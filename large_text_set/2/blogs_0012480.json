[], "text": "SLNIPNDILNYDVYNSSNNR Protein–protein interaction analysis of Pfs38 with other merozoite surface proteins The direct interactions among the proteins of Pfs38 complex was examined by a number of biochemical tools. Far western analysis that detects the interaction between a membrane-bound prey protein and soluble bait proteins [ 36 ] was performed. Recombinant Pfs38 served as a prey protein while GLURP (R0, R1, R2), Pfs41, Pfs12, PfMSP-1 65 , PfMSP-1 19 proteins and PfMLH protein [ 39 ] served as a bait in the two hybrid interaction analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 a, Pfs38 interacted with the GLURPR2, SERA5, PfMSP-1 65 , Pfs12, and Pfs41 proteins, while no significant interaction was seen between Pfs38 and PfMSP-1 19 or PfMLH proteins. Interactions among the proteins of Pfs38 complex were further confirmed by an ELISA-based binding assays in which recombinant Pfs38 was allowed to interact with different regions of GLURP (R0, R1, and R2), PfMSP-1 65 , PfMSP-1 19 , Pfs41, Pfs12, SERA5, and PfMLH. As shown in Fig. 2 b, all protein–protein interactions seen in far western analysis were observed in the ELISA-based binding assay. Interestingly, no interaction was observed between Pfs38 and PfMSP-1 19 , suggesting that Pfs38 binds to a MSP-1 region upstream of the 19 kDa C-terminal region (Fig. 2 b). A surface plasmon resonance analysis was next performed to assess the physical properties of the interaction between Pfs38 and GLURPR2. Recombinant GLURPR2 was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip and increasing concentrations of recombinant Pfs38 were injected over the chip. Pfs38 bound to GLURPR2 in a dose-dependent manner with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K d ) of 2.6 × 10 −8 M (Fig. 2 c). Together, these results confirmed the association between Pfs38 and other merozoite surface proteins. Fig. 2 Existence of a Pfs38 protein complex at Plasmodium asexual blood stages.

B ELISA binding analysis confirming the interactions of Pfs38 with Pfs12 ( a ), Pfs41 ( a ), GLURPR2 ( b ), PfMSP-1 65 ( c ), and SERA5 ( d ) proteins, while Plasmodium PfMLH and PfMSP-1 19 did not show binding to Pfs38. Error bars represent mean ± SEM of duplicate measurements. C SPR analysis showing an interaction between Pfs38 and GLURPR2 Co-localization and co-sedimentation analysis confirm an association of Pfs38 with other 6-cys proteins, SERA5 and PfMSP-1 65 on the merozoite surface To know the localization of proteins of Pfs38 complex on the surface of P. falciparum merozoites, co-localization studies for these proteins were performed on intact merozoites by immunofluorescence staining using their specific antibodies. Pfs38 partially co-localized with GLURP, Pfs41, Pfs12, and MSP-1, advocating the co-existence of proteins of 6-Cys protein complex on the merozoite surface (Fig. 3 a–d). These results were corroborated by co-sedimentation analysis of parasite-derived polypeptides. Western blotting and LC–MS/MS analysis of the glycerol gradient fractions revealed the presence of Pfs38, Pfs41, Pfs12, GLURP, MSP-1, and SERA5 in a single fraction, suggesting that these proteins exist in a complex on the parasite (see Additional files 10 , 11 ). Fig. 3 Expression and co-localization of proteins of Pfs38 complex on Plasmodium merozoites. Co-localization studies were performed by immunofluorescence assays. Merozoites were labelled with ( a ) mouse anti-Pfs38 and rabbit anti-GLURP or with ( b ) mouse anti-Pfs38 and rabbit anti-Pfs41 antibodies or with ( c ) mouse anti-Pfs38 and rabbit anti-Pfs12 antibodies or with ( d ) mouse anti-Pfs38 and rabbit anti-PfsMSP1 65 antibodies. Partial co-localization was observed between Pfs38 and other proteins of 6-Cys complex with co-localization coefficient of 0.75, 0.61, 0.82, and 0.83 for a – d , respectively. Td represent bright field images Pfs38 binds to human erythrocytes The putative role of the Pfs38 complex in the invasion of P. falciparum merozoite into host RBC was also investigated. In vitro erythrocyte binding assays were performed with three recombinant 6-Cys proteins using intact human RBCs as described earlier [ 37 ]. Plasmodium vivax erythrocyte binding antigen region 2 (PvRII) [ 40 ] and ClpQ [ 41 ] were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Pfs38 efficiently bound to human erythrocytes and the binding was found to be neuraminidase resistant. In contrast, neither Pfs12 or Pfs41 showed appreciable binding to human erythrocytes (Fig. 4 a, b). No erythrocyte binding activity has been reported for GLURP and SERA5 so far. An earlier study using a cross-linking assay with synthetic peptides derived from Pfs38, Pfs41 and Pfs12 and RBC membrane proteins indicated that these proteins might be binding to members of glycophorin family present on the RBC membrane [ 42 ]. Although the binding of Pfs38 to human RBC was neuraminidase resistant, an ELISA-based interaction was still carried out between Pfs38 and glycophorin A protein. Fig. 4 Pfs38 binds human erythrocytes via Glycophorin A and is required for invasion of red blood cells. a Recombinant Pfs38, Pfs12 and Pfs41 were incubated with uninfected human erythrocytes and bound proteins were eluted from the erythrocytes after centrifugation through oil. PvRII was used as a positive control for erythrocyte binding assay, while an internal protein ClpQ was used as a negative control for the assay; b Erythrocyte binding assay of recombinant Pfs38 with untreated (UN) and neuraminidase treated (NM) RBCs. c Glycophorin A is the erythrocyte receptor through which Pfs38 binds human erythrocytes. ELISA binding assay was performed to study the interaction between Glycophorin A and recombinant Pfs38. As a control, GLURPR2 and PfMLH protein were used. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM of duplicate measurements; d A model of Pfs38 protein complex based on protein–protein interactions and protein-erythrocyte interaction; e Invasion inhibition assay was performed on schizont stage using α-Pfs38 purified IgG at concentration of 2, 5 and 10 mg/mL and percent inhibition was calculated. Bars indicate mean ± SEM of duplicate measurements Recombinant Pfs38 showed a dose-dependent interaction with glycophorin A (Fig. 4 c), while GLURP R2 from the same complex and PfMLH (non-specific protein) did not show interaction to glycophorin A. These results are in line with a recent finding where MSP-1 amino terminus region (Msp-1 83 ) was found to bind with glycophorin A of human RBC even in the presence of neuraminidase treatment [ 43 ]. Furthermore anti-Pfs38 antibodies could inhibit the interaction between Pfs38 and glycophorin A by up to 70% at 2 mg/mL (see Additional file 12 ). Together, these results show that Pfs38 protein of the Pfs38 protein complex binds to human erythrocyte via glycophorin A. Based on the results of interactions studies among the proteins of Pfs38 protein complex and interaction of Pfs38 with RBC surface, a model is proposed for the organization of Pfs38 protein complex (Fig. 4 d) showing that Pfs12 and Pfs38 proteins are anchored to merozoite membrane by GPI domains and Pfs41 interacts with these proteins to stabilize them. Pfs38 binds RBC surface via glycophorin A, while PfMSP-1 65 , GLURP and SERA5 bind to the axis generated by Pfs41, Pfs12 and Pfs38. Invasion inhibition assay (GIA) The inhibitory potential of anti-Pfs38 antibodies on the invasion of Plasmodium merozoites into RBCs were evaluated. An invasion inhibition assay was performed on P. falciparum 3D7 using the purified anti-Pfs38 IgG at different concentrations. IgG purified from pre-immune sera served as a negative control. Anti-Pfs38 IgG showed an inhibition of approximately 30–40% at a concentration of 10 mg/mL (Fig. 4 e). Humoral immune responses to the proteins associated with Pfs38 protein complex The immunogenicity of the members of Pfs38 complex were evaluated during natural infections using plasma from Africa and India by ELISA. MSP-1 65 , GLURPR2, Pfs38, Pfs12, Pfs41, and SERA5 proteins were frequently recognized by sera from Liberia in Africa with seropositivity rates of 100, 96, 89, 89, 96, and 89%, respectively (see Fig. 5 ; Additional file 13 ). Interestingly, these antigens were also recognized by sera from India with seropositivity rates of 80, 60, 60, 42, 40, and 46%, respectively (see Fig. 5 ; Additional file 13 ). The lower seropositivity rates observed among Indian samples may be related to a lower transmission intensity in this area compared with that of Liberia. The seropositivity of three refolded 6-cys proteins, i.e. Pfs38, Pfs12 and Pfs41 as well as PfMsp-1 65 , were significantly reduced when these proteins were denatured with 8 M urea, thereby confirming their proper folding (see Additional file 14 ). Fig. 5 Naturally-acquired humoral IgG immune responses to proteins of Pfs38 complex. Human IgG antibodies against proteins of 6-Cys complex were detected by ELISA in sera from naturally infected patients from Liberia and India. Sera from Denmark were used as a negative control. The dotted line indicates positivity thresholds determined from the mean reactivities +2 SD of 28 sera samples from Danish non-immune volunteers. African and Indian sera with OD above the positive thresholds are considered seropositive for each of the antigen. Bars represent mean ± SEM for 28 sera samples Irrespective of the differential reactivity, the relative high seroprevalence rates in both areas indicate that the 6-Cys proteins: Pfs38, Pfs12, Pfs41, and MSP-1 as well as SERA proteins used in the present study, are good immunogen and these proteins have adopted their natural folds. Taken together, these results indicate that proteins of the Pfs38 complex are expressed during the natural infection in geographical distinct parasite populations. Discussion An effective blood-stage vaccine to prevent the prevalence of malaria or ameliorate the severity of disease is still a distant prospect because of major gaps in the knowledge of Plasmodium biology, especially in the understanding of molecular architecture of merozoite surface as well as the critical events involved in the invasion of RBCs. Among the many antigens that coat merozoite surface, 6-Cys proteins are of significant interest as they are expressed at multiple stages of P. falciparum life cycle and have a characteristic arrangement of cysteine residues [ 18 , 29 , 44 – 46 ]. Although 6-Cys domain proteins were identified more than 20 years ago, their functions at asexual blood stages are yet to be defined. To get insights into the role of three 6-Cys proteins: Pfs41, Pfs38 and Pfs12, at asexual blood stages, particularly in the invasion process, these proteins were expressed and purified in E. coli expression systems and specific antibodies to these proteins were raised. These antibodies were specific as they recognized specific bands in asexual blood stages of P. falciparum lysates and stained the merozoite surface. It has been shown that Pfs12 and Pfs41 exist as heterodimer on the P. falciparum merozoite surface [ 20 ]. To know whether these proteins are part of a large network, the P. falciparum schizont stage parasite lysate was immunoprecipitated using either anti-Pfs38 or anti-Pfs41 or anti-Pfs12 antibody and the immunoprecipitated samples were analysed by LC–MS/MS. A similar approach has been adopted by us and others to identify protein complexes in Plasmodium and other organisms [ 47 ]. These analyses provided evidence for the association of three 6-cys proteins (Pfs38, Pfs12 and Pfs41) with other merozoite surface proteins: GLURP, PfMSP-1 and SERA-5 on the merozoite surface. Careful analysis of the peptides generated in MS/MS analysis showed that a region upstream of the PfMSP-1 19 is associated with the complex. Overall, these results suggested the existence of a large Pfs38 protein complex comprising of GLURP, SERA5, PfMSP-1, Pfs41, and Pfs12 proteins. In vitro protein–protein interaction tools, such as ELISA based binding assays and Far western blot analysis between the six proteins of Pfs38 protein complex and co-localization studies, provided additional evidence for the existence of such a complex. The interaction between Pfs38 and GLURPR2 was further quantified by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis in the present study. Although a couple of previous studies have shown an interaction between Pfs12/Pvs12 and Pfs41/Pvs41 [ 20 , 40 ], other interactions between the components of Pfs38 complex have never been reported. Among the merozoite proteins identified in Pfs38 complex, Pfs12 and Pfs38 anchors to the merozoite membrane via GPI motif similar to several other merozoite surface proteins, while Pfs41, SERA5 and GLURP lack GPI-anchoring motifs and they interact with Pfs12 and Pfs38 via non-covalent interactions [ 16 ]. Although MSP-1 has a GPI anchoring motif, nonetheless this protein undergoes processing and region(s) of MSP-1 that interacts with this complex are distant from PfMSP-1 19 , a region anchored to the merozoite membrane [ 48 ]. Gene knock-out studies have shown that neither Pfs12 nor Pfs41 are essential for the malaria parasite growth or invasion and antibodies to these antigens do not significantly block erythrocyte invasion in vitro [ 20 ]. These proteins also did not show binding to human erythrocyte in an in vitro assay [ 20 ]. As the structural and biochemical characteristics of 6-Cys proteins predict their role(s) in the process of recognition and adhesion of host cells [ 26 , 29 ], the possibility of Pfs38, Pfs41 and Pfs12 interaction with human RBCs was explored. As shown previously, Pfs41 and Pfs12 did not show binding to human erythrocytes, however, Pfs38 bound to RBCs via glycophorin A and anti-Pfs38 antibodies showed a moderate invasion (~40%) inhibition activity. These results are in line with a previous study where anti-Pfs38 antibody generated against a plant-produced recombinant Pfs38 showed inhibition of ≥60% [ 49 ]. Although a moderate level of invasion inhibition was observed with anti-Pfs38 antibody, it is possible that for greater protection antibodies to other components of the complex may also be required. This is evident in an earlier report that showed better protection against a Plasmodium yoelii challenge in mice immunized with PfAMA-1-RON2 complex in comparison to the mice immunized with each antigen alone [ 50 ]. Together these studies advocate the development of a sub-unit malaria vaccine based on the candidates that are present in complexes with one or more binding partners instead of the individual component. To explore whether the recombinant proteins used in interaction analysis were properly folded with intact conformational epitopes and are targets for naturally acquired humoral immunity, these six antigens of Pfs38 protein complex were screened against plasma from 28 Liberian and 28 P. falciparum -infected Indian patients. All the six antigens: Pfs38, Pfs12, Pfs41, PfMSP-1 65 , GLURPR2, and SERA5 showed at least a two-fold change in IgG reactivity between the naïve sera and P. falciparum -exposed plasma in two geographically distinct populations. However, antibody responses among six antigens varied. GLURP R2 and PfMSP-1 65 showed significantly high antibodies than members of the 6-Cys family. Similar high responses have been observed against GLURPR2 in a number of previous studies [ 33 , 51 , 52 ]. Differences in the humoral responses against these antigens between the Liberian and Indian sera were observed. The difference in the reactivity observed between Indian and Liberian sera may be because Liberia is a malaria-endemic region, while Indian isolates were from non-endemic areas. Interestingly denaturing four of these antigens by urea treatment significantly reduced their reactivity with Liberian sera thereby further confirming the folding of recombinant proteins used in the present study. Conclusions In summary, the existence of a large Pfs38 complex on P. falciparum merozoites consisting of three 6-Cys family members: Pfs38, Pfs41 and Pfs12 that associate with GLURP, PfMSP-1 65 and SERA5 was revealed. Pfs38 protein of this large Pfs38 complex binds to RBC via glycophorin A. Two proteins of this complex: GLURP and PfMSP-1 65 showed high seroreactivity to sera from P. falciparum -infected patients with a seroprevalence of >90% from two geographically distinct populations. Although broader epidemiological investigations and in vivo challenge studies are required, the results of the present study point towards developing malaria sub-unit vaccines based on merozoite surface protein complexes.
