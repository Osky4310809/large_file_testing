He told police following his arrest early Feb. 22 that he knew it was a mannequin he was attacking. \nSchindler’s court-appointed lawyer declined to comment. \nPolice say surveillance video shows Schindler creep up and hit the mannequin in the head, using two-handed swings of the 4-pound hammer. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
