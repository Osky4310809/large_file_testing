By Igor Bobic \nMembers of President Donald Trump ’s administration attempted to pre-emptively discredit the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office over the weekend ― just before it’s expected to issue an official projection of how the Republican health care bill would affect the federal budget and insurance coverage. \nOn Sunday, the White House chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, argued that CBO projections have been “ meaningless ” in the past because they said “many more people will be insured than are actually insured.” Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, even made the case that scoring big legislation like the GOP’s Obamacare repeal bill “ isn’t the best use of [the CBO’s] time .” \nBut for the last several years, Trump himself has appeared to be a big fan of the CBO and its analysis. In fact, he frequently cited the office’s work in attacks against former President Barack Obama’s record on health care, jobs, the unemployment rate and the economy. \nHere’s a sampling of some of Trump’s tweets citing CBO figures to criticize Obama: The stimulus \"is a net negative effect on the growth of GDP over 10 years\" --as admitted by @BarackObama 's own CBO http://t.co/otaKcGOV — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 17, 2011 The CBO has confirmed that @BarackObama 's stimulus \"crowds out\" private investment while not creating any jobs. http://t.co/nMSky9jb — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2011 The CBO has predicted that unemployment will rise to 8.8% this next year. http://t.co/AsMhkOre This is @BarackObama 's economic recovery. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2012 Disaster! The @BarackObama tax hikes set for 2013 are going \"to throw us back into a recession\" according to the CBO http://t.co/DnIZD13r — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2012 Scary--the CBO esimated that US publicly held debt amounts to over 70%. China is buying our country up. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2012 Terrible CBO forecast for 2013--1.4% GDP growth and 7.5%+ unemployment (really 17%+) http://t.co/B9Q7UowK You get what you vote for! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2013 As I predicted, Obama already caught lying on Ocare enrollment # by CBO who’s sticking w/ “6 million enrollments” http://t.co/LoVuJhXWEB — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 24, 2014 Waste! The CBO now estimates that @BarackObama 's stimulus cost $831B and a ridicuous $4.1M per job created http://t.co/acb1EiXg — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2012 CBO estimates over 2.3M jobs will be lost due to ObamaCare http://t.co/CHG5fhA2Q5 Elections have consequences. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2014 Congrats to Pres.Obama and Dems. CBO has TRIPLED its estimate of working hours lost due to ObamaCare http://t.co/CHG5fhA2Q5 Job Killer — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2014 CBO now estimates that over 2.5M will lose jobs directly because of ObamaCare. REPEAL now before it is too late. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2014 Congrats to Obama & Democrats. CBO has just announced that ObamaCare missed its uninsured target by half & program costs extra $700B+. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 17, 2014 \nBased on his advisers’ recent comments, Trump appears to be having a change of heart with respect to the CBO now that he’s president. Republicans are bracing for a report that will show millions of Americans losing health coverage under the plan that GOP leaders, and Trump himself, are championing as a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. \nTrump’s opinion about government-issued statistics has been known to vary, seemingly depending on whether they favor him or not. After years of doubting official Bureau of Labor Statistics reports on the nation’s unemployment rate, Trump and his advisers cheered a strong jobs report on Friday ― the first complete report under his administration ― showing the nation added 235,000 jobs in February. \n“[The jobs reports] may have been phony in the past, but it’s very real now,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Friday.
