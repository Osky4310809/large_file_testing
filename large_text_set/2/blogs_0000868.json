Bush went to the hospital, suffering from pneumonia on January 14. \nHis wife Barbara was also taken to the hospital as a precaution. She was suffering from bronchitis. \nShe was given the go ahead to be released, but stayed longer to be with her husband of 72 years. \nTheirs has been the longest Presidential marriage in history. \nGeorge H.W. Bush was soon making great strides in recovery and it wasn’t just the love of his wife helping him. \nHe had a goal helping him: the desire to go to the Super Bowl in his hometown in Houston on February 5. \nThe NFL heard that about his goal, so they planned something special for him. \nAccording to the Washington Examiner, the NFL invited Bush to perform the opening coin toss at the Super Bowl on Sunday, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed Wednesday. \nBush’s spokesman said Bush was very honored by the invite. Pres/Mrs @GeorgeHWBush are honored by @NFL Commissioner Goddell's kind invite to flip the coin b4 #SuperBowl , and are looking forward to it. \n— Jim McGrath (@jgm41) February 1, 2017 \nBush himself even weighed in today. Getting fired up for Sunday and #SuperBowl . pic.twitter.com/zlXmsZJrTM \n— George Bush (@GeorgeHWBush) February 1, 2017 \nVery nice gesture from the NFL. \nCertainly enough to help anyone’s recovery!
