However, do you really know the differences between a a good leader and a boss? And what exactly should we do if we want to be a charming and lovable leader?\nA charismatic leader motivates and boost the team members’ morale and confidence. A charismatic leader also ensures growth in every team member. These are what a boss would never do.\nThe differences between a truly good leader and a demanding boss: Great leaders find people’s potentials; bosses only see faults in team members.\n\nGreat leaders always encourage the team; bosses blame team members.\n\nGreat leaders inspire the team to grow; bosses don’t care about individuals’ personal growth.\n\nGreat leaders know how to utilize team members’ talents; bosses see team members as tools only and exploit them.\n\nGreat leaders accept feedback and talk with members openly; bosses don’t value members’ opinions and transparency.\n\nGreat leaders know how to delegate; bosses only micromanage the team members.\n\nGreat leaders are open to innovative ideas; bosses hate changes.\n\nGreat leaders appreciate the effort the team makes; bosses take the team’s effort for granted.\n\nAll the successful leaders have their own charismatic leading style. Almost everyone knows Steve Jobs, but only a few know about how he leads a team. Steve Jobs is a visionary leader. He has a vision in developing Apple products to change the world. With his strong conviction, he made his entire team believed in what he pictured in mind – to change the world with innovative ideas.

Dalai Lama is an affiliative leader with love and support. This charisma of kindness is what enables him to successfully lead a lot of believers who also believe in kindness to stand against the pressures of many others. [1] \nWhat type of leader are you?
