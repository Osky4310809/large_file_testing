But huge improvements have been made in the last couple of years thanks to donations by individuals and brands.’\nIf you personally want to campaign, The Homeless Period advise: \n‘You can also get involved with a number of crowdfunds or fundraisers happening around the world, which we list on The Homeless Period twitter page .\n‘But if you want to go further, you can also set up your own fundraising project. You can use The Homeless Period name, slogan, logo and any other photos you find on our campaign site .’\nBuy \nSanitary pad company Bodyform has just announced a three-year plan to help alleviate period poverty .\nThe firm has pledged to donate 200,000 packs of sanitary products by 2020, for girls and women who usually can’t access towels or tampons.\nMusic with one in three notes missing gives powerful message about cancer Nicola Coronado, SCA’s Marketing Director for Bodyform, announced the plan following the awful news that girls were skipping school during their time of the month.\nCoronado said: ‘As a manufacturer of these essential products, we feel incredibly moved by this and we see this commitment as the first step in helping to combat these issues. Alongside campaigns such as The Homeless Period, we can overcome the taboo of talking about menstruation while ensuring sanitary products are reaching those most in need.\n‘Until we know the full extent of this issue in the UK, we would urge other manufacturers to look at how they can further support this cause so that we can keep increasing access to these fundamental products.’\nBodyform will be sending the free sanitary towels to In Kind Direct, who will distribute them to various charitable organisations around the UK.\nTell companies what you think Think it’s a great idea that Bodyform are helping out? Great, then buy their products as a thank you.\nReckon companies like Tampax, Always Lil-let etc should do the same? Tweet or email them and let them know it’s an issue that’s important to their customers.\nYou can reach them on Twitter here: \n@Always \n@Lil_lets \n@Tampax \nTalk \n\nHalf of the world’s population will or have had a period during their lifetimes – why are they still taboo?\nFor some reason, you won’t see a single drop of blood in adverts for sanitary products.\nWhen really, something like this would be more appropriate: \n\nIt’s a monthly occurrence for women and girls that isn’t going to disappear anytime soon, the survival of the human race sort of depends on it, you see.\nThere are small and subtle steps you can take to start normalising periods: \nTalk about it on the internet, or even post pictures , if you like.\nIf you’ve got cramps or feel unwell due to your period, don’t tell people it’s caused by some mystery illness that seems to pop up just as regularly as Aunt Flo.\nBaggage ban on laptops and tablets to be implemented by Saturday When you need to change your tampon or sanitary towel, don’t shove it up your sleeve out of sight like you’re carrying a dirty secret .\nWant to have sex on your period? Go for it, there are plenty of good reasons why you should.\nWant to go swimming? Fine, get your cossie on .\nOverhear somebody peddling ridiculous myths about what you can and can’t do on your period?\nCall them out.\nOr better still, serve them up some truthbombs about periods .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:42:41.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
