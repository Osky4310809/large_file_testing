With this big start, Disney is now projecting a $160 million weekend for their live-action remake. \nThis means that “Beauty and the Beast” now has the potential to pass “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” for the all-time biggest opening in March. Its opening on Friday has already passed the $58 million made “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” to set a new record for the highest single-day total ever made by a PG-rated film. \n“Beauty and the Beast” will also blow by the opening weekend totals scored by its predecessors in Disney’s remake series. “Cinderella,” which also got a March release in 2015, made $67 million in its opening. Last year’s “The Jungle Book,” which got a summer release, made $103 million en route to a $966.5 million worldwide total. That puts “Beauty and the Beast” well on pace to reach the $1 billion mark during its theatrical run.

It was produced for $160 million.

The $185 million film will be released in China next week. \nFox’s “Logan” came in third with $4.6 million in its third Friday, bringing its domestic cume to $184 million. Universal’s “Get Out” is in fourth with $3.8 million, and Lionsgate’s “The Shack” rounds out the top five with $1.6 million.

BH Tilt now projects the film to make $3.6 million, just below the $4 million expected by both studio and independent projections. \nThe horror film, which is directed by Greg McLean and written/produced by James Gunn, depicts a sadistic experiment in which an office of 80 desk job workers is locked in their building and forced to kill each other. Peter Safran (“The Conjuring”) produced with Gunn. It received mixed reviews from critics, scoring 49 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. \nRead original story ‘Beauty and the Beast’ on Track for Beastly $160 Million Opening At TheWrap  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:21:37.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
