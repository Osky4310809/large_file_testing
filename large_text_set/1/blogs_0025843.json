It’s billed as more of a suite of movements than a collection of songs, and that feels true enough on new single “Break Me Open.” We’re dropped into the album’s storyline about a failing marriage, with spare yet energetic guitar balladry bolstered by a string section as Kasher sings, “I’ve got my crosses to bear/ I’ll be your husband, I’ll be your father, I’ll be your friend.” Check it out below. \n<a href=\"http://15passenger.bandcamp.com/album/no-resolution\">No Resolution by Tim Kasher</a> \nNo Resolution is out 3/3 via Kasher’s new label 15 Passenger .
