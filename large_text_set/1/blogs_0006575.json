I apologise that my nerves got the better of me.” \nMany of Hiddleston’s fans seemed shocked that the star had even felt the need to aplogise, with one person commenting: “Inelegantly? From you? Are you kidding? Tom Hiddleston, you came across as the intelligent, articulate and compassionate darling that you are. Please pay no mind to anyone who cannot recognise that. You stand far above the others. Congratulations!” . @twhiddleston wins Best Performance by an Actor in a Limited Series or a Motion Picture Made For Television!

It’s a terrible situation for children there. The Night Manager is about arms dealing, and there are far too many arms coming into South Sudan.
