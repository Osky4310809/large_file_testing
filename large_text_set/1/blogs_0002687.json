Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA dad-of-two is “praying for a miracle” after being given just months to live with terminal cancer which he was originally thought was a cold . \nPhil Cox has spent the last 16 months battling aggressive tumours which are rapidly growing throughout his body. \nTo add to his ordeal, he recently received the devastating diagnosis of Leptomeningeal Disease, Gazette Live reports. \nThe condition is an incurable complication of cancer which spreads to the brain and spinal cord. Phil in hospital (Photo: handout unknown) \nThe 36-year-old, who lives in Billingham with his wife Kerri, 41, their son Joe, four, and Phil’s step-daughter Keira, 10, has been told he could have less than a year - or as little as a few months - left to live. \nBut determined to stay positive, Phil and Kerri, who met six-and-a-half years ago, are desperately trying to find ways to prolong Phil’s life and have shared his story on social media in a bid to find help. \n“We have got to be realistic; we are praying for a miracle,” Kerri said. \n“We know how it is going to end, but we are willing to do whatever it takes for us to give Phil more time.” Phil with wife Kerri (Photo: handout unknown) \nKerri told how Phil’s story went viral in just a few hours, with people from around the world contacting them with ideas and advice. \n“We have been completely overwhelmed by the response we have had,” Kerri said. \n“We’ve had messages from people as far as Australia, America and Germany, telling us about possible treatments and trials available.

Phil just hopes the appeal will reach someone who may just have the answer we are looking for.” \nKerri described how her husband went ‘back and forth’ to the doctor after he became unwell in September 2015. Phil Cox (Photo: handout unknown) \nHe initially thought he was suffering from a bad bout of flu and so took a couple of weeks off from his plumbing and heating business. \nKerri said: “He just seemed to get worse so I went to the doctors with him. They took some more bloods and when they listened to his chest it was rattling so they sent us straight to A&E.” \nTests revealed Phil, originally from Middlesbrough and went to King’s Manor School, had secondary lung cancer - before doctors discovered the primary cancer as testicular. \nHe spent months undergoing chemotherapy until he received more heartbreaking news that tumours had spread to his brain in May last year. \n“It has been a complete and utter whirlwind,” Kerri said. \n“No one likes to hear the word cancer but at first we were hopeful. We kept hearing that if there was the best type of cancer to get it was testicular, so that kept us positive.

If we can find a doctor somewhere, anywhere, who might be onto something in the way of treatment to prolong Phil’s life we will search for them. We have nothing to lose at the moment.” Phil on his wedding day (Photo: handout unknown) \nKerri told how the pair had planned their dream wedding for April this year, but after Phil’s condition began to deteriorate, they moved it forward and tied the knot at Preston Park in October last year. \n“We had to move pretty quickly to get it all booked but we had a fantastic time. I had always dreamed of a 1920s themed wedding so that’s what we did. I made all the headpieces and bouquets which I was really pleased with. \n“And it gave us something to look forward to. I just hope we can continue to look to the future and spend as much time as we can together as a family.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:20:33.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
