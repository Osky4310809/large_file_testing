The KPG Hospitality bar is taking over Benji’s Cantina former space (the restaurant shuttered last summer ). The relocation means the bar and arcade will get a new kitchen, which means food. Blake Keely, Benji’s former executive chef and Kung Fu’s current corporate chef , will oversee the kitchen. He is in the middle of a menu revamp, which includes new bar dishes and brunch with dishes like Cap’n Crunch fried pickles. KPG is eager to join the crowd on West 6th Street, because of anticipated spots like Whiskey Tango Foxtrot and fancy bowling alley The Goodnight, as well as the address’ “favorable lease structure” and additional space, according to owning partner Troy Cramer. The old Kung Fu will shutter sometime in the spring, and quickly reopen in its new home shortly after that. Above the West 6th Street address is rooftop bar Green Light Social. KPG Hospitality also runs West 6th Street’s Brew Exchange. The company is holding onto the original Kung Fu space, but there is no word on what will be done with it yet. There are Kung Fu Saloons in Rock Rose , Houston, Dallas, and Nashville . The Rio Grande location originally opened in 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:13:30.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
