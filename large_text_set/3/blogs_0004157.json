The more bones you have, the better it tastes. That’s why restaurant soup tastes better—it’s got a bigger variety of bones, marrow, and meat.” RECIPE: Pho Bo: Beef Noodle Soup \n\nThere you have it—all it takes to make the best pho of your life. It all comes down to tons of bones, some marrow, and a little bit of patience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:59:45.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
