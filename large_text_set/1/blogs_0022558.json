We’ve had five wildland fires caused by pot grows,” McManus said.\nThe group has gathered more than 5,000 signatures in what’s believed to be the first voter-initiated ordinance to ban all pot growing. It would kill the county’s pot friendly regulations and even calls for shutting down the dispensaries.\nSmiley, a Calaveras County resident told KPIX 5, “It’s just going to go underground again.”\nHe said, “They’re going to still want it cause it actually works and it’s cheaper and more effective than what the doctor gives them.”\nCalifornia’s passage of Prop. 64 allows individuals to grow up to six plants for personal use, but pot proponents in Calaveras County say a complete ban would only deprive tax payers of the benefits of more than $300 million in taxable crop in an already cash strapped county.\nThe Calaveras County board of supervisors will meet and could decide at that meeting to ban cannabis cultivation altogether or they could let the voters decide in the spring.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:15:10.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
