(Mike TheilerMIKE THEILER/AFP photo/Getty Images) \nThere she goes again. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has sparked a new controversy, this time making comments about historically black colleges and universities that betrayed ignorance of the history of HCBUs and racial segregation in the United States. \nDeVos, who has been education secretary for only three weeks, issued a statement Monday evening after meeting HBCU leaders which said this about historically black colleges and universities: \nThey started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education. They saw that the system wasn’t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. [ DeVos called HBCUs ‘pioneers’ of ‘school choice.’ It didn’t go over well. ] \nDeVos has been focused on promoting school choice — vouchers, charter schools, private schools and other alternatives to the traditional public education system for decades, but this was a step apart from other statements she has made in support of “choice.” This time she touted HCBUs as choice “pioneers” rather than a reaction to institutionalized racism that prevented blacks from attending white schools. \nThough she made a speech on Tuesday — noting that “the traditional school system systemically failed to provide African Americans access to a quality education — or, sadly, more often to any education at all” — she didn’t really clean up the mess, and she wound up adding ammunition to critics who say DeVos does not understand fundamental aspects of public education and its history. \nDuring her Jan. 17 confirmation hearing before the Senate education committee, she could not discuss a key federal law protecting students with disabilities — and in fact didn’t seem to know it was a federal law — and could not discuss how student progress on standardized tests is measured. She was confirmed by the Senate only after Mike Pence became the first vice president in American history to break a tie for a Cabinet nominee. \nShe recently drew the wrath of teachers at a D.C. public school that she had visited, saying that they seemed to be in a “receive mode,” waiting to be told what to do. \nThe HCBU comments by DeVos — presumably written by someone at the Education Department — adds to criticism that the Trump administration has no real connection to African Americans and their history. [ So far, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is just what her critics feared ] \nOn Feb. 12, someone at the Education Department posted a tweet that misspelled the name of W.E.B. Du Bois, a black sociologist, historian, civil rights activist and co-founder of the NAACP, the oldest civil rights organization in the United States. That followed comments by President Trump in which he seemed to think that black abolitionist Frederick Douglass — who died in 1895 — were still alive: \n“Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice.” [ Six astonishing things Betsy DeVos said — and refused to say — at her confirmation hearing ] \nNot surprisingly, DeVos’s comments about HBCUs sparked strong reaction on Twitter from academics and others. Among the most critical comments came from U.S. Democratic senators, including Patty Murray of Washington, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Christopher Murphy of Connecticut, and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. . @BetsyDeVosED ‘s backwards, confused comments on history of #HBCUs only makes it clearer how unqualified she is to serve all our students. \n— Senator Patty Murray (@PattyMurray) February 28, 2017 \n— \nSecy Betsy DeVos appears ignorant of racial segregation in US. #HBCUs are byproduct of racism during Jim Crow era. pic.twitter.com/XV4VS9UVye — Kristen Clarke (@KristenClarkeJD) February 28, 2017 \n— \nTotally nuts. DeVos pretending that establishment of historically black colleges was about choice not racism. https://t.co/gROpItxRx4 — Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) February 28, 2017 \n— \nNo, Sec. DeVos- the segregation and inequality that forced the establishment of HBCUs is not a model of “school choice.” https://t.co/CIotGpKzBH — Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) February 28, 2017 \n— Read the whole statement. It is BANANAS. Says the solution to school segregation was to build more black only schools. I’m not kidding. https://t.co/MOZ8RyUUfe \n— Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 28, 2017 \nAnd here are some other comments: — \nThey. Had. No. Choice. https://t.co/7Jk7RYVMQe — Ron Fournier (@ron_fournier) February 28, 2017 \n— HBCU’s are incredible-but @BetsyDeVosEd saying they are “pioneers of school choice” shows NO historical knowledge https://t.co/AbPN4muSSl \n— Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) February 28, 2017 \n— \n#BetsyDeVos needs to go back to school. #PublicSchool . https://t.co/0K8lhox7sa — Glenda Good (@GWGlenda123) March 1, 2017 \n— #BetsyDeVos hit a new low today. Can she please clarify what she meant by her comment on #HBCUs ? Because she really messed up! \n— Nikhil Jain (@J_N1k) March 1, 2017 \n— \nDear #BetsyDeVos , Saying that black universities were “school choice” is like saying that black restrooms were “bathroom choice.” pic.twitter.com/XKn1TZ7OeA — Nicholas A.
