On restructuring we stand. Igbo presidency without restructuring will make little or no difference neither would the various ethnic agitations cease. \n“Defection of some Igbo personalities to the All Progressive Congress, APC, is of no relevance to Ohaneze. One can defect to Heaven or hell but Ndigbo will not identify with any political party that is not in marriage with restructuring. \n“Governor Okorocha can speak for Imo APC or the government of Imo State, but he is not in a good stead to speak for Ndigbo. \n“On the rumoured death of the President, God forbid that we should wish anybody death because death is like an identity card which we all have with its attendant expiry date. \n“However, if you occupy a public position maintained with tax payers money (including but not limited to medical trips) it behooves that you should account to them in all ramifications. The presidential Aids who are keeping mum on the President’s health condition are severely owing Nigerians that obligation. \n“It smells to high heavens that even the Minister of Information (who is also paid with tax payers money) cannot inform Nigerians on the issue. Instead, he prefers to tell us about the stale news of ‘information about Book Haram. \n“The issue affecting Apostle Suleiman suggests that the truth is hidden. We read in the tabloids that Northern Governors said the rampaging herdsmen are foreigners, non of the security agencies refuted or questioned the Governors. \n“Now does it mean that we should allow foreigners to come and be killing Nigerians? We demand an explanation even as we condemn violence and inciting words or actions”. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:08:38.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
