Without climate change costs, the region will need $22.6 trillion for the given period, an investment of $1.5 trillion per year. \nADB’s new flagship report focuses on the region’s infrastructure needs for power, transport, telecommunications, and water sanitation. Considered in the compilation of the report are the region’s current infrastructure stocks and investments, future investment needs and financing mechanisms. \nOut of the total climate-adjusted investment needs from 2016 to 2030, $14.7 trillion is seen to be needed for power while $8.4 trillion is required for transport. Investments needed in telecommunications are seen to reach $2.3 trillion while needs for water and sanitation infrastructure are placed at $800 billion. \n“The demand for infrastructure across Asia and the Pacific far outstrips current supply,” said ADB president Takehiko Nakao. “Asia needs new and upgraded infrastructure that will set the standard for quality, encourage economic growth, and respond to the pressing global challenge that is climate change.” \nADB said infrastructure development in developing Asia has “grown dramatically” in recent decades but a “substantial” infrastructure gap remains. Around 400 million people still lack access to electricity, 300 million lack access to safe drinking water and about 1.5 billion lack access to basic sanitation. \nMany economies in the region also lack adequate ports, railways, and roads that could connect them efficiently to larger domestic and global markets, said the report. \nDeveloping Asia currently invests an estimated $881 billion in infrastructure. The investment gap—the difference between investment needs and current investment levels—is around 2.4 percent of the projected gross domestic product of the region for 2016 to 2020, according to the report.
