This time, they’ve been taken at a closer distance, making it easier to pick up (hah!) the finer details of the prototypes ahead of the late 2017 on-sale date. \nFrom the front, we can spot LED projector headlights, looking larger than on the concept shown last year. These flank a massive grille which sports twin bars and will carry the dinner plate-sized three-pointed star front and centre. The front bumper also appears deeper than the Nissan NP300 Navara on which it’s based. \nAlong the sides, the surfacing is simpler with a continuous shoulder line running front to back, instead of the Navara’s haunches over the front and rear wheel arches. Speaking of which, the arches on the Mercedes are squared-off instead of round. The rear ditches the concept’s ring-like tail lights for more conventional items; there’s also a simple bumper bar. \nMercedes has revealed that higher-end variants of the X-Class will be powered by a turbodiesel V6, likely the ubiquitous 3.0 litre mill developing 258 hp and 620 Nm. Other models could get the 2.3 litre twin-turbo four-pot diesel the Navara offers in countries with cleaner diesel, with up to 188 hp and 450 Nm on tap. \nThe four-wheel drive system will combine an electronic traction system, a two-speed transfer case and differential locks on the centre shaft and rear axle. The whole system shuffles power to the axle with the most grip, and both differentials can be locked for extreme off-road driving. Expect the transmission to be either the seven-speed 7G-Tronic or nine-speed 9G-Tronic automatic. \nThe company quotes a payload capacity of more than 1.1 tonnes and a towing capacity of up to 3.5 tonnes. Additionally, the X-Class will also benefit from the Navara’s five-link rear suspension with coil springs, ensuring better ride comfort than other pick-ups, both on- and off-road. Driver assists will be made available with the use of cameras, radar and ultrasound sensors, with many features coming as standard.
