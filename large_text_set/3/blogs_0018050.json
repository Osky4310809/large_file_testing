The first domestic services to be run by Sir Richard Branson's airline Virgin Atlantic are among a number of new routes being flown by UK and overseas carriers from Britain in 2013. Virgin will be operating a total of 24 domestic flights a day out of Heathrow starting from the beginning of April. The airline will be flying six daily returns to Edinburgh as well as three daily returns to Aberdeen and to Manchester. Also from the beginning of April an extra, third, daily flight between Heathrow and Atlanta, USA, will be operated by American carrier Delta - the airline which is waiting for regulatory clearance to take a 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic. From the end of March, British Airways will begin flying from Gatwick to Colombo in Sri Lanka and will also start Gatwick services to the Canary Islands' destinations of Lanzarote and Tenerife. BA will also begin flights between Heathrow and Alicante in Spain and Palma in Majorca in spring 2013. See PA story AIR Routes.
