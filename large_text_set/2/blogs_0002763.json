NO PICKUPS @ JFK Airport 6 PM to 7 PM today. Drivers stand in solidarity with thousands protesting inhumane & unconstitutional #MuslimBan . \n— NY Taxi Workers (@NYTWA) January 28, 2017 Surge pricing has been turned off at #JFK Airport. This may result in longer wait times. Please be patient. \n— Uber NYC (@Uber_NYC) January 29, 2017 \nThe move was perceived by some as an effort to profit off the protests as more passengers would need to seek alternatives to cabs. \nTwitter users started using the hashtag “#DeleteUber” to convince others to delete the app and not use the ride-sharing service in the future. \nUber notes they shut down “surge” pricing, which increases fares when rides are in high demand, during the protests at JFK Airport so that people could leave the airport at normal prices, and said they did not intend to break up the JFK taxi strike. \nMany were also upset that Uber CEO Travis Kalanick sat on the president’s economic advisory committee. Kalanick initially said on Sunday that he was going to use his position on the council to “stand up for what’s right.” 3/ I'm going to use my position on Pres economic council to stand up for what's right – https://t.co/L6U9LOv3IX \n— travis kalanick (@travisk) January 29, 2017 \nKalanick quit the council on Thursday, however. \nUber released the following short statement regarding Kalanick’s position on the economic advisory committee: \n“Joining President Trump’s economic council was never meant to be an endorsement of the new Administration’s agenda, but in reality that’s what it became. Travis joined the economic policy board — along with more than a dozen other CEOs — in the belief that by having his voice heard he could effect change.” \nOn Saturday, Kalanick also said that his company is buying plane tickets for stranded drivers now that a federal judge has put a hold on President Trump’s ban on travel to the United States by migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nLaura Wiens, a member of Pittsburghers for Public Transit and the organizer of Saturday’s protest, said they believe Uber’s public opposition to the ban and subsequent actions are just a reaction to bad press. \n“We can celebrate a small victory because Uber [CEO Travis Kalanick] has [stepped down from the economic council], but it was only after massive boycotts of their product. People had deleted their app, more than 200,000 people deleted their app,” Wiens said. “And we think that they did it too late, frankly, because people’s lives were affected on Saturday.” \nThe Pittsburgh protest was not solely related to the travel ban. The release also says they are protesting because Uber has fought “any attempt to hold it to account to basic standards of safety and liability regulations, labor rights, environmental sustainability, data transparency, and compliance with civil rights laws such as the Americans With Disabilities Act.” \nWiens said they would like Mayor Peduto to reconsider Uber’s partnership with Pittsburgh. \nUber released the following statement in response to the protest: \n“More than ever, it’s important that we all support freedom of speech. Like many others, Uber strongly opposes the President’s unjust immigration ban which is harming many innocent people, many of whom are drivers. That’s why we created a $3 million legal defense fund to help, and why we’re offering compensation for lost earnings for any driver stranded abroad. We will continue to stand up for those being hurt by the President’s executive order.” \n  \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
