Nutella, advertised as a pseudo-healthy sweet, is a chocolate spread used on pancakes, toast and fried in wontons. \nIn fact, the product has a large group of enthusiasts both in Europe and the U.S. Unfortunately, while advertised as a healthy addition to your morning breakfast routine, Nutella doesn’t live up to the hype. \nThe simple ingredient list contains just five items, the greatest of which is sugar. Nutella has celebrated its 50th year anniversary and appears to be well established in their niche market of spreadable chocolate. Interestingly, crimes related to the product have also made the news. \nIn 2013, thieves in Germany snatched a little over $20,000 of the jars from a delivery truck. 1 In that same year, Columbia University discovered students were taking jars of Nutella from the dining facility, costing the school nearly $6,000 a week to replace. 2 Ingredients in Nutella May Surprise You \nWhile customers seem to love the taste, bordering on addiction, its ingredients may surprise you. In this short advertisement from Nutella, you’re told your children need the enticement of chocolate each morning to get them to eat breakfast. \nBut, before you pop out to the store to get a jar, take a peek at what’s inside. The advertisement talks about hazelnuts and a hint of cocoa, but neglects to mention refined palm oil and a massive dose of sugar. The label claims there are 8.5 grams of sugar in a 15-gram serving. 3 \nThat means more than half of any serving is composed of sugar. However, when dishing out Nutella, you likely are not weighing the product and there is no indication of a teaspoon serving size. In a statement, Nutella’s parent company, Ferrero, said: \n“One of Ferrero’s core nutritional beliefs is that small portion sizes help people to enjoy their favorite foods in moderation. The labeling on all our products enables consumers to make informed choices and helps ensure that Nutella can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.” Sugar and Palm Oil Do Not Make for a Healthy Breakfast \nThat sounds good, but an infusion of sugar is not part of a balanced diet . In fact, eating sugar triggers natural opioids in your brain and may be as addictive as cocaine to some people. \nSugar increases your risk of disease, tricks your body into gaining weight and may trigger behavioral changes. Learn more in my previous article, “ The Truth About Sugar Addiction. “ \nThe second ingredient making the news is palm oil, which has predominantly been harvested from the forests of Malaysia and Indonesia, contributing to the deforestation of those countries and having a significantly negative impact on the environment and the animals who depend on palm trees for survival. \nFerrero has made a point of using sustainable palm oil they claim is not contributing to deforestation and is part of a broad effort to create sustainable methods of production of palm oil. 4 , 5 However, sustainability is not the only concern with the palm oil used in Nutella. Health Effects of Refined Palm Oil Called Into Question \nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), akin to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, recently released a study 6 finding the chemical contaminants that result from refining vegetable oils (including palm oil), may increase your risk of cancer. \nThe substances causing concern included: glycidyl fatty acid esters (GE), 3-monochloropropanediol (3-MCPD), and 2-monochloropropanediol (2-MCPD) and their fatty acid esters. When refined at approximately 200 C (392 F), palm oil and palm fats had the highest number of contaminants, including GE. \nNo tolerable or safe levels have been set for GE as the group found sufficient evidence it is genotoxic and carcinogenic. 7 \nThe panel’s review did find levels of GE between 2010 and 2015 were cut in half through voluntary measures taken by producers. Ferrero claims their palm oil, refined to take out the characteristic red color and unusual taste, is responsible for the texture and taste of Nutella. \nThe company states its palm oil is refined at temperatures just below 200 C and under low pressure to reduce contaminants. Moving away from palm oil would not only change the taste, but also have economic repercussions to the company. Cost Is a Factor in Production \nPalm oil is the cheapest vegetable oil, costing $800 per ton, compared to $845 for sunflower and $900 for rapeseed. 8 Ferrero uses 185,000 tons each year, so switching could increase costs between $8 to 22 million annually. \nAlthough the World Health Organization and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization also flagged refined palm oil with the same risk, they did not recommend banning the ingredient. The palm oil industry, valued at $44 billion, has found a vocal and passionate supporter in Ferrero. \nWithout prompting, and following the release of the study, a large supermarket chain in Europe decided to boycott processed palm oil. Barilla has also eliminated it from their products. 9 However, Nutella, going on the offensive, began running a series of advertisements to assure the public in Italy their product is safe. 10 \nUnilever and Nestle have also continued to include palm oil in their products despite the report from EFSA. However, Ferrero is the only company, to date, mounting such a public defense of their use of palm oil. \nFerrero, a privately owned company, says global sales have been unaffected by the EFSA announcement and are continuing to grow approximately 5 percent per year. 11 Health Benefits of Unrefined Palm Oil \nIt isn’t the effects of palm oil that are in question, but rather what happens to the oil during the refining process to remove the color and neutralize the smell.
