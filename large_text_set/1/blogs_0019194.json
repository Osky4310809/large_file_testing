Jan 19, 2017 2:15 PM \nFirst pic I have ever seen of him without his Jets cap on. Jan 19, 2017 2:15 PM \nI wouldn’t expect any less. Jan 19, 2017 2:18 PM \nAnd Jets fans rejoice. Jan 19, 2017 2:20 PM \nCan trump send Synder somewhere as well? tomtravis76 says: Jan 19, 2017 2:21 PM \nThere might just be a few fan bases that would like to see Trump name Ambassadors so the owner will relinquish control of an organization. Maybe Trumperica will make sports ownership great again by sending off terrible owners for diplomacy elyasm says: Jan 19, 2017 2:21 PM \nSo much for the Special Relationship Great Britain and the US have shared for the last few centuries. Jan 19, 2017 2:25 PM \nCan the JETSs move to London now?!?!? patfanken says: Jan 19, 2017 2:28 PM \nSo I guess this means we should be at war with Great Britan before the end of the year. lol streetyson says: Jan 19, 2017 2:46 PM \nAll part of Trump’s plan to stop Jets taking the AFCE crown from NE… factschecker says: Jan 19, 2017 2:48 PM \nDo the Jets have to start wearing their logo on the left side of their helmet? rowech44 says: Jan 19, 2017 2:49 PM \nIf Trump mentioned this was his plan prior to the election, he may have won NJ/NY too… Jan 19, 2017 3:00 PM \nThe London Jets, kinda has a nice ring to it, lol thegreatgabbert says: Jan 19, 2017 3:00 PM \nLife is expected to be easier for the Jets owner in the U.K., where they have different slang terms for a “Woody” and a “Johnson”. streetyson says: Jan 19, 2017 3:05 PM \nBtw, my fellow Americans, the correct grammar is an Ambassador to the Court of St. James’– not James’s. There’s no need for a superfluous “s” after the apostrophe, at least in Britain (and the St. James’ in question is a British court), and in correct English – yet so many put one (even the Brits sometimes) as English grammar everywhere becomes dumbed-down. bobthebillsfan says: Jan 19, 2017 3:08 PM \nThis is great news for the Jets, not so much for the Bills, Dolphins, or Patriots. Jan 19, 2017 3:09 PM \nWorld.Domination Jan 19, 2017 3:20 PM \nThis is Trump doing everything he can to make the Jets competitive again.
