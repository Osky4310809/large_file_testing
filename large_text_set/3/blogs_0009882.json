German hostage Juergen Kantner was beheaded on Feb. 26 after almost four months in captivity.   \nThe military has deployed thousands of troops in the Abu Sayyaf strongholds of Basilan, Tawi-Tawi and Jolo islands. \nDefense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said they are also eyeing the deployment of drones and joint patrols with Indonesia and Malaysia to prevent cross-border kidnappings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T04:13:19.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
