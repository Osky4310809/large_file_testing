And that respect has to be earned. But it's hard to be respectful of someone when we all have kids, and we're watching him be misogynistic and xenophobic and racist and make fun of handicapped people.\"\nThen, on Sunday morning, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr made this joke about his playing career in Orlando.\nSteve Kerr on his in unmemorable, short Magic career: \"Sean Spicer will be talking about my career any second. 14,000 points.\" pic.twitter.com/XvvuUfKoNW\n— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) January 22, 2017\nYep, that's Kerr making a dig at Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer, who was pilloried on Twitter for lying during his last press conference.\nSo, you've got the stern firebrand in Pop, who has won five NBA championships as a coach — just the kind of winning pedigree and temperament you'd want in a president. And you have the laid-back humor of Kerr, who could totally play the Biden role .\nPlenty of people on Twitter liked the sound of that presidential ticket.\nCan someone start a GoFundMe for a Gregg Popovich/ Steve Kerr 2020 presidential campaign?\n— (((Hal Schwimmer))) (@SchwimmyFBaby) January 22, 2017\nPopovich/Kerr 2020 and I'm not even kidding.\n— Adam Turer (@adamturer) January 22, 2017\nAll I'm saying is, I wouldn't not vote for a Gregg Popovich/Steve Kerr ticket in 2020.\n— Joshua Guerrero (@kid_charlemagne) January 22, 2017\n@ramonashelburne Popovich/Kerr 2020.
