Record on Sunday , referring to the Senate and House investigations into the Trump campaign’s connections with Russia. She went on to characterize the concerns about Trump’s ties to Russia as “a bunch of people who can’t believe that Hillary Clinton lost the election,” adding “I was the campaign manager. I was there every day and every night. I talked to people in Macomb County, Michigan, not in Moscow.”\nConway also insinuated that Obama may have done more than merely wiretap Trump Tower. “What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other. You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets — any number of ways.”\n\nEven as she doubled down on her boss’s claim that Obama spied on Trump, she denigrated the claims about Russia as a “waste of people’s oxygen, and air and resources and time when we could be helping those who are hungry, who need health care, who are in poverty, who need tax relief, entrepreneurs who want to get off the ground.”\nConway’s comments directly contradict the position of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n“I have no reason to believe that the charge is true, but I also believe that the President of the United States could clear this up in a minute,” McCain told anchor Jake Tapper . “All he has to do is pick up the phone, call the director of the CIA, director of national intelligence and say, ‘OK, what happened?'”\n \n\nOn Monday, Conway repeated her claims during an appearance on NBC’s “Today.” After Matt Lauer compared Trump’s claims about being wiretapped by Obama to his promotion of the discredited birther conspiracy theories, Conway replied, “I’m not surprised you’re conflating the two, but I fail to see the comparison.”\nAfter she tried to pivot to Obamacare and her hosts reminded her that the issue of wiretapping was raised by President Trump, Conway responded that “it’s under investigation.”\n. @MLauer and @SavannahGuthrie question @KellyannePolls about Trump's wiretapping claims. https://t.co/WByrBSNjyU \n— TODAY (@TODAYshow) March 13, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T14:08:19.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
