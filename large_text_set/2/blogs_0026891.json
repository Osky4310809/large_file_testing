We have already come across a great one over at Best Buy. The retailer is giving out a bunch of freebies to customers who buy one of the company’s flagship devices.\nIf you pick up a Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge , you’ll get a wireless charger ($59.99), a $100 Best Buy gift card, and a Samsung EVO+ 256 GB microSD card ($199.99) for free. The total value of these three items is $359.98, and they will be added to your shopping cart automatically.\nHowever, some conditions do apply. You’ll have to activate the device on Verizon Device Payment, AT&T Next, or Sprint 24-Month Installment. Supplies are limited, which means that the deal probably won’t last for long, although Best Buy didn’t mention exactly when it will end.\nSee also: Get the Secure Folder feature on your Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge (Nougat only) 4 days ago This really is a great deal for those of you who have been thinking of getting either of the two devices. We’ll probably see more deals like these in the coming months, as Samsung, as well as retailers, will try to sell as many smartphones as possible before the Galaxy S8 launches.\nIf you’re thinking of getting the deal, visit Best Buy’s website by clicking the button below.\nGet the deal ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:57:26.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
