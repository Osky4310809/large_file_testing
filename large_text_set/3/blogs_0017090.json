After all, the Xbox One S is more similar in some ways to the new slimline PS4 that was introduced earlier in 2016. Shouldn’t we be comparing the Xbox One S to the slim PS4, and leave the PS4 Pro comparisons for the more powerful Project Scorpio when that launches later next year? \nIn a way these criticisms are valid, but at the end of the day, if you want to buy a new console with 4K capabilities right now in 2017 then these are the two best consoles to consider. \nIf you're not overly concerned with having the highest power and the latest graphics we'd throw the Nintendo Switch into the mix for your consideration and direct you to our comparison hub for that . \nAs far as high-powered consoles go, the situation will of course change again when Project Scorpio is launched later this year, but until now we think that it’s a two horse race between the PS4 Pro and Xbox One S. \nThis guide is focused on these two pieces of hardware specifically, but if you’re looking for a comparison of the two platforms as a whole then you should check out our full guide to , which details everything from the console’s respective controllers, to their game libraries and online networks. Xbox One S vs PS4 Pro graphics Xbox One S uses simplistic upscaling to generate 4K images. PS4 Pro renders at higher resolution and uses more intelligent upscaling. \nThe headline graphical feature of both consoles is their 4K output, but how exactly each console achieves this is a little different. \nWith the Xbox One S its 4K output in games is generated by a process known as upscaling. The games themselves are rendered at a maximum resolution of 1080p (otherwise known as ‘Full HD’) and then stretched to have it fill the entirety of a 4K screen. \nSince 4K is four times the resolution of Full HD this means that with the One S each one of the game's pixels is being stretched across four of your television's pixels, and the result is an image that’s much less crisp and detailed than what 4K is truly capable of. \nLike the Xbox One S, the PS4 Pro is also not always capable of displaying native 4K content – some games, such as Skyrim, will hit those heady pixel heights - but more often it too will be a case of upscaling on Sony's machine. At least with the PS4 Pro however, it is slightly cleverer with how it fakes it. \nEach game handles its upscaling slightly differently, but a general theme so far has been that games will render at a resolution that’s between Full HD and 4K and then use a more advanced upscaling method called ‘checkerboard rendering’ to fill its 4K pixels. \nWhen talking about checkerboard rendering things can get complicated very quickly, but the important takeaway from this is that the images the PS4 Pro is capable of displaying look very close in quality to native 4K content, which is a far cry better than what the Xbox One S’ upscaling is able to achieve. \nThe PS4 Pro has given itself a big boost with the addition of its aptly named 'Boost Mode' in its 4.5 firmware update. \nTo really take advantage of the PS4 Pro's power a game's developers would ideally enable \"Pro Mode\" which is an additional line of code in software that allows the game to take advantage of the more powerful hardware. However, the addition of Boost Mode has meant that even games that don't have this patch are able to take advantage of the console's extra power with more stable frame rates and improved performance. \nGoing forward, most (if not all) games will support the Pro’s extra functionality, but it's good to know that the vast majority of the console's existing games can benefit too. \nAside from 4K, HDR is the other big recent development in image technology, and both consoles support it to varying degrees. With the Xbox One S the list is confined to games that have been specifically upgraded to support HDR and Ultra HD Blu-ray discs, whereas with the PS4 Pro most of the games that have a Pro mode should support it. The PS4 Pro, however, does not have a 4K Blu-ray player - but more on that in a little bit. \nThis means the amount of games that support HDR is currently much longer for the PS4 Pro than the Xbox One S. Xbox One S vs PS4 Pro Games Both have excellent exclusives. More games than ever before are now multi-platform. \nOf course, graphics are only important if you want to play the games in the first place, and although both consoles have a number of excellent exclusives, there's also a great deal of overlap in the games available. \nRecently the Xbox One has seen some great exclusives come its way. We’ve seen the Gears of War series make a fantastic comeback with", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:54:46.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
