The family were accompanied by one bodyguard and stopped by the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store and Pooh's Corner Toys.

Looks like Christmas came again for the Jolie-Pitt kids. \n“They all looked great,” a source told E! News. \n“Shiloh was so happy. They were laughing a lot and just enjoying being out together.” \nIt comes amid reports that Brad had his \"worst\" Christmas ever following his split from Angelina .

Brad is said to be upset (Photo: Splash News) \n\"He desperately misses having his kids with him for Christmas and New Year,\" the insider added. \n\"He's broken down in tears so many times - he's not ashamed to cry anymore. Brad is like a broken man.\" \nIt comes weeks after Pitt's lawyers stated that Jolie \"has no self-regulating mechanism\" to prevent sensitive information about their children and divorce becoming public through the media. \nThe actor's legal team filed a memorandum in a Los Angeles court on December 21 explaining to a judge why he wants information about the divorce and the custody of their six children sealed from the public. Actor Brad Pitt arrives at the premiere of the film \"Allied\" in Madrid (Photo: Reuters) \nIn the paperwork Pitt, 53, accuses Jolie, 41, of compromising their children's privacy and not acting in their \"best interest\". \nThe move from Pitt comes weeks after a judge refused to take emergency action to seal the file but told the actor he could apply for the case to be sealed in January 2017. \nPitt's lawyers also drafted a proposed order which they would like the judge to approve at the January hearing, which will be at a court in Los Angeles. \nEarlier this week Brad's demands to see more of his children were rejected by his ex-wife as their divorce battle became increasingly bitter, and the star was said to be facing a Christmas alone. Brad has accused Angelina of having: 'No self-regulating mechanism' \nThe details emerged as the actor's request to seal sensitive court documents in his custody fight with the Tomb Raider star was denied by a judge. \nHowever, Superior Los Angeles Court Judge Richard Burdge Jr did not rule out sealing specific documents, including those related to the couple’s children. \nBefore the hearing, which neither Pitt and Jolie attended on Wednesday, lawyers for both sides reportedly submitted information via emails to the court that shed light on the increasingly acrimonious dispute involving access to their six children. \nThe actor’s attorney Lance Spiegel claimed in one that while his client has complied with the child therapy process, 'the therapy team has ignored or disregarded issues that [Brad] has raised.'

Jolie currently has temporary custody of all of the couple's children (Photo: FameFlynet) \nIt followed the launch of investigations by child services and the FBI into an incident between the World War Z star and son Maddox, 15, on a private jet flight in September. \nThe probes were launched after Pitt, allegedly got “verbally abusive” and “physical” with his eldest son. \nAuthorities from both agencies later cleared Pitt , 52, from any potential charges. \nJolie, 41, filed for divorce five days later saying the decision to end the marriage “was made for the health of the family”. \nThe actress is currently seeking sole physical custody of the couple’s six kids while Pitt wants joint custody. \nHe and Jolie share Maddox, Pax, 13, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, eight. Jolie temporarily has primary custody. \nJudge Burdge Jr also said there was no reason to bring forward a hearing on the issue of the children and the case remains scheduled for January.
