He sounds like a man very much at home in Vegas, happy to talk sports and bet in the desert. Advertisement \nKilgore dug up excellent anecdotes about ESPN and NFL execs scolding Musburger for reading betting lines on air, but the best nugget is about Musburger’s apparent enthusiasm that he can now express his horniness on the air. More than anything, Musburger is famous for lusting over college girls during his broadcasts , which he’s now happily free to do: \nWhen his Monday show finished, he laughed as he told a reporter, “It’s great working for a group that, when I see a beautiful woman, I can call her a beautiful woman.” Musburger had, over the years, rankled many by referring to the attractiveness of female fans. (“1,500 red-blooded Americans just decided to apply to Florida State,” he once said after the camera showed three scantily clad Seminole football fans.) \nBrent Musburger finally found a place where an old man can shamelessly announce that he’s aroused. Must have been a difficult search. Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T01:24:57.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
