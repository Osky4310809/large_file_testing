The documents also allege that Brown threatened some of Tran’s friends. And, there’s also a video posted by Brown a few weeks ago that states plainly his feelings on women: “If I love you bitch, ain’t nobody gonna have you.” \nThe restraining order requires Brown to stay 100 feet yards away from Karreuche, her mother and her brother.
