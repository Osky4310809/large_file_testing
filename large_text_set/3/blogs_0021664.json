Last week she headed to New York to appear on The View where she talked about her Pro-Choice beliefs despite falling on the conservative side of the political spectrum.\n\nThese very liberal comments ticked off her conservative base, lead to a tweet storm from Tomi over the weekend:\nI speak my truth. If you don't like it, tough. I will always be honest and stand in my truth.\n‚Äî Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017 \nI have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker.\n‚Äî Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017 \nThank you. Conservatives don't have to exist in a monolith and share the same brain on every issue. It's okay. https://t.co/YqzJNcaRar \n‚Äî Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 19, 2017 \nListen, I am not glorifying abortion. I don't personally advocate for it. I just don't think it's the government's place to dictate. https://t.co/qRjbAtJdo7 \n‚Äî Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 19, 2017 \n\nAnd resulted in a tweet from her employer at The Blaze:\nWait, libertarian views? Help me out on Trumpcare, stimulus, and executive orders. Trump is anything but libertarian. #intellectualhonesty https://t.co/jlt5sFvQMP \n‚Äî Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) March 20, 2017 \n\nNow The Daily Caller is reporting that The Blaze is attempting to put a muzzle on Tomi, suspending her show for a week. via The Daily Caller :\nConservative media company The Blaze has suspended political commentator Tomi Lahren, multiple sources with knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Daily Caller.\nLahren‚Äôs show is suspended for effect for at least one week starting Monday, according to TheDC‚Äôs sources. A source with direct knowledge of the situation previously told TheDC that Lahren‚Äôs contract with the company goes until September, but that she may leave the company before then.\nLahren‚Äôs inflammatory style placed her at odds with other employees at The Blaze, as previously reported by TheDC. Tensions were high between Lahren and her coworkers at The Blaze even before she called pro-life conservatives hypocrites in an appearance on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe View‚Äù on Friday.\nWith a suspension coming on the heels of a trip to the media capital of the world, it will be interesting to see if she announces her next move. At least she has a winning attitude about the whole thing:\nNo one hunts small deer ü¶å this too shall pass. #mondaymotivation \n‚Äî Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 20, 2017 \n\n‚Äî Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 20, 2017 \n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:39:52.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
