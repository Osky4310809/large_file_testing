But, sometimes it seems like there’s no end in sight to the negativity thrown our way. Depending on the situation, it can be downright depressing. Is that how you feel right now? Having a rough day or maybe a rough week? You didn’t get the job you wanted, you and your best friend are fighting, your partner just dumped you…\nThe list can go on and on. But, that’s what life’s all about. The ups and the downs, just like a roller coaster ride. And even though it doesn’t seem like it now, things will get better. You’ll find happiness again. In fact, there are some things you can do to start feeling happier sooner.\n“Change is the only constant in life.” – Heraclitus An important life lesson that Buddhism teaches us to hold on to is that life is constantly changing. Remember this when you’re feeling depressed and thinking you’ll never feel happiness again. Now, you might be thinking – how is this going to help me? But, just think about it for a minute. Constant change means everything is temporary. Including your pain.\nThe idea of constant change is called anitya, which means impermanence. Life is fluid; you will never repeat the same moment twice. Every day is different from the day before. Your body has changed, your thoughts have changed, and the world around you has changed. Remembering this during your most trying times can help you deal with everything. This will pass, and it will not come back. [1] \nDon’t just think about this when you’re feeling down in the dumps however. Cherish this life lesson as words to live by. You’ll be surprised by how much control you have over your own happiness. And you’ll start to appreciate all the little moments in your life, knowing that you must enjoy them while you can.\n“Happiness is not a station you arrive at, but a manner of traveling.” – Margaret Lee Runbeck Happiness will not just happen. You have to make an effort and work for it. If you’re sad right now, you have to work even harder. Erin Falconer’s personal experience is all about taking short relaxation breaks. She either meditates for 5 to 10 minutes or listens to some motivating songs to change the direction of her energy. [2] Relaxation helps when you’re dealing with too much stress.\nYou can apply this same strategy to your life, or you can personalize it. Getting your happiness back is all about changing your focus. If you’re sad, don’t sit around thinking how sad you are. If you’re stressed, don’t obsess over all the things you have to get done. Stop what you’re doing, stand up, stretch, and focus on something else. Try to do 50 jumping jacks or watch 5 minutes of cute kitten videos (doesn’t that cheer up everybody?).\nThe key to being happier is remembering that life is always changing. Not only is this moment temporary, but you also have control over how you feel. The sooner you understand this, the happier you will be. Accept this life lesson and embrace it. Make it your daily mantra. When you get out of bed in the morning, repeat to yourself: “anitya”. This will help set your mind for the day ahead.\nWhen all else fails you, remember that every rough patch in life is like an obstacle. Use each obstacle to get you closer to your goal – happiness. Tomorrow is another day. Things will get better. The present is all you have right now, use it to for your personal growth.\nFeatured photo credit: Unsplash via pexels.com \nReference [1] ^ Mind Body Green: 3 Buddhist Beliefs That Will Rock Your World – And Make You Much Happier!
