Akinwunmi Ambode will safeguard against prevalent pandemics around us. \n”We urge the public to report to appropriate government authority any illegal or criminal activities around them through the Lagos Emergency Toll-free lines ‘112’ or ‘767’, ” he said. \nEgbeyemi said that the Commissioner of Police in Lagos, Mr Fatai Owoseni, had directed that all those arrested in connection with illegal businesses in oil should be immediately charge to court. \nResidents of the Alausa area told journalists that the illegal activities in oil were responsible for a fire outbreak that destroyed properties including 18 vehicles in the area recently. \nOne of the residents, Mr Anjorin Babalola, said that they were afraid to reports to government because they were threatened by those involved in the illegal dealings. \nMrs Rebecca Ogunsanya, a food vendor, said that trucks, including those marked “NNPC” and “Oando” discharged diesel and kerosene inside the compound daily. \nOne of the suspects, who claimed to have hailed from Oyo state, said Jlobjin Petroleum Ltd, the company masterminding the illegal business, belonged to one Alhaji Lukumon Ojena. \nHe confessed that they mixed diesel with kerosene on daily basis and supplied in large quantities to the public, particularly communication companies and banks, at low prices. \nAccording to him, we make sales of over N20 million every day from adulterated diesel. \nAnother suspect said that the business was very lucrative as he was paid between N3, 000 and N4, 000 daily. \nHe disclosed that they had contacts with major oil marketers who supplied them with diesel and kerosene daily for the business. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T15:08:15.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
