Nick Viall took his remaining ladies to his hometown in Wisconsin, where they ran into his ex, squeezed udders (not Corinne ’s) and spent quality time with his family on The Bachelor ’s Monday, January 23, episode. But first, we need to return to last week’s cliffhanger… PHOTOS: 'The Bachelor' Season 21: Meet Nick Viall's Bachelorettes! \nCorinne’s Rude Awakening \nTo pick up we left off at the pre-rose ceremony pool party, Vanessa was asking Nick if he’s just looking for a “someone to f--k around with” and we were screaming at our TV, “Yeah, Nick, what do you want ?” \nWell, Nick did not directly answer the question, but commiserated with Vanessa, reminding her that he’s totally been there before and it sucked. (Not that this means he’ll avoid putting anyone in that position, obviously.) He asked her to keep calling him out when she noticed things that bugged her because he likes strong women and “very much give[s] a s--t\" about Vanessa’s opinions. Also, he requested patience regarding Corinne. \nSpeaking of being patient with Corinne, after Nick left to get ready for the rose ceremony, Sarah and Taylor decided to wake Corinne from her nap to call her entitled, to which the multi-million dollar business heiress scoffed, “I’m not privileged in any way, shape or form.” This conversation inspired Corinne to be fake to everyone who was fake to her and set us up for the next two hours to be primarily about Corinne v. everyone, but mostly Taylor. \nThen the rose ceremony came and went, leaving us with Alexis , Astrid , Corinne, Danielle M. , Jaimi , Jasmine , Josephine , Kristina , Raven , Sarah, Taylor and Whitney all staying. Danielle L. , Rachel and Vanessa had already received roses last week, so Brittany and Christen were sent packing. PHOTOS: 'The Bachelor' Season 21: See Which Former Contestants Are Lookalikes With Nick Viall’s New Ladies? \nNick’s Ex Makes a Cameo \nChris Harrison announced that the women were leaving the mansion for Milwaukee, which was met with great excitement since this is Nick’s hometown. \nDanielle L. got the first one-on-one date, the highlights being the tour stops on Memory Lane along the way, such as the dirty river some kids tricked Nick into jumping into for $12 and then ran away from to avoid paying up, the library where Nick used to make out with girls and the place where he had “the first.” \nThe lowlight was the chance encounter with Nick’s ex-girlfriend Amber , who dated the now-Bachelor for three or four months. Danielle L. was much cooler about it than some of the other women would be (we won’t name names), but dropped a, “But um … yeah!” to end her positive thoughts on that portion of the date. Amber didn’t have any hard feelings toward Nick and just said he won’t pursue something he’s not feeling, so that was much less exciting than it could have been. \nThat night, Nick asked Danielle L. the best getting-to-know-you question we’ve heard on the show thus far: “When was the last time you went grocery shopping in sweatpants?” He liked her answer enough (“All the time!”) to give her a rose. Nick Viall at a Chris Lane concert George Burns/ABC \nCorinne Confronts the Women \nRachel, Alexis, Vanessa, Jasmine, Jaimi, Sarah, Kristina, Taylor, Josephine, Danielle M. and Corinne went on the group date to a dairy farm, where they all performed manual labor, feeding and milking cows and shoveling manure. Well, all minus Corinne, who excused herself during the manure portion and said she’d have rather been at a spa being fed a nice chicken taco, which didn’t sound ridiculous. \nThat night, Corinne, who deemed herself “misunderstood” after musing “Do you call this immature?” while grabbing her boobs with each syllable, noticed the growing hostility coming from the other women and encouraged them to talk to her about any concerns. \nEveryone jumped at the chance, until Corinne realized she didn’t want to hear everyone’s annoying complaints and ran to Nick to tell him that people were talking about her and that she confronted her naysayers. Much like he did with Vanessa earlier, Nick empathized, saying he knows how it feels to be in that situation. They didn’t kiss, which Corinne took note of. \nKristina got the group date rose.
