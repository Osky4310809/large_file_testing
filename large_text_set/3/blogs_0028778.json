He formed his own foundation, and advocated strongly for human rights causes such as youth development, anti-racism, and freedom of speech.\nLast year, he joined a movement of veteran figures who were critical of the governing ANC and its current crop of leaders - particularly President Jacob Zuma, who has been mired in mounting allegations of corruption . Kathrada penned an open letter to the president and called on him to step down.\n\"Right to the very end he kept himself relevant, he was a newsmaker, he was honest and true to his values and his beliefs,\" Page said. \"And that's why so many millions of South Africans will be very sad at his passing today.\"\nINSIDE STORY: Will South Africa's Jacob Zuma hang on to power? \n\"This is a great loss to the ANC, the broader liberation movement and South Africa as a whole,\" Neeshan Balton, head of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, said in a statement.\n\"'Kathy' was an inspiration to millions in different parts of the world.\"\n\nKathrada's activism against the white-minority apartheid regime started at the age of 17, when he was one of 2,000 \"passive resisters\" arrested in 1946 for defying a law that discriminated against Indian South Africans.\n\nIn July 1963, the police swooped on Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, a Johannesburg suburb where Kathrada and other senior activists had been meeting in secret.\n\nAt the famous Rivonia trial, eight of the accused were sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour on Robben Island.\n\nHis fellow prisoners included Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Denis Goldberg.\nMandela's legacy: Media in post-apartheid South Africa - The Listening Post \nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T09:54:32.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
