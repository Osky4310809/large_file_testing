It’s unclear if this teaser was specifically designed to capitalize on the similarly patriotic nature of Lady Gaga’s halftime show , but it’s a nice surprise either way—especially for people who like to see the American flag represented in both stars and banana hammocks. \nBaywatch will be in theaters on May 26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:11:10.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
