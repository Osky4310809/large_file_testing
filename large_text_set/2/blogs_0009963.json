Welcome to The Morning Shift , your roundup of the auto news you crave, all in one place every weekday morning. Here are the important stories you need to know. \nAdvertisement \n\n1st Gear: Peugeot Is, Like, Interested In Buying Opel \nGM’s European subsidiary Opel (and its British cousin Vauxhall) hasn’t really been doing the American company any favors. And by favors, I mean sold many cars, despite showing us a drop-dead gorgeous wagon . As a result, GM is possibly looking into selling Opel, which has piqued the interest of France’s PSA Peugeot-Citroën Group, according to Bloomberg . The two companies are in formal talks now for GM to offload the brand onto the French.\nAdvertisement \n\nThe move would most likely give PSA a volume boost:\nA combination would create a manufacturer with about 16 percent of the European car market, leapfrogging Renault SA to become the region’s second-biggest auto group after Volkswagen AG. A deal would also be the second run at linking the two mass-market carmakers. GM, which has controlled Opel for nearly 90 years, sold a 7 percent stake in its French counterpart in 2013 after savings from a cooperation fell short of expectations.\nSo where does that leave GM in the European market, a place it has traditionally struggled? Apparently saying “screw it” and getting out. \n\nPSA is considering the takeover to boost its scale, get access to Opel’s engineering and electric-car technology as well as reap savings from joint purchasing and eventually cost cuts, according to one of the people. For GM, it would mark a clean exit from Europe, especially after the U.K. vote to leave the European Union weighed on the British pound and profits, the person said.\nMaybe it will take a French touch for Opel to turn a profit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:14:52.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
