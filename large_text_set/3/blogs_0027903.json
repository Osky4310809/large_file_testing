Kat Von D Is Relaunching Her Cult Scents in July â€” but Here's How You Can Get 1 Now March 23, 2017 0 Shares Chat with us on Facebook Messenger. Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. A post shared by Kat Von D Beauty (@katvondbeauty) on Mar 22, 2017 at 7:31pm PDT \nAfter years of teases and anticipation, we finally have information on when Kat Von D is reviving her cult-status fragrances, Saint and Sinner. In a post to the brand's official Instagram, a caption disclosed that the scents will be relaunching exclusively and internationally in Sephora this July. \nIf you didn't sniff them when they originally launched in 2009, you should know that the two perfumes are wildly different but both impossibly sexy. Saint, which is the lighter aroma of the two (and housed in that white bottle in the above image), features notes of mandarin, vanilla, caramel, jasmine, and sandalwood. Sinner, seen above in black, is spicier and boasts cinnamon, patchouli, and vanilla notes. \nIf you simply can't wait for July, we have good news: you can actually buy Kat Von D Saint Perfume ($45) right now on the brand's official website. It's in an edgy, intricate, cigarette lighter-inspired bottle. Act quickly if you're interested, though, because it's likely to sell out quickly. \nStay tuned for price information and more updates on the fragrance relaunch as they become available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:40:59.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
