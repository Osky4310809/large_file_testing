By Jean Hopfensperger Star Tribune March 15, 2017 — 11:48am Freshly cooked tilapia is on the menu for Friday nights in Lent at St. Albert the Great church in Minneapolis. But this Friday, Catholics have permission to eat meat. ] AARON LAVINSKY ï aaron.lavinsky@startribune.com Maple Grove played Grand Rapids in a boys' 2A quarterfinal hockey game on Thursday, March 9, 2017 at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minn.

While fish fry purveyors may not be thrilled, many area Catholics are relieved. “I think it’s a great idea, said Bryan Marshall, working St. Albert the Great Church’s annual fish fry last week. “You get tired of eating fish six weeks in a row.” Catholics in the only diocese to ban the beef, New Ulm, aren’t exactly dancing a jig. “I’m sure there will be people not happy about this,” said Mary O’Connor, a founder of the New Ulm St. Patrick’s Day parade. “In New Ulm, at least we have sauerkraut,” added her friend Mary Jane Glawe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T18:57:17.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
