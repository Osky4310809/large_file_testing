The hospital is struggling to cope though the Federal Government had provided 100 vials of anti-snake venom. \n“We get lots of cases and the vials given by government are not sufficient; during the hot season, the 100 vials can be exhausted in five days. A vial of anti-snake venom costs N27,000 and many victims, who could not afford that amount, usually seek alternative treatments. \n“Some go to native doctors leading to high mortality; many people just die at home. We have challenged them to do the economic arithmetic; a rat is not worth N27,000. It costs just about N50 to N70. \n“We have also advised them to stop moving around at night; where they must, they should use torch lights and try to avoid snakes’ possible habitats.” \nHe advised people in affected areas to rear pigs and ducks because they are sources of biological control of snakes. \n“The two are natural preda-tors that eat snakes and deplete their population,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:50:27.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
