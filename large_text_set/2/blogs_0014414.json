His serum ferritin was very high (which is a potent risk factor for heart disease ), as were his liver enzymes. After consulting with three different doctors, he realized none of them really understood the root cause of these problems, or how to address them. \nAs a result, he delved into the medical literature, found the problem and reversed his abnormal test results. He also dropped 35 pounds in the process. \nEventually, he got more involved in health and began giving lectures such as this one, which was presented at the Low Carb USA Keto Getaway 1 in Florida this past January. He also has a website, thefatemperor.com, 2 where he notes: \n\"I refer primarily to the 'diet-heart' hypothesis, which proposed that dietary saturated fat elevated blood cholesterol, and the latter drove heart disease mortality like nothing else. \nThe evidence at the time was loose correlation, certainly not causation, and seems almost laughably naïve in retrospect. \nHowever, the tenaciousness of this flawed hypothesis has turned out to be no laughing matter, condemning millions to the misery of obesity, type 2 diabetes and an extraordinary range of inflammatory diseases. \nThe factors that conspired to perpetuate the flawed hypotheses were many: academic and research community hubris, political forces, economic imperatives, profiteering from the food and pharmaceutical industries, and the groupthink psychology that underpins the worsening 'diabesity epidemic. \nAfter 25 years in technical/management positions with a personal specialty in complex problem solving, I have been inspired to … bring an engineering-style approach to the current situation.\" The Cholesterol Conundrum \nThe vast majority — about 80 percent — of the cholesterol in your body is made by your liver. The remaining 20 percent comes from your diet. If you consume less, your body will compensate by making more, and vice versa. \nContrary to popular belief, cholesterol is a crucial molecule necessary for optimal health, and not nearly the damaging culprit it's been made out to be. \nSince cholesterol is a fatty substance, it does not travel well through your water-based bloodstream. Hence it is encapsulated in a lipoprotein. Cummins likens the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) your liver makes to a boat that shuttles not only cholesterol but also triglycerides through your bloodstream to your tissues. \nThe VLDL will dock onto receptors in your muscle tissue, where it releases triglycerides to be used for energy. Cummins accurately notes that eating fat is not the cause of high triglycerides. \nIf your triglycerides are high, it means you're eating too many net carbohydrates, because it's actually sugar that causes triglycerides to rise, not dietary fat. \nOnce the VLDL has dropped off the triglycerides to be burnt for energy (or stored as fat if you're not using the energy due to inactivity), the VLDL becomes a low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which in conventional thinking is a \"bad\" kind of cholesterol. \nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) is colloquially known as \"good\" cholesterol, and the HDL is indeed beneficial in that it acts as a master manager, helping protect the LDL against oxidation and transport triglycerides and cholesterol in and out of the VLDL. \nIn a healthy person, the LDL will be reabsorbed by the liver after about two days, where it gets broken up and recycled. This is a beautiful system; alas, it is one that can be disrupted if you're eating too many unhealthy foods. \nAs a general rule, a high-sugar diet will cause damaged LDLs to rise, beneficial HDLs to drop, triglycerides and, often, total cholesterol to rise. All of these are conventional indicators of atherosclerosis or inflammation in your arteries that can precipitate a heart attack. Beyond Cholesterol — What Really Causes Heart Disease? \nAccording to Dr. Thomas Dayspring, a lipidologist (expert on cholesterol), most heart attacks are due to insulin resistance . He has also stated that LDL \"is a near-worthless predictor for cardiovascular issues.\" \nIn simple layman's terms Cummins goes on to demonstrate the connection between the metabolic functionality of adipose fat — which actually acts as a signaling organ — and insulin sensitivity, and how and why: A metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW) person who has good insulin sensitivity has a low risk level for cardiovascular disease (CVD) A metabolically obese yet normal weight (MONW) individual who is insulin resistant has a high risk A metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO) individual who is insulin resistant also has a high risk But a metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individual who has good insulin sensitivity is at low risk for CVD \nIn other words, there's healthy body fat and unhealthy body fat, or put another way, fat that protects your health and fat that promotes disease. The key difference is the presence or absence of insulin sensitivity. \nThe higher your insulin resistance, the worse markers such as fasting insulin, triglyceride-HDL ratio and HbA1c will be, suggesting you're at increased risk for diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. \nRecent research has shown that two specific metrics: circulating adiponectin and macrophages, can with near 100 percent accuracy predict your obese phenotype, meaning whether you're obese insulin sensitive or obese insulin resistant. How a High-Sugar Diet Causes Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes \nBut what makes one person insulin sensitive and another insulin resistant? This is where your diet comes into play. What you eat tends to be a primary deal-maker or deal-breaker. Other factors that promote systemic insulin resistance include: \n✓ Smoking", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:45:09.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
