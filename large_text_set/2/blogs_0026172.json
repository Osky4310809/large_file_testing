Warren Beatty makes a mistake while announcing the Best Film at the 89th Academy awards. Calls out La La Land when it's actually Moonlight that won the award. By Aarti Iyengar | Published: February 27, 2017 11:30 am comments \nOops is the right word for this moment. Warren Beatty just pulled a Steve Harvey at the 89th Academy awards! He mistook Moonlight for La La Land and announced the wrong film as the winner Best Film. Yes, that happened! So far the Oscar’s event was going smooth, with no goof ups, no controversy, nothing. However, in just one move, celebrated director Beatty has made it the most talked about on social media! Basically, he was presenting the award for Best Film, the last category in the list of awards. After seeing the nominations, the filmmaker opened the envelope but that’s when he made a boo-boo. Instead of reading Moonlight, the director called out La La Land. The happy team of the musical film jumped up in joy and made their way to the stage. However, sadly an announcement was soon made stating that not La La Land but Moonlight had won the trophy. \nAn embarrassed Beatty then clarified that he read Emma Stone, La La Land on the envelope handed over to him. After the award was given to the musical, the producer read the envelope that Beatty had in his hand and announced, “There’s a mistake. ‘Moonlight’, you guys won Best Picture. This is not a joke.” Ah yes. A total Steve Harvey moment. Remember how the Miss Universe host had goofed up majorly by crowning the wrong diva and later rectifying it. Damn. It’s weird because apparently, Warren states that the envelope given to him had Emma Stone written on it. But where was that piece of paper?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:24:27.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
