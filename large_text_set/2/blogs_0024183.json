Below, a sampling: \n“Oh, look at me … I’m Ryan Gosling. I have perfect bone structure and fine eyes. Go **** yourself Ryan Gosling.” Advertisement \n“Are we all just ignoring the fact that Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne have the same face?” \n“Lin-Manuel Miranda looks like he’s getting a 1996 NBC sitcom with his haircut.” (Miranda, good sport that he is, did not appear to disagree with this.) \n“Emma Stone looks like she plays a crack whore in every role she plays.” \n“Miles Teller has the face of a guy who would request Gangnam Style at a wedding where he doesn’t know either the bride or groom.” Kudos to @Josh for really nailing Miles Teller. \nDavid Canfield is a Brow Beat intern.
