2017: The Hottest Parties and Most Anticipated Movies January 17, 2017 @ 4:00 PM Travis Cronin \nIt’s that time of year again, when big stars descend upon a small mountain resort town in Utah to celebrate independent filmmaking, raise awareness of important causes and party hard on Main Street (thin oxygen, be damned!). And the 33rd edition of the Sundance Film Festival, which starts January 19 in Park City, Utah, promises to be extra-buzzy, as Jennifer Aniston , Jay Z , Anne Hathaway , Jon Hamm , Casey Affleck , Kristen Stewart , Chelsea Handler and more A-listers plan to stop by to promote their latest projects. Us Weekly will be there to cover it all. Until then, here’s the VIP cheat sheet: Casey Affleck and Jon Hamm attend An Artist at the Table: cocktails and dinner program benefit during 2016 Sundance Film Festival. Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images \nThe Movies! \nThe Yellow Birds — Jennifer Aniston stars in this drama about two American soldiers ( Alden Ehrenreich and Tye Sheridan ) struggling to survive while fighting in the Iraq War. In a rare serious turn, Aniston plays Sheridan’s mom. \nAn Inconvenient Sequel — Timing really is everything. On the eve of Donald Trump ’s inauguration, former VP Al Gore will present a follow-up to his Oscar-winning climate-change documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. \nA Ghost Story — Future Best Actor Oscar nominee Casey Affleck is determined to stick to his indie roots. He stars alongside Rooney Mara in this thriller about a house and, yes, the ghost that haunts it. \nTo the Bone — Lily Collins is a teen battling anorexia; Keanu Reeves is her doctor. The familiar tale will surely have an intriguing spin, as it’s written and directed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Private Practice and UnREAL showrunner Marti Noxon . Sundance Film Festival Amanda Edwards/Getty Images \nThe Parties! \nTao's Park City pop-up, presented by Tequila Don Julio, will be open the first weekend of the festival and feature Devin Lucien , DJ Ruckus and surprise performances.

(Think models, bottles and celebs dancing on tables.) \nThe Chase Sapphire Lounge will serve as the afterparty spot for the film Yellow Birds, starring Jennifer Aniston, Tye Sheridan and Toni Collette . The lounge offers a cozy lodge vibe, complete with fireplace in the VIP area. \nCelebrity chefs such as Shawn McClain and Cat Cora will create five- to seven-course tasting menus for ChefDance, a nightly invite-only sit-down dinner at the Memorial building in Park City. Cora’s dinner on January 23 will benefit Operation Smile. \nRock & Reilly’s is usually so bustling at night, people will wait outside in subzero temperatures just to get in! This year, it’s the site of the Getaway premiere party, hosted by Kate Upton and her fiancé Justin Verlander (presented by BMW & Golf Digest Studios), as well as the J.Crew-, Vulture- and New York magazine-hosted “Person to Person” party.

PepsiCo will be hosting for Matt Bomer , Nick Offerman and Sam Elliott , and also feature a late-night party to celebrate“Give Me Future: Major Lazer in Cuba,” which is guaranteed to last into the wee hours of the morning. \nNylon magazine and Dream will host the Nylon X Dream Hollywood Apre Ski party, which will bring all the cool kids together for a rooftop bash. Past celeb attendees have included Nick and Joe Jonas . Pretty in Park City! Chloë Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale Explore Sundance in Style \nThe Events and Lounges! \nWomen power! On January 21, Chelsea Handler will lead 20,000 people down Main Street in the Women’s March on Main. The march, which supports women's rights, civil liberties and diversity, will coincide with several other women’s marches that day across the country. Handler will be joined by Jennifer Aniston, Salma Hayek, Sarah Paulson, Elizabeth Olsen and thousands of protesters. The march will begin at 9 a.m. in front of the Wasatch Brew Pub. The event will conclude with a rally hosted by Handler herself. \nThe Acura Studio will host premiere parties and dinners for movies including Fun Mom Dinner, starring Adam Scott , Paul Rudd , Molly Shannon and Toni Collette, and always features selfie-ready fans outside trying to get a picture with their favorite stars. Expect to see Jon Hamm, Paul Rudd, Geena Davis and many more speaking in the studio! \nSnack time! Those covering Sundance rarely find time to sit down for an actual meal, so Park City Live Presents: The Hub will be treating guests to a Tanqueray Gin and Juice Bar, where guests can enjoy spiked or nonspiked pressed juices as well as deconstructed grilled cheese and marinara meatballs, and even get beauty and hair touchups from top stylists while they snack! \nThe RAND Luxury Lounge at the St. Regis hotel is a celebrity favorite! Celebs and invited guests can view the most high-end goods that will be unveiled at Sundance. Featured this year will be the 360 fly camera and LightStim LED therapy products, and several other big-ticket items.
