On Thursday afternoon, Gizmodo Media Group’s corporate parent Univision asked Gizmodo Media employees, which includes Jezebel’s staff, to attend an “active shooter training” conducted by a Department of Homeland Security official named Kevin Peterson. It’s no mystery why any responsible employer would want to prepare its employees for what is unfortunately becoming an increasingly routine workplace hazard. It’s also no mystery why the Department of Homeland Security would make its staff available for such briefings.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nWhat is worth asking, though, is why DHS is using workplace trainings to promulgate false accounts about prior terror attacks and to decry “political correctness” as an impediment to workplace safety. (Of the training and employees’ reactions to it, Gizmodo Media Group CEO Raju Narisetti said, “Like everyone at [Gizmodo Media Group], I got the training email and then sign[ed] up. We were not involved in the design or content of the training itself.”)\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Kevin Peterson, the man who led the training at Gizmodo Media, is a DHS Protective Security Advisor (PSA) for the New York District. He visits companies and institutions around the city to deliver active shooter trainings. That presumably means that workplaces besides ours have been exposed to this advice, some of which can be accessed by anyone on the DHS’s website , and included the following:\nAdvertisement \n\nDon’t Be Afraid to Racially Profile Your Friends, Neighbors and Coworkers \nPeterson opened his remarks with an anecdote about the San Bernardino shooters, who you’ll recall were a married couple. He noted that a neighbor failed to call the cops on the pair before the shooting, despite seeing them in their garage doing something murky. She feared being thought of as “racist,” Peterson said.\nPeterson described this as an example of “political correctness run amok.” He encouraged us not to let a distaste for treating people differently based on their race or ethnicity prevent us from alerting the police to behavior like spending time in a garage with your spouse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:10:33.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
