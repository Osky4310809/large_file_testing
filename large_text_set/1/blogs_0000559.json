Firstly, let’s start with the similarities shared between both variants. \nUnder the bonnet, a 1.5 litre SOHC i-VTEC engine with 120 PS at 6,600 rpm and 145 Nm of torque at 4,600 rpm powers the BR-V in its two guises, with power being directed to the front wheels via an Earth Dreams CVT. \nBoth also come with a choice of five exterior body colours – Taffeta White, Golden Brown Metallic (new addition), Lunar Silver Metallic, Modern Steel Metallic and Dark Ruby Red Pearl – along with 16-inch alloy wheels (with Bridgestone Ecopia EP150 195/60 section tyres). Honda BR-V V (left), Honda BR-V E (right) \nFurther features found on the E and V include aluminium roof rails (30 kg load limit), halogen projector headlamps, LED DRLs, 60:40 split-folding second-row seats with sliding, reclining and one-touch tumble, and 50:50 split-folding third-row seats. \nSafety-wise, all BR-V variants come with dual front airbags, three-point seatbelts for all seven seats, Isofix child seat mounts in the second row, Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), ABS, EBD, Hill Start Assist (HSA), reverse sensors. As a result, the BR-V has been awarded a five-star ASEAN NCAP safety rating. \nSimilarities done with, let’s move on to the differences, and we start at the BR-V’s front end, where you’ll notice that the E does not come with fog lamps, but these are present on the V (with chrome surrounds). Looking a little lower, the V also gets a silver-finished skid plate that is different from the E’s body-coloured design. \nDown the sides, the V comes with more chrome bits than the E, which can be found on the door handles as well as the lower section of the doors. As for the rear, once again, a silver-finished skid plate is exclusive to the V. The tailgate on the E gets a mechanical locking mechanism instead of the V’s electrical one, another thing to note. Honda BR-V V (left), Honda BR-V E (right) \nIf you’re looking for some Modulo goodies to go along with your BR-V purchase, a body kit is available for RM3,750, which adds on front and rear lower bumper garnishing, side skirts and a tailgate spoiler (pictured below). \nThe disparities continue as you step into the cabins of both BR-Vs, with the V having leather upholstery (seat and door armrest), whereas its fabric (seats only) in the E. While the main dashboard is done up in plastic, the area just above the glove box in the E gets a shiny dark metallic trim piece, while its a water print matte look on the V. \nFrom the driver’s seat, keyless operation is exclusive to the V, as are the leather steering wheel (with multimedia controls) and gear shift boot. Buyers of the E will instead have to turn an ignition key and interact with a urethane steering wheel and gear shift knob instead. \nA more obvious item here is the head unit, where the E gets a standard audio system with Bluetooth, AUX and USB inputs and four speakers. The V meanwhile, gets a 6.1-inch touchscreen display audio system that has the same inputs and speaker count as the E’s unit, but tags on HDMI too. The screen also acts as a display for the V-only rearview camera. Honda BR-V V (left), Honda BR-V E (right) \nJust below the head unit, the air-con controls may look pretty much identical upon first inspection, but only the V has an automated system (see that Auto A/C button on the right?), with the E having a manual one instead. \nRear passengers can also get some cool air via ceiling-mounted vents in the second row, which are ducted through the B-pillars and have a manual fan speed adjuster. Other minor bits include seatback pockets (V only) and an assistant vanity mirror. \nNow that you know the detailed differences between both BR-V variants, hopefully it will help you in making an informed purchase.
