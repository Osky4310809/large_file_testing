This is exactly what “a good night’s sleep” entails. Advertisement \nIn the most recent issue of the journal Sleep Health , the National Sleep Foundation explained exactly what getting a good night’s sleep means when it comes to scientific studies. The four factors, as explained by Cari Romm at Science of Us , are: You take half an hour or less to fall asleep. You wake up no more than once per night. If you do wake up in the middle of the night, you fall back asleep within 20 minutes.
