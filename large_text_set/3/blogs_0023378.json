While the casualties were far lower in Wednesday’s attack outside of Parliament, the feeling is real and you don’t have to look much further than James Corden on The Late Late Show . \nThe host responded to the attacks with an emotional statement showing the impact that an attack like London’s can have when you’re several time zones away. It adds to the powerless feeling you already have and Corden did his best to capture that at the start of his show: \nWatching the news today, I felt a really long, long way from home. When something like that happens in your hometown, you don’t have a feeling of being glad that you’re so far away, what you feel is that you wish you could be there with loved ones to stand alongside them.”\n\nOf course, he adds that this kind of attack won’t be able to splinter the people of London, echoing something we’ve heard time and time again following a shocking attack:\n“If this act of terrorism was supposed to divide the people of London, I know for a fact that all something like this does is bring them closer together as one.”\nIn this age of late show hosts having to address tragedy on an almost regular basis, Corden has shown he’s able to balance a need to have fun and get very real when the times calls for it . It’s a nice thing to have around when there are so many fresh faces replacing folks on television. \n(Via Late Late Show )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T07:02:52.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
