But concerned fans quickly commented underneath her latest photo upload, warning her she’s starting to look like a ‘fish’ thanks to her trout pout, with some even saying she’s looking like the late Pete Burns, who famously underwent a number of lip filler surgeries.\nThe black and white photo shows Charlotte posing for the camera whilst sat in a restaurant – but it’s her huge lips which steal the show.\nCoupled with her new nose, which she treated herself to last year, as well as a pair of icy blue contact lenses, it’s a striking difference to the Charlotte we were introduced to back in 2011 when she found fame on Geordie Shore.\nAnd fans who have followed her rise to fame aired their concerns underneath her latest pic, with one writing, ‘Wtf [what the fuck] happened to your lips that looks terrible,’ while another simply wrote: ‘Ewwww her lips’.\n&&&&& To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nOther comments read: ‘God please stop ruining your face!!!’, ‘What did you do to your lips’, and ‘WTF. You look so unnatural’.\nAnother post simply said: ‘Pete Burns’.\nThis photo, which Charlotte captioned with emojis, isn’t the only snap to spark fears amongst her devotees that she’s undergoing too much surgery, with a number of recent snaps she has posted getting a similar reaction.\n\nA post shared by Charlotte Letitia Crosby (@charlottegshore) on Mar 16, 2017 at 6:37pm PDT \nWet hair & tequila \nA post shared by Charlotte Letitia Crosby (@charlottegshore) on Mar 18, 2017 at 8:28am PDT \nA Snapchat video from last week was particularly worrying to some viewers, with the footage showing off very plump lips, and many fans took to Twitter to vent their worry for the 26-year-old TV star.\nI'm all for cosmetic surgery but honestly charlotte crosby looks like she can't bloody control her lips anymore it's ridic\n— quavo (@summerfoz) March 20, 2017 \nCharlotte Crosby's lips \n— meg_ (@meganjaneeex) March 20, 2017 \nWhat the fuck has Charlotte Crosby done to her lips 🤢\n— Olivia (@livbristt) March 20, 2017 \nSearch up Charlotte Crosby without plump lips and blue contacts she's almost unrecognisable \n— Gossip Queen (@GossipQ46821546) March 17, 2017 \nWtf is Charlotte Crosby doing to her face.

But I feel great. Surgery has made me feel so much more confident.\n‘I can see why people become addicted because, when I has my nose done, something that looked awful then looked amazing in a matter of three hours, but it’d only be addictive if you hated so much about yourself, you wanted to change everything – luckily I only hated my nose.’\nMore: Showbiz Super-excited Nadine Coyle reaches out to Cheryl over baby news \nCat Deeley goes on epic Twitter rant against 'disgusting' LA restaurant \nMel B files for divorce from Stephen Belafonte after 10 years of marriage – and doesn’t want to pay him \nAnd she didn’t rule out getting more surgery done, adding: ‘Maybe when I’m 53 I might have a face-lift if it starts to sag loads. Or maybe I’ll get a designer vagina when I’m in my 30s! Lots of people get it done when they have a baby.’\nAnd in January this year, she posted a Snapchat video showing her having her eyebrows tattooed on.\nIn the short clip, Crosby says to the camera: ‘I’ve just had my eyebrows drawn in and we’re about to start tattooing.’\nMORE: Stephen Bear is desperate to get Charlotte Crosby pregnant as he reveals name for baby \nMORE: Charlotte Crosby claims Stephen Bear is ‘the one’, pointing to Vicky Pattison’s romance ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T10:26:52.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
