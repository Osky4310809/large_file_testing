You get strength through a­dversity. And we have worked hard with sports psychiatrists and the like to create that ­identity. \n“We have got in Gareth someone who wants to do the same with the senior men’s team and I am r­eally ­confident we will have that. \n“What we have is a bit of a void. If you ask an England men’s player, 'What medal would you really want to have?’ It’s a World Cup winners’ medal. Undoubtedly. There is a not a lack of passion or desire.

So the England women’s team is one of the best in terms of team spirit I have seen and we will get there with the men. \n\"With ­Gareth, he ­absolutely gets it.” \nHead of Women’s ­football, Baroness Sue Campbell, aims to have competitive ­England teams across all age ­levels and ­revealed the FA will target “eight key priority areas”. Part of Southgate's brief is to improve the team spirit within the male squad (Photo: Getty) \nThey include “a ­sustainable high performance system to produce world-class players”, “changing ­perceptions and social barriers” and ­enhancing the profile of the women’s team. \nArsenal and England ­defender Alex Scott revealed she worked in the laundry of the Gunners’ men’s team to earn the money to make her way in the game. \nShe said: “It’s not been easy to get where we have. \n\"That’s what always kept us as a close group, to achieve ­something together. It’s not about ‘me’. It’s about all of us. You had Casey Stoney ­coming out and announcing she was gay, instead of hiding it. You had me come from a council estate in east London.

In meeting rooms, there’s been tears because of the ­struggles we’ve been through. We’ve always wanted this. \n“I can laugh that I worked in Arsenal men’s laundry with Vic Akers because I needed some extra money to go to my ­training ­sessions. I’m proud of it. I had to do it to ­become a footballer. \n“We have to keep that culture, keep passing on those messages, show what was fought to get to our position — and not take it for granted.” poll loading Do you agree the England women show more team spirit than the men? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:00:22.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
