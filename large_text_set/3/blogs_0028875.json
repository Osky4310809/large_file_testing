Check out the latest deals here . Chelsea face fight to keep Hazard \nOnly a couple of days ago , it was reported that Chelsea were preparing to offer Eden Hazard a lavish new contract in order to stave off the attentions of Real Madrid. \nNow, according to the Mirror , they are resigned to \"a summer-long battle\" to keep the Belgium international. \nIt says Real believe Hazard is keen to work with head coach Zinedine Zidane -- and the attacking midfielder \"is understood to be learning Spanish.\" \nChelsea \"are refusing to comment publicly on claims they promised the 26-year-old to consider any offer from the Bernabeu\" for him, the Mirror adds. \nDespite being interested in bringing Madrid striker Alvaro Morata to Stamford Bridge, the Londoners \"are determined not to enter into any talks\" that might involve Hazard leaving as part of a deal. \nMeanwhile, the Telegraph reports that Chelsea \"have moved into pole position in the race for Southampton centre-half Virgil van Dijk \" with the Saints pondering a move for Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho -- impressing on loan at Crystal Palace -- as a replacement. \nNetherlands international Van Dijk is thought likely to cost around £50 million, with the Telegraph saying Southampton \"will want more than the £47.5m Manchester City paid Everton for John Stones.\" \nIt adds that City could yet rival the Premier League leaders for Van Dijk, \"but at this stage Chelsea are leading the chase.\" MIRROR SPORT: Hazard gets deal #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/xnOHaz3ldG - Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) March 27, 2017 Is keeper Patricio in Gunners' sights? \nPlenty has been written in recent weeks about what Arsenal might do in the summer, with some suggesting an overhaul in every department of the team is on the cards. \nRecent reports have suggested Stoke's Jack Butland could be the incoming goalkeeper -- but now the Sun has thrown a new name into the frame. \nCiting reports in France, it says the Gunners \"are lining up Sporting Lisbon and Portugal stopper Rui Patricio , who would cost in the region of £13m. \nPatricio, 29, had been linked with a move to Watford but was reported to have decided that a switch to Vicarage Road was not for him. Everton home in on Orlando's Larin \nRomelu Lukaku's decision not to sign a new contract at Everton means boss Ronald Koeman will be looking far and wide for attacking reinforcements. \nEarlier this month , Koeman was linked with a £50m double move for Cedric Bakambu of Villarreal and Real Sociedad's Willian Jose . \nNow, according to the Sun , he is turning his attention to Orlando City forward Cyle Larin , who would cost about £2m. \nIt reports that Canada international Larin, 21, \"has been tracked by Goodison Park scouts during two prolific seasons in MLS\" and has \"established himself under the management of ex-Everton striker Adrian Heath.\" A Cyle Larin brace gave Orlando City their second-straight win to start the 2017 season, edging a stingy Union side. Tap-ins \n- Manchester United are interested in bringing teenage American midfielder Will Vint to Old Trafford, the Mail reports. \nIt says the 15-year-old, the son of Everton academy director Peter Vint, impressed coaches on a visit to the United's academy facilities. \nHe has also had trials at both Everton and Championship club Fulham. \n- Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce was very keen to bring in Manchester United goalkeeper Sam Johnstone on loan earlier this season -- and now he wants the move to be made permanent, according to the Telegraph . \nBruce, it reports, \"has opened talks with United\" after Johnstone produced a succession of impressive performances. \n- ESPN's Julie Stewart-Binks reports that Luis Gil is on the verge of a return to the MLS. Currently playing for Queretaro, the 23-year-old has linked with a move to Orlando City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:45:20.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
