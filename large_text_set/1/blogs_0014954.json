Thank heavens, then, for the wide library of Netflix, which is here to service all of our laughter needs. Craving a traditional laugh-tracked sitcom? A more serious, single-cam series? A mockumentary? Done, done, and done. It’s all there at the click of a mouse (or tap of a phone screen). \nOf course, it’s impossible to definitively declare the following offerings the “best” or “funniest” without argument; there’s sure to be plenty of it. But that’s the beauty of Netflix: If you don’t like what you see, you can always proceed to the next screen. So here are the 15 funniest shows on Netflix streaming right now. \n15.
