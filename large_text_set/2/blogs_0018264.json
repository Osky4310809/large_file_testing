A leaked image has surfaced online which shows the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus side-by-side and reiterates what we’ve heard so many times in the past, that the Galaxy S8 will have a 5.8-inch display and its bigger sibling will tout a massive 6.2-inch display. We can also see the soft Home button in this image. \nIt has been reported time and again that Samsung is going to ditch the Home button for the Galaxy S8. Photos leaked recently show that it’s going to have soft buttons instead . Even though it’s going to be a software-based button it will offer similar functionality compared to a physical Home button so that there’s not much of a learning curve for users. \nThe button will be a part of Always On Display on the Galaxy S8 so it will always remain available. That’s kind of a big deal. We hear that pressing down on it with a bit of pressure is going to wake up the display and that even double tapping the software button is going to launch the camera app much like double pressing the Home button does the same on the Galaxy S7 and other Samsung handsets. \nThis is obviously going to reduce the learning curve for users who will be picking up a device without a physical Home button for the very first time. It’s small things like this which will make it easier for them to adjust.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:10:18.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
