Instead of coming back to London full of confidence after a big away victory, the inability to win on the road at one of the traditional big teams simply reinforced doubts and certainly had an effect on a team whose mentality has often been far too fragile. \nThey drew their next game with Stoke, then lost at home to Chelsea. From a position where they could stamp their authority on a title challenge, they stumbled. Although they beat Leicester at home to breathe some life into things again, winning just two of the eight games they played after that draw at Liverpool put paid to their chances of winning the league. \nIt might be hypothetical, but how different might it have been if they had won that game? If they hadn't, in typical Arsenal style, shot themselves in the foot and dented their own confidence. \nWe'll never know, but Arsene Wenger's side face an equally important task at Liverpool on Saturday, even if their title chances are as remote as the Pitcairn Islands. Chelsea are the runaway leaders and overwhelming favourites, but Arsenal have to show they're capable of at least putting up a fight. \nOf course, much of the focus is on the Frenchman and in large part his future depends entirely on results. With big games against Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham still to come, the record against the big teams and rivals for the top four comes into sharp focus. \nThey'll be facing a Liverpool side who will be stinging from a 3-1 defeat to rejuvenated Leicester last Monday, and one which itself needs to show some mettle. They've won just twice in their last 12 games, a run of form which, ordinarily, might lend confidence to the opposition, but runs like that have to come to an end at some point. \nGiven that Arsenal are the masters of providing a boost to the teams they face, they may well be the perfect opponent for Jurgen Klopp and his men. Especially when you simply don't know what kind of Arsenal will turn up on the day. A 3-3 draw at Anfield derailed Arsenal's title bid last season. \nTheir form has been stuttering since beating Southampton so convincingly in the FA Cup in January, and the defeats to Bayern Munich and Chelsea have been particularly demoralising. On days when a good performance and result might answer questions about their quality, they simply end up raising more. \nThe record in away games against big opposition is something Wenger admits his team need to address. \n\"Our recent history being negative doesn't help but we have to be strong enough to deal with that,\" he said at his news conference on Thursday . \nHis team selection will be interesting. Although Mesut Ozil is undoubtedly one of the stars of the team, his recent form has been patchy and his contribution away from home has been questioned in the past. Given that he was off training due to illness this week, it might spark Wenger into a rethink in terms of his team's set-up. \nWithout him, he might play a more traditional three in midfield, or recall the fit again Aaron Ramsey to play in that role, while Danny Welbeck and Lucas Perez will be itching to show what they can do. Fresh legs might well be a factor against a team who like to press the way Liverpool do, and both those Arsenal forwards have played so little this season they far from running on empty. \nAbove all else, the players need to stand up and take some responsibility too. Most of the criticism has been directed towards a manager who is under intense pressure, but that doesn't mean they exempt from their part in the poor results. \nThey've been far from their best in recent weeks, and it's time they showed they have what it takes to win at a big team away from home. \nAndrew Mangan is one of ESPN FC's Arsenal bloggers.
