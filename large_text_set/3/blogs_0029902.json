USA TODAY Sports Like his father Al did in 1982, Raiders owner Mark Davis is leaving Oakland after 22 years. (Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports) 1   \nPHOENIX — Mark Davis insists that he has no fear. \nShortly after NFL owners formally approved another franchise relocation Monday — the third in 14 months — sending Davis' Oakland Raiders to Sin City, he was reminded about the backlash brewing back home. \nOn top of intense debate over whether fans will pay to see a team with one foot out the door, Davis’ home address has been plastered all over the Internet. It makes me wonder whether the needs to beef up his personal security. \n“No concern,” the Raiders owner told USA TODAY Sports as he hustled to the next meeting. “That’s part of life.” \nDavis pretty much had to make this move in one sense, given the landscape for the business of the NFL and the frustrating but fruitless years of trying to strike a deal to remain in Oakland. Davis expects that in the coming days, he will publicly detail his reasons for the move to the die-hards in Oakland. \nGood luck with that. Why Dolphins owner Stephen Ross voted against Raiders' move to Las Vegas \nRegardless of how he explains it, it will be tough to convince some fans in the Bay Area that he could not have held out longer. They are hot, bothered and angry, the latest group of jilted fans whose team is moving away for greener (as in money) pastures. \nRonnie Lott, the Hall of Famer who is part of an investment group that fell short in striking a stay-at-home deal, told USA TODAY Sports last week: “It’s going to get ugly. In San Diego, they were upset to lose the Chargers. People in Oakland will be mad.” \nYet the Raiders, whose $1.9 billion domed stadium in Las Vegas isn’t projected to be ready until 2020, will be staying in Oakland a little longer. The team has annual leases that extend through the 2018 season, and Davis said that getting another for 2019 is also possible. \nWhat a long, lame-duck window that surely some might view as a slap in the face to Oakland. Just move, baby? Not so fast. \n“If fans would like us to stay there, we’d love to be there for that,” Davis said in reference to the upcoming seasons. “I’d like to bring a championship back to Oakland.” \nLike a farewell gift? This will be so awkward, and just when the Raiders have been rebuilt into a viable Super Bowl contender after more than a decade of futility. \nConsider how the Chargers responded after deciding to join the Rams as the second team in Los Angeles. They will play for two years at a temporary home at the StubHub Center in Carson, Calif., rather than remain in San Diego while their new stadium is built. Apparently, owner Dean Spanos realized it would have only increased the strain — and probably drained ticket sales, too — to stay any longer in San Diego. \nThe Rams, likewise, knew it wasn’t an option to stay in St. Louis after striking their L.A. deal. \nWhat makes the Raiders different? As one NFL owner told me Monday: “It can work for them where it wouldn’t work for others. The Raiders have such a unique fan base.” \nThey undoubtedly are one of the NFL’s most passionate national draws. I’d put the Raiders in a group with the Dallas Cowboys, Pittsburgh Steelers, New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers when it comes to taking over a visiting stadium. The term “Raider Nation” comes with much substance. \nOne reason the franchise will succeed in Las Vegas, as Davis has suggested, is because of its proximity to California, where Raiders fans are ubiquitous. \n“A lot of people we know are down with the move,” said Raul Jaramillo, a Los Angeles native currently residing in Phoenix, who was among a small group of Raiders fans who showed up at the swanky resort where NFL owners are meeting this week. \n“It’s closer for us.” \nJaramillo was living in L.A. when the Raiders moved back to Oakland in 1995, so he understands the bitterness and anger. He said he wouldn’t wear the “Las Vegas Raiders” T-shirt he sported Monday in Oakland, because it would be a slap in the face to fans there. \nHowever we’re going to see just how loyal the Oakland base of Raider Nation will be. In the meantime, the Raiders have the weirdness looming of at least two more years in Oaktown — possibly three if they don't spend 2019 in San Diego, sharing the 49ers' stadium in Santa Clara or going to Vegas early. \nAs Jamarillo put it, “It’s like divorcing your wife and she lives with you for two years while dating someone else.” \n*** \nFollow NFL columnist Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell \nPHOTOS: Remembering the Oakland Raiders Facebook Posted!

Founded in 1960, the Raiders have spent 44 of their 57 seasons in Oakland and have historically been one of the NFL's most popular and successful franchises. Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports Al Davis quickly became synonymous with the Raiders. He was hired as their coach in 1963 and led them to their first winning season that year. Davis would later he would become the team's GM before ascending to principal owner. Ben Margot, AP The Raiders were crowned AFL champions following the 1967 season but went on to lose Super Bowl II to the Green Bay Packers 33-14. AP The Raiders enjoyed their heyday under coach John Madden, who led the team to a 112-39-7 record from 1969-78. Madden won one Super Bowl and took Oakland to the playoffs eight times during his 10-year tenure. AP The Raiders' 32-14 victory in Super Bowl XI brought them their first title. Their intimidating style and talent proved far too much for the overmatched Minnesota Vikings. AP With four catches for 79 yards, Raiders WR and eventual Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff, left, was named MVP of Super Bowl XI. AP Hall of Famer Kenny Stabler quarterbacked the Raiders for most of the 1970s, including the 1976 title team, which went 13-1 and is considered one of the greatest teams in NFL history. Anonymous, AP Stabler was involved in most of the Raiders' most memorable games, including the \"Sea Of Hands\" (pictured here). He also played in \"The Immaculate Reception,\" \"Ghost to The Post,\" and \"Holy Roller\" games. AP The Raiders won their second title after the 1980 season, beating Ron Jaworski (7) and the Philadelphia Eagles 27-10 in Super Bowl XV. Oakland became the first wild-card team to win a championship. AP Fullscreen Amid one of his many legal scraps with the NFL, Davis moved the Raiders to Los Angeles after the 1981 season. The team won Super Bowl XVIII as the L.A. Raiders. But Davis eventually returned to Oakland, bringing his club back home in 1995. Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen The Raiders struggled after returning to the East Bay, failing to post a winning record or reach the playoffs from 1995-99. But coach Jon Gruden revitalized them with his forceful personality and offensive acumen. He took Oakland to the AFC Championship Game following the 2000 season and to the divisional round the following year. Jack Gruder, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen The 2001 Raiders seemed to have a good shot at winning the Super Bowl. However they were waylaid by the New England Patriots in the infamous \"Tuck Rule\" game, one instance were Davis fed into his conspiracy theories about the NFL being out to get his team. Matt Campbell, AFP Fullscreen League MVP Rich Gannon led the Raiders to their most recent Super Bowl after the 2002 season. But they flopped in Super Bowl XXXVII, getting blown out by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Gruden, who was traded to the Bucs after the 2001 season. Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports The Raiders fell on hard times following Super Bowl XXXVII, missing the playoffs for the next 13 seasons. The low point came in 2011 when Davis died at age 82. A flame at the Oakland Coliseum keeps his memory alive. Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports Through thick and thin, the Raiders have always been backed by a legion of zealous and loyal fans, many of the most creative packing themselves into The Coliseum's infamous \"Black Hole.\" Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports Certain themes in the fans' attire have not changed through the years ... Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports ... though new generations may add their own spin to costuming. Eric Christian Smith, AP The Raiders' trip to Mexico City in 2016 validated that they remain a strong brand internationally. Erich Schlegel, USA TODAY Sports And from a personnel standpoint, with young stars like DE Khail Mack (52) and QB Derek Carr, who helped lead the Raiders back to the playoffs in 2016, this franchise is poised to be a contender for some time. Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports But the Raiders' history and new owner Mark Davis' stay in Oakland is coming to an end after the NFL paved the way for the team's relocation to Las Vegas on March 27.
