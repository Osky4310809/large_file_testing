That’s not weird, right?\nHow can it be when LEGO Batman not only seems like it’s going to be a ridiculously fun take on the eponymous DC hero, but it also features an amazing female hero in Barbara Gordon, A.K.A. Batgirl? Ain’t nothing weird about being excited to watch Batgirl not only kick some ass, but also not take Batman seriously and put him in his place!\nIn the above trailer, we get to watch Barbara (voiced by Rosario Dawson) in action both as Gotham’s top cop and as Batgirl, which is pretty sweet. As Gotham’s new police commissioner (So, what happened to Jim Gordon? We do get a glimpse of him in this second “Team” trailer… ), Barbara expresses her desire to join forces with Batman, making explicit the police/superhero partnership that has always made Gotham run, and that Gotham desperately needs. It’ll be cool to see her not only be extremely good at her job as commissioner, but also at cleaning up the streets as Batgirl.\nMy only concern is that I hope she doesn’t fall to Trinity Syndrome the way that Wyldstyle did in The LEGO Movie (or, uh, Trinity did in The Matrix ). You know, the super-awesome badass chick who’s good at everything…until the script requires her to suddenly become incompetent or unintelligent so that the male hero can shine? Yeah, that thing. I hope that they actually DO team up and that it’s an equal partnership. And when LEGO Batman inevitably saves the day (it is The LEGO Batman Movie , after all), that it doesn’t happen at the expense of Barbara’s character development.\nThe best part, though, is the fact that despite wanting to team up with Batman, she has zero patience for his nonsense. My favorite line in this trailer? “If you call me Batgirl, can I call you Batboy?” (Batman’s response is priceless)\nOK, no, my absolute favorite line, that I’ve seen in a couple of trailers so far is when Robin asks Batman why he built the Batplane with only one seat, and Batman says, “Because last I checked, I only had one butt.” Because BATMAN WORKS ALONE. LEGO Batman is straight-up becoming my definitive Batman, I’m not gonna lie.\nAre you living for The LEGO Batman Movie as much as I am?\n(via Nerdist , featured image via screencap)\nWant more stories like this?
