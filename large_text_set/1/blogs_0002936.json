What’s the answer?” \nHorowitz finally conceded that he didn’t know the number, but nevertheless maintained that bans on such firearms, more stringent background checks nationwide and stronger federal laws against gun trafficking would significantly reduce the murder rate in places like Chicago, in the process tacitly admitting that his gun control laws would target law-abiding gun owners instead of the criminals who already don’t obey the laws already on the books. \nPerhaps toying with him a bit, Carlson then asked Horowitz to define a “military-style assault weapon,” noting later that his description closely matched Carlson’s .30-06 deer-hunting rifle. \nWhen Horowitz responded by talking about “thumbhole stocks” and “detachable magazines,” Carlson could barely suppress a laugh as he said, “Who cares what the stock is like? This suggests you don’t know much about guns to me.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:58:42.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
