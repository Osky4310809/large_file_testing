Images courtesy the Kolly Gallery From crisp floral patterns to chalky, abstract paint streaks and hieroglyphic styled animal illustrations, French artist Supakitch applies a unique street art style to original paintings inspired by Asian and indigenous-Indian art. This fusion of styles is at the core of each canvas in On My Wave Home , his new solo exhibition at Kolly Gallery in Zurich. Raised on manga and hip-hop, Supakitch sticks to a fairly consistent color palette of indigo blue, gold, white, and black. His canvases vary in size and are made from a combination of materials like resin, fiberglass, pigment, and acrylics.“It’s basically layers of fiberglass cloth, polyester resin with pigments, acrylic paint with gold leaves, gold flakes or/and gold glitter,\" Supakitch tells The Creators Project. \"For this technique, my first inspiration was the surfboard as an object. I was fascinated by the texture of the resin. The depth in the texture and the color have this hypnotizing effect on my eyes. The fact that it looks wet when it’s not and the randomness of the resin tinted swirl is fascinating.\" SUPAKITCH, Overseas, Resin, Fiberglass, Pigment, Canvas, Acrylic, 60 x 120 cm, 2017 As a youth, Supakitch took to the streets to satisfy a burning desire to make art. He first started writing graffiti back in 1990. At the age of 21, he started working as an art director for several brand advertising agencies. It was during this time he met his wife, Koralie, a fellow street artist who encouraged him to move his work from the streets and into the gallery space. Supakitch hosted some of his first exhibitions during the early 2000s and has had work in and out of galleries around the world ever since. In addition to paintings, On My Wave Home exhibition also features a couple of novelty surfboards that the artist has embellished with his signature graphics, as well as a series of works that incorporate multiple techniques like brushwork, collage, and silkscreening. SUPAKITCH, On My Wave Home, Resin, Fiberglass, Pigment, Canvas, Acrylic, 105 x 115 cm, 2017 On My Wave Home runs from January 19 - February 18, 2017 at Kolly Gallery.
