She was keen to explore the history of Shetland ponies and how they live in the wild.\n\"I took Albert and Ernie on a boat out to a remote island where a wild herd runs free, so that Albert and Ernie could meet some ponies their own size and I could learn more about them,\" says Massingale.\nImage: Emma Massingale/SWNS.COM\nThe ponies' boat trip mirrored the historic way Shetland ponies were moved from one island to another by boat. The ponies travelled via motorboat to the islands northeast of mainland Scotland. But, it wasn't easy. They had to battle high winds and large pods of orca.\nMassingale and the ponies had practiced boating on a local lake beforehand to see what they made of travelling by boat.\nImage: Emma Massingale/SWNS.COM\n\"The first time we tried, Albert got his front feet on the boat but left his back feet off, but they were really good by the end. Ernie had a little look but then hopped straight on.\"\nImage: Emma Massingale/SWNS.COM\nDuring the adventure, Massingale and the ponies tried out some of the old traditions that their ancestors would have been involved in. She, flanked by her ponies, collected peat, made fishing lines to catch dinner and learned about the role of Shetlands in crofting, a form of farming.\nNow, that's a beautiful tail of adventure.\nBONUS: This transparent bowl swing is what cat dreams are made of", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0KM6ysBX6NFANU9j9j_G_jZFv90=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F389615%2F8dbf3642-3e75-42e7-9ea3-706425cd7684.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5GDzVrTbvjZR-z3NcPYEjcC_N6k=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F389613%2Fd4dbca1d-f8aa-4a95-953b-87f083a167b2.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/BeII2Zv1.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PVXM9-jVm0pWQ3S7b5BZkFm-4RI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F389613%2Fd4dbca1d-f8aa-4a95-953b-87f083a167b2.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hly6Z49AZ9IsfF3E1ky2XKpQ5lk=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F389655%2F4f27caa2-3899-47af-9e3a-14018338bfc5.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/BeII2Zv1.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mm5ki6ZH0AUVgKGx2OrZkIHUonQ=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F389655%2F4f27caa2-3899-47af-9e3a-14018338bfc5.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/46hrnHgu03AT2V4MSBeHbUpxGT8=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F389661%2F95d96dc9-0d99-44d8-973c-67e29f7e8d76.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9ytkYeCB_p4rjos_sfJZJ3B5YA4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F389615%2F8dbf3642-3e75-42e7-9ea3-706425cd7684.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IVOmIX1mVJqZEfq7UvIEju_WEmM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F389661%2F95d96dc9-0d99-44d8-973c-67e29f7e8d76.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-21T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:13:22.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
