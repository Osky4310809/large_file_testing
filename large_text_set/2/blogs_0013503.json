He’s a 8 week old, cute as a button, puppy who might be missing his two front legs, but he definitely makes up for it with spirit. This bundle of energy and smiles had a rough start to life, but things are looking up. 2 Craig Robertson \nCupid was found in a dumpster in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, tied up in a garbage bag and just left there. Whoever found him, anonymously dropped him off at a vet office, who then reached out to several shelters to see if they could help him out. \nThe first few declared him ‘un-adoptable’ and refused to take him. Then Joan Znidarec, president and co-founder of The Dog Rescuers Inc , got involved. She took him in. \nNow, I don’t know what kind of asshole decides to throw away a dog because he’s missing legs, but they should be banned from owning animals and I wouldn’t argue to perhaps them getting some justice served. No animal deserves to get tossed. Period. 3 Twitter/StevensGlobal \nAfter Cupid got checked over by the vet, they determined that the missing legs were a birth defect, but that he was also missing a part of his tail. That was not a defect; it was done intentionally. As they suspect he might be a Great Pyrenees, he’s supposed to have a big, sweeping, fluffy tail. Now, because of some douche, he’s never going to. Not that it’s going to stop Cupid from being awesome. \nOnce they knew that Cupid had no other hidden issues, Znidarec decided to name him Cupid because of his heart-shaped nose and she made it permission to find a way to get him mobile. 4 GIF \nNot that he had any trouble moving around. He already knew how to get himself to where he wanted to go. \nFucking legend, this dog. Nothing stops him. 5 Global News \nZnidarec reached out to a company called PawsAbility , and its founder Janice Olynich, who’s a certified animal prosthetist, to see if they could get this little guy some prosthetic legs. \nWhile she has yet to fit a dog with a bilateral loss, she’s up to the challenge of getting Cupid the best opportunity to be a normal dog.
