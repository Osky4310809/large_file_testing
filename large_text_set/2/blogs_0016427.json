It was a stunning performance and a potential coming of age for Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. Guardiola is right: Radamel Falcao is a killer Falcao only managed five goals in his two seasons in England ( Getty ) \nPep Guardiola was emphatic in his praise of Radamel Falcao ahead of the Colombian's return to Manchester. “In the box, Falcao is a killer,” Guardiola said in his pre-match press conference. “He is a good professional, a nice guy and I am happy he is back at his level scoring goals.\" \nGuardiola went on to describe how Monaco’s Leicester City-esque 4-4-2 formation suited Falcao to a tee, because “they attack inside and cross a lot – it’s perfect for him.” \nHow right he was. Falcao proved a constant handful for Manchester City, with Monaco's highly impressive wingers repeatedly swinging in crosses for their front-man at every opportunity. \nHis first-half goal was superb and evidenced everything Falcao lacked during his two seasons in the Premier League: hunger, confidence, composure. Forcing himself in between City's defensive pairing of Stones and Otamendi, Falcao threw himself onto Fabinho's cross and powered his header past a hapless Willy Caballero. It was Falcao's 14th goal in 15 games and one of his most important. \nHe would go on to miss a penalty at the start of the second-half but made almost instant amends, putting Monaco 3-2 up with a sublime chip over Caballero. He was superb and desperately unlucky to find himself on the losing side. Leroy Sane is fast becoming one of City's most influential players Sane was superb playing on the left-wing ( Getty ) \nThis wasn't meant to be Leroy Sane's season. Signed from Schalke 04 for an eye-watering £37m, Guardiola repeatedly insisted that – despite his high price – Sane was a signing for the future, a player who shouldn't expect too much from his first season in the Premier League. \nBut such is Sane's quality, that Guardiola is finding it difficult to leave him out of his starting XI. He played an essential part in City's opening goal: dancing around two defenders, he exchanged cute passes with Silva before firing the ball into the path of Raheem Sterling for a simple tap-in, and was always lively down the wing. He was then on hand to score City's vital fifth, which could well decide this tie. \nSterling also deserves much credit for a similarly exuberant performance down the right. On a night when City's defence toiled and their midfield was frequently overrun, they have their wingers – not to mention two goals from Sergio Aguero – to thank for winning them this tie. Fabinho is more than ready for a move to the Premier League Brazilian defender Fabinho has excelled for Monaco this season (AFP/ Getty Images) \n“The Premier League is a league that interests me and maybe one day I will come and play here,” Fabinho said with a smile and a wink ahead of this evening’s Champions League match, firmly placing himself in the shop window ahead of the summer transfer window. \nThe 23-year-old is wanted by both Manchester United and City – and it’s not hard to see why. He assisted both of Monaco's first-half goals and was a nuisance throughout, controlling the tempo from the middle of the park and repeatedly breaking down the right-hand side. \nOther supposed Premier League targets also impressed. Kylian Mbappé was lively playing just off Falcao and his confident strike which gave Monaco the lead was remarkable for an 18-year-old. \n21-year-old Thomas Lemar was similarly impressive, causing plenty of problems in the midfield. City need a new goalkeeper. And fast... Caballero struggled against Monaco ( Getty ) \nWilly Caballero deserves an awful lot of credit for saving Radamel Falcao's second-half penalty, which went on to inspire City's remarkable comeback. \nBut his performance was still lacking, especially at this level. He does not inspire confidence among City's back-line and is not a sufficient upgrade on the error-prone Claudio Bravo. \nIt is ultimately no surprise that City will not renew his contract at the end of the season. \nHis worst moment came in the first-half, as he attempted an ambitious pass to Fernandinho out on the left. But he failed to get enough power on the diagonal, with Fabinho gratefully intercepting before swinging in an inch-perfect pass to an onrushing Falcao. \nCaballero had no chance in keeping the subsequent header out, but the Colombian should never have been presented with the chance in the first-place.
