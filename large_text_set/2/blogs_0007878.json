CCTV footage showed Mr Zimmerman being approached from behind (Photo: PA) Mire then left his victim in a pool of blood The rampage continued after Mire tapped out with an Oyster card and went up to street level \nMire went on to lunge at other passengers with the rusty blade while shouting he was attacking people for \"my Syrian brothers\". \nMr Zimmerman said he was \"fortunate\" to have received prompt first aid treatment at the scene from a passing junior doctor. \nIn a statement read during Mire's sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey in London, he said he was \"quite lucky\" to have survived. \n\"I have been left with a scar on my neck which I am aware of only because it pulls when I use my voice but is otherwise superficial and healing well,\" he said. \nMr Zimmerman suffered from \"flashing lights\" in his vision for months after the attack. Mire was convicted at the Old Bailey last month (Photo: Metropolitan Police) Muhiddin Mire knifed Lyle Zimmerman after following him off a train \n\"I am somewhat more cautious about interacting with strangers since the attack - overall I have not been significantly traumatised by the attack psychologically,\" he added. \nProsecutor Jonathan Rees QC praised him for his \"philosophical view\" of his injuries. \nHe also commended a number of passers-by who intervened in the attack. \n\"There were a number of individuals who behaved with conspicuous bravery. Mr Zimmerman said he still suffers from his neck injuries \nDr Shaun Bhattacherjee, a consultant psychiatrist treating Mire at Broadmoor Hospital, said he was \"clearly mentally ill at the time of the events\". \n\"It is clear at the time of the offence he was very psychotic and manifested a significant number of psychotic symptoms,\" he said. \nHe added that Mire poses a \"very severe\" risk to the public and needs ongoing psychiatric treatment. Brave passengers were praised for capturing footage of the rampage Many witnesses recorded the attacks on mobile phones \n\"Because of the significant risk to the safety of others ... it's necessary that that treatment is continued in conditions of high security.\" \nAlphege Bell, defending, said Mire suffered from a number of unfounded beliefs, including that \" Tony Blair was his guardian angel\". \nHe also thought he was possessed by evil spirits and underwent a number of \"exorcisms\" by imams. \nMire has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and suffered his first episode of psychosis in 2006, the court heard.
