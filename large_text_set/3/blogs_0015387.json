He showed a recent clip from “CBS This Morning” in which the director of Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney , explained how he and the Trump administration arrived at the budget. \n“Wrote the budget by going through the president’s speeches, going through the interviews he had given and talking to him directly and finding out what his priorities were,” Mulvaney said. “We took those words, those policies, and turned them into numbers.” \nOliver was positively shocked at this revelation: \n“Basically, Mulvaney treated Trump’s past statements the way Trump treats women: Randomly singling out a few of them and then reducing them down to numbers.” \nThe late-night comedian could not understand how somebody could listen to a Trump speech and derive any meaningful policy considerations from it. “Last Week Tonight” then played a clip of Trump comparing America’s nuclear capabilities with that of Russia. \n“Our nuclear is old and tired and [Russian President Vladimir Putin’s] nuclear is tippy top from what I hear,” Trump said in a speech. \n“I don’t know how you turn that into policy,” Oliver said after the clip. “That apparently means a $1.4 billion increase for the National Nuclear Security Administration, while cutting the Department of Energy’s overall budget by $1.7 billion. But to be honest, I can’t be certain because I don’t speak fluent toddler psychopath.” \nOliver noted that the budget has received criticism from both sides of the aisle. Republican Rep. Hal Rogers from Kentucky, for example, has called the cuts “draconian, careless and counterproductive.” \nThe “Last Week Tonight” host tried to describe just how big of a problem that is for Trump: “A Republican saying that about budget cuts is like a toddler telling you this balloon fucking sucks.” Taylor Link is a news writer at Salon.
