That’s good for the most kills by a Marine sniper ever. 7 source \nCarlos Norman Hathcock II \nNicknamed ‘The White Feather Sniper,’ Carlos has a total of 93 confirmed kills. He wreaked so much havoc in Vietnam that their army put a $30,000 bounty on his head for getting rid of so many of their guys. He also fired an insane shot that went through the scope of the enemy sniper and right into his eye. He was crawling along looking for an enemy sniper who had already taken out a few fellow marines, and happened to catch a glance of the reflection from the other guys’ scope. He fired immediately, landing one of the most accurate shots ever. 8 source \nVasily Zaytsev \nZaytsev has 242 confirmed sniper kills. He was so good that he started to train his own snipers, and the ‘graduates’ of his school went on to kill over 3,000 enemy soldiers. 9 source \nLyudmila Pavlichenko \nThis female sniper joined the Red Army infantry when Nazi Germany was invading the Soviet Union. She managed to collect 309 confirmed kills as one of 2000 female snipers for the Soviet. 10 source \nSimo Häyhä \nThis Finnish soldier, who by the way is nick named ‘The White Death,’ has the most confirmed kills by a sniper in any war ever. Quite the resume for this fella. He killed a total of 705 enemies, 505 being with an iron sighted bolt action rifle, and the other 200 with a sub-machine gun. The most impressive thing is that most of these kills were done while he spent all day and night alone in the freezing snow, shooting down any Russian enemies he could see.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T17:41:19.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
