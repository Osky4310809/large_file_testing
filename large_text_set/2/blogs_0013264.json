This time, the British carmaker is focusing on one of the main aspects of its 650S successor – the engine. \nThe previous car was fitted with a 3.8 litre twin-turbo M838T V8 engine, which delivered 641 hp and 680 Nm of torque, so the new car gets a larger 4.0 litre twin-turbo M840T unit instead. McLaren won’t discuss how much power the new mill produces, but is more than happy to show you an image of it, along with some performance figures. \nFirstly, the next-gen Super Series model (reportedly dubbed the P14 or 720S) will accelerate to 200 km/h from zero in just 7.8 second “accompanied by a soulful, clean and crisp exhaust note that is among the most emotive of any McLaren.” By comparison, the 650S takes a 0.8 seconds longer to achieve the same feat. \nTake it to the drag strip and it will complete a standing quarter mile in just 10.3 seconds, which is again faster than the 650S (10.6 seconds). “Power, torque and throttle response are all significantly enhanced compared to the first-generation Super Series, yet with fuel efficiency and emissions also notably improved,” said McLaren Super Series vehicle line director, Haydn Baker. \nA pair of ultra-low inertia, twin-scroll turbochargers are responsible for the M840T’s undisclosed amount of power, capable of spooling up more rapidly to deliver a better throttle response and reduced turbo lag. \nMcLaren also adds that the engine “signals its performance credentials with an exhaust sound achieved through a sophisticated balance of harmonics and delivering a ‘crescendo’ characteristic,” and promises an optional sports exhaust for those who want to excite their ear even more. \nThe company will even offer engine bay illumination for those who want to show off the car’s new engine – especially the cast-aluminium air intake plenum that features the McLaren Speedmark logo on top. More details of the second-generation McLaren Super Series, including engine and performance specifications, will be confirmed on March 7 at the Geneva Motor Show.
