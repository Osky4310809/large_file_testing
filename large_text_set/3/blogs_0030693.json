Could   \nFormer Premier League striker Ivan Klasnic refuses to give up hope of a \"happy ending\" as he waits for a THIRD life-saving kidney transplant. \nKlasnic, 37, spent three years with Bolton Wanders in the top flight, between 2009 and 2012, scoring 20 goals in 77 Premier League matches. \nHe also played for Bundesliga clubs Werder Bremen and Mainz, Ligue 1 side Nantes and made 41 appearances for Croatia during a seven-year international career. \nKlasnic suffered renal failure in 2007, leading to a transplant from his mother. Yet his body rejected the organ, leading to him receiving a second kidney from his father. Klasnic during his time with Bolton (Photo: AFP) Ivan Klasnic undergoes dialysis three times a week (Photo: CEN) \nAt the time, Klasnic launched a lawsuit for \"gross negligence\" against sports doctor Goetz Dimanski and cardiologist Manju Guha, who work on behalf of Werder Bremen, for failing to identify his kidney complaint earlier. Klasnic's lawyer collected medical evidence that showed his kidney was only 67 per cent effective in 2001, when he signed for Bremen. \nThe second operation was a a success and in 2008 he became the first ever player to feature at a major international tournament after an organ transplant, when taking part in the European Championships. \nHowever, he has been critically ill after his body ultimately rejected that organ in September. He has since been spending three days a week on dialysis at his local hospital in Hamburg. Klasnic refuses to give up (Photo: CEN) \n\"I thought I'd have a shorter life or something,” he said during a documentary aired on German TV station NDR. “I have to accept the fate of it is, go on dialysis, but maybe it’ll come and there’ll be a happy ending. \n“And that would be that successful third transplantation and me no longer having to go on dialysis. \n\"The hardest part is that my mother lost a kidney, and I am grateful to my parents a lot.\" \nPossible donors related to the player, such as his brother, Joseph, are no longer an option because his body has now formed antibodies which make relatives’ organs too dangerous to transplant. \n\"I wish for the new kidney and life without difficulty,\" he added. \nKlasnic is continuing to play football once a week while he waits for a donor.
