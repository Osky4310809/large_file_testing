The summary judgment ruling was not a final judgment and the trademarks have not transferred away from WBS. Even if they did in the future, they would be owned by the Ratt Partnership, not Juan Croucier. And the only two remaining members of the Ratt Partnership, according to Croucier, are him and Bobby.” \nBlotzer/WBS have filed a request for reconsideration, scheduled for Jan. 23 in a downtown Los Angeles federal courtroom. According to Sherman, “There are significant contradictions in sworn testimony by Mr. Croucier.” But Doniger says, “Blotzer tried to pull a fast one and has now ended up with nothing.” At the Jan. 23 hearing, Doniger is seeking more than $250,000 in costs and attorney’s fees from WBS for his clients. \nIn addition to the ability to generate revenue by touring as Ratt, whoever controls the trademarks controls revenue from merchandising and licensing (but not music sales or publishing). \nPearcy, a guitarist-turned-singer influenced by the likes of Alice Cooper and Blue Oyster Cult’s Eric Bloom, founded the band in San Diego in the mid-’70s as Mickey Ratt, later shortening the name to Ratt. Pearcy moved to Los Angeles in 1981, living and rehearsing in a Culver City garage. A friendship with Van Halen partially inspired his move to L.A. That connection began in 1977 after Pearcy smoked a joint with David Lee Roth outside West Hollywood’s Whisky a Go-Go, back when Van Halen was still an unsigned local band. Ratt's Robbin Crosby, left, and Stephen Pearcy, during the ’80s Courtesy Stephen Pearcy \nPearcy, DeMartini and Crosby wrote Ratt’s grimy, infectious hit “Round and Round” in a one-bedroom apartment known affectionately as Ratt Mansion West, bouncing vocal and guitar tracks between two cassette players. The singer says “there’s not a day that goes by” in which he doesn’t think of Crosby. \nIn 2017, Ratt doesn’t command nearly the fan base of early-’80s Sunset Strip contemporaries Mötley Crüe. But that was not always the case. Beginning with their 1984 debut LP, Out of the Cellar , Ratt notched four consecutive platinum albums and headlined arenas. \n“I think it’s quickly forgotten just how big Ratt was,\" Trunk says. \"To me, album for album, song for song, you could even make the case they were more consistent than Mötley Crüe. But I think a lot of the reason they don’t get that same reverence as a band like Mötley Crüe is they had a lot of lineup changes. Mötley was great at making a book and dating Hollywood celebrities, and the excess really fueled their legacy, whereas Ratt kind of kept it in-house and you didn’t really hear about it all that much. So I think that factors in their perception.” \nBefore Blotzer began doing shows as Ratt, he was touring a project called Bobby Blotzer’s Ratt Experience and playing Ratt songs —à la Jason Bonham’s Led Zeppelin Experience. Doniger says Blotzer realized he could make 10 times as much money touring as Ratt — $2,500 to $4,900 a night as Bobby Blotzer’s Ratt Experience, versus $25,000 to $45,000 as Ratt. \nBands successfully touring with one original member has become commonplace. Look at Foreigner, among others. And there are prior examples of two versions of the same band touring simultaneously, as with L.A. Guns. It all depends on that particular band’s partnership agreement and who owns the trademarks. \nBut how do two touring versions of a band affect fans? That depends, Trunk says. “I think for the really hardcore true fans that really know what’s going on, it divides them and obviously upsets them. I think that for a majority of people that don’t follow it that closely, honestly, a lot of them don’t know anything different. They see a logo, they see a name and they go and hear the songs played well like they remember them, and they have some fun and have beers with their friends and go home.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T13:55:00.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
