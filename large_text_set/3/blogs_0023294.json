Sure he’s a one-trick pony, but I don’t think I’m going to ever get stick of his schtick in this case because it combines high theater, food, and swag. The dude is and always will be a demi-god if you love eating and red meat and the finer things in life. Eating at his restaurant is on my bucket list. He’s probably the finest master swordsmen to ever go viral .\nToday he’s back with a cheeseburger. But this is salt bae, so it’s not your every day cheeseburger — It’s a Kobe Beef burger, mashed with love in a meat grinder. This little trick is pure culinary poetry in motion:\nThe Kobe (beef) of no-looker jumpers. pic.twitter.com/AO52mGvkn7 \n— BroBible (@BroBible) March 23, 2017 \n\nI’ve never wanted a cheeseburger so bad in my life.\n\nLOOK HOW GOOD THIS LOOKS \n\nSide note: I think this is my favorite Salt Bae effort to date, even after the burger. The part where he does the knife twirl with that small piece of meat gets me giggling every time.\n\nNever leave my life, Salt Bae:\n\n\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:14:00.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
