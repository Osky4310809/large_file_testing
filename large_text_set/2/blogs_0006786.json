Now let's get on with taking the fight to the Tories #A50Bill pic.twitter.com/TMU91aqPpX — Clive Lewis MP (@labourlewis) 8 February 2017 \nThe resignation is a major blow for Mr Corbyn who faces a possible revolt at his insistence for MPs to support the Government's bill. \nThe bill will allow Theresa May to begin withdrawal talks under Article 50 of the EU treaties. \nMr Lewis backed the bill at its second reading last week but warned he would not do so again unless the legislation was amended by Labour. Labour MP quits frontbench over Corbyn's order to support Brexit bill \nWhen the final potential amendment was voted down on Wednesday evening, a swift statement was issued which confirmed he had stepped down. \nMr Lewis becomes the latest Labour frontbencher to quit the shadow cabinet over Mr Corbyn's three-line whip following the departures of Tulip Siddiq, Dawn Butler and Rachael Maskell. Fresh blow for Corbyn as two Labour frontbenchers quit over Brexit \nMr Corbyn said: “I would like to thank Clive for his work in the shadow cabinet, which has underlined what an asset he is to the Labour party and our movement. \n“I understand the difficulties MPs representing constituencies which voted remain have in relation to the European Union withdrawal bill. MPs have a duty to represent their constituents as well as their party. \n\"However, the Labour party respects the outcome of the EU referendum, so we have asked all Labour MPs to vote for the bill at its third reading tonight.” \nThe bill was passed after MPs voted 494 to 122 in favour, a majority of 372.
