But she skipped out on the prequel “The Huntsman: Winter’s Warrior,” which opened last month on the shoulders of Chris Hemsworth and bombed at the box office . \nIn an interview for this week’s Variety cover story , Stewart spoke out for the first time about what happened. “I read a few scripts,” Stewart recalls. “None of them were good. None of them were greenlight-able. And I had a meeting with Universal about the places where the story could go. Maybe Chris was more into it. I actually don’t f—ing know.” \nShe insists that the tabloid coverage of her relationship with director Rupert Sanders — the two were caught kissing by the paparazzi shortly after the movie opened in the summer of 2012 — didn’t factor into Universal’s decision-making. “It wasn’t a situation where I got kicked off a movie because I got in trouble,” says Stewart, who issued a public apology to her then-boyfriend Robert Pattinson. “We had been in talks months after that about making something work, and it never came together.” \nStewart found out about the sequel in a press release. “I was like, ‘OK, cool,’” she says with a laugh. “We hadn’t spoken in a long time, but I didn’t know we had broken up,” she says of Universal. \nThe studio did reach out to ask if she would appear in a cameo as Snow White. She told them, “I might just leave that be. I was really into that, but …” she adds with a smirk. “So now I’m like … ‘Thank God.’” \nUniversal declined to comment. \nDespite her streak of character parts in indie movies, including upcoming Cannes films “Cafe Society” and “Personal Shopper,” Stewart isn’t opposed to returning to blockbusters. “I’m a kid from the Valley,” she says. “I love big movies that everyone sees, and I can’t wait for the opportunity to f—ing nail that. It has to be the right people and the right time.” \nFor more from this week’s cover story with Kristen Stewart, click here .
