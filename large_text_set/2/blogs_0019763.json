The first is to have the greatest natural lighting with the least thermal gain or loss. The perforations that lead directly outdoors are regulated according to the interior needs and are complemented by the full illumination through inner courtyards with temperatures controlled by natural means. In this sense, and considering the climatic conditions of the site, a porous surface wetted laminarly was placed on the inner side of the concrete walls of the courtyards, where the outside air provides latent heat, cools down, and enters in a controlled way through the windows of the workshops exiting through the opposite wall by an also regulated evacuation plenum.\nElevation All rainwater is stored in a cistern on the roof from where it descends through the concrete walls of the courtyards, is collected, and accumulates in a transparent tank that serves as the entrance hall roofand is recirculated back to the upper reservoir in a continuous cycle.\n© Gonzalo Viramonte The exterior concrete walls complement its great thermal inertia with its insulation and inner lining helping to naturally regulate the periods of average temperatures.\nDiagram Although the building is equipped with air conditioning, the goal is for its use to be minimal and only in extreme temperature situations.\n© Gonzalo Viramonte Si bien el edificio consta con equipos de aire acondicionado, el objetivo es que su uso sea mínimo y sólo en situaciones de picos extremos.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:00:20.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
