But at the end of the day, feeling beautiful isn’t about what you wear, but about the confidence your go-to beauty booster gives you: Nothing is sexier than confidence. A tightly-knit group of women in Australia recently learned the power of confidence first-hand, when they decided to strip down to their birthday suits and slather themselves in glitter for a sunrise body-positive photo shoot on the beach. The close pals—who met via social media thanks to their shared love of lingerie—had previously gathered in a group member’s backyard to test out the body glitter, and ended up loving the way the sparkle made them feel. The group’s unofficial spokeswoman, Bonnie (of @Busty_Diaries ) told Cosmopolitan.com : \"[We] did it because we love ourselves and want to do things that make us happy…..It seemed like the most fun and outrageous thing to do within the privacy of our own backyard.\" You May Also Like Lifestyle What It's Really Like to Get Your Nipples Pierced And fun it was.

Though they were, for all intents and purposes, totally nude—something that, for most, would be at least a little daunting—Bonnie says they all felt “like absolute supermodels.” She explains, \"None of us fit the stereotypical mold of what a model 'should' look like, but together we bring out the best in each other.\" More ways to wear glitter:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:34:45.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
