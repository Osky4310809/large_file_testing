Shot from on high, photographer Andy Yeung’s spectacular drone images of densely populated Sheung Wan, Wan Chai and Sham Shui Po offer a unique perspective on the city we call home. Stunning drone photography of Hong Kong attracts global attention Photographed over a two-month period, the bird’s-eye views from Yeung’s Urban Jungle series caught the public imagination last year, when an aerial shot of Sheung Wan was named Editor’s Choice on prominent international photography blog PetaPixel. Now five selected works can be viewed in an exhibi­tion titled “From the Sky”, which the artist will open this week with a talk on drone photography. \n“Drone cameras allow us to see things we normally don’t have access to,” says Yeung, who first made headlines in 2015, with his work documenting 100 of China’s “megastructures” and his Compact City photo, which won the International Photography Awards One Shot competition. “Hong Kong is an over-photographed city, so I thought using drones could provide a new perspective and make people look at my city with fresh eyes. “Choosing the right time of day and the right spot to fly to minimise interaction with other people can be tough,” he says. “Flying right above the concrete jungle might make the drone subject to electro­magnetic interference, hence the danger of flyaway.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T15:41:58.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
