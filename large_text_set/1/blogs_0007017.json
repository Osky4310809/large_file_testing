But, there are a few hacks that can prevent these awful hair days. You just need to make small changes to keep your mane strong, and full of volume. Switch up your washing routine \nFirst of all, stop washing your hair every single day. Shampoos combined with water can strip your scalp off of its essential oils. So, make sure you wash your hair only two or three times a week. If you can't go more than one day without a wash, then alternate between a shampoo and an all-in-one cleansing conditioner which gently washes your hair and scalp without stripping away the oil. Wash with filtered water \nWe all know that water is packed with minerals. But, sometimes, chlorine in the water can deposit a muddy colour and can also weaken your strands. So install a filtration plant, and if you find it too expensive then just use a shower-head filter.Make sure you replace it every six months. Treat your hair like your skin \nThe way you use various products to address different skin issues, your mane needs a similar kind treatment as well. Don't use just about any shampoo or conditioner. Figure the quality of your hair, and choose products accordingly. Make a habit out of using hair masks, and oil your hair regularly. Oil your hair \nMake sure you oil your hair before every wash, and also spread on some light weight oil only on your stands. This will block all the foreign particles from damaging your hair cuticles, will camouflage you split-ends, and add a healthy shin to your tresses. Get a haircut every three months \nYou don't necessarily need a full-blown haircut, just a trim is enough to add life back to your mane. Split-ends can weigh down your tresses. Trimming them regularly can help in maintaining a healthy volume.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:15:09.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
