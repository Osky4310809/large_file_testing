Gerrymandering. WATCH: https://t.co/SoX0tdlTeM — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 14, 2017 \nThat reference to Nickelback's approval rating, though, didn't sit well with the band (or whoever runs their Twitter account, anyway), who shot back: \n. @Schwarzenegger big fans. Approval rate this: Batman & Robin. Please leave us out of your future wisdom drops. Danke Shön Herr Governator. — Nickelback (@Nickelback) February 14, 2017 \nShowing a sense of perspective and a knack for self-deprecating humor that likely served him well as a Republican governor in the Democratic stronghold of California, Schwarzenegger told Nickelback that the diss was \"ice cold.\" \n\"I hope we can agree that we need a freeze on gerrymandering, guys,\" he tweeted . \"Thanks for the reply.\" \nAs you might expect, those cold puns -- a callback to the most notorious element of his character's personality from Batman & Robin -- earned him a \"well played\" and a ceasefire from Nickelback.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:02:37.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
