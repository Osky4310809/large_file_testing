Some of that construction is particularly grand in its height â€”at least by Boston standards. Here is a map of the eight buildings either under construction or planned in the city right now of at least 400 feet. \nThat is an extraordinary height in a city where 200 feet seems de rigueur and 600 feet is positively revolutionary . \nThe map does not include projects such as One Bromfield or 1000 Boylston Street , which are still very much on the drawing board and have not received any sort of city approval (the mapped projects all have the city's blessing, at least in part). Nor does it include M.I.T.'s proposed 500-footer in Kendall Square just across the Charles. \nWe will therefore update this map of Boston's high-rises as things change. 1 Four Seasons Hotel & Private Residences One Dalton Street \nThe 61-story, 699-foot tower has been under construction in western Back Bay since early 2015 and will shoot past the newish Millennium Tower sometime by the end of this year to take the tallest-residential-tower crown. In fact, the Pei Cobb Freed-designed One Dalton will become the tallest tower constructed in Boston in nearly 40 years. It is due to include 180 luxury condos, plus a Four Seasons hotel (that will also service the condos). Like with Millennium, things will be on the pricey side. 1 Dalton St", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:30:04.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
