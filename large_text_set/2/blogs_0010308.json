The striker's new manager says that he is ready to move on from past controversies. \n\"It was unfortunate,\" Hughes told the Stoke Sentinel of the news about Berahino's failed drug test. \"We were all disappointed that it came out. It didn't have to. It did, so you just move on. \n\"Everyone is aware of it. Everyone can move on. It's something that's happened. He's been great since he's walked through the door. \n\"He's got a big smile on his face — there's a weight off his shoulders and he just needs to get on with his career now.\" \nHughes said Berahino will likely be involved when Stoke take on Tottenham in two weeks. \n\"He's match short, clearly, but we have two weeks away which will help him immeasurably,\" Hughes said. \"Likelihood is he'll be involved versus Spurs.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:29:58.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
