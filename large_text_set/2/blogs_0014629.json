Barbara Hendricks with Christian Schmidt Credit: Rex \n“ I’m not having this Veggie Day through the back door,” Christian Schmidt, the food minister , said. \n“I believe in diversity and freedom of choice, not nanny-statism and ideology. Instead of paternalism and ideology. Meat and fish are also part of a balanced diet.” \nT he ban emerged in an email to department heads from a senior civil servant in the environment ministry. \nThe ministry has a responsibility to combat the “negative effects of meat consumption” and must “set an example”, the email said. \nIt is claimed meat farming accounts for up to a third of greenhouse gas emissions . \nBut Ms Hendricks has been accused of hypocrisy after it emerged that the ban only applies to official functions, and that meat and fish are still available to ministry officials in the staff canteen. \n“You have to eat what’s on the table according to the will of the ministry. No meat, no fish, and the cover of ‘climate protection’,” Gitta Conneman, a senior MP in the CDU told Bild newspaper. \n“They won’t save the climate by branding people who eat meat, and they know this. The ban only applies to a handful of guests, not to 1,200 employees. This is pure ideology, a ‘people’s education’ for the diet.” \n“We’re not tell anyone what they should eat,” the environment ministry said in a statement. “But we want to set a good example for climate protection, because vegetarian food is more climate-friendly than meat and fish.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:20:13.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
