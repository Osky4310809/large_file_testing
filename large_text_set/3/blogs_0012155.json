Posted 11 hours ago 18 \nAnother little Metallica clip surfaced via YouTube, answering the question of what would \" Moth Into Flame \" sound like if it was played by the gang during their iconic Seattle show in 1989. \nUploader Valdes Gaming noted: \"This song was covered to sound like it came from the 'Justice' album by GuitarRazze, so the instruments you hear in this video are his. I just put together this video using the DVD ('Live Shit: Binge & Purge'). \n\"I used various songs they played at the Seattle Center Coliseum in August 29, 1989 from the DVD. Edited, synced, and subbed all by me. I'm in no way making any money for this. All for fun.\" \nYou can check out the clip below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T03:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T05:55:19.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
