It’s more than being a star.\n“What it is really is that I want to be productive.\n“I’m not content to just be a rock ‘n’ roll star all my life.\n“I am trying to be one at the moment because I need it at the moment for a particular reason so I can get off and do other things.”\nThere are also interviews with his long-time producer Tony Visconti who said Bowie was “at the top of his game” when recording Blackstar.\nVisconti, the man behind more than half of Bowie’s studio albums including “The Man Who Sold The World” and “Heroes,” added: “David had great, grand ideas.\n“To become well-known, famous, for him was initially to have the resources to realise what his ideas were.\n“He really does come from that spirit, he just didn’t want to be famous per se.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:55:47.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
