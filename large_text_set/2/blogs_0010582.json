She appeared to think they were poorly made swastikas and asked if Neo-Nazis have access to google.\nThe photo that Silverman posted shows \"fairly standard markers\" that are used to help construction workers, Mediaite reported .\nWalking to get coffee saw these all over a sidewalk in the town I'm in. Is this an attempt at swastikas? Do neo nazis not have google? pic.twitter.com/A4ses1G3ru \n— Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) February 12, 2017 \n\nSeveral people then commented that the markings were not swastikas. One construction worker noted that they are meant to indicate the locations of underground wires, pipes, and related items.\nThis led to a storm of tweets mocking Silverman.\nThis has to be a joke. No one is this dumb. https://t.co/WufajNLFFh \n— Liz Finnegan (@TheGingerarchy) February 13, 2017 \n\n. @SarahKSilverman If you a see a guy dressed like this on the street, punch him pic.twitter.com/GjeZetRcRU \n— Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) February 13, 2017 \n\nSilverman responded by saying that she made an \"innocent mistake,\" indicating that her initial tweet was not a joke as some suspected. The comedian also made a Holocaust joke in her tweet, which had the orange construction markers and an actual swastika side-by-side.\nIt's a construction marker. Innocent mistake for a Jew that gets \"burn in an oven!\" at least weekly on twitter. Still pretty close though.. pic.twitter.com/8Gsuy3QkuE \n— Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) February 13, 2017 \n\nShe then sent a message to the \"excited-to-pounce\" people who thought she was a \"dummy\" for seeing swastikas when they were just markers for construction workers. The message contained explicit language and took a jab at President Trump and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, appearing to imply that they have incited anti-Semitism with their actions and rhetoric. Silverman mentioned the White House's statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day, which did not mention the six million Jews who the Nazis murdered while in power in Germany.\nTo the excited-to-pounce, smelly condescending cunts who say ima dummy 4 seeing swastikas in street markers:\n— Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) February 13, 2017 \n\nI'm seeing swastikas in everything fratboys. It started w Bannon's rise & festered when trump decided not 2 mention Jews re the Holocaust. https://t.co/rBqPZpAHHx \n— Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) February 13, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:13:49.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
