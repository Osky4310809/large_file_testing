AP/File photo SULTAN KUDARAT, Philippines — Communist rebels who killed a Marine and wounded nine others in Kalamansig town on Friday have fled to the forested border of neighboring Sultan Kudarat and South Cotabato provinces, police and Army sources said Tuesday. Local officials in South Cotabato also confirmed that nine New People’s Army guerrillas were killed — not six as initially reported — in the ensuing firefights with patrolling personnel of the 2nd Marine Company in Sitio Tinagdanan in Barangay Hinalaan in Kalamansig. The three-hour running gunbattles erupted when the NPAs, positioned on high ground, attacked the Marines dispatched to verify the reported presence of rebels in Barangay Hinalaan collecting “taxes” from farmers. Senior Superintendent Raul Supiter, Sultan Kudarat provincial police director, on Tuesday said an enlisted Marine, Pvt. Albino Bahian III, died on the spot from multiple bullet wounds. Nine of his companions — Pvt. Randy Borromeo, Pfcs Kenneth Calaycay, Glen Genova, Jared Sugagil, Cpl. Marlon Ampao, Robert De Asis, Carsle Camo, Joseph Accad and Sgt. Alex Falcasantos — were wounded as they traded shots with their ambushers. Kalamansig is a seaside town in Sultan Kudarat in Region 12, close to South Cotabato province, where there are highland towns with heavy NPA presence. Local officials and barangay leaders told The STAR Tuesday afternoon that the NPAs retreated to a nearby forested hinterland in South Cotabato province carrying their dead and wounded companions The sources had also confirmed that nine NPAs were killed while 13 others were injured when a Marine artillery base in another barangay in Kalamansig bombarded their positions from which launched the ambush, forcing them to scamper away. Army and police intelligence sources said six NPAs were killed in the initial exchange of gunfire with the Marines and three more, who sustained shrapnel wounds when a mortar round landed and exploded near them, died while being carried away from the scene by companions. “They were spotted near a mountain range between Surallah and Lake Sebu municipalities on Monday morning,” an Army major, who requested anonymity owing to the delicate nature of his covert missions, said Tuesday afternoon. Surallah and Lake Sebu towns are both in South Cotabato, also a component province of Region 12. The rebels behind the ambush of the Marines in Barangay Hinalaan last Friday reportedly belong to the NPA’s Guerilla Front 73.
