PHOTOS: Celebrity Scientologists \nMaking an Impact \nLeah traveled to Los Angeles to see a family — Lois and Gary Reisdorf, and their sons Brandon, Brett and Craig — who the Church of Scientology insists is guilty of hate speech and hate crimes against religion. Brandon is bipolar and was in psychiatric care when Leah came around, but his family decided to allow him to be interviewed.

When Brandon had an episode, he was put in an “introspection rundown,” which involved weeks-long periods of isolation and intense interrogation because Scientologists don’t believe in psychology. Through all of that, Lois and Gary remained in contact with non-Scientologist family members, which got them expelled from the church in the end anyway.

Ultimately, he was convicted of a felony for a hate crime, which enraged Leah because the church had “prevented him from getting the real medical help that he needed” by giving unsolicited psychiatric advice. \nEven when he was finally taken into psychiatric care, he still believed what the church had told him about medication and wouldn’t take them until a court order was issued. \nThe \"Write\" and Wrong Ways to Fight Back \n“That’s not true,” Brandon said when he heard the church was claiming Leah inspired him to throw a hammer through one of their windows. “It’s not true.” \nHe also said that now that he’s a felon, he’s been “destroyed.” \nLater, Leah began to wonder if she could go to the FBI. Mike Rinder , a fellow former Scientologist who is also involved in the show, suggested they call up some journalists. \nThey reached out to John Sweeney , Tony Ortega and Mark Bunker , reporters who have not only investigated the church but who were targeted in smear campaigns run by Mike himself when he was still a parishioner! Sweeney revealed that though he’s reported on North Korea and Vladimir Putin , only his experiences being stalked by the church still give him nightmares; the other two shared similar stories of being allegedly followed, photographed, ambushed and intimidated by church members, possible paid protesters and private investigators. \nMike, who was once the person who directed such revenge activities, spoke to the veracity of their claims, but the journalists also had home video footage of themselves confronting parishioners who were following them. \n“I can’t excuse those things,” Mike said of his “misguided” behavior. “I can only try to say, ‘This was my mindset at the time.’” Leah Remini A&E \nFinally, We Talk About Xenu (and to Some Lawyers!) \nIt was revealed that Leah herself was interviewed by Sweeney while she was in the church. At the time, she refused to acknowledge whether or not church members believe in “Xenu,” the intergalactic being who traveled to earth 75 million years ago, killed a bunch of people with bombs inside volcanos and basically started the religion. \nThe belief in Xenu is, according to Leah, “confidential information.” She revealed there is $100,000 fine any time someone reveals that type of information to someone outside of the church. \nNext, Sweeney asked if her creation of the show was her way of saying “sorry” for perpetuating and promoting Scientology.
