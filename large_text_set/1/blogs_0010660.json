WBBM’s Steve Miller reports. \nOne of the girls somehow got trapped and locked inside a prison cell, authorities say. \nLily Nunez of the Joliet Fire Department took the call, when one girl phoned for help. \n“She was scared. And she said her name was Brittany, and she said her and her friend were messing around and her friend got locked (in). And I could hear her friend in the background. She was scared.” \nThe fire department arrived and reportedly used a sledgehammer to break through a wall. \nThe teenagers faced under an hour of jail time. Now authorities said they will both face trespassing charges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:25:48.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
