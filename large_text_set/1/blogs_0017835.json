Meaning, you keep yourself as busy as possible so you don’t dwell. Taurus (April 20th to May 21st) \nYou keep things to yourself. Even though you’re hurting, it’ll be hard to tell to the outside world. You seem like everything is fine, but are emotionally reeling on the inside. Gemini (May 22nd to June 21st) \nYou fluctuate. Some days, you act like it’s not a big deal at all and you’re better off. Others, you’re angry and keep talking about how much your ex is gonna regret breaking your heart. Cancer (June 22nd to July 22nd) \nYou’re an incredibly sensitive soul, so heartbreak deeply affects you. You seek comfort in your friends and probably listen to a lot of Adele. Leo (July 23rd to August 22nd) \nHeartbreak is doubly upsetting to you because you hate when your pride takes a blow. You’ll look for someone hotter to have rebound sex with. Virgo (August 23rd to September 22nd) \nYou are highly critical and have probably been expecting to be let down in some way for a while. To you, heartbreak just seems like an inevitable outcome when two people become seriously involved. Libra (September 23rd to October 22nd) \nThe master when it comes to balance, you do equal parts crying and healing things, like yoga or journaling. Scorpio (October 23rd to November 22nd) \nYou don’t get heartbroken. You break hearts. Sagittarius (November 23rd to December 21st) \nYou’ll be sad for a bit, but bounce back pretty quickly. You enjoy your independence and know there are plenty of other fish in the sea. Capricorn (December 22nd to January 20th) \nYou’ll wallow for a bit, but not in any dramatic way. You give yourself permission to be disappointed for a short period of time and then fully commit to moving forward. Aquarius (January 21st to February 18th) \nYou’re a bit of a mystery. You usually don’t develop super deep feeling for people so heartbreak for you is rarely as intense as it is for other signs. Pisces (February 19th to March 20th) \nYou write so many poems.
