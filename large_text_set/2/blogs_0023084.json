Nobody asked for her unsolicited advice.The cop in question, Daulatram Jogawat, spoke to News18 regarding the debacle. His statement is a lesson in humility, and a reality check of all of us. \"Nobody loves to be overweight. If madam knows about some weight-loss treatment, then help me lose weight... it is not good to mock someone without having any detail about the person.\" In an interview with HT , he said, \"It is due to my illness that I am so fat, and not due to overeating. I had a gall bladder operation in 1993 and I developed insulin imbalance which resulted in my obesity. If madam wants, she can pay for my treatment.
