Corden talked about how much he loved Michael's music, and also thanked him for helping create what would eventually become the hugely popular \"Carpool Karaoke\" segment of his show. via: YouTube \nIn 2011, George Michael and James Corden did a sketch together for Comic Relief for England’s Red Nose Day. \"In this sketch, the idea was that a character from a sitcom I was in at home was driving to the offices of Comic Relief to try and save Red Nose Day,\" Corden said. \n“We had come up with this idea to have me and George Michael singing in a car. It was the first time I’d ever sung in a car with anybody. It’s become quite a big part of my life now, and he really inspired it.” Having someone like Michael do that bit is what convinced huge star Mariah Carey to also give it a try, making her the first official \"Carpool Karaoke\" guest. \n“So, we all have so much to thank him for, for the music that he’s given that will last forever,” he said. “But we personally, here at this show, we owe him so much.” \nHe will surely be missed. 22 Words Rocks ...AND GETS ALL UP IN YOUR FACEBOOK More posts in #Entertainment", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:58:54.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
