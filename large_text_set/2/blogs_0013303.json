According to the text of the resolution, which was submitted by DNC superdelegate William Owen, \"Director Comey demonstrated in the recent 2016 election that he did not need to be blackmailed to engage in illegal partisan actions,\" and Comey's \"partisan and illegal letters\" resulted in the election of Donald Trump. The resolution then encourages people to have \"the same respect for the FBI as Director Comey demonstrated with his illegal actions.\" The Democratic National Committee will vote next week on a resolution to condemn the ABC show \"Designated Survivor.\" pic.twitter.com/I1f5dfr19G â€” Reid J.

Comey's letters came about after new emails were discovered during an investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY) after it was discovered that he had carried on an online relationship with a high school student. \nI mean, as someone who watched the first few episodes of \"Designated Survivor\" before tuning out because it was just so dreadfully boring, I think a resolution condemning the show is a bit of overkill. This is an extremely petty (yet hilarious) incident of sour grapes post-election. \nOr, in the words of Guy Benson: This is truly embarrassing https://t.co/S9F1zlo68k", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:30:31.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
