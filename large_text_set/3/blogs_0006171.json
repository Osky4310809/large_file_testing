Teachers. Veterans. Nurses. Your moms.\nSEE ALSO: What to do when you're so overwhelmed by the Trump presidency you can barely move\nThere's a stereotype about the modern protester that's proven hard to shake: the whiney, internet-savvy highly educated socialist coastal liberal who wants nothing more than to destroy capitalism and replace it with Lena Dunham.\nThe current face of the resistance to the Donald Trump administration and its policies, however, is more diverse ( and largely female-led ) than some GOP senators would have you believe .\n\"I've never protested anything before,\" Liz P., an Indivisible member in Alabama says.\nIndivisible , the coalition of 5,802 anti-Trump grassroots groups that rapidly organized after the election, gave her a platform.\n\"I'm from Alabama. We never even talked about politics around here before, it's kind of a social survival thing.\"\nOverwhelmed by Trump and the daily barrage of threats they feel he poses to the American democracy, these \" violent paid protesters \" got together on platforms millennials thought their parents didn't understand — Facebook, Slack, and Twitter — and did something about it.\nThey'd like people to know they're not quite the radical left-wing extremists Marco Rubio and others say they are. And they definitely aren't paid to protest.\nThey come from deep red states\nSara Anderson of West Viriginia\nImage: Sara Anderson\nAmericans love nothing more than dividing themselves into a FiveThirtyEight map: red or blue, Clinton or Trump, facts or alternative facts.\nSome of the loudest voices of the resistance aren't from blue states at all, but from places like West Virginia, which Trump won by a margin so large we'll just hyperlink it .\nSara Anderson lives in Morgantown, West Virginia, a blue speck in the heart of Trump country. Since she since started organizing after the election, first on Pantsuit Nation West Virginia and then on Indivisible, she's started to see members pop up from everywhere.\n\"We've had women from Pocahontas County, a beautiful, rural, Trump county, drive hours to Charleston to make it to a meeting. They connected on the Indivisible page. They're doing what they can to find each other.\"\nUsers sometimes take advantage of the Indivisible map to discover grassroots groups in their state. All the way over in Northwest Arkansas, a Muslim woman in a red state, whose name we've abbreviated to A.P., was thankful to connect to anti-Trump neighbors she didn't even know existed.\n\"I got involved shortly after inauguration when I heard of the Indivisible groups popping up all over the nation. I live in the South in a very red state so I doubted there was one near me,\" A.P. says. \"As a Muslim American, I felt more lonely than ever. But ,lo and behold, thank goodness, there was one nearby.\"\nA.P. admitted that she's nervous to share some of her story, as a Muslim woman living in a Trump-friendly state. But she's glad she doesn't have to experience this administration alone.\nThey could otherwise be confused for a Trump voter It's no surprise that A.P. thought she wouldn't find allies in her state. If you read the post-election hot takes, Trump supporters , we came to understand, were white, married, working-class, highly religious, and liked to eat their steak well done.\nThe Women's March itself, the largest protest in U.S. history by some tallies, was led by women of color (after significant backlash ). Many of the \"paid protesters\" showing up at these town halls, however, look like they'd fit in one of the typical Trump voter categories.\nKim Holmes from Huntsville, Alabama, checks off all of these boxes: She's a married, white heterosexual woman from a deep red state with three kids and a job in marketing. But she also has a gay son, who helped to make her aware of people whose life experiences were dramatically different from her own. She wants her children to be involved in politics so that \"they will be comfortable with it as adults.\"\n\"I think I used an Obama Presidency as my safety net, so I didn't feel the need to be super active in the political sphere. But now the safety net for marginalized communities is gone and I suddenly feel the weight of my privilege as a white women in a heterosexual marriage with middle class means,\" Holmes says.\nKim Holmes (Center) and two of her kids in Huntsville, Alabama\nImage: kim holmes\nHolmes alone doesn't change the data of who voted this election, and which candidate they voted for . But she's actively looking to find \"non-traditional\" protesters — even former Trump voters — and get them involved in the cause.\nThey're addicted to Facebook, they're blowing up on Twitter, and they even like Slack Kim and others like her stressed that they're dependent on Facebook for their organizing, as much they sometimes resist it. Kristin Moline, another Indivisible organizer and nurse and a veteran, didn't want to get on Facebook or Twitter. She barely even maintained her accounts. Now, Moline says, \"she's fomenting the resistance from my cellphone,\" and had to buy a new computer to help her organize post-election.\nMoline didn't think much of social media until she started organizing after Trump's election. When she learned that her congressperson was holding his town hall across the state (400 miles away from their district's largest population center), she drove 12 hours round trip and filmed her experience for Twitter, where it quickly blew up and made headlines .\n@Scout_Finch pic.twitter.com/4sFKafyAja\n— kristin moline (@sisterresister1) February 14, 2017\n\"I only got on Facebook six months ago, I only started to use Twitter three weeks ago and my life is going off right now,\" Moline said, who now manages a group of over 3,000 members. \"I'm able to take a leadership role because of Twitter.\"\nIndivisible reports that the page has already received 17.23 million page views in just two months alone.\nNothing (besides everything they're fighting against) makes them madder than being called 'paid protesters' Though their concerns were diverse, from protecting the Affordable Care Act to investigating Trump's potential ties to the Kremlin, nothing unified these women more than their resentment as being dismissed as \"paid protesters.\"\n\"I'm a stay at home mom and I'm doing this out of my own time and effort,\" Leigh Altman, organizer of one of the Indivisible chapters in North Carolina, says. \"Without exception, these are hardworking ordinary citizens. The paid protester thing is a testament to how desperate [the opposition] are. They'll come up with any face-saving lie to try and explain a spontaneous groundswell from the people that we've never seen before.\"\nLeigh Altman organized a town hall when her own Senator, Thom Thillis, wouldn't show up to one\nImage: Leigh altman\nWhile there are some people who are paid to organize, not \"protest for pay,\" all of these women strenuously asserted that they had little to gain financially by organizing.\nLorena Johnson, a citizen and formerly undocumented immigrant from Mexico, is truly embarrassed that her representatives allege that she's motivated by money. She'd like her senators to know she's here for a different reason.\nLorena Johnson and her family\nImage: lorena johnson\n\"I'm here because I remember what it was like to be an undocumented immigrant. I knew how people feel. You are are always scared you will be caught [and] deported. You're hiding. I lived here for a year without documents and I remember what it's like to suffer ... So I'm speaking up because I have to tell this story.
