Officials told Reuters the new deployment would provide US commanders on the ground with more flexibility to respond immediately to unforeseen challenges on the battlefield. \nAlso, according to officials, the decision on whether to use the Kuwait-based reserve force would be left to local commanders – a drastic change in the way the fight against terrorists in the region is handled, as the Obama administration tended to micromanage the details of the war against ISIS. \nReuters’ sources also said the potential deployment would differ from the existing US troop presence in Kuwait. Located on Iraq’s southeastern border, Kuwait has been a staunch ally of the US since 1991, when US forces spearheaded a campaign to drive occupying Iraqi troops out of the country, in what has come to be known as the first Gulf War. \nAccording to Military Bases.com , there are currently eight US Army bases in Kuwait.Reuters said Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis declined to comment on the options which are being discussed by the Trump administration regarding the fight against ISIS.

On Tuesday, the head of the Iraqi Army’s Counter-Terrorism Force reported that the Iraqi Army has regained control over 60 percent of western Mosul. \nEarlier this week, Iraqi forces recaptured a key local government complex in the center of the embattled city, as well as a courthouse, a branch of the central bank, a police directorate, a Turkish consulate, and the city’s antiquities museum, once home to priceless ancient Mesopotamian artifacts, that are now either gone or reduced to rubble. \nNews of the potential Kuwait deployment follows confirmation by the US that it dispatched nearly 400 Marines to Syria to establish an outpost in support of the operation to retake the city of Raqqa, the de-facto ISIS capital in Syria. \nThe troops will provide support to US allies on the ground leading the offensive to liberate the city, codenamed Operation Euphrates Rage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T14:58:40.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
