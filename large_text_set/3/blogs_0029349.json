(AP Photo/Darren Abate) \nLaMarcus Aldridge scored 23 points and Kawhi Leonard added 19 to power San Antonio over visiting Memphis 97-90 Thursday, moving the Spurs within two games of NBA-leading Golden State. \nAustralian reserve Patty Mills netted 15 points and French guard Tony Parker contributed 13 as the Spurs improved to 55-16 with their third consecutive triumph, staying within range of the pace-setting Warriors (57-14) with 11 games remaining. \nAldridge cracked the 15,000-point mark for his NBA career with a jumper in the fourth quarter.

The Knicks were without Carmelo Anthony due to a left knee injury and Derrick Rose with a right foot injury. \nDallas edged the Los Angeles Clippers 97-95, scoring the final five points over the last 2:30 of the fourth quarter. \nSeth Curry’s jump shot pulled the host Mavericks within 95-94 with 2:19 to play and Dallas took the lead at 96-95 on Harrison Barnes’ jumper with 68 seconds to play. \nThe Clippers had three chances to answer but a Chris Paul miss and two turnovers — the last by Blake Griffin with three seconds remaining — led to a Wesley Matthews free throw to create the final margin as J.J. Redick missed a desperation 3-point attempt at the closing buzzer. \nCurry finished with 23 points to lead Dallas while Barnes added 21 and Griffin had 21 to lead the Clippers. \nBrooklyn’s Brook Lopez scored 19 points to spark the Nets back from an early 15-point deficit to a 126-98 rout of Phoenix Suns, giving the NBA’s losingest team a 15-56 record and back-to-back wins for the first time in a year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T14:48:27.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
