I just really can’t wait for people to forget about me.\" WATCH: Selena Gomez and The Weeknd Make Out During Romantic Date on Yacht Rob Haskell, who interviews Gomez for the April issue of Vogue , notes in the piece that the \"It Ain't Me\" singer is insistent that \"everything she has said about her relationships in the past has come back to bite her, and that she will never do it again.\" A post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine) on Mar 16, 2017 at 4:01am PDT There is a moment during their conversation, however, where it appears that Gomez is talking about her ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber , after she happily poses for photos with some of her younger fans, who are dressed in \"pinafores and pink high-tops.\" \"Somebody I used to hang out with would always get very frustrated with me,” she recalls, leading Haskell to presume that she's talking about Bieber. “But I have a hard time saying no to children.” WATCH: Fans Think Selena Gomez Is Wearing The Weeknd's Red Sweatshirt in Latest Studio Pic While Gomez holds the title of having the most followers on Instagram , she admits that she's posting less on the photo-sharing site and no longer has the app on her phone, nor does she know the password to her account. \"As soon as I became the most followed person on Instagram, I sort of freaked out,” she admits. “It had become so consuming to me. It’s what I woke up to and went to sleep to. I was an addict, and it felt like I was seeing things I didn’t want to see, like it was putting things in my head that I didn’t want to care about.\" Photo: Vogue Photo: Vogue Gomez adds, \"I always end up feeling like sh** when I look at Instagram. Which is why I’m kind of under the radar, ghosting it a bit.\" MORE: Justin Bieber Has Near Run-In With Selena Gomez and The Weeknd at GRAMMYs After-Party In addition to chatting with Vogue , Gomez also poses for photographer Mert Alas in a series of high-fashion images. As her fans may recall, in January, Alas shared a behind-the-scenes photo of the 24-year-old entertainer wearing nothing but a gold thong and a blanket.
