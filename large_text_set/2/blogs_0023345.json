(Source: PTI) \nVoting for the fourth phase of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections started today in 53 constituencies spread over 12 districts. Fate of more than 650 candidates will be decided by 1.84 cr voters. Districts such as Raebareli, Mahoba, Hamirpur, Allahabad, Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Banda, Chitrakoot and Fatehpur are going to polls in this round. Around 25 per cent of voter turnout has been recorded till afternoon and electorates are coming in good numbers to exercise their voting franchise. Now, the the elections have drove into mid-stage and stakes are high for all major political parties including the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ), Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). For SP, phase 4 is most crucial as the ruling party holds 24 out of the 53 seats here. UP, over the past few months, has witnessed high-decibel election rallies and roadshows with all parties leaving no stone unturned to lure voters across the state. While the ongoing polls are touted to be a litmus test for SP, PM Narendra Modi -led BJP has made the road tough for the Akhilesh Yadav -led camp. The incumbent CM has managed to build an image of ‘leader for youth’ and have bagged huge vote bank in various regions of the state. His ‘kaam bolta hai’ campaign has gathered good response in rural as well as the urban areas of the state. However, there has been a little anger ire against him as some believe that he is the reason behind the failure of law-and-order in the state. \nMayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has made this election a crucial three-way contest. The party has cemented itself as one of lead contenders in this political run. However, BSP is still running short on numbers as compared to SP and the BJP apart from some particular communities. Even the Muslim community is supporting her in limited areas where the candidates fielded are very strong. This high-voltage assembly elections will lay the cornerstone for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. While SP aims at retaining its power, this time with the Congress, both BJP and BSP are fighting to make a comeback. \nNizamabad is constituency No. 348 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly.
