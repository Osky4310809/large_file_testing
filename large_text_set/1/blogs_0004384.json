The Obama administration never had a scandal, did they? \nIt was the most open and transparent administration ever , as they were so fond of telling us. \nAnything you may have heard to the contrary is just nonsense… \nFrom the NY Post: \n“The president prides himself on the fact that his administration hasn’t had a scandal and he hasn’t done something to embarrass himself,” [Adviser Valerie] Jarrett said in an interview broadcast on CNN Sunday. \nJarrett opined that it was because Barack and Michelle Obama were such ‘good people’ that that ‘resonates with the American people.’ \nNeedless to say, Jarrett’s opinion was not received well. \nTom Fitton of ‘Judicial Watch’ called Jarrett’s assessment ‘delusional.’ \n“The Obama administration has a scandal rap sheet longer than my arm. Between just the IRS abuses, Benghazi, and the Hillary Clinton scandals, this administration was even more corrupt than Nixon’s,” Fitton concluded. \nNot to mention Solyndra, Fast and Furious, the NSA spying scandal, and the spying on reporters. \nIf we expanded to cover whether Obama has ‘done something to embarrass himself,’ we probably would still be talking next week. From bowing to dictators to throwing our friends under the bus with the anti-Israel resolution, there’s a lot of embarrassing there.
