A post shared by ↠a d r i e n n e o s u n a↞ (@adrienneosuna) on Feb 17, 2017 at 9:07am PST \n“I knew I was getting smaller but I didn’t realize how drastic I had changed my body,” the photographer and nursing student told Us Weekly after her Instagram post went viral when she posted it last week. She wears the same pink tank in both photos, but it fits her body entirely differently in the “before” photo, at 182 pounds, compared with the “after” pic, at 180 pounds. \n“After several months and lifting weights and being really consistent, I posted a picture of me at the same weight but completely different body compositions, because I hadn’t even really noticed the dramatic difference myself until I put the pictures together,” she told Us .

(She fasts from 7 p.m. to 10 a.m., sipping on tea or sparkling water after a protein-rich dinner and drinking coffee with heavy cream in the morning.) Her fit photo has now gone viral, with more than 11,000 likes and commenters calling her “inspiring” and “motivating,” with one writing: “Y ss! Thats why i threw my scale out!!!” \nThe Morgan Hills, California, resident, who has been married for 10 years, tells Us that she is thrilled to have struck a chord with other women. “They’re very encouraged because they feel in bondage by the scale.” Since the post went viral she added 10,000 followers to her Instagram (she now has 36,000), where she chronicles her fitness journey. The Most Captivating Real-Life Stories of 2016 \n“It’s not all about the number,” Osuna says. “You can have incredible results without losing a pound. On any given day you can weigh a different thing, but if you change your body composition, you will look and feel and be stronger and better.” This Mom Documented Her 92-Pound Weight Loss on Instagram \nNow a size 10, Osuna is not done yet. Her size goal is a 6. But she says it’s not about a number. “My ultimate goal is to be strong and confident and comfortable in my body. I enjoy seeing what my body can do rather than how much it weighs.” \nWant stories like these delivered straight to your inbox? Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter!
