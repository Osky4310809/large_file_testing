Bush were growing worse. \nManafort’s arrangement was with Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally. Manafort signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006 and maintained a business relationship until at least 2009. The work was described in interviews with people familiar with it and confidential business records obtained by the AP. \nManafort confirmed to the AP that he worked for Deripaska but said the work was being unfairly cast as inappropriate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:22:40.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
