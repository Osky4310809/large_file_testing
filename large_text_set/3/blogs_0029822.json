We immediately went to the Louvre upon arrival in Paris, but I was so wiped out by jet lag, I sat down and fell asleep. The spot I had chosen, however, was actually an ancient work of art. Here’s what would have happened had I broken it. \nIt’s a nightmare scenario. You wander through a gallery of gorgeous artwork only to trip and accidentally punch a hole through a priceless painting. It actually does happen. In fact, a 12-year-old boy did just that to a 350-year-old painting by Paolo Porpora worth $1.5 million a couple years back . So, did the boy get trouble?

Also, if you damage a piece on purpose, it’s a very different outcome. You will be forced to pay for the repairs or cover its total value, and you might face criminal charges. \nSo, had I broken that Egyptian stone thing I napped on in the Louvre—which, I’m sorry, looked like a bench in my exhaustion—I probably would have been fine. I just have to live with the embarrassing memory of waking up to a crowd of staring museum goers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:27:22.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
