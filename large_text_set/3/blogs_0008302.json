Although season two of the HBO series isn't set to premiere until 2018, many fans are already wondering where exactly the sophomore season will go - and who of the large ensemble of characters will be a part of it. \nJimmi Simpson , who was involved in perhaps the most-theorized plotline of the first season, is just as uncertain as fans are. The actor recently spoke to GQ Style , and revealed that he does not know if his character, William, will be a part of the second season. \n\"So far, my involvement in [season 2] is unclear. If they have more for William, I would assume it would be a whole new kind of story. Because I feel like this story, the love affair [with Evan Rachel Wood’s character, Dolores], we know everything, we know what happens, we don’t have to belabor that point.\" \nFor any Westworld fans who need a quick refresher in the months that the show has been on hiatus, it was revealed in the finale that William is actually the younger villain of The Man In Black ( Ed Harris ), and that his involvement with Dolores was occuring decades prior to the main timeline of the show. \nWhile the finale did essentially conclude younger William's storyline, Simpson believes that there could be more story to be told there - especially something that would close the gap between the two periods of time on the show. \n\"But if they have a reason — I mean, it was the greatest set I’ve ever worked on. But we’re all speculating what season 2 will be, and I think it’ll be something that will blow our minds, to the degree that the first season did. But I wouldn’t be surprised if William showed up season 3 or something.\" \nEven if Simpson does not return in Westworld 's later season, he reassured that getting to be involved in the show was a worthwhile experience for him. \n\"I was delighted.\" Simpson explains. \"It’s some of the work I’m proudest of. A lot of times, I do work either on stage or on small-scale television that a lot of people miss. It’s so nice to feel proud of something that people are engaged in.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:22:47.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
