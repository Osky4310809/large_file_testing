For years the country has resisted the P5+1 negotiations on Iran’s nuclear future. \nBenjamin Netanyahu’s cartoon of a nuclear bomb which he presented to the UN General Assembly in September 2012 certainly grabbed the world’s attention. Having incessantly talked about “red lines” for Iran’s nuclear development, four years ago he literally drew one across the bomb to illustrate the point at which the international community should take decisive action. Netanyahu set his literal red line at the 90 percent threshold of uranium enrichment. \nUp until P5+1 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, plus Germany) announced the agreement with Iran in July 2015, to limit the country’s nuclear development in exchange for sanction relief, Israel was threatening to take unilateral action against Tehran. \nA day after the funeral of Shimon Peres, Jerusalem Post published the former president’s revelation which was shared with the publication two years ago, revealing that he was solemnly responsible for stopping Netanyahu’s plan. With this revelation, it seems that plans to attack Iran at the time were not just empty threats. \nThe conversation between Peres and Jerusalem Post Managing Editor David Brinn took place at the Peres Center for Peace in Jaffa on August 24, 2014. During the exchange, Brinn asked Peres what he would consider the greatest achievement of his presidency (2007-2014), to which the elderly president responded by saying that he had personally intervened to stop Netanyahu from attacking Iran’s nuclear sites.

I told him the consequences would be catastrophic,” Peres was quoted as saying. \nWhen asked by the publication if they have his permission to report on the claim, Peres replied: “When I’m dead.” \nAfter suffering a stroke, Peres died on September 28, 2016, near Tel Aviv, allowing his years-long claim to be made public. \nWhile details of the possible strike were not shared by the former president, the attack could potentially have followed the blueprint of Operation Opera, which was a surprise Israeli air strike on June 7 1981, that destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction 17 kilometers southeast of Baghdad.

I always suspected that Binyamin “There will never be a Palestinian State” Netanya-filth was capable of that, and many other atrocities. His, ah, “coalition government”, if you wanna call it that, has been leading Israel to ruin. They are badly in need of “regime change”. KelMac \nNetanyahu is correct, his logic makes sense. Far from’leading Israel to ruin’ he is saving it from that exact same thing. Iran IS the most dangerous regime in the world & has every intention of committing horrendous acts on the West & in particular — Israel. I am not Jewish nor Israeli, but I would support Israel 100% if it came to the crunch.The Iran regime would use every horrific weapon at their disposal to demolish America, Israel & their allies to further the spread of it’s barbaric ‘religion’ /ideology — thus controlling the world as they have been attempting to do for hundred’s of years. Islam is evil. Both need to be destroyed,completely & utterly. highlanderjuan \nYou may or may not be Jewish or israeli – that’s irrelevant – but you are absolutely following the zionist israeli PR line – distract and blame someone else for the problems that israel causes. In this case, blame Iran. That’s an ongoing and very immature reaction by zionists. Spoiled teenagers come to mind. \nAre you a zionist troll? \nAll humans who pay attention to middle east war problems know very well that it is zionist israel that is behind every war and behind every destructive act. Iran has not attacked any other country in hundreds of years. Israel has, on the other hand, been attacking everyone and everything around it. There has been no peace in the middle east since 1947-1948. Even the US has been attacked numerous times by israel (e.g. USS Liberty, 9-11). \nSadly, zionists now also control the American government, and that helps explain why the United States military has been involved in continual unconstitutional and unwarranted war for several decades. If we Americans can remove the zionists, the israel firsters, and the israeli dual nationals from our government, we may be able to experience peace once again. As it is now, however, we will likely see the destruction of our country because of the protocol driven madness of the zionist ideology. \nIt is zionists and zionism that must be destroyed. Leave Iran the hell alone. KelMac \nYour reply is irrelevant sir. I have no physical or cultural ties with Israel or any of it many opponents I am a police officer who works internationally frequently & have done for over 10 years. I come to my own conclusions by what I learnt, what I see & experienced. What I conclude is there is one race who are the snivelling, whining scum of the earth, with no empathy for the human race (other than their own genetic stock —& they murder them without a whimper) they degrade & despise women. Plus many other vile ‘customs’ which fit them neatly into the barbarian box. highlanderjuan \nInteresting response. My reply is irrelevant? Is that because I disagree with your ideology? International cop, eh? I’ll try not to hold that against you. I suspect that you have also been trained in israel, and that supports your zionist beliefs. \nRegarding race, you just don’t seem to tolerate Arabs as a race, which would make you a racist, eh? And I suspect that you believe the Jews are a race, but they are not. The Jews that control israel are all Ashkenazi Jews, DNA sourced from Khazaria. One Jew lawyer friend calls them Khazarian gypsies, and I think the term fits them quite well. \nLook, I’m not here to re-educate you, but by now, I should have raised a red flag with you, and how you respond to that red flag is up to you. My education in these matters is well founded, and I suspect that much of your own education has been compartmentalized. Mine hasn’t. \nI do hope that one day when you are successfully matured that you will see humanity through clear eyes and try to understand what your force and violence attitude has done to you and others. Believe it or not – there is a better way. \nHave a nice day. I think we’re done here. KelMac \nI’m flattered that I’m always a trending topic in your life. highlanderjuan \nOh, and BTW, I didn’t write this – a zionist Jew wrote this: \n“We Jews, we the destroyers, will remain the destroyers forever. Nothing that you will do, will meet our needs and demands. We will destroy forever because we need a world of our own, a God-world, which it is not in your nature to build.”— Maurice Samuel (Jew), You Gentiles, page 155, 1942 KelMac \nWaste your time hating me…I don’t give a darn. Think about it, Where’s your daddy, baby- When you’re ready for bed? Anonymous \nEveryone who disagrees with you is irrelevant, right? Blue lives may matter to you, but Blue LIES matter to us. Highlander said that you “may or may not be” Jewish or Israeli. He said that was irrelevant. However, you are STILL a Zionist, you are STILL an Israel Firster. You do not have be Israeli or Jewish to be an Israel Firster. There are many Goyim who are Israel Firsters. Since you seem to be so much “in the know” tell us then, when was the last time Iran attacked another country? highlanderjuan \nThanks, Anonymous. I suspect that all israel firsters like KelMac are what Bibi describes as useful idiots, and they will be the second to go at the hands of the israelis, right after the israeli truthers, eh? Anonymous \nYes, we think so too. But KelMac’s mind is already made up. Don’t try to confuse him with the truth. KelMac \nThat’s ok mate. Whoever ‘Highlander’ is I am sure he is omniscience (i bow to his ultimate wisdom). lol. Your own ‘all knowing’ supreme intelligence & knowledge is equally impressive. Finally, I have no idea what a ‘Goyim’ is or what is the difference between Jewish & Zionist — by the way ‘all-knowing’ one 🙂 I am an Australian ‘Firster’, Aussie all the way. But an Australian who loathes the unfairness & pure hatred that many feel for no apparent reason (except having the misfortune to be Arabic) towards the Israeli people. I have had the privilege of training with the IAF (for policing purposes) & believe they are the most amazing armed forces on the planet. S, spew away all you want, I feel nothing for your opinion.

Where’s your conscience, copper? \nMake the world a better place? F-ck no – just bomb the crap out of everyone with whom you disagree. \nYeah, that will work out well for everyone. Spoken like a true zionist israeli. KelMac \nMay I suggest you go to the library and brush up on your ignorance? Ciao! Anonymous \nBombs do NOT kill an ideology, they FEED it!!! Israel has been saying for YEARS that Iran was, at various times, months, weeks, even DAYS away from a nuclear bomb. So far, just a whole lot of empty, meaningless words. So far, no bomb. NOTHING!!! Just lies from Israel. \nIn 2002, Israel also claimed that an Iraq without Saddam would be a “peaceful place.” So, how did THAT turn out??? KelMac \nWe see things diametrically opposed mate. Lol @ ‘ISIL’is Israel. Wow, your imagination has no boundaries. Hit the books, go back to school, join a law enforcement agency (as I have –for plus 10 years now) but do try not to sit in judgement on a subject complex & composite as this is.(but, of course you will 🙂 ) highlanderjuan \nI suspect that you being a cop will be held against you, and not added to your credits. Most cops are now viewed as order followers and thus, non-thinkers. \n“The greatest crimes in the world are not committed by people breaking the rules, but by people following the rules.

I do believe you suffer from cognitive dissonance, and there really is no reason why anyone should try to appeal to your intelligence, because there just isn’t much there, mate. \nAustralia’s day in the sunshine is waning, and it is largely because of dead-heads like you. Have a nice day, and keep up the good work adoring and sucking up to the plantation masters. Anonymous \nWell…mate. You don’t know us. We were career military, handling stuff that would have you running home and crying to mama. We HAD to get it right…or a lot of people would die. KelMac \nAhhh — Mr Antisemite, yet again. I’ve come across rotting bodies that are less offensive than you are. Take a hike. Anonymous \nYou just love to throw that word around, don’t you? We took things that WERE said by Israel…and pointed out historic facts. But, rather than actually trying to make a counterpoint, you scream anti-semitism! You are the one who is offensive. You are offensively offended, snowflake. Need a “safe space” to run and hide, snowflake? highlanderjuan \nNice response, Anonymous. billdeserthills \nI think allowing Iran to enrich uranium will turn out to be a very bad idea for everyone, muslims included highlanderjuan \nWho are you, or who are any of us, to tell another country how to live its life as long as that country does not disrupt or attack our own country? If you want to know who the great destroyers are, look no further than at the illegal zionist state of israel. Iran has not attacked anyone in hundreds of years. israel on the other hand has directly and indirectly attacked its own neighbors as well as all countries that disagree with its protocol ‘we are god’ mentality. \nSo, yes, I get pissed off at zionist israel which controls my own country (the USA) as it does most western countries. If you want to get upset at an international unlawful organized gang, get upset at zionist israel. They are murderous b-stards of the highest order. billdeserthills \nI’m just a small voice of reason in an ocean of stupidity, who likes to see this country without the scars of a nuclear war–The zionists are no friends of mine either, but Iran and other muslim country’s do not look at life & morality in the same way as judeo-christian country’s do. They already have targets in mind to use their new bomb on, as soon as it is built–Encouraging your enemies to develop ever increasingly destructive weapons may be a good recipe for keeping the war effort moving, but it doesn’t encourage peaceful relations between unfriendly countries highlanderjuan \nInteresting. My only comment is that Judeo-Christian is an oxymoron. There is nothing Christ-like in anything Talmudic Jew or protocol zionist. Nothing. \nSo, is it safe to say that you believe that someone can tell another country how to live its life or defend its own territory? Try telling that to the occupied Palestinians who are being genocided by the israelis. billdeserthills \nI’m not a zionist, but it seems like the US is the king at telling others what they may do in their own country. If by occupied Palistinians, you mean he gobs of poor people the arabs keep shoving in just outside of Israel, I always did wonder how their numbers keep growing, all the time. Can we move some of our ‘deplorables’ over there as well & then claim they are actual Palistinians too?? America Firster \nAll of Israel is Occupied Palestine.
