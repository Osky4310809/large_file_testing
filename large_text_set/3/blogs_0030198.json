Moreover the Justice Department will require that jurisdictions seeking or applying for Department of Justice grants to certify compliance with 13.73 as a condition of receiving those awards.” \nSessions cited the Kate Steinle case, where a woman was shot and killed in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant who said he had sought out the city because of its sanctuary city policies. \n“The American people are not happy with these results,” he added. “They know that when cities and states refuse to help enforce immigration laws our nation is less safe. Failure to deport aliens who are convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk, especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators. DUIs, assaults, burglaries, drug crimes, drug rapes, crimes against children, and murders – countless Americans would be alive today and countless loved ones would not be grieving today, if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended.” Happy to have AG Sessions at the @WhiteHouse to talk about enforcing US laws to #MakeAmericaSafeAgain https://t.co/YKjHY3aONk \n— Sean Spicer (@PressSec) March 27, 2017 \nABC reported that in the current fiscal year, this action could affect as much as $4.1 billion in grants that are set to be dispersed by the Department of Justice. \nAbolishing sanctuary cities was one of President Trump’s constant promises at campaign rallies, and it was the focus one of the first executive orders from the White House of his term. Some cities have protested, including Los Angeles, whose mayor issued his own executive order that expanded sanctuary city policies to all city employees, commanding them to not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:50:32.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
