He was 66. The cause of death has not yet been released. \nColmes had been with Fox News since its inception in 1996, when then-CEO Roger Ailes asked him to join the infant network, which would soon grow to become the most watched of the cable news networks. \nWith Fox, the left-learning Colmes offered an intellectual counterpunch to Sean Hannity on the Hannity & Colmes program , stepping into that role after a string of successful radio shows on WNBC, WABC and WMCA in New York City.

In fact, it was quite the opposite, according to Hannity. He called their bond a “deep friendship,” offering his respects during an appearance Thursday morning on Fox News.

She issued the following statement: \nAlan Colmes passed away this morning after a brief illness. He was 66-years-old. He leaves his adoring and devoted wife, Jocelyn Elise Crowley. He was a great guy, brilliant, hysterical, and moral. He was fiercely loyal, and the only thing he loved more than his work was his life with Jocelyn. He will be missed. The family has asked for privacy during this very difficult time. \nNews of Colmes’ death rocked many members of the media, who offered their respects on social media.
