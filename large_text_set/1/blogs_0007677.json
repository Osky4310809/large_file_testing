He will later sign the contract along with president Daniele Sebastiani.\" \nGilardino, who has previously represented the likes of AC Milan, Fiorentina and Genoa, has 188 career goals in Serie A. \nThat record in front of goal has him level with Alessandro Del Piero and above Gabriel Batistuta in the league's all-time goalscoring charts. \nPescara are away to Napoli on Sunday. — Pescara Calcio (@PescaraCalcio) January 9, 2017 Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:00:19.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
