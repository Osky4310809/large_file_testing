There is no real history between Styles and McMahon, but a feud has been building between the two for weeks. As previously reported in the Inquisitr , Styles was “fired” from SmackDown last week after attacking McMahon in a parking garage. The segment saw Styles push McMahon through a car window, and later in the show, McMahon challenged Styles to settle their differences in the ring at WrestleMania 33 . Of course, that was never likely to be the end of the story. \nJust as Roman Reigns exacted his revenge on The Undertaker on Monday Night Raw , last night’s SmackDown saw McMahon claim retribution for last week’s attack by Styles. In the wake of last week’s incident Styles was fired from SmackDown by General Manager Daniel Bryan. As reported on the official WWE website , this week’s SmackDown opened with Styles barging into Bryans office to inform him that he was not fired. Styles went on to confront McMahon, to tell him that his challenge to meet at WrestleMania 33 was accepted. (Image by WWE) \nStyles told the WWE universe that he wasn’t sorry for attacking McMahon, and that he “enjoyed putting his fist into McMahon’s face,” and that seeing McMahons eye swelling up had made “his heart swell.” \nOne might have assumed that the buildup to AJ Styles vs. Shane McMahon was complete, but the WWE network had one more card to play. SmackDown closed with Styles waiting in the parking garage to ambush McMahon. Seemingly unknown to Styles, McMahon was in the ring calling him out. Styles made his way to the ring to face McMahon, and a war of words soon broke into something much more entertaining. Shane McMahon And AJ Styles Kick Off In A Scene Reminiscent Of Prince William’s Dad Dancing \nMcMahon had been in the ring calling out Styles to settle their differences “man to man.” McMahon claimed that Styles had “blindsided” him, and said that if Styles didn’t come to the ring he was going looking for him. Styles appeared saying that he was angry because he thought he had “the main event at WrestleMania , and now I don’t.” In a rather strange segment, Styles admitted that he “had made a mistake.” It seems that Shane McMahon wasn’t in a forgiving mood. (Image by WWE) \nStyles entered the ring saying that he wanted to “look McMahon in the eyes and sincerely apologize.” As soon as The Phenomenal One entered the ring, McMahon attacked. In a scene, reminiscent of Prince William’s “dad dancing” in Verbier, McMahon and AJ danced around the ring swinging at each other. Of course they ended up outside the ring, and as reported by Wrestling Inc ., the battle continued with McMahon smashing Styles through the announcer’s table and battering him with a monitor. The segment ended with McMahon pointing up at the WrestleMania 33 advertising sign, a clear message of intent for Styles. \nMany commentators have questioned the wisdom of putting Styles up against McMahon at WrestleMania 33. Styles is a prodigious talent, arguably the best wrestler in the WWE stable. Many feel his talents are wasted on a WrestleMania match with McMahon, but the WWE are facing a huge dilemma. Many of the WWE’s top stars are either retiring or are already semi-retired. Huge names like The Undertaker, Triple H, and McMahon himself are at the end of their careers. Others, like The Rock and Hulk Hogan, have left the WWE network for one reason or another. \nTo date, the WWE has failed to elevate any of its regular stars to the level of acclaim enjoyed by those legends who are at the end of their careers. The next year could well be a pivotal one for the WWE. Viewing figures have been dropping, and must be in danger of further falls, if people like AJ Styles, Roman Reigns, Bray Wyatt, and Braun Strowman don’t replace them. What better way, to elevate those stars in the eyes of the WWE universe, than have them defeat the legends at WrestleMania 33? \n[Featured Image by WWE]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:18:23.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
