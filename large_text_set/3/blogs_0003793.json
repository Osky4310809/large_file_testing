India was among InterNation's worst countries for expat quality of life. Danish Siddiqui/REUTERS \nIn a survey by InterNations, the world’s largest network for people who live and work abroad, the company asked 14,300 expats, representing 174 nationalities and living in 191 countries or territories, to rate 43 different aspects of life abroad on a scale of 1-7. \nFrom this, InterNations calculated the scores to get an overall average of the quality of life of people living in foreign countries. \nThe Quality of Life index took into account factors such as: Leisure Options; Personal Happiness; Travel & Transport; Health & Well-Being; and Safety & Security. \nIn January, Business Insider looked at the countries where expats have the best quality of life — with Taiwan topping that list. However, for every happy expat there is likely an unhappy one, and as a result, we decided to look at the countries InterNations says offer the worst quality of life. \nCheck out the 19 worst places for expat quality of life below: View As: One Page Slides 19. China — Regardless of its growing economic prosperity, China can be a difficult place for Western expats to settle thanks to its vastly different culture and language. It scored particularly poorly in Internations' health and well-being sub-index, ranking 64th out of 67 countries surveyed. ChinaFotoPress / Getty Images 18. Philippines — Ruled by controversial President Rodrigo Duterte, expats in the Philippines struggle most with poor travel and transport links, and a low score in the health and well-being sub index.

Uganda — Uganda's capital is home to a large expat population, but the country as a whole does not provide a great experience for expats. It scored poorly in three of Internations' five subindexes.

However, expats living there feel unsafe, with the country finishing 65th out of 67 in the safety and security subindex.

Ukraine — Ukraine's expat experience did not stand out in any particular category but scored fairly poorly across all categories. It was 41st in the travel and transport subindex.

Ireland — Ireland is perhaps the most highly developed of all the nations on this list, and is the only country in western Europe to score so poorly in Internations' ranking.

Qatar — The tiny Arab emirate has a huge number of extremely wealthy residents, but wealth divides in the country are stark. Expats complaining about a lack of leisure options — the country was 64th out of 67 in this category — helped push it towards the bottom of the ranking. Rafi Letzter/Tech Insider 12. Peru — Peru ranks as the second worst country for expats in South America for quality of life, with foreigners living in the country feeling unsafe. Peru was 59th out of 67 in the safety and security subindex. Peruvian police officers take part in an operation to fight crime in Callao, Peru, May 26, 2016. REUTERS/Janine Costa 11. Kazakhstan — Kazakhstan may not be the most obvious country for expats to move, and it scores poorly on Internations' list. Expats reported poor leisure options as well as bad health and wellbeing.

Only three nations ranked worse in that area.

However, expats do not have a great quality of life, with leisure options and health being major concerns. People crowd at a market next to railway station in central Mumbai January 16, 2015.

Kidnapping and gun violence are prevalent in Brazil's big cities. AP Photo/Felipe Dana 5. Saudi Arabia — With a huge oil industry, Saudi Arabia attracts its fair share of expats, many of whom bemoan a lack of leisure options and personal happiness. It was 66th in both those subindexes. Zainal Abd Halim/REUTERS 4. Egypt — Egypt scored poorly across the board in Internations' ranking, finishing below 60th in four of five subindexes. Its best score was 48th overall in the leisure options subindex. Tourists ride on camels next to the Pyramid of Khufu on the Great Pyramids of Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo, April 27, 2015.

It was dead last in both the leisure options and personal happiness subindexes. Reuters/Stephanie Mcgehee 2. Mozambique — Ranking 66th out of 67 in both the travel and transport and health and well-being subindexes, and 63rd for safety and security, the east African state of Mozambique is the runner-up for the worst quality of life among expats.

Nigeria — Hit by terrorism, a stalling economy and poor infrastructure, it is perhaps unsurprising that Nigeria ranks as having the worst quality of life for expats anywhere in the world. It was bottom of the table in both travel and health, and 66th in safety and security.
