CNN and CNN en Espanol conducted interviews in the U.S., Venezuela, Spain and the UK over the past year. \nAdditionally, CNN has obtained a confidential intelligence report from Latin American countries that links the new vice president of Venezuela, Tareck El Aissami, to the issuance of passports to individuals from the Middle East as well as people linked to the terrorist group Hezbollah. \nAlso featured in the series is an exclusive interview with the head of Europol, who reveals that fraudulent passports can enable terrorists to move freely around the world. \n“If we don’t get our arms around this, people are going to die,” warns Roger Noriega, former ambassador to the Organization of American States, as a Venezuelan passport is valid in more than 130 countries, not including the U.S. CNN Senior Investigative Correspondent Drew Griffin and Rafael Romo, CNN en Espanol Anchor and host of global affairs news program Mirador Mundial , led the coverage of this story with reports presented in both English and Spanish. The report will also be featured on CNN Digital platforms.
