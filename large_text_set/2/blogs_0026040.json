What does the ribbon -- the same one that Casey Affleck wore for Saturday's Independent Spirit Awards -- mean? It's all in support of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"This symbol of solidarity with the ACLU acknowledges the commitment of those on the front lines -- in the courts, legislatures and in the streets -- who are working to ensure that our precious freedoms and values are preserved,\" a statement from the organization explains. Here is the \"Stand WITH ACLU\" ribbon on Negga and Moonlight director Barry Jenkins: Photo: Getty Images As well as Kloss and Michelle Williams' date for the evening, Busy Philipps: Photo: Getty Images And the most adorable ribbon wearers: Miranda and his mother, Luz Towns-Miranda: Photo: Getty Images And though she didn't ultimately wear her ACLU ribbon on the red carpet, Brie Larson tweeted on Sunday morning, \"Proud to support @ACLU, @PPFA, and @glaad all day, everyday. #istandwithpp #standwithaclu #weresist\" â€” Brie Larson (@brielarson) February 26, 2017 Meanwhile, Negga revealed to ET on the red carpet why wearing the ribbon meant so much to her. \"I'm a big fan and champion of theirs,\" she said. \"They change the Constitution for the better, and that's what they're about. They're about equal rights for all, unequivocally. That's what we should all be about.\" RELATED SLIDESHOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:17:34.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
