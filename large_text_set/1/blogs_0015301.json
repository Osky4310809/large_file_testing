Hooper: This is career ending 2:19 \nNRL: James Hooper updates us on the Jarrod Mullen situation. January 17th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/NRL/ Hooper: This is career ending \nFortunately the Knights have a host of youngsters pushing for a regular gig in the NRL side. \nJaelen Feeney is also on the books and considered a half after a failed attempt to transform him into a fullback last year. \nBut Jack Cogger and Brock Lamb are two young prospects the Knights see having a bright future with the club. \nSo much so, Mullen had spent time training at hooker during the pre-season. \nThe No. 9 is another position they aren’t lacking depth in. media_camera Playmaker Jarrod Mullen at training. \nPremiership winner Rory Kostjasyn left North Queensland for the Knights during the off-season, while Danny Levi and Tyler Randall are also on the books. \nFormer Manly backrower Jamie Buhrer has also spent time at hooker. \nWhile playmaking responsibilities will fall directly on the shoulders of Trent Hodkinson this year, they do have a handful of experienced players to call on to help him lead the team. \nBuhrer has over 100 first grade games to his name, as does exciting centre Dane Gagai. \nWhat does this mean financially to the club? \nIf Mullen, 29, is to accept the result and cop the four-year ban, his NRL career will be over. \nWith two years to run on his contract, the Knights’ playmaker is on a deal worth close to $600,000 a season. \nIf Mullen’s Knights’ career does come to an end then they have $1.2 million to splash on the open market. media_camera Knights players at training. \nTrent Hodkinson is also off-contract at the end of the season as are a host of big name halves. \nLuke Brooks, Ben Hunt, Shaun Johnson, Anthony Milford, Mitchell Pearce, Gareth Widdop, Jack Bird, Mitchell Moses, Chad Townsend and Josh Reynolds all feature on the unsigned list. \nIt’s no secret the club is chasing a marquee forward and recently made a play at Roosters enforcer Dylan Napa. \nAaron Woods, Kane Evans, Ben Matulino, Matt Scott, Jordan McLean and Adam Blair are among the names without deals after this year. \nHow much more can the Knights take? \nThe Steel City has copped an absolute hammering in recent years, and Knights fans are entitled to ask when they cop a break. \nPlans were already in the works for life without Mullen, his dodgy hamstrings have had the club on notice for a while and there is a good crop of young halves to build their future around. \nBut a drugs scandal is flat out devastating, particularly for a club man as popular as the 29-year-old local junior. media_camera Nathan Tinkler during his time as owner of the Knights. \nToss it on top of Nathan Tinkler’s tumultuous ownership saga, Alex McKinnon’s tragic injury, Wayne Bennett’s walk out and two wooden spoons and the joint could understandably be at breaking point. \nThing is but, Novocastrians are a resilient lot. Nathan Brown issued a call out to fans to get around his young, locally sourced side as they were being flogged up and down in 2016. \nAnd so Newcastle did, with an average home crowd in excess of 14,000 leaving plenty of bigger Sydney clubs in the shade. \nNewcastle will endure, but they sure could do with a good news day. \nDoes this open the door for Carney or Sandow? \nNo. Nathan Brown has been clear in the direction he’s leading the football club. \nWhile Todd Carney and Chris Sandow have been eyeing an NRL return, the Knights are highly unlikely to extend the olive branch. \nBoth players would need the NRL to approve any proposed deal but with Cogger, Lamb and Hodkinson on the books, it’s hard to see Brown calling on the bad boys anytime soon. media_camera Brock Lamb of the Knights is tackled. \nAlready Brown has pushed out several high profile players on big money and backing a youth policy rather than chase a quick fix. \nKorbin Sims is the latest high profile player slated to leave the club in order to free up cash. \nSims has been linked with Brisbane and South Sydney this week. \nIs this the end for Mullen? \nMullen’s career is currently in tatters. \nHe’s already returned a positive A-sample and has the option of having his B-sample tested by January 31. \nIf Mullen is indeed banned by ASADA and cops a four-year suspension, at 29 years old, his 211-game career is almost certainly over. \nThe Knights star has been hampered by hamstring injuries over the past few seasons and only recently quashed talk of hanging up the boots. \nBut a ban will most likely fast track that retirement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T08:58:03.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
