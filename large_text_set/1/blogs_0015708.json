In the aftermath of Mona Lisa and Vikrant Singh Rajpoot’s marriage, Manveer Gurjar and Manu Punjabi are discussing that how their interpersonal relationships seem to have changed post the wedding and that he has been feeling a rush of emotions which is quite disturbing. Bigg Boss calls Mona Lisa and Vikrant in the confession room and tells them that it’s time for Vikrant to leave and make an exit from the house. Mona gets teary-eyed and bids goodbye to her husband. Upon Vikrant’s exit, the contestants go back to their normal selves and arguments and bickering once again begins. \nMona Lisa talks about how she feel the burden of changing herself since she got married. She tells everyone how she feels guilty for wearing western clothes and dancing. Manu finds Mona’s behaviour towards him very strange and confronts her about it. Mona tells him that matters related to their friendship are being glorified and blown out proportion outside the house and it has been bothering her. She adds that after her marriage, she can’t afford to make any wrong move or take any wrong decision that will have a ripple effect on their life. Manu confides into Manveer and tells him that its Vikrant who has manipulated Mona and has drilled random thoughts into her head.

The housemates are divided into two teams- Team Manu consisting of Manveer, Lopamudra Raut, Manu while Team Rohan Mehra consisting of Mona, Bani J, Rohan. On the first day of the task, Manu, Manveer, and Lopa are tied to a bungee cord and are asked to put their hands on a red circle placed at a distance in the garden area. The trio has to stretch the cord and take a position next to the red mark with their hands firmly placed on it at all times. They have to make sure that the majority of their team members survive in the said position for the longest time and if they are able to do so, they get a special power to save themselves from the next nominations. Team Bani has to displace Team Manu from the red mark. \nBigg Boss also announces that Rohan will also stand a chance to save himself from evictions. Lopa, Manveer, and Manu gear up for the task and take their positions near the red mark. As the task commencement buzzer rings, Bani and Rohan start irritating Team Manu. They try to distract them by putting ice cold water, oil, spices, curd, sawdust and ice cubes on them that give them shivers and makes them feel disgusted. As Bani attacks Lopa by pouring water on her, they both have a verbal spat that has absolutely no effect on Bani.

Bani and Rohan then get vegetable oil and pour it on them. While Bani is putting curd on Lopa, she brushes against Manu as a result of which Manu’s hand gets displaced from the red mark. While Manu loses out on his chance in the game, Lopa and Manveer tirelessly work towards winning the task and withstand all the attacks. Manu gets upset with Lopa over this. Manu decides to stand there anyway to be a part of the game. Lopa keeps pushing the can of oil from Bani’s hand but she still keeps doing it. She even puts curd on Lopa’s head and dress. \nThey even break eggs on Lopa and Manveer’s helmet along with whipped cream. The contestants tell Lopa that she is out of the game but she refuses to budge. She leaves once Bigg Boss asks her to leave. Lopa loses her cool on Rohan and Bani and she tries protecting Manveer despite him asking her to leave. Manu asks everyone to keep pouring water on Manveer so he doesn’t feel too cold. Manveer starts shivering but still stands strongly. Lopa tries to snatch the rule book from Bani so she stops blowing air on Manveer. \nManu takes the sheet of paper from her and lets her keep the file. Lopa discusses how disappointed she is with Rohan’s behaviour. Manu motivates Manveer to stay strong and the poor chap does the task with a smile. Manu starts crying looking at his best friend’s state. But he still motivates Manveer to keep going on. Lopa, on the other hand, asks him to leave and not go through all of this as Rohan keeps pouring water on him. Manu and Manveer start singing to distract themselves. \nManu taunts Rohan for being so ruthless and merciless. He also warns them that they will have to go next and he will be the one torturing them. Just then, Bigg Boss announces that task is over for the day and all contestants gather to help him out. Bani and Rohan decide to hide ice and a few other things. Manu decides to seek revenge from Rohan and Bani after what they did to Manveer. Manu and Manveer tease Mona Lisa with Vikrant before going to sleep.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T20:07:35.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
