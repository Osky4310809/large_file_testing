They’ve been well known to residents of India for years, but their fierce competition in the wireless space as of late has really allowed them to take hold in the market. Reliance Jio recently surpassed 100 million subscribers within the country and while that sounds like a huge number for some, it actually still puts them behind their direct competitors such as Airtel, BSNL, and Idea.\nStill, the company is on track to disrupt the wireless market in India and Google has seemed to take notice. The Mountain View technology giant has been focusing a lot of their efforts on India lately as they see it as a huge opportunity for growth in a mobile-first world. A new rumor that cites “industry sources” claims that these two companies are working together right now to create an affordable smartphone with plans to launch it before the end of 2017.\nIt’s unclear if it will be an Android One branded device or not, as there simply aren’t that many details to go on at this time. The rumor talks about this mystery smartphone working exclusively on the Reliance Jio wireless network though. It also claims that Google and Reliance Jio are working on making the wireless provider’s own applications “tightly integrated” into the Android platform. This could result in a smartphone with a better user experience and that could entice even more customers onto their network.\nThe sources cited by The Hindu Business Line also talked about Google and Reliance Jio working together on the software for Jio’s smart TV services. This is also said to be released sometime before the end of 2017, but the report didn’t disclose any further details. This type of partnership would let Reliance Jio release affordable hardware with decent specifications, while also letting Google get their services in front of even more people within the country.\nSource: The Hindu Business Line ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T19:14:13.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
