Reasons To Vote For Democrats Book Filled With 266 Blank Pages Share Share Tweet \nIt’s a bestseller . It’s doing well on Amazon. And it’s quite hilarious. Michael J. Knowles has a book called “Reasons To Vote For Democrats: A Comprehensive Guide,” and it’s completely blank . No, seriously--it’s 266 empty pages. Knowles, a Yale graduate, said that after observing the Democratic Party for 10 years on a variety of issues, it would be best to just leave the pages blank (via Fox News ): “It took a very long time to research this book,” Knowles said Thursday. “I’ve been observing the Democratic Party for at least 10 years now and when I observed their record and reasons to vote for them – on reasons of economics or foreign policy or homeland security or civil rights and so on – I realized it was probably best to just leave all the pages blank.” This book - Reasons to Vote for Democrats - is 266 blank pages. It is the #7 best-selling book on Amazon. https://t.co/HhV7qcgPDY — Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) March 8, 2017 \nIt’s the No. 4 bestseller on Amazon right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:09:08.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
