Awesome in the “huge and terrifying” sense. Despite the fact the entire nation watched Donald Trump speak in front of an audience a fraction of those we’ve seen come out for Barack Obama. Despite every network watching his limo roll past sad, empty bleachers for block after block. Despite the absolute fact that anyone can just flipping look at the relative puniness of his “crowd,” the Trump campaign is going all in a Big Lie right off the bat. \nOrganizers for Trump’s inauguration expected 800,00 . But what they got was something even smaller. While the National Park Service no longer provides crowd estimates (or tweets, thanks to Donald Trump) the former director of crowd logistics at the 2012 inauguration provided an estimate. \nTrump 2017: 250,000 Obama 2013: 1,000,000 Obama 2009: 1,800,000 \nWhat happens when reality doesn’t line up with Trump’s fantasy in which he’s the best at everything? Reality has to move. x — Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) January 21, 2017 \nNot only was Trump’s attendance a fraction of President Obama’s, even his television numbers were down. \nNearly 31 million people watched President Donald Trump’s inauguration, falling short of the audience that tuned in for Barack Obama eight years ago, according to Nielsen. \nPerhaps Spicer knows something about the viewership … in Moscow? x \nThat entire press statement was about humiliating the press and making them take it. If they submit this one time, it will get worse. — Ian Millhiser (@imillhiser) January 21, 2017 \nBy the way, for those who listened to the speech at the CIA and were confused by the on cue clapping and cheering, here are some comments from the people filming Trump’s speech to the CIA. x \nMore from CNN Prod per pool: \"...the persons who are on the side...are the ones clapping and reacting. We do not know who these people are.\" — Robert Gifford (@giff18) January 21, 2017 \nThe Trump campaign is trying to manufacture a story that Trump had great attendance at his inauguration, when the truth is the numbers were little short of pitiful. This is a simple, straightforward test of whether Trump will be able to say whatever he wants over the next four years without consequence. \nDo we have a free press, or not? x \nThis is a shot of the Mall from the Washington Monument yesterday at 11:59am ET.
