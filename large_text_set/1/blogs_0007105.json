Given its influence on pop culture and real-world science, it is no surprise that the movie has amassed an extremely devoted fan base over the years. One such fan took his love of Ridley Scott’s classic to a whole other level by recreating one of the film’s famous set pieces in VR.\nUsing the Unity engine, software engineer Quentin Lengele recreated the interior of replicant detector Rick Deckard’s apartment in VR. Anyone who has seen Blade Runner will instantly recognize all of the minute details contained within this virtual set. We not only get to see what each room of the apartment looks like, but we’re even treated to a bit of the futuristic Los Angeles landscape that’s visible from the balcony. This is truly remarkable work.\n“Blade Runner 9732” has been in development for a few years now. As you can see in the video, this is build 694. According to the video’s description, this version includes fine tuned particle systems, city mod & texturing enhancement, new police spinner animation & textures, better Global Fog settings, and fine tuned lens flares (among other things).\nAccording to Engadget , Lengele only had access to a first-generation Oculus Rift developer kit for this recreation. Deckard’s VR apartment already looks stunning when running on this relatively old VR tech, so one can imagine what Lengele would be able to produce with an updated version of the Oculus Rift.\nOne thing to note is that there will be an official Blade Runner VR experience that will coincide with the release of the Blade Runner 2049 film. It will be interesting to compare that VR experience to this fan-made one. Let’s just hope that Disney doesn’t decide to kill Lengele’s project before it is completed as it is obviously a huge labor of love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T13:54:15.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
