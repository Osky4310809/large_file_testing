The Football Whispers Index takes the latest transfer rumours and gives them a score out of five; the higher the score, the more realistic and reliable the whisper. \nHere are today's top five emerging whispers for the summer. And keep an eye on Transfer Talk for all the latest gossip. \nMario Gotze to Liverpool \nJurgen Klopp could reignite his interest in reuniting with former player Mario Gotze in the summer, according to Goal.com. The German boss had wanted to bring the World Cup winner to Anfield last summer, but Gotze chose a return to Dortmund from Bayern instead. However, things have not gone to plan for the 24-year-old, and the Germany international currently finds himself sidelined with a metabolic disorder. Considering Gotze's stock has fallen considerably over the last seven months, the Merseyside club are only going to be interested in a deal for the right price, while the player will also need to take a paycut. \nChristian Benteke to West Ham United \nCrystal Palace striker Christian Benteke is back on the Hammers' wanted list, with the East London club pondering a summer swoop for the Belgian, according to reports. Benteke is Palace's top scorer so far this season with 11 goals in all competitions, but the 26-year-old has frequently cut a frustrated figure for the Eagles. Should Sam Allardyce's side end up relegated in May they will likely have to offload a number of players, with the former Liverpool striker one of the most likely candidates. \nWilfried Zaha to Tottenham Hotspur \nAnother Palace star set for a summer exit from Selhurst Park is Wilfried Zaha, with Tottenham confident of landing the 24-year-old with a £30 million bid. The Sun is reporting that although the Ivory Coast international is wanted by RB Leipzig and Inter Milan, Mauricio Pochettino believes he's in pole position to sign the winger. Zaha was the subject of an unsuccessful £12m bid last year and is contracted to the relegation strugglers until 2020, but the offer of Champions League football, as well as a significant increase on his £40,000-a-week wages, could be too good to turn down. \nRaphael Varane to Manchester United \nJose Mourinho is set to return to his former club Real Madrid in a bid to bolster his defensive options, with United planning a summer move for Frenchman Raphael Varane, according to Spanish media outlet Don Balon. The Portuguese boss handed Varane his debut during his stint at the Bernabeu and is keen to be reunited with the 23-year-old France international. \nAlexis Sanchez to Chelsea \nArsene Wenger's decision to drop Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal's starting line-up for the weekend's game against Liverpool has fuelled speculation that the Chilean will leave the Emirates in the summer with the Daily Mirror insisting it could be for Chelsea. Sanchez looks certain to move on at the end of the season, but there will be a host of suitors for the 28-year-old's services, and it is unlikely the Gunners will be willing to sell to a direct rival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:29:02.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
