Michelle for its newest flavor, Southern Peach. Beginning in April, Southern Peach will only be available for purchase in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee, but a national rollout is planned for early summer. A post shared by K. Michelle (@kmichellemusic) on Mar 24, 2017 at 12:47pm PDT “Jack Daniel’s is a brand with rich history,” K. Michelle said in a press release. “Also being from Tennessee, I’ve always appreciated how JD falls in line with my southern values. This collaboration with Jack Daniel’s Country Cocktails is a celebration of all those values, and I’m excited to share that with my fans.” Initially, the celebrated whiskey brand linked up with the R&B singer for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey, and this time around, she worked closely with the team to craft Southern Peach from beginning to end, including the creation of the custom gold crown cap, which is exclusive to the Southern Peach flavor. “We are excited to team with K. Michelle for Jack Daniel’s Country Cocktails, Southern Peach,” Casey Nelson, Brand Director, Jack Daniel’s Flavor Portfolio, added. “K. Michelle has been a friend of Jack Daniel’s for quite some time, and we are excited to embark on this new journey together.” K. Michelle has already established herself as a successful entrepreneur and this is just one more notch to add to her belt. In the summer of 2016, she opened her own restaurant, Puff Lounge, and began her relationship with Jack Daniel’s in 2015 during her My Twisted Mind Tour. Later this year, Michelle plans on dropping her highly anticipated fourth studio album via Atlantic Records. Until then, revisit her new track with Rick Ross and Fabolous above.
