Mayor Francis Slay won 81 percent of Vollmer’s 10th Ward, which takes in the eastern edge of the Hill down to portions of Tower Grove South to the east and south. Last Tuesday, Krewson won 49 percent of the ward, with a majority of voters actually choosing other candidates, including Jones, Board of Aldermen President Lewis Reed and Alderman Antonio French. \nVollmer stood at Krewson’s right side the night of the victory party. Most of the old guard was there, as Krewson was backed by Slay. There was restauranteur Kim Tucci, and lobbyist Lou Hamilton. Former Mayor Vince Schoemel was there, and labor leader Jeff Aboussie. But in winning only 32 percent of the vote, and young progressives picking off another aldermanic seat, Krewson faces a different landscape than Slay ever did. \nHer challenge in building coalitions will be similar to the difficulty of getting an old warehouse torn down in a historic neighborhood, and replaced with an apartment and condo complex sure to bring younger residents — and lots of them — to a forever changed landscape. \nTenth Ward resident Andrew Arkills believes the change that is coming will be good for the city. \nHe sat through some of the meetings over the Sansone development over the past year, and said “the generational split was very evident.” \nArkills, 30, is the president of the Tower Grove South Neighborhood Association . He sees that area and its generally younger residents gaining in political power in the ward, most of which traditionally rested on the Hill. \nArkills, a consistent critic of how the city hands out tax subsidies, was a Jones supporter. He believes that younger voters like him are ready to take the mantle from the generation that still clings to power. \n“There is a reluctance overall in this city to do anything that isn’t the ‘St. Louis Way,’” he says. “We’re very insular.” \nHe sees the growth that will come from the proposed Sansone development as a necessary melding of old and new in St. Louis. The city is attractive to millennials in part because of the charm of its older neighborhoods and architecture, but it needs an influx of population — specifically young families — if businesses are going to locate here and grow the economy. Sansone plans to target graduate students and young professionals who will appreciate the walkable neighborhood and closeness to St. Louis University and Washington University’s medical complex. \nThat’s why Jeff Proctor, president of the Hill 2000 neighborhood association , said so many of the younger Hill families, many, like his, the next generation of Italian-Americans to love the neighborhood, were so much in favor of finding a workable development of the old, decrepit warehouse complex that was a blight on the area. \nProctor doesn’t see a battle between young and old but rather a passing of the torch from one generation to the next. \nIn some ways, even with Krewson winning, that’s what Tuesday’s election felt like. \nThe old St. Louis political division of black and white was replaced by young and old, and the young voters served notice: They’re here to stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T12:02:43.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
