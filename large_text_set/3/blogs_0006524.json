Chants against the church and Argentinian President Mauricio Macri rang out on Plaza Mayo as protesters attacked a large fence that was erected to protect the building by setting it alight with small bonfires. \nThe protest spiraled into violence when a man carrying a Vatican City flag stood in front of the cathedral. Several of the feminists tried to snatch the flag and hit out at the man before a group escorted him away. \nThe video was shared on a Facebook group called LGBTears. “This is a friend of ours. We met him years ago, and we know that he didn't hit anyone or incite violence,” the post accompanying the video said. “He went to defend the cathedral so that it was not vandalized. There are a lot of people saying he was smacking the participants of the March, but he didn't touch anyone.” Women´s Day at Plaza de Mayo.

La Nacion reports that 30 people were arrested. Videos from the scene show police dragging away women who were taking part in the demonstration.The cathedral emerged from the night of protest largely unscathed as the protective fence proved effective in saving it from the feminist’s missiles.

The Catedral Metropolitana was also the scene of demonstrations earlier in the day, with Pura Ciudad reporting that the left wing MST (Workers' Socialist Movement) party staged a gathering where they dressed as witches, complete with pointy hats, brooms and a steaming cauldron, to demand the separation of church and state. #AHORA : Gases, piedras y fuego en Plaza de Mayo.

Wednesday night’s events echo similar incidents on previous International Women's Days in Buenos Aries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T14:58:39.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
