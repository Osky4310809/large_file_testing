She’s still here! \nShe also blasted Trump over the wall, but spent years along with other stars in Malibu, trying to kick people off the beach by her house, constructing a wall to keep people out. \nGuess it’s walls for me but not for thee. \nIf she shed the weight of hypocrisy, she’d be a lot thinner… googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T06:17:04.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
