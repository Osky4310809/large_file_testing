Ellen DeGeneres! Wanda Sykes! Colton Haynes!” (Don’t shake your head at Colton Haynes, please.) I’d follow those with the breathless delivery of five to twenty additional names, which I probably shouldn’t write out here for legal reasons. \n\nBut Key, a straight man, had some trouble. This is fine! It’d be hard for me to list 10 straight celebrities if confronted by a shrieking Billy Eichner because I’m convinced that roughly 75% of famous people are gay! But that’s my problem, and this is about Key. In 60 seconds, he only names four gay celebrities, and one of them is the gay man standing in front of him.\nAdvertisement \n\nWhen the countdown begins, Key shouts:\n“Uhhh, Billy Eichner! Neil Patrick Harris! Rosie O’Donnell!” \nCorrect! Correct! Correct!\n“Raven-Symoné!”\nCorrect again! Good one, Key!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:27:31.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
