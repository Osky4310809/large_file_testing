Queensland won the title in 2012 in front of a smattering of fans at the Gabba. (AAP: Dan Peled) \nWatching Australia’s best cricketers play at the MCG or the Gabba and hearing the crack of bat and ball turn into an awkward echo around the empty expanses must feel like a dagger in the heart of every Aussie cricket traditionalist. \nGiving top-flight sport to audiences who don’t always get the chance to see it is a good tactic, often utilised for one-off rugby league games that are losing steam — recent examples include the City v Country match and the All Stars game. \nBut did the game truly exhibit the best of Aussie cricket? \nSlowing things to a crawl was Victoria’s prerogative, but it hardly seems like the best thing for a competition that is bordering on irrelevance with the general public. \nDuring the season, SA’s Chadd Sayers took a record 62 wickets. Did you know? \nCould you name the top run-scorer for the season? A few could, sure, but not many. (It was Ed Cowan with 959, by the way) The Sheffield Shield matters All eyes were on the Sheffield Shield for a week in November as the Test team faced an overhaul. (AAP: Dave Hunt) \nThe first-class competition is a hugely important part of deciding Australia’s Test team, as we found out late last year. \nWe caught a brief glimpse of what life could be like in mid-November, when Australia’s selectors were hunting for some talent in the wake of the embarrassing capitulation to South Africa at Bellerive Oval. \nAll of a sudden, names like Peter Handscomb, Marcus Harris, Matt Renshaw and Kurtis Patterson were on the tips of everyone’s tongues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T12:06:54.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
