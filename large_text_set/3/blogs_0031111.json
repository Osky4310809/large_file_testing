According to reports from The Wall Street Journal and Axios , the company is working on an initial public offering for 2018. \nBuzzFeed has already raised hundreds of millions from VC firms and NBCUniversal. And if you’ve raised a ton of money in order to grow rapidly, you don’t have many options. Either you go public, or you get acquired at some point. And it looks like the company would rather go public. \nBuzzFeed gained initial traction by publishing viral stories.

BuzzFeed also invested heavily into videos and a cooking vertical with Tasty . \nWhile NBCUniversal is by far the biggest investor in BuzzFeed, the IPO reports prove that an acquisition isn’t planned. NBCUniversal is also an investor in Vox (The Verge, Recode, Racked, Polygon, etc.).
