According to the American Academy of Dermatology, the condition can result in bald patches, total hair loss on the head, or total hair loss on the head and body. Boone decided to let his hair grow for two years and then donate it to Ruiz so she could get a wig made by Children With Hair Loss , an organization that provides wigs at no cost for kids who have lost their hair. \nIn a video for ABC Action News , Boone talked about his friendship with Ruiz, and about growing out his hair. \"I’m growing my hair to give to Gabby — I just want to make her happy,\" he said. \nRuiz helped cut Boone's 12-inch long ponytail before he was treated to his first haircut in two years. In the end, Boone looked completely different. \nSince the video was shared on Dec. 29, it has received over 113,000 views. Many are commenting about Ruiz and Boone's strong bond and what an inspiration Boone is. \nOne Facebook commenter wrote, \"This is so sweet, I am so happy when I hear stories like these ... makes me think there are so many good men, women and children out there still, even when I was giving up thinking there were ... \" \nAnother said , \"If half the people on [the] planet had this kid's heart, the world will be a heaven to live on.\" \nAs for Ruiz, she told ABC Action News , \"Tyler's a great person ...\" \" ... He's amazing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T17:49:44.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
