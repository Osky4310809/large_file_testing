Why would you do that?\"\nThe Knicks  cut arena music, videos and in-game entertainment from the first half of their game against the Golden State Warriors at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. Nothing made noise in dead ball situations aside from the sounds of announcers, whistles from referees, and crowd chatter. It was uncomfortable to watch, and the experiment did not sit well with Draymond Green.\n\"That was pathetic,\" Green told reporters after his team's 112-105 win. \"It changed the flow of the game. It changed everything. You get used used to playing the game a certain way.\"\nMSG is going old school and playing no music, video or in-game entertainment for the first half. This is what it sounds and looks like: pic.twitter.com/PxYJp1CpIt \n— Ohm Youngmisuk (@NotoriousOHM) March 5, 2017 \nAthletes are listening to music all the time on their way to the game, in the locker room, and they're accustomed to having background music while they're warming up and playing. Green thought the absence of music changed the game, and also felt for those whose jobs were put on hold during the breaks from gameplay.\n\"To completely change that, to me I think it was disrespectful to everyone from Michael Levine to Rick Welts and all these people who've done these things to change the game from an entertainment perspective and I've the game a great vibe. That's complete disrespect because you advance things in the world to make it better; you don't go back to what was bad.\"\nDraymond just destroyed the idea of playing no music during the game, calling it \"disrespectful\" and \"trash.\" pic.twitter.com/Zes1cCwvsK \n— Ohm Youngmisuk (@NotoriousOHM) March 6, 2017 \nThen Green compared the 24 music-less minutes to a step back in technology.\n\"And so it's like computers can do anything for us -- it's like going back to paper. Why would you do that?\"\nDraymond was clearly NOT ok without his tunes.\n\"Did you see that first half? It was just bad. Sloppy, all over the place. It was no rhythm too the game. All that stuff makes a difference in the game, believe it or not.\"\nThe Warriors shot 36 percent from the field and 35 percent from three in the first half without music, and 56 percent from the field and 40 percent from deep in the second half with music.\nMaybe he has a point.\n\"[Music] just helps you get into a certain area, takes you to a certain place. And so I don't think they were doing it to like throw us off, but it definitely threw the entire game off. And they need to trash that because that's exactly what it was.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:13:15.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
