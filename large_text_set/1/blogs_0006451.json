Michelle would also have to dish on her thoughts upon meeting with President-elect Donald Trump’s family and her real feelings about Hillary. \nIn order for Barack Obama to pull down the big money, he too would have to give up interesting information such as information on Hillary Clinton and her email server or Benghazi. \nIf either actually gave up the interesting dynamic with the Clintons, that would be a blockbuster, as many people believe the couples dislike each other and the association was one of political convenience. \nAnything on that or any of the scandals would certainly draw an audience.
