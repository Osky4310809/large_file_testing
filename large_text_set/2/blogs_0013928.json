Ava is precious. We do not deserve her. \n2. Children are stupid and terrifying. They’ll just peace the fuck out in the middle of the night and wind up with their soft, undeveloped heads caught in a bush because “OOOH BOO-BERRIES!” Like any self-respecting American, I blame the media. You see that Dora the Explorer shit kids are watching these days? “Let’s go through the BIG forest… over the loooong river…” NO. SHUT YOUR MOUTH DORA YOU EVIL BITCH. Let’s not go through any forests or over any rivers and maybe just sit in the corner and play with blocks or some shit so daddy can lie down. I will never judge a parent for keeping their kid on a leash like it’s a damn dog because kids are stupider than dogs, as this story has proven.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:38:18.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
