Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA \nThat didn’t take long. \nJust a day after Britain triggered article 50, one of the City’s most established names announced plans to open a new office in Brussels. \nLloyd’s of London, the insurance market that famously began in a coffee house, will create a subsidiary in the Belgian capital so it can retain its ‘passporting rights’ in Europe. Those rights are essential to keep offering financial services across the EU from. \nUnder the plan, Lloyd’s will have its new office ready in time for the 2019 underwriting season -- to minimise the disruption from Brexit. Up to 100 staff are likely to move. \nCEO Inga Beale says it will provide ‘efficient’ access to Europe, adding: \n“It is now crucial that the UK government and the European Union proceed to negotiate an agreement that allows business to continue to flow under the best possible conditions once the UK formally leaves the EU. I believe it is important not just for the City but also for Europe that we reach a mutually beneficial agreement.” \nHere’s Julia Kollewe’s news story on the announcement, and Lloyd’s latest financial results: Lloyd's of London plans to open Brussels office by start of 2019 Read more 08:05 The agenda: German inflation and US growth figures \nGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. \nThe City feels rather subdued this morning after the drama of seeing Britain hit the exit button to quit the European Union yesterday. \nTraders are watching to see how the opening exchanges pan out...and there are already worrying signs, with EU officials unhappy that the UK is threatening that security co-operation will suffer unless it gets a decent deal. Brexit: EU condemns May’s ‘blackmail’ over security cooperation Read more \nInvestors may also be alarmed that the two side are also at odds, already, over the negotiating process. Britain wants to discuss the terms of the divorce, and the future relationship, at the same time - but Germany insists the exit bill is agreed first. Angela Merkel rejects one of Theresa May's key Brexit demands Read more \nSo faced with this impasse, investors are taking a cautious approach this morning. \nAnd that means the pound is serenely flat in early trading, at $1.243 a gainst the US dollar. It’s equally unruffled against the euro, at €1.1551 - the same as last night. \nEquities are calm too, with the FTSE 100 gaining 8 points in early trading, to 7382 points. No drama here (yet anyway). \nFXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed believes Brexit will be a tricky event for the City. Traders haven’t seen such a historic event before, and \nWednesday marked the official countdown of UK’s divorce from the EU, ending a 44-year relationship with its neighbors. The end of this relationship is of course painful, but many agree that this marriage was not a case of love at first sight after all. Investors decided not to take any significant action on Wednesday, the GBP-USD traded within 70 pips trading range, and all major European equity markets closed higher. \nPredicting currency movements was never an easy task, and in the pound’s case it’s even a more complicated situation given that we never experienced such a divorce in the past. Economic conditions in the U.K. are in a much better shape than what was anticipated nine months ago, with most economic indicators surprising to the upside. Meanwhile, the BoE is likely to turn more hawkish as the depreciation of sterling continues to feed through to increased prices. These factors helped the pound to find a floor in the past 6-months, but the forward outlook will much depend on how negotiations progress in the next couple of months. Coming up this morning. \nThere’s some interesting economic data on the calendar today, which might move the markets. \n10am BST: The latest Eurozone economic confidence reading; expected to be a little higher this month as the European economy picks up \n1pm BST: German inflation figures for March. The CPI rate is expected to drop to 1.8%, down from 2.2% in February, partly because Easter comes later this year. A higher reading would increase the pressure on the European Central Bank to rein in its stimulus measures \n1.30pm BST: Updated US GDP figures for the last quarter of 2016. Economists predict that the annualised growth rate could be revised up to 2.0% (or 0.5% quarter-on-quarter), from 1.9%.
