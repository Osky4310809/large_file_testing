Barring a deal on visit today with #Seahawks , ex- #Packers tight end Jared Cook’s next visit will be with … the #Vikings , source said. — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) March 14, 2017 \nCook was a huge asset to the Packers last year, becoming a go-to target for Aaron Rodgers and finishing the season with 30 catches for 377 yards and one touchdown in just 10 games with the team. \nThere is a connection to Minnesota for Cook as he played with now Vikings quarterback Sam Bradford back in St. Louis where Cook had some of the best seasons of his career. \nKyle Rudolph is currently Minnesota's tight end and there is likely little chance that signing Cook would affect Rudolph's place with the team in any way. The league is trending toward teams having two big, pass-catching, play-making tight ends, and Cook certainly fits that bill.
