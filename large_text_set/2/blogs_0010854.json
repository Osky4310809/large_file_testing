If you’re just now learning the news, allow me to welcome you to planet Earth. She is also slated to perform at Coachella in April, and perform she will — probably. \nAdvertisement \n\nSources say that at the Grammys last night, a member of her production team asked Bey about the spring music festival. She responded that those plans remain unchanged so long as her health is up to par. Delivering twins may bring an increased necessity of bed rest, so perhaps Beyoncé is thinking in those terms. Seems reasonable!\nThat said, Beyoncé has promised to compensate her team regardless of whether or not she performs. A good queen always does right by her people, after all.\nAdvertisement \n\nHowever, Bey has not disclosed how many months pregnant she is and, apparently, some of her production team hadn’t seen her baby bump until Sunday night — thus the backstage discussion. \nAs for me, I’m just thrilled for the endurance of the Knowles gene. Goodness knows that family is a blessing upon our scorched earth.\n[ TMZ ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:37:44.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
