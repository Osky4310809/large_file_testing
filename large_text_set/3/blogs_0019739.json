(Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n\"I think where Pep wants to bring Man City, that's competing in the Champions League and Premier League, he simply doesn't have the players to do it. The Man City players are just not good enough to get to that level. \n\"You can't compare where City are with Barcelona and Bayern Munich when he got to those clubs and I think this will confirm Pep's thoughts from over the last few months. (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"You need a big setback in a big game to confirm it and to say to the owners; we need to get four, five, six top quality players into the club. \n\"Otherwise when they are at this stage of the competition again next year, they are going to have exactly the same problems.\" poll loading How many trophies will Man City win this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T13:15:02.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
