In no country did the percentage that disagreed surpass 32%.” \n“(This) means your voters have a harder line position on this than Donald Trump, or myself, or frankly any party sitting in this parliament,” asserted Farage. “I simply cannot believe that you are blind to the fact that even Mrs. Merkel has now made a u-turn and wants to send people back.” \n“The fact is: the European Union has no future at all in its current form, and I suspect you’re in for as big a shock in 2017 as you were in ’16.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:44:50.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
