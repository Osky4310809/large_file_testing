The side’s brand of footy restricted its ability to attack and limited its players’ ability to express themselves on the field. \nChampion Data logged Richmond as having the second-highest amount of disposals in its defensive half in the league and the second-lowest metres gained per kick. \nThe board — and certainly not the fans — perhaps wouldn’t have tolerated another year of dour footy. \nBut they need not worry. Three goals inside the first eight minutes had many predicting a blowout, with a seven-goal opening term virtually enough to kill the match as a contest. \nLIVE stream every game of every round of the 2017 Toyota AFL Premiership Season on FOX SPORTS.

It’s first class at the moment.” \nBut this wasn’t all about youthful exuberance for the Tigers. \nRichmond blended their promising youngsters with a trio of handy recruits and a top-tier of talent that is good enough to mix it with the best. \nDustin Martin more than likely has three Brownlow votes to his name as a result of his starring performance against the Blues, while Alex Rance is undoubtedly the best defender in the game. Dustin Martin starred on Thursday night. Picture: Wayne Ludbey Source: News Corp Australia \nWhen you consider the club also has a Brownlow Medalist and a two-time Coleman Medal winner in Trent Cotchin and Jack Riewoldt respectively, perhaps September isn’t out of the equation for the Tigers. \nIt certainly isn’t if they retain a game plan as free flowing and attractive as the one they produced on Thursday night. \nHarder tests await the Tigers — next week’s fixture against Collingwood already looms as a defining game — but the draw has been kind to them. \nWith only one match against a finals opponent from last year in their first five weeks, Richmond has a valuable chance to build momentum. And we all know how important that can be on the Tiger Train. \nFor now, though, those supporters can simply enjoy a satisfying season-opening victory — an emotion they could barely muster throughout last season. \nHardwick, meanwhile, can enjoy the fruits of an exhilarating new game plan. \nOn Thursday night, his numbers at the opinion polls might even be higher than Donald Trump’s. And Richmond might be on its way to being ‘Great Again’.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:22:20.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
