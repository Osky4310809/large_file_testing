The Southeast Asian city-state regards both the U.S. and China as “friends and do not want to have to choose between them,” the prime minister added. \nFears of a U.S-China trade war are high and should President Donald Trump act on his campaign promise of imposing tariffs on the mainland, a country he blames for the loss of American jobs, global exports and imports are expected to suffer. \nSingapore, home to one of the world’s busiest ports, stands to particularly suffer as its economy is heavily reliant on international trade. The island nation also maintains deep, strategic ties with both Washington and Beijing. \n“Singapore is clearly deeply annoyed at the U.S. abandoning TPP,” said Chovanec, referring to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that had been scuttled by the Trump administration. \nBefore the U.S. presidential election, Lee was “already quite outspoken” in saying abandoning the deal would be big mistake for the U.S., and damage its credibility in the region, Chovanec explained, adding that some may be underestimating the cost to the U.S. \n“Singapore is more important than it might seem, at first glance, because of the quiet but strategically important security relationship it already has with the U.S., which relies on Singapore as a regional supply base for naval operations,” he said. “If abandoning TPP, along with other moves, cause Singapore and other countries in Asia to see the U.S. an unreliable partner, the implications could be quite serious.” \n—Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:23:05.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
