She would often travel with the Obamas when they went on vacation and attended family dinners in the private residence of the White House. Jarrett was dubbed the \"The Night Stalker\" by other White House staffers because she was often seen following Obama from the West Wing to the private residence.\nAccording to the Daily Mail , Jarrett has moved in with the Obamas so she could work closely with former president on his post-presidency plans and travel around the world with Michelle Obama. One of those post-presidency plans is reportedly to undermine his successor, President Donald Trump.\nObama had previously promised to follow the lead of his predecessor, former President George W. Bush, and not comment on the Trump presidency. After the election, Obama said he intended to be respectful to the office of the presidency and give Trump a chance to enact his agenda.\nObama's former attorney general, Eric Holder, recently stated that Obama is ready to reenter the world of politics, however.\n\"It's coming. He's coming,\" Holder said. \"And he's ready to roll.\"\nThe Trump administration has been hit by a series of leaks to news outlets about senior Trump officials having contact with Russian officials during the presidential campaign. Trump has blamed the leaks on Obama. There have so far been 40 leaks of classified information designed to undermine the Trump administration, the Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday.\nThe New York Times reported that Obama officials left a trail of evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election and communication between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\nObama himself has not commented on the situation since leaving office. He recently came back from vacation and announced a $65 million book deal .\nThe post Report: Valerie Jarrett Is Moving Into Barack Obama’s New DC Home appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T19:17:51.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
