He explains the stories behind the photos: ‘Stephen held the door for me as I entered the local 7/11 in the Lower East Side of NYC. As I invited him in the store with me to offer him some refreshments, the clerk gave him a bit of a problem. I told the clerk “he’s with me”, as Stephen said “I’m with him”’. Bustos appears at Cut festival , London, from 25 February until 2 March. All photographs: William Yan ‘Stephen’s haircut is a simple way to show the world how one’s demeanour can transform during the service, no matter who you are – homeless or not’ ‘Uncle Chen was living under a bridge in Guangzhou, China. This photo is from the moment he could see his new look. Shortly after meeting him, I was contacted by friends from China that he had been killed in a car accident’ ‘This girl was living with her brother and mother under the same bridge as Uncle Chen. The innocence of this beautiful little girl, who was at first afraid of the water dripping into her eyes, showed me that trust is granted, not given’ ‘A short walk from my own family’s home in the San Nicolas area of Masantol in the Philippines. This cemetery is what many families and children call home. Many children living in this cemetery do not have parents – the community all comes together to take care of one another’ ‘Across the street from the cemetery, there is a row of squatter homes above sewage water. This woman is paralysed from the waist down, and has not had her hair cut in ages’ ‘Behind the elementary school that my mother attended in the Philippines, and where my grandmother was a well-respected teacher, there is a community of squatter homes. Donna was one of the many children living among the homes, and was extremely charming’ ‘This young man’s “father” insisted that he get a haircut instead. Although it wasn’t his real father, it was someone that this young man was able to look up to, living without a home in New York’ ‘Larry was excited about his haircut, but hesitant to remove his hat to expose his thinning hair. Downtown Chicago was rumbling with protestors chanting and bars overflowing during St Patrick’s Day festivities. Even for a moment, a haircut was able to slow the world down for Larry’ ‘I gave Ray his nickname: King Ray. He is the King of the Bowery, the street in lower Manhattan where he resides’ Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:01:46.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
