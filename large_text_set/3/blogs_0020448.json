Gorsuch was grilled on Tuesday about torture and presidential power, a discussion that focused on his activities under President George W. Bush. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee grilled Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday about torture and presidential power. It was in reference to President George W. Bush’s claim in December 2005 that, as the commander in chief, he could bypass a statute in which Congress had tightened anti-torture rules. The recurring questions on this issue at Judge Gorsuch’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing renewed interest in an unresolved dispute over the scope and limits of presidential power in national security matters. What was the dispute about? After the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, the Bush administration set up an interrogation program to torture terrorism suspects in overseas C.I.A. prisons. It relied on secret Justice Department memos that blessed techniques like waterboarding and prolonged sleep deprivation as lawful. After that came to light, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act in December 2005. Its centerpiece, championed by Senator John McCain, a Republican, barred interrogators from inflicting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment on prisoners anywhere in the world. Mr. Bush signed the bill. But he also issued a signing statement laying out his official interpretation of the new law. It essentially said the Constitution empowered him to bypass the statute under his powers as commander in chief, a claim that set off legal and political controversy. What does that have to do with Judge Gorsuch? In 2005, Mr. Gorsuch was a senior official in the Justice Department, where he dealt with many war-on-terror controversies , including negotiations with Congress about the Detainee Treatment Act. A recently disclosed email chain showed that Mr. Gorsuch was involved in the internal deliberations that led to the signing statement. \n  Did Judge Gorsuch draft the disputed claim? No. The emails show that there was a dispute over what Mr. Bush’s signing statement should say. David S. Addington, the counsel to Vice President Dick Cheney , wanted a curt line claiming the president could bypass the ban. John B. Bellinger III, the top lawyer in the State Department, wanted a more expansive statement putting a positive spin on the act. On Tuesday, Judge Gorsuch said he had been aligned with Mr. Bellinger’s faction, which “wanted a gentler signing statement,” but lost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:43:08.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
