Describing it as “pressing pause,” Uber said its rides will not be available in Taiwan after February 10.\nUberEats, a delivery service, is unaffected, a spokesperson tells Tech in Asia .\nWe have not made this decision lightly. \nIt comes after months of mounting pressure and sizeable fines as Taiwanese authorities accused Uber of being “illegal taxi operators.” Uber drivers faced penalties ranging from US$3,100 to US$790,000.\nThe US-based company – already losing a lot of money, including US$2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2016 – was paying the fines for its Taiwan-based drivers.\nUber, which has seen 15 million rides in Taiwan since 2013, today called for Taiwan to frame ride-hailing regulations that take into account app-based services.\nOffroad “Unfortunately, the government has moved further and further away from embracing innovation and setting the stage for a 21st century transportation policy,” said Uber in a statement. “Uber’s driver-partners, hard working, ordinary Taiwanese citizens, face greater penalties than ever for providing people a safe ride across town.”\n“We hope that pressing pause will reset the conversation and inspire President Tsai to take action,” it added.\n“We have not made this decision lightly, as we know it will have a significant impact on hundreds of thousands of drivers and riders,” added the statement, signed by the Uber Taiwan team.\nThis post Uber shuts down ride-hailing in Taiwan appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:44:58.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
