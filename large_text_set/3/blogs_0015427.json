The Definitive History of Hip Hop will examine the rise of Hip Hop music in culture from its beginnings in the 1970s to the global impact it has today. \nSimmons’ All Def Digital will work alongside Stephen David Entertainment and GroupM Entertainment in developing The Definitive History of Hop Hop series. The announcement of the venture was made on Sunday from Los Angeles. \nAs stated in the press release for the series, Simmons and his partners aim to showcase how Hip Hop’s start in the New York boroughs of the Bronx and Queens came from a need for expression and how influential the culture became in relatively short time. \n“The Definitive History of Hip Hop is the untold story of the birth of this art form – the series gets behind the scenes of what drove the beats, the rhymes, the ideas — and the people — that so powerfully hit a chord with all of youth culture in America and around the world. It starts with the OGs of this disruptive force in entertainment, spotlights some of the lesser known artists who’ve fallen out of history or favor, and of course looks at the icons who are now household names whether you’re in LA or London, Toledo or Tokyo,” said Simmons in a statement from the release. \nSimmons adds that Hip Hop’s four-decade history will be carefully dissected in the series, digging deep at the roots and expansion of the music, fashion and impact the culture continues to wield. \nStephen David Entertainment was responsible for the Emmy Award-winning series The Men Who Built America for the History Channel along with the Emmy-nominated series The World Wars and The Making Of The Mob: New York . GroupM Entertainment is a global content investment and rights management firm. \nProduction on the series will take place this year.
