Luckily, she told the whole story on Monday's episode of Ellen .\nSEE ALSO: World's most excited tiny surfer is freakin' stoked to be back on 'Ellen'\n\"I broke my finger. I know what you're thinking—how can you host a show without the tip of your ring finger? I'm not going to let this beat me. I am not!,\" DeGeneres exclaimed.\n\"So, you know how in gymnastics when you do a one-handed cartwheel and you have to spread the weight evenly between all your fingers? Well, I had two glasses of wine and fell into a door,\" she explained, then showed audiences pictures of the broken bones.\n\"My first thought was no big deal, Obamacare will cover this,\" she said. \"Turns out I didn't break it, I dislocated my finger...which is an incorrect term because I knew where it was located. It was just wrongly located.\"\nThis is my finger. Seriously. Find out what happened tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/oy4sAyvPDN\n— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) March 21, 2017\nDeGeneres went through the whole ordeal with the audience, explaining in too much detail about how her finger was snapped back into place.\nBut hey, at least she got some money out of it.\n\"It was a hard weekend for me, but I put on a brave face and I made it through. Luckily, my friends from Shutterfly heard my story and they love helping people out in need, so they wanted to present me with this check for $10,000, which is so nice,\" she said, poking fun at herself and her show. Shutterfly and other donors often give her guests money and donations.\nGet well soon, Ellen. We need you and your finger out here now more than ever.\nWATCH: ‘Beauty and the Beast’ cast tell us their characters’ musical guilty pleasure", "external_links": ["https://t.co/oy4sAyvPDN", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/bRHLkcb5.jpg", "https://twitter.com/TheEllenShow/status/844002213873696770", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/bRHLkcb5.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-21T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:50:51.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
