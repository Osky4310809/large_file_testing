Credit Barbara Statas/Smithsonian’s National Zoo On a snowy Monday morning in the nation’s capital, Ollie the bobcat apparently just needed some space. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington announced that Ollie, a 6-year-old, 25-pound female cat, had gone missing sometime between 7:30 a.m., when handlers check in on the enclosure she shares with two male bobcats, and feeding time at 10:40 a.m. “She’s very standoffish,” Craig Saffoe, the zoo’s curator of great cats, said of Ollie at an afternoon news conference, calling her “not super friendly.” He added: “It would be extremely easy on us if she were a cat who would come when called, but that’s not who this individual is.” Brandie Smith, the National Zoo’s associate director of animal care, said zookeepers believed the bobcat escaped through a small hole in the mesh fence intended to keep her in. When the animal did not turn up during a search of the area around the bobcat enclosure, the zoo changed tactics, Ms. Smith said, creating a larger perimeter so as not to scare the animal away. “We very much believe she will want to come back to her exhibit,” she said. “There’s shelter, there’s food, there’s warmth.” But Mr. Saffoe stressed that while Ollie is probably nearby, she is a “capable hunter” and the D.C. area is a natural habitat for bobcats. (In fact, a feline believed to be a bobcat was spotted in a residential neighborhood on Sunday in nearby Fairfax County, Va., The Washington Post reported.) “Cats are survivors,” Mr. Saffoe said. “I’d be lying to you if I said we were definitely going to get her back.” Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
