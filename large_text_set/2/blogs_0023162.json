A post shared by Hugh Jackman (@thehughjackman) on Feb 24, 2017 at 4:43pm PST \nJackman was clearly happy about the pasta doing a little jig when Batali brought out the giant bowl. \nAfter giving the celebrity chef a hug, Jackman announced it was “the best fricken thing I’ve ever seen”. \nBatali, who owns Italian restaurants worldwide, also posted the photo on his Instagram captioning it “The new @thehughjackman #wolverine diet includes pasta. Lots of pasta.” media_camera Jackman was pretty excited to dig into a giant bowl of pasta and a glass of wine. \nDespite the diet, Jackman admitted at the movie’s New York screening he will miss playing the X-Men character. \n“This is like a dream. After 17 years, I feel I’ve met every Wolverine and X-Men fan [in the street] … Honestly, these 17 years would not have been possible without you. I love this character, and I love you guys,” he said. \nThe X-Men spin-off Logan is slated for release next month and will be the ninth (and allegedly last) time Jackman will play the superhero. media_camera Logan, which also stars Patrick Stewart, is due for release next month. \nIn his interview with Jimmy Fallon , Jackman also revealed it was his friend Jerry Seinfeld who helped him realise Logan would be his last movie as the X-Men character. \n“He was very clear,” Jackman said. “He said, ‘Look, when you’re creating something, it’s very important not to run yourself dry. It’s not about finishing on top, necessarily, but making sure that you creatively still have something left, which propels you into whatever’s next.’ And as he was talking to me, I went home and I said [to my wife], ‘Deb, this is it. This is the last one.’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:38:32.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
