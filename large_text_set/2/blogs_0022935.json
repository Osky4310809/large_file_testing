By Zainab Mulla | Updated: February 23, 2017 7:26 PM IST Comments \nMahashivratri 2017 will be celebrated on February 24 in 2017. This auspicious Hindu festival falls on the 13th night and 14th day of the New Moon. On the day of Mahashivratri, devotees worship Lord Shiva also known as Mahadeva. Mahashivratri is termed as the ‘Great Night of Shiva’ and it is said that Lord Shiva saved the entire universe from a pot of poison that emerged from the ocean during Samudra Manthan. Devotees celebrate this festival with zeal and enthusiasm. According to mythology, it is said that Lord Shiva got married to Goddess Parvati on the day of Mahashivratri and on the same night he performed the Tandava dance. Women perform puja and worship Goddess Parvati also known as Gaura and it said that Goddess grants them with a good husband and a long married life. Devotees wake up early and take a ritual bath. Later they visit a temple and perform special puja and arti for Mahashivratri. Devotees offer fruits, flowers and bel leaves to the Shiva Linga and observe fast.
