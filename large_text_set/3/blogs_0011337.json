He finds alternative solutions to conflict resolution. Played crucial role in South Africa during the apartheid era and was involved. Prince Franklin is his ally.” \nChairman of Obong of Calabar Executive Forum, Chief Asuquo Ekpenyong, said the conferment was a re-enactment of the relationship between the Efik and Britain. \n“The event is significant. It is not too common to confer an Efik title on foreigners. It is a re-enactment of the relationship between the Efik, Britain and peace. What we have seen is going to bring to the Efik and its people a positive relationship. We have by this shown that we still recall the past,” he said. \nAsuquo, however, urged the visitors to visit the palace at least once every year. \nIn his response, Price Franklin promised to visit the palace regularly, adding that they would extend their humanitarian roles to other parts of the world. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T05:10:18.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
