Miss Universe mess-up \nThe Oscars fail reminded many of Steve Harvey's flubbed announcement of the winner of Miss Universe in 2015. Obviously, Steve Harvey was a running theme on Twitter.

I'm just dumbfounded that I'm included,\" said Affleck, a first-time Oscar winner. \nViola Davis, meanwhile, won her first Oscar for her supporting roles in Fences.
