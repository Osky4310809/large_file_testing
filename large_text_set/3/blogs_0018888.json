Let your wallet take the lead. \nYou might not realize it, but the money you spend eating out for lunch and dinner can really add up. \nEven if you opt for cheaper, fast food restaurants, your bank account probably takes a big hit on the months you choose to eat out rather than pack your lunches. \nThis is how fast food has become a $100 billion industry in the United States despite offering up low prices. \nA great first step in stopping the bad habit of binging on unhealthy meals out is to track what you’ve been spending on food each month. \nMost major banks and credit card companies offer nifty graphs and charts that can show you this. \nIf you bank with a smaller financial institution, you can track your food spending manually by going through your statements. \nOnce you have a number, think about what you would do with that money. \nVisualizing what you could do with the money you’d save from eating more meals in the house is sure to help you stick to a meal prepping routine. 2. Enforce the 80/20 rule. \nContrary to popular belief, establishing a healthy routine requires a little leniency. \nSure, you’ll want to stick to your kale and lean protein most of the time, but some starchy carbs and a little chocolate will be necessary here and there if you’re looking to build a program that has the potential to stick. \nThis is why you should employ the 80/20 rule.

I ate like a saint six days a week, but every Friday I had a giant chocolate chip cookie and a latte. Knowing I had Cookie Day to look forward to made all the celery on the other days much more palatable.” 3. Drink water… seriously. \nYou’ve heard it before, and you’ll likely hear it a whole lot more in your lifetime. In order to establish a healthy routine and achieve your healthiest body, you absolutely must drink water. \nNot only does it help you keep your body hydrated and functioning properly, but it also helps you stay full and focus less on snacking. \nAccording to the Mayo Clinic , women should drink at least 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water each day and men should drink 13 cups (3 liters) daily. \nIf you make sure to at least hit your minimum amount of water each day, fitness pros promise you’ll see some awesome weight-loss benefits like increased metabolism, curbed appetite and a boost in energy. 4. Enlist the help of apps and gadgets. \nOne of the biggest hurdles in quitting junk food is becoming aware of how much junk you’re actually eating on a given day. \nA doughnut here and a cookie there might seem like nothing if you space them out throughout the day, but the calories really add up when you eat these things consistently. \nThis is where apps and gadgets can help.

Replace snacks with veggies. \nFinally, we’ve come to one of the tricks I learned during my quick stint as a fitness competitor: replace snacks with veggies. \nWhen you think about it, you can eat all of the vegetables you want, and it will likely only help, not hinder, your ability to build a healthy body. \nNot only do vegetables serve as a healthy alternative to binging on junk food when you get hungry, but they can also help you determine whether what you’re feeling is actually hunger or just a craving. \nIf you find that veggies aren’t enough to satiate you, go for a lean protein like chicken or perhaps a serving of almonds. \nJust be sure that the healthy snacks you eat stick to recommended portion sizes to remain in control of your caloric intake and avoid binging.
