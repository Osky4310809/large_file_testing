In the two-minute supercut, titled \"John Wick Chapter One Symphony of Violence, Vengeance, Bloodshed, Justice, Mayhem,\" We see every moment of violent action, every bullet shot and punch thrown throughout the course of the first John Wick movie, all to riveting classical music. \nIt's exactly as glorious as it sounds. \nThe first John Wick became an instant classic, as Keanu Reeves and his character seemed to share the line \"Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back.\" As the action star returned to form, so did his character, a retired assassin who gets back into the game to exact vengeance for his dog. The second chapter, teased at the end of this video with Laurence Fishburne's appearance, sees him still unable to completely retire. \n\"In this next chapter following the 2014 hit, legendary hitman John Wick [Keanu Reeves] is forced back out of retirement by a former associate plotting to seize control of a shadowy international assassins’ guild. Bound by a blood oath to help him, John travels to Rome where he squares off against some of the world’s deadliest killers,\" the official synopsis reads. \nJohn Wick: Chapter 2 hits theaters February 10, 2017, and if we had to bet, we'd say there's going to be some violence in it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T21:45:02.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
