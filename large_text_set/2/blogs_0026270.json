All you need is some milk and sugar. \nAs Sheela Prakash at The Kitchn explains, there’s no need to toss out that extra side of take-out rice, or waste the excess you end up with when you make a huge batch at home (I do this all the time.) Instead, grab some milk, almond milk, or coconut milk and mix it at a one-to-one ratio with your leftover rice in a large pot. Crank the heat, then reduce it to a simmer and stir frequently. You can use sugar, brown sugar, honey, or even maple syrup to add sweetness as you stir. Make sure you add a pinch of salt too. After about 20 minutes of stirring, you should be left with the perfect pudding consistency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:09:59.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
