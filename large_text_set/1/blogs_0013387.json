However, we wish to make clear that Luis Nolasco was not speaking on behalf of the ACLU at the Rialto City Council meeting and his statements are not consistent with our stated policy. Nevertheless, we support his right to freely express his personal opinion to his elected representatives. \nThe ACLU advocate’s comments came after Rafael Trujillo, a newly elected city councilman, apologized for attempting to hold a Dec. 30 meeting to discuss making Rialto a sanctuary city. Trujillo’s comments came at the start of the meeting last week prior to comments from more than 20 people, most of whom rejected the councilman’s idea. \nIn addition to apologizing, Trujillo said the canceled meeting was “a lesson learned.” Nolasco, for his part, said the councilman should not have apologized.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T20:04:17.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
