PVV is unlikely to form a government since other parties refuse to cooperate with Wilders over his tone on immigration. \nPVV could still shake up the political map in the Netherlands and give populist parties in Germany and France a boost in elections later this year. \nWilders has a history of targeting Moroccan immigrants. He was convicted of “inciting racial discrimination” in December for remarks he made in 2014. (VIDEO: Geert Wilders Convicted Of ‘Inciting Discrimination’) \nWilders asked supporters at a televised rally if they wanted fewer or more Moroccans in the country. The crowd started chanting “Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!,” and Wilders responded he would take care of it. \nNo penalty was imposed by the court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:35:12.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
