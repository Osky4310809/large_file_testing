Officers were concerned there was an imminent risk to health.” \nThe director of the company, Yanrui Yi, told officers of her intention to close the restaurant for refurbishment. \nBut when they returned in November – after the business had changed its name to Nines Global Buffet – they once again found hygiene failings including dirty chopping boards, rusty equipment, and failure of food standard systems at the 230-cover venue. \nThe business was issued with two hygiene notices in December. By March, the court was told, issues had been complied with, but the hygiene rating remained zero.

We cannot say but how it was found she is very suspicious of, although she accepts in terms of liability she is responsible.” Read More Porn DVDs, empty wine bottles and mountains of rubbish: Disgusted landlord reveals inside house of horrors ruined by tenants Blood was found on the floor of the kitchen \nHe added: “This is not a case of running a business down over a long period of time but someone taking it on abruptly and not getting it to a standard that we would expect. \n“It is a punishment in itself being before the court and the reputational damage is enormous. \nSentencing chairman of magistrates Jan Langton fined the company £10,500 each for the offences related to the discovery of the dead pigeon and the cockroaches, while fines of £1,000 were handed down for each of the other four offences. \nShe said: “It was very fortunate no member of the public was taken ill as a result.” \nShe also ordered the company to pay costs of £830 and a surcharge of £170.
