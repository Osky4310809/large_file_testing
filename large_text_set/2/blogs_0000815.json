After reading it through a few times, it seemed to me that the man made a lot of yuge promises that were not only strange and hard to completely define but also seemingly counteractive to the plans of many of the people he wants to put into high-level positions. \nAs to the transition of power and how this time around it’s gonna be real special: \n“Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another — but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” \nHow can he say that when he wants Betsy DeVos, someone who seeks to dismantle and privatize the country’s public school system, as education secretary? That comrade Trump is not a crusader for the people is a known fact to some, but for others, it’s going to take a while for that to sink in. \nIt’s all about you and your power. You’ve been held down for so long. Oh! The tyranny! \n“What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people. Jan. 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.” \nReally? Of course it matters which party controls our government. It’s a lesson that will be used as a stick upside your head, starting immediately. And there are no forgotten people in America. Purposefully marginalized and disenfranchised, sure, but not forgotten. \n“But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.” \nWait, he wants to help these people? You’d better get out your crayon and write him a letter. But not to worry; “those” people won’t be moving into your trailer park.
