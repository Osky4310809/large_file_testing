The delivery of the car was expected to begin by the end of 2017.\nSeveral businessmen have showed interest in Tesla’s arrival in India. Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, VC Mahesh Murthy, entrepreneur Vishal Gondal were among the few people who pre-ordered the Model 3 last year.\nThe final price of the Model 3 is likely to carry a heavy import duty, as per domestic law. According to media reports, Tesla and the Indian government has had talks on getting the car manufacturer to setup a plant in the country.\nThis would allow Tesla to manufacture locally and avail several tax concessions and benefits from the government. Though, reports have claimed that Tesla will only commit to it if the Model 3 gets a good reception in India.\nImage: Rajat Gupta/Epa/REX/Shutterstock\nRegardless, it will be nothing short of a delight for many to see an autonomous vehicle on Indian roads. India has some of the world's worst maintained roads even in urban areas with scant respect for traffic rules.\nAnother challenge for Tesla would be to set up its network of Superchargers where owners would be able to charge their cars. Earlier last year Musk had confirmed the company would set up the network across India.\nBONUS: Tesla unveils the Model 3, its mass-market electric car", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/goel_ishan", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5atsM7HCkq_y3j31fkfzT2j_zZM=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F376043%2F329cd7f2-8e72-402f-8e28-ab346e93fb9b.jpg", "http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/u3cM3GUGsrRpoZjT2aoidN/Forget-Apple-woo-Tesla-instead-to-set-up-manufacturing-faci.html", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/CXsMT47x.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VvQZnWHHU6-asOT5BfGwavNeS80=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F376043%2F329cd7f2-8e72-402f-8e28-ab346e93fb9b.jpg", "http://www.bgr.in/news/tesla-to-set-up-an-india-wide-supercharger-network-for-tesla-model-3-launch-elon-musk-confirms/", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/829027848434257924", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/CXsMT47x.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-08T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:27:56.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
