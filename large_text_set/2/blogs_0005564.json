Those who have been blessed with felines in their lives know the struggle of keeping their mischievous cats from digging into “people food” and getting into all sorts of other shenanigans. With their quiet sauntering paws and surreptitious keen eyes, cats are born to be secret agents. Cats are naturally curious creatures whose alert senses have them sniffing, stalking, swatting , and tasting anything they can get their cute little paws on. Their ninja-like skills can get by even the most watchful cat parent. Young Maggie may be a loving, diligent cat mama, but like most cats, her little feline Shadow pulled a fast one on her one night. Maggie’s plight was revealed in the form of an e-mail to her family’s vet. The vet tech who received the note, posted the adorable-ness to Reddit to share with the world. \n\nWe can’t help but to giggle at the earnest and diligent tone from this little 12-year-old. Her concern shows the true badge of a pet parent – though she may be young. You’ll be relieved to know that the vet did respond and let Maggie know that tiny amounts of dairy are usually ok for cats, but we must remember that cat health is a seriously important issue. As with humans, dairy can cause health issues like upset stomach and diarrhea in cats, and we need to take a cue from young Maggie and make sure we keep a close watch on what our cat children ingest! \nIf you ever suspect your pet has eaten something they should not have, please be like Maggie and contact your veterinarian immediately. \nImage source: ChiefAcorn /Reddit   some recent posts below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:36:11.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
