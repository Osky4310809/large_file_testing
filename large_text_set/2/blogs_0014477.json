Though they required goalkeeper Jordan Archer to be at his very best they thoroughly merited their late winner, as Ranieri conceded. \n“When they played 10 v 11 they played better than us,” he said. “They had more character, more desire and more heart than us. Millwall 1 Leicester City 0: Lions roar back after red card in FA Cup \n“In the end they deserved to win. They have one chance and they score the goal. Well done to them.” \nThe defeat piles further pressure on Ranieri, whose side are battling to stay out of the Premier League relegation zone a year after they were leading the way on their path to a first ever top division league title. \nRanieri, whose future is likely to come under increased scrutiny after Saturday’s defence, hopes that some good will come from defeat as he looks for his side to rediscover the fighting spirit that took them to the title last season. \n“I need the soldiers, I need the gladiators, because Millwall, with 10 players, showed they are fantastic gladiators. Lincoln's giant-killing inspired Millwall to beat Leicester - Harris \n“It is strange because last season we won for this, to be more determined than the opponent and play with more heart than the opponent. We could also lose but we would fight every match. I want to see this, the fight until the end. \n“This defeat could be good for us because when you lose against a team who fights, you have to say well done to them but why did we lose?” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:03:28.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
