The referee felt that both Suarez and Roberto deserved two yellow cards. \n\"I was about to take Roberto off because of the booking he had. He's made three challenges and he's been given two cautions. We felt he could maybe get a second, but we didn't react quick enough.\" \nBarca, who ended the match with nine men, were made to suffer after substitute Kevin Gameiro levelled proceedings on the night with seven minutes remaining. \nAtletico's Antoine Griezmann also had a goal incorrectly disallowed for offside in the second half. \n\"In the 90 minutes we did not deserve this result, but we deserve to play the final of Copa del Rey because of the merits we have made in the competition,\" Luis Enrique added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:15:23.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
