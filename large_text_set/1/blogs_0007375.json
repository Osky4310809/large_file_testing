Anderson is something else. He’s a mad scientist experimenting in his lab, outfitting boys in gender-bending silhouettes, insane visual mashups and completely unrelated elements (previous seasons have seen spray-painted aprons worn with steampunk goggles and crowns made from building blocks).\nFor FW17, the Northern Irishman developed a fascination with the Middle Ages. He used crochet knits, images taken from stained-glass windows and patches of heraldry like the ones knights would wear back in the day. Not exactly instantly wearable ideas, but Anderson’s appeal is never obvious.\nDig a little deeper, and you’d see some eerily charming ideas peeking through the cracks. Massively oversized knits, allover print tees, patched cardigans and bombers sporting heraldry shields would all keep the buyers happy, even if the show did feel like a no-holds-barred assault on the eyes — which it always does.\nFor the latest collections, street style and trends, check out the rest of our FW17 Fashion Week coverage. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T12:01:22.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
