Food and Drink Michael Twitty: The culinary historian shedding a new light on the slave trade \nInstead of talking about slavery with images of whips and chains, the culinary historian uses another route, food. Julia Platt Leonard finds out how the food of the southern states of America were transformed by traditions brought over by African slaves Saturday 4 March 2017 00:00 GMT Click to followIndy Lifestyle Online Michael Twitty (left) interprets what it was like to cook as an enslaved person at US plantations in his Southern Discomfort Tour Photography by Afroculinaria \nHe calls it the Southern Discomfort Tour and for many Americans – particularly those in the South – what Michael Twitty does is uncomfortable. Twitty is a culinary historian, a historical interpreter and food writer. He’s travelled across the southern US tracing the routes of his own enslaved ancestors and telling a story of slavery that many would rather ignore. \nAt a lecture at the National Maritime Museum in London, he told the audience, “We’re just not allowed to tell those stories.” The scale of the history of slavery in America is staggering. \nJust a floor above the lecture room is an exhibit charting the transatlantic slave trade – the largest forced migration in history. British and British colonial ships bought an estimated 3.4 million Africans in just under 150 years. The foods people eat most in cities across the UK and the world \nBut Twitty says while Britain has acknowledged the role it played in slavery, the US has not. “You go to a museum in Great Britain and slavery is a shame. It’s like blood guilt. It’s a casualty of Empire. In America, it’s a glitch on the way to American democracy.” The average enslaved person, says Twitty, was sold 2-3 times during his or her life. Their stories – including those of Twitty’s ancestors – have remained largely untold. \nIn 2011, Twitty decided to change that. He researched his own family tree and now helps others tease out the threads that connect them back to Africa. He calls it “uncracking the code” of their American story. He documents his work in the blog Afroculinaria and now in a book out in August called The Cooking Gene . Twitty shines a light on how central and west African food traditions brought to the US through the slave trade transformed the South \nTwitty knows that the sheer enormity of slavery can make it difficult to comprehend. For him, food is a way of understanding the slave experience – making it real and personal. Food became a way to get closer to the past. “People will not listen to me if I talk about whips and chains all the time. So I had to go another route.” He began researching central and west African food traditions that the slaves brought with them and how those transformed the food of the South. “If I can’t know these people in every single detail then maybe I can know their lives that are behind their food.” \nTwitty felt the best – the only – way for him to do this was to immerse himself in their world. He learned how to butcher a hog with a hatchet and blunt knife, make fire with a flint and steel, and learn what time of year a possum was best eaten. He picked cotton in a sweltering field for sixteen hours. Now he regularly interprets the cooking of enslaved people at plantations across the South. He’s cooked a dinner at a plantation in North Carolina where slaves lived in a four-room slave house with twelve people crowded into each room. “The bottom line is you go into these spaces and they are haunted: literally and figuratively. They are uncomfortable spaces.” Food and drink news Food and drink news 1/20 You can now get a job as a professional chocolate eater \nThe company responsible for some of your favourite chocolate brands – think Cadbury, Milks, Prince and Oreo – have officially announced an opening to join their team as a professional chocolate taster.

But one scientist argues it should be used as a “supersalt” and encourages adding it to food.

According to the weekly report from the Government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, a pair of Little Gem lettuces had an average market price of £0.86 in the week that ended on Friday, up from an average of £0.56 in the previous week – that’s an almost 54 per cent increase.

But an expert has warned that while many cereals boxes claim their contents are the perfect start to the day, many are packed full of sugar and carbohydrates with little nutritional value. Even some seemingly-health muesli cereals have a lot of added sugar in the form of honey, malt, molasses, dried fruit or “even fruit juice” Getty Images 12/20 Crisps made with real ingredients \nMichelin starred chef, Simon Rogan in action cooking a menu inspired by the provenance ingredients in the new Chef’s Signature range from Kettle Chips.

The world is becoming more health conscious. There's the war on sugar, and teetotalism is on the rise, with more than one in five not drinking at all (especially young adults), according to The National Statistics for Adult Drinking Habits. This abstinence is even more pronounced in London, with almost one in three turning away from alcohol. An increasing number of mixologists are applying their talents to the creation of non-alcoholic drinks that taste as good as their boozy alternatives 15/20 'Heat map' shows which areas of Britain enjoy the spiciest curries \nAfter Bradford was named the Curry Capital of Britain for the fifth year running, a map has been released showing which regions of Britain enjoy a spicy curry and which prefer the milder variants. According to the map developed by Hari Ghotra, Kent, Essex, West Yorkshire and Lancashire are the heat-handling kings of Britain, while Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales all prefer milder curries. The data was collected by monitoring the location of social media posts that mentioned names of curries. These were then given a spice rating and were then collated to give each area a score out of 1000 16/20 Guinness to become vegan-friendly \nGuinness is set to become vegan friendly for the first time in its 256-year history, as the company announced its plan to stop using fish bladders in its filters 17/20 Why the salmon on your plate might not actually be salmon \nSalmon that ends up on the dinner table may not be salmon at all, a study has suggested. The problem of salmon mislabelling has become an increasing issue in the US in the winter months, according to American research published by Oceana. The findings show that 43 per cent of the salmon tested was mislabelled – the most common instance of this being when farmed Atlantic salmon was sold as wild salmon 18/20 How dangerous is a bacon sandwich \nA recent WHO report warning that processed and red meats can cause cancer may have left you thinking a little harder about whether to pick up that bacon butty for breakfast or ditch a beef-filled Bolognese for dinner - but how worried should we be? The review of 800 studies for the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) prompted global health experts to cast processed meats - including bacon, ham and sausages - into the ominous-sounding list of group 1 carcinogens, where they joined formaldehyde, gamma radiation and cigarettes. Eating just a 50g portion of processed meat – or two rashers of bacon - a day increases the risk of bowel cancer by 18 per cent, the experts concluded 19/20 New Zealanders are behind a lot of the interesting food and drink stuff happening in the UK \nDark beers are more suited to cold months, so the thinking goes, but in one part of the world they're always popular. \"Lots of breweries in New Zealand have got stouts and porters among their best sellers,\" says Stu McKinlay, one half of the duo behind Wellington brewing company Yeastie Boys. McKinlay recently swapped Wellington for west Kent in order to launch Yeastie Boys in the UK, and he's joined forces with four other breweries (8 Wired, Renaissance, Three Boys, Tuatara) as part of the New Zealand Craft Beer Collective, to promote his country's finest over here 20/20 Additives in popular chicken nuggets \nIngredients, a new book co-created by photographer Dwight Eschliman and food writer Steve Ettlinger distils 25 products, including popcorn, Red Bull and chicken soup, focusing on 75 of the most common food additives and revealing what each one looks like, where it comes from and why it is used. McDonald’s chicken nuggets were found to contain 40 different ingredients. These included dextrose, a sugar also used by shoe makers to make leather more pliable, and corn starch, used for thickening food as well as also being a substitute for petrol \n“You don’t understand anything until it’s 102 degrees in Montgomery, Alabama and you have to make that food over an open hearth.” he said. The life of the enslaved cook was one of gruelling, relentless labour where they routinely had to lift pots that weighed 27 kilos. “Your back hurts. There is hair burnt off your face and arms and you get cuts that you don’t even know you had. You can’t even imagine what it would be like to do that every single day with four hours sleep a night.” The culinary historian shows people the foods and cooking styles that were brought to the South through the slave trade \nHe recounts how at one plantation event, visitors giggled when he spilt water while lifting a heavy pot, “…not even realising that if I was an enslaved cook and I made a mistake that was noticeable, what do you think would happen to me? Think they’d be giggling? No.” Denmark cuts food waste by 25% in 5 years with the help of one woman \nSharing stories of African American food and cooking he says, is a way to reclaim history. “Let’s put the seed in the ground and let’s see where the seed grows. And maybe if the seed grows well then I will have collard greens and I can make that heirloom collard green into something.” Those heirloom collard greens, or foraging, or nose to tail cooking were all part of the slave’s life out of sheer necessity. “It’s our heritage, it’s not some cute little trend…our people did that every day and night to survive.” \nTwitty says while his work may make people uncomfortable, his goal is reconciliation, not retribution. But he says first people must acknowledge what happened and that, “…there is power to be ceded or shared.” Ultimately, he wants people to come together. He talks about one time when he cooked at a plantation and local African Americans and whites came together for the first time in the act of eating and sharing food. “We are a dysfunctional family but we are related to each other,” he says. “We will either die together or live together.” \nThe Cooking Gene, published by Amistad Press is out 1 August this year.
