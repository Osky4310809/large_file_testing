On licking your wounds \n“You can't be brave if you've only had wonderful things happen to you.” In character as Mary Richards \n“I'm an experienced woman; I've been around. Well, all right, I might not have been around, but I've been ... nearby.” On doing what you love \n“I just like the continue doing what I've been doing. A mélange of funny, straight drama, television, movies, a little theater here and there wouldn't hurt. So if I can keep doing that, I'll be a very happy person.” On her controversial decision to wear Capri pants rather than a skirt on The Dick Van Dyke Show \n“We got the absolution of men everywhere and women kind of breathed a sigh of relief, too, and said: ‘Hey, that’s right. That’s what we wear.’” On animal rights \n“Behind every beautiful fur, there is a story.

The funny thing is, Ed lost 28 pounds — and everyone found out about the bet. The two of them met up and were face to face. What would happen? But they turned and went their separate ways!” On the Cold War \n“There's one beneficial effect of going to Moscow. You come home waving the American flag with all your might.” On befitting names \n\"Someone told me the other day that there is a new pill going around in the social drug scene and they don't have a name for it yet, but the most evident result is that you tend to smile a lot, and so they're calling it the MTM.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:44:45.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
