Hameed Ali (retd.) has approved a grace period of one month, which will end on Wednesday April 12, 2017, for owners of all vehicles whose Customs duties have not been paid to do so. \nThe Acting Public Relations Officer, Nigeria Customs Service, Mr. Joseph Attah, disclosed this in a statement issued on Thursday. \nThe statement advised all motor dealers and owners of such vehicles to visit the nearest Customs zonal office to pay the appropriate duties on them. \nThe four zonal offices of the NCS, according to the statement, are located in Lagos, Kaduna, Port Harcourt and Nacho. \nThe statement read in part, “The CGC, therefore, calls on all persons in possession of such vehicles to take advantage of the grace period to pay appropriate duties on them, as there will be an aggressive anti-smuggling operation to seize as well as prosecute owners of such smuggled vehicles after the deadline of Wednesday, April 12, 2017. \n“For the avoidance of doubt, all private car owners who are not sure of the authenticity of their vehicles’ Customs documents can also approach the zonal offices to verify with a view to complying with the provision of the law.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:29:47.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
