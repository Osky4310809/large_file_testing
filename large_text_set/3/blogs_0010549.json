The lower house, the House of Commons, had erased the changes made by legislators in the House of Lords. The peers have caved in to House of Commons pressure, which on Monday voted against amendments to guarantee the rights of millions of EU citizens living in the country after Brexit as well as giving Parliament veto powers over a final Brexit deal. It has been 262 days since Britain shocked the world by voting to exit the EU. \nThe EU has said that it will respond to Britain's formal notice to leave within 48 hours, Sputnik reported. \nThe next step for the legislation is royal assent. From there, Prime Minister Theresa May is free to trigger the UK's divorce from one of the world's largest economic unions. The final break could happen in the final week of March. \nFrom there, May would begin a two-year negotiation period, as stipulated in Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. One hurdle that has been placed in May's path comes from Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is calling for another independence referendum in 2018 or early 2019 depending on how the terms of Brexit play out. \nMORE DETAILS TO COME", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:40:43.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
