NBAE/Getty Images Andrew D. Bernstein 10 Isiah Thomas, Indiana After trailing early in the 1981 NCAA title game, Thomas exploded with 19 of his 23 points in the second half to lead the Hoosiers past North Carolina. The sophomore declared early for the NBA draft and was the No. 2 overall pick by the Detroit, where he won two championships in his 13-year professional career. ZUMA Press TSN ARCHIVES 9 Wilt Chamberlain, Kansas Chamberlain led Kansas back into the tournament after a four-year absence, but the Jayhawks fell short in triple-overtime against North Carolina in the 1957 NCAA title game. However, his 23-point, 14-rebound effort earned him the Final Four MOP. Chamberlain won NBA titles with the Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers, but he's best known for his 100-point game with the Philadelphia Warriors in 1962. Getty Images Focus On Sport 8 James Worthy, North Carolina Michael Jordan put the game-winning points on the board but Worthy sealed the Tar Heels' 1982 NCAA title game victory after Georgetown’s Fred Brown mistakenly passed him the ball in the final seconds. Worthy was named Final Four MOP after leading UNC to its second tournament championship with 28 points and four rebounds. The Lakers’ 1982 first-round pick lived up to expectations, helping the franchise win three more championships and earning the 1988 NBA Finals MVP award. 7 Jerry West, West Virginia Despite a one-point loss to California in the 1959 NCAA title game, West's average of 33 points and 13 rebounds in the Final Four earned him MOP honors. He was a 14-time NBA All-Star and won the 1974 championship with the Los Angeles Lakers. 'Mr. Clutch' spent his entire professional playing career with the franchise and even served as its coach and general manager, but he's probably best known as the silhouette figure in NBA logo. NBAE/Getty Images Dick Raphael 6 Patrick Ewing, Georgetown In a showdown of the season’s two best college centers, Ewing's Hoyas topped Hakeem Olajuwon’s Houston Cougars for the 1984 NCAA title. Ewing scored 10 points and grabbed nine rebounds to earn the Final Four MOP award. He led Georgetown back to the championship game the following season, but the Hoyas were unable to complete the repeat. Ewing spent most of his Hall of Fame NBA career with the New York Knicks and is regarded as one of the greatest centers of all time. Getty Images Ronald C. Modra/Sports Imagery 5 Hakeem Olajuwon, Houston Phi Slama Jama came up short in the 1983 NCAA championship game, but Olajuwon's 20-point, 18-rebound performance was big enough to win him the MOP, and he's the last player to claim the honor from a losing team. The Cougars reached the title game again the following season but fell to Patrick Ewing and the Georgetown Hoyas. After his college career, Olajuwon moved down the street where he won two NBA championships with the Houston Rockets, including the 1994 title against Ewing's New York Knicks. NBAE/Getty Images NBA Photos 4 Bill Russell, San Francisco Russell was already a legend before he helped build the Boston Celtics dynasty. He led the San Francisco Dons to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1955 and 1956, averaging more than 20 points and 20 rebounds in both seasons. In Boston, Russell became arguably the most decorated player in NBA history as a five-time league MVP and 11-time champion. Tony Tomsic 3 Lew Alcindor, UCLA Before he was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Alcindor led the Bruins to consecutive NCAA titles from 1967-69 and is the only three-time Final Four MOP. Alcindor averaged 30.3 points and 18 rebounds in the three championship games. He continued to be a dominating force in the NBA, winning a title with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1971 and five more with the Los Angeles Lakers. 2 Larry Bird, Indiana State / Magic Johnson, Michigan State In a meeting between two future NBA rivals, Johnson scored 24 points to lead the Spartans over Bird's undefeated Indiana State Sycamores in the 1979 NCAA championship game. Johnson won an NBA title the following season as a rookie with the Los Angeles Lakers and four more in his Hall of Fame career with the team. But in their first showdown for an NBA championship, Bird's Boston Celtics beat Johnson and the Lakers in seven games in the 1984 finals. Bird finished his career with 3 NBA titles and as a 12-time All-Star. Getty Images Jerry Wachter/Sports Imagery 1 Michael Jordan, North Carolina Jordan gave basketball fans a taste of things to come in the 1982 NCAA championship game that featured several other future NBA legends. The freshman's jumper with 17 seconds remaining put North Carolina on top 63-62, and Georgetown's ill-advised pass to James Worthy sealed the victory for the Tar Heels. Jordan went on to become arguably the greatest ever to play the game, winning six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls.
