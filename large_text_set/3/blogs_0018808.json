This week, the nations' three navies conducted missile defense information-sharing drills in the region. \nKim Jong Un's regime has repeatedly threatened to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). \nIn January, a senior North Korean official told NBC News that North Korea was ready to test-fire an ICBM \"at any time, at any place.\" \nWhile North Korea regularly threatens nuclear attacks against the United States, until 2016 analysts had thought the country was a long way from developing missile technology that would make them capable of doing so.

Toru Hanai / Reuters \nShortly before Tillerson made his comments in Tokyo, a senior North Korean diplomat in Beijing addressed its nuclear program and relations with the U.S. during a rare press conference. \nNorth Korea's Charge d'Affaires Pak Myong Ho told journalists that his country needed to strengthen its nuclear capabilities against an \"aggressive\" America \"given threats from U.S. and relevant countries.\" \nPak also said his country had proposed a peace deal that the U.S. rejected, and added that the America was carrying out the largest-ever military drills off its waters.
