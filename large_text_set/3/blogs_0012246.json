I got stuck in traffic... I fell sick... I have a family emergency...\" The list goes on. We end up apologising for things that are absolutely not our fault, and we are so used to doing this, on a subconscious level, that is doesn't even register anymore. \nBut you need to stop. Not just because you are not at fault (unless you are), but because there are a host of other things that happen when you are constantly apologising. \nFirst off it's annoying. No, seriously. Hearing you apologising all the time can get a tad irritating for the other person. If you have to approach a person, when he or she is busy, then instead of saying \"I am so sorry\", just say \"Hi, can I have a minute?\" Trust us, it works just fine. \nAlso, constantly apologising makes others perceive you as the the wrong-doer. Because when you apologise for things that are not your fault, people automatically expect you to take the blame for everything. Put a stop to it, and stop making yourself sound so wrong all the time. Half the time you are apologising for things that are no one's fault, and you really don't need to do that. Next time you feel the need to say \"I am sorry\", pause and say something else instead. Find a new catchphrase for yourself instead of this one. \nAlso, because you are beginning more than half your sentences with \"I am sorry\" it automatically devalues the point you are making. When you are genuinely sorry about something, don't be mad if people don't accept your apology. Because you do it the whole day long, people don't really care. \nFrom today, pay attention to the amounts of sorrys you are saying in a day, and curb it.
