Not long ago, news broke about the show’s first casting, and it seems another star has signed onto the series. According to Deadline , Stephen Moyer of True Blood has been cast for the pilot. The actor will be playing a lead role and joins Blair Redford and Jaime Chung whose castings were previously confirmed. \nThe actor will play a character named Reed who is an \"ambitious attorney trying to balance the demands of his job at the DA’s office with his responsibilities to his family.\" \nSo far, it seems Moyer's character will be a non-mutant given the show's description. The pilot is said to tell the story of family who discovers their children have mutations and are forced to go underground as such. With Moyer tapped to play a father, it seems the star will be parenting mutants and likely learn how his home-life conflicts with his job in politics. \nWhile Moyer appears to be playing a human, the pilot will be bringing mutants on-board. Chung will be playing a fan-favorite character from the Marvel Universe known as Blink. Also known as Clarice Fong, Blink is able to teleport almost anywhere and can also focus her abilities into spear-like forms with limitless range. \nOn the other hand, the show's other confirmed cast member has a less defined role. Redford was brought in to play Sam who is said to be \"the strong-headed Native American leader of the underground network\" the main family comes to after learning about their childrens' gifts. \nThe X-Men pilot is being written by Matt Nix and directed by Bryan Singer with a script that focuses on two parents who discover their children are mutants. The family then has to go on the run and joins an underground network dedicated to saving mutants. \nIf the series has its pilot green-lit, it would be the second X-Men series to hit cable in recent years. Not long ago, FOX premiered Legion to critical praise, and the trippy mutant series has continued to garner traction from fans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:32:30.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
