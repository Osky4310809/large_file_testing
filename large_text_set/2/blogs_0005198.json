Sadio Mane ran Spurs ragged (Photo: PA) \n\"We have to be focused and try to win games and then we'll see what happens. \n\"It's true that it's difficult to challenge and try to fight for the Premier League, but today, in the first 45 minutes, that is not a team that are ready to fight for the Premier League.\" \nBT Sport is your home of unmissable live football from the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and FA Cup.
