Shares of the company are up 22 percent in the last week but are down 26 percent in the last 12 months. \nJoe Agnese of CFRA Research kept a \"hold\" rating for Sprouts' stock after the report. \n\"We believe a potential deal makes strategic sense as increased scale would help [Sprouts Farmers Market] lower costs and price more aggressively in a low inflationary environment,\" Agnese said. But he added that he expects competition in the grocery space will \"remain intense over the next few years.\" \nAgnese has a price target of $24 on Sprouts shares. The stock closed at $21.82 on Monday. \nRead more about the possible merger on Bloomberg's website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:35:25.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
