PUNCH Metro learnt that the President of the Students Union Government, Samuel Kappo, was also arrested by the police. It was learnt that Onyekachi had an altercation with a truck driver on Sunday after the latter bashed his car on the LASU-Isheri Road. The disagreement was said to have degenerated into a fight, during which the victim was stabbed to death by the driver, who immediately fled the scene. Students of the school on Monday trooped out to protest against the killing, as motorists were held in a gridlock that lasted for hours. Policemen at the Igando division were said to have used tear gas on the students. Some of the angry students reportedly attacked the police team after the SUG president was arrested. The school’s Acting Public Relations Officer, Ademola Adekoya, who confirmed the incident, said the school authorities had already intervened, adding that Kappo had been released. He said, “Management notes with sadness the unfortunate death of Ugwanyi Cyril Onyekachi, a 500-level student of the Faculty of Law, with Matric Number 130411107, and commiserates with the family, friends and colleagues of the student. In the same vein, we salute the students of the Lagos State University, led by the LASUSU President, Mr. Samuel Kappo, for the maturity they displayed in responding to the issue, even under a very tense and emotional condition. “Angry reactions followed the news of the unfortunate incident. But student leaders, having received assurance from the police on the arrest and detention of the individual alleged to have perpetrated the act, prevailed on the students to exercise restraints for justice to prevail. Our students have, therefore, returned to their classrooms and are going about their activities peacefully.” The state police spokesperson, Olarinde Famous-Cole, gave a different account of the incident. He said a student had a fight with a motorist after their vehicles collided, which led to the death of the driver. “The student was arrested and his colleagues came to demand his release. The suspect has been transferred to the command,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
