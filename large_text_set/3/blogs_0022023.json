He was 85. \nBorn in 1931 in Secunderabad, Tyagarajan (he had not yet assumed the pseudonym of Ashokamitran) moved to Chennai in 1952. After moving to Chennai, he went on to become one of the most influential figures in post-independent Tamil literature. His oeuvre includes now over 200 short stories, eight novels, some 15 novellas besides other prose writings. \nHe was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1996 for his work 'Appavin Snegidhar', a collection of short stories. \nOne of the finest writers in Tamil, Ashokamitranâ€™s short stories have been translated into English, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu and other languages. He is known for brevity and subtle humour. \nThe Eighteenth Parallel (1977) is one of the highly acclaimed novels of Ashokamitran. A kind of biographical lookback, it portrays the growth of an observant and conscientious Tamil boy called Chandrasekharan or Chandru amidst the confusing cosmopolitanism and rapidly changing political climate of Hyderabad in the late Forties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:01:16.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
