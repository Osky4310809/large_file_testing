He got his ear pierced on live TV but was still eclipsed by Mariah Carey’s trainwreck performance on New Year’s Eve. You gotta feel for the guy, if only because he aimed for magnificent revelry only to deliver second-place antics on the the drunkest U.S. holiday. In the above video, Lemon can be heard rambling for ages about his love life (on CNN) while Brooke Baldwin nodded along:\n“I live my life to the fullest. The thing is, I need a little more balance in work-life. I may be open to a relationship this year, I wasn’t before … actually being available to be in a relationship …. I’m a bad person to date. I’m not selfish, but I’m very self-centered … yeah, I’m not going to be as self-centered. I don’t care what people think about me. I do what I want because it’s my life.”\n\nNo one’s quite sure whether or not Lemon was sauced. He appeared to take a shot before getting pierced, but any reputable piercing or tattoo artist would never do their thing on someone who’s been drinking. TV magic, y’all.\nIn the below video, things got even messier. After midnight hits in NOLA, Lemon and Brooke briefly celebrate for the cameras. Then at about 1:20, Lemon states, “2016 was awful” before his mic loses sound and jazz starts playing. Later on after the bubbly pours, Lemon and Baldwin talk to a newly engaged couple from Utah. In the last moments of this video Lemon asks, “Brooke, will you marry me?” And we never hear her answer.\n\nMediaite poses the theory that CNN cut Lemon’s mic after the “awful” bit, although this may have simply been a technical difficulty. After all, Lemon was allowed to keep talking and ask for Baldwin’s hand in marriage, which appears to be the point where his televised fun ended (and old footage of Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin began to air).\nEarlier in the evening, Lemon danced on a tabletop while waving a napkin.\n\nDon Lemon winning multiple Emmys tonight pic.twitter.com/YflYsHe7Dp \n— Busted Coverage (@bustedcoverage) January 1, 2017 \nOf course, social media lived vicariously through the certain embarrassment that Lemon will feel in the morning:\nDon Lemon hammered, standing on bar taking tequila shots is best reporting I've seen on CNN all year! \n— Angie Murray (@PeterPlab) January 1, 2017 \nWow. @donlemon just raised the #CNNNYE bar. #pierced pic.twitter.com/KcvZT34qjx \n— Zilo Phantom (@ZiloPhantom) January 1, 2017 \nDon Lemon just got into a sorority on #CNNNYE \n— CrippleThePresidency (@BrevityShmevity) January 1, 2017 \nDon Lemon just drunkenly got his ear pierced on tv tho, CNN rules pic.twitter.com/ZIV5QaZANx \n— sarah (@3x1minus1) January 1, 2017 \nI hear Don Lemon got into Anderson Cooper's Zima supply tonight. pic.twitter.com/a2jMxuaasv \n— Just Call Me Mister (@MisterMetokur) January 1, 2017 \nDon Lemon is lit on #CNN AGAIN. #CNNNYE \n— MsH805 (@MsH805) January 1, 2017 \n\n\nCould Lemon’s regret be worse than Anderson Cooper’s humiliation at being wrapped in aluminum foil by Kathy Griffin?
