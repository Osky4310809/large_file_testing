Not us united.” \nSpeculation is everyone’s game at this point as the line is not attributed to any actual Justice League member, but the t-shirt does indicate ‘crew’ status and is possibly a gift for crew members. \nHowever, its important to take all rumors with a grain of salt, especially in the wake of yesterday’s blurry image of a black suited Superman. \nThe quote does seem to embody a sense of positivity in the face of overwhelming odds. While Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was lambasted, much like Man of Steel, for its dark and pessimistic portrayal of cherished icons, many involved with Justice League’s production maintain that the film will be much more upbeat. \nFootage has already been released and tends to lend credence to the air of levity surrounding the film, depicting Batman and Flash cracking wise as they get to know each other. \nIn Justice League, fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. \nJustice League is directed by Zack Snyder, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio, and features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot , Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Ciarán Hinds, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Jeremy Irons and Jesse Eisenberg. \nJustice League hits theaters on November 11, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:40:35.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
