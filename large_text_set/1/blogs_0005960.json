I thought we could have gone to that next level,\" he said. \n\"I felt like we weren't quite as sharp, we weren't quite as quick as we have been – a few misplaced passed, a few heavy touches. \n\"We were a little bit short of the levels that we've set this season. You can't be short at places like this. Credit to them, they did well and got the result.” \nBut Cahill is adamant Chelsea will bounce back from their first league defeat since September. \nHe added: \"We're disappointed with that but it's after a run that's been fantastic. It's one game. It won't affect us mentally.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T02:28:57.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
