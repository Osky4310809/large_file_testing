While healthy cooking and eating is worth it in terms of returns on your investment — think extra hours in the kitchen that lead to an extra long, vibrant life — you can't let it take over your life, given how much else you've got going on. \nGood news: you have a wealth of choices of smart gadgets to add to your counter to help reduce cooking time and increase the amount of fresh, delicious food you're eating. Grab one (or all) of these ten talked-about, tech-savvy kitchen tools soon to upgrade your kitchen game. (Image credit: Samsung ) To keep fresh food fresh: \nWith WiFi, a touchscreen, and a thousand other high-tech features, the Samsung Family Hub Refrigerator ($5800 and up) is really next-level. Farmers market produce that's constantly rotting before you can cook it won't even wilt thanks to a triple cooling system and customizable temperature settings. The cameras inside can also tell you what you've got stocked from your iPhone whenever you're at the store, so you don't overbuy or forget items. Since its high price tag doesn't make it accessible to most, though, there's also Fridge Fresh by Berry Breeze ($40), a gadget that releases activated oxygen inside any refrigerator that it says will keep food fresh for three times as long as normal. (Image credit: Juicero ) To make drinks quick: \nTurns out Keurig was on to something big: Expect more of your drinks to come from pods from here on out. For sippable vegetables, the Juicero ($700) is the latest thing in cold-pressed juice, allowing you to make delicious organic fruit-and-vegetable juices at home with no chopping and no clean-up. (Image credit: Teforia ) \nAnd while these next three aren't as health-conscious as on-demand fresh juice, they're all cashing in on the drink convenience trend: Tea from Teforia (above, available this fall) is digitally brewed to perfection, thanks to an app that releases tea leaves into it's infusion globe at brews each tea at the perfect temperature. (Image credit: Somabar ) \nSomabar ($429) plays bartender and serves up perfectly mixed cocktails from SomaPods of your favorite ingredients (I'd add vodka, ginger beer, and lime juice to mine to make the perfect Moscow Mule every time). (Image credit: PicoBrew ) \nLastly, craft-brew-lovers rejoice: PicoBrew ($999) lets you browse a recipe marketplace and select from hundreds of craft beer recipes that you can create with (you guessed it) pods (AKA PicoPak ingredient kits). (Image credit: Pantelligent ) To never overcook the salmon again: \nSauté smarter with Pantelligent ($99), a pan embedded with a sensor that monitors the temperature of whatever you're cooking so that making meals like salmon or steak (and much more) is simple and foolproof. Pantelligent syncs with an app via Bluetooth to guide you through the cooking process and alert you to adjust the temperature or flip the filet, and you can even put it on autopilot (if you purchase an optional accessory) to have it adjust the temperature for you and send you notifications when it's time to flip and time to eat. (Image credit: Orange Chef ) To monitor your meals' nutrition facts: \nFood scales used to be the hallmark of an unhealthy obsession with calorie counting, but Orange Chef's Prep Pad ($65) promotes balanced eating by making it fast and easy to get full nutritional information for every meal. It syncs with your iPad via Bluetooth and as you cook you place the ingredients on the scale, tell the scale what it is, and then it gives you information on protein, fat, vitamins, and more. It also comes with a library of recipes you can tap and syncs with other popular kitchen gadgets like the Vitamix and Crock-Pot. (Image credit: Inspiralized ) To eat (or encourage your kids to eat) more vegetables: \nThis one isn't technically new, but thanks to bloggers like Inspiralized's Ali Maffuci, Spiralizers ($30) are having a major moment. Using one will allow you to transform almost any vegetable—from zucchini to sweet potatoes—into \"noodles\" for faux-pasta dishes you'll love and kids will gobble up. (Image credit: Flatev ) To eat homemade tacos, without an Abuela: \nFlatev , a Keurig for Tortillas expected to hit the market in summer 2017, has answered all my prayers — fresh, homemade tacos without any of the skill and time normally required. Pop a pod filled with non-GMO corn dough (or flour, or cinnamon, or garlic) inside the machine, and it will press it into a perfectly shaped warm tortilla. It's not available yet, but I'm waiting with salsa in hand. (Image credit: Carley Knobloch ) To cook fancy, fast: \nSous Vide may sound like a term only Michelin-starred French chefs use, but smart kitchen gadgets like this one make it easy tor home cooks, too. You can literally attach the Anova Culinary WiFi Precision Cooker ($200) to the side of a pot, set a timer, and come back when your smartphone alerts you to—to a perfectly cooked (grass-fed) steak. \nGreetings!
