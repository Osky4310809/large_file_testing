She has also been a longtime advocate of girl's rights with the UNICEF, and is also an ambassador for Girl Rising, a global campaign for girl's education and empowerment. This International Women's Day, Priyanka shared a video on Twitter, as part of a Girl Rising initiative, to celebrate every woman and every girl. And the beautiful video shows a classroom of girls who are telling stories of themselves, and the strong women they are surrounded by who have fought against adversity in their lives and come out stronger. With the message of #ThatGirlIsYou and #ThatGirlIsMe, this video is a powerful initiative that we all need to drive us to action.
