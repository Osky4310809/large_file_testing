You read that right. Women are knitting pink pussyhats to wear during the Women’s March on Washington, D.C., on January 21 to protest the presidency of Donald Trump.\nThe women’s “ movement ” is being touted as a way to provide protesters “a means to make a unique visual statement which will help activists be better heard” and to “provide people who cannot physically be on the National Mall a way to represent themselves and support women’s rights.”\nOddly, women who typically shun female stereotypes are embracing knitting and crocheting to make their voices heard. In a statement that would make any sex-positivist feminist cringe, these women say they find the “traditional” knitting world appealing because “these circles are powerful gatherings of women, a safe space to talk, a place where women support women.” Will they be baking cookies next? Will the kitchen become a new “safe space”?\nAs for the use of a “pussyhat,” feminists are famous for turning pejorative terms into proud labels (a common tactic to counter stigma). Most famous is their embrace of the term slut, which morphed into SlutWalks , international marches to end the rape culture. So this is just one more attempt to “reclaim” a derogatory term “as a means of empowerment.” I’m surprised none of them has co-opted the GOP acronym to stand for Grab Our Pussies. Of course, it’s only a matter of time.\nIt's not too late to knit yourself a Pussyhat!Monday & Tuesday 12-5 pm, Sister-Arts Studio. https://t.co/ijQ1OjPxUK pic.twitter.com/4DwlRJlYlO\n— Donna Palicka, SASI (@SisterArts) January 16, 2017\nBut this isn’t just about women per se; the Mad PussyHatters couldn’t resist bringing a good dose of intersectionality into the fray, stating :\nIn this day and age, if we have pussies we are assigned the gender of “woman.” Women, whether transgender or cisgender, are mistreated in this society. In order to get fair treatment, the answer is not to take away our pussies, the answer is not to deny our femaleness and femininity, the answer is to demand fair treatment. A woman’s body is her own. We are honoring this truth and standing up for our rights.\nWell, as far as I know the only people wanting to take away pussies are transgender men (women who reject their pussies for a faux penis). And the only people who typically deny femaleness and femininity are feminists themselves who have been hell-bent for decades to make women just like men, defeminizing them to the point that there are very little sexual distinctions or femininity.\nWhat the 'Women's March on Washington' Is Really About\nAs for “assigning gender,” our gender (which is tied to our SEX) is not “assigned.” We are born either male or female. Whether we want to choose to act like men and women is our personal choice. But transgenderism isn’t merely about the aesthetic of sex; it’s about actually changing sex through physical alterations and mutilations. For those rejecting their femininity and femaleness, this is a greater attack on women than any policies proposed by the GOP.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/16/pussyhats-and-the-real-war-on-women/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://t.co/4DwlRJlYlO", "https://twitter.com/SisterArts/status/821010774453878785", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwBjtQGbV7gEZU1TdUd2b1JIZGM/view", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SlutWalk", "https://t.co/ijQ1OjPxUK"], "published": "2017-01-17T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T06:20:08.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
