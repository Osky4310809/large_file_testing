There was a green wicket on offer when Pakistan toured New Zealand, but on both the occasions that the hosts faced South Africa in the One-Day International series, turners were dished out. \nFor as much as New Zealand claimed they were preparing for swing-friendly conditions and didn't include Ish Sodhi in the squad, South Africa beefed up their team with an additional spinner by calling in Dane Piedt for the last match of the series. They were ready for a 'dustbowl'. \nMuch to their surprise, as they went ahead inspecting the pitch, they were met with a track with a good covering of grass. While things can change in the next three days and the pitch could assist spinners as well,they did feel relieved despite Keshav Maharaj and JP Duminy wrecking havoc on a green track in Wellington. \nBut it isn't just spin that South Africa are banking on. Reverse swing is another lethal weapon that head coach Russell Domingo believes could prove effective. \"The main thing is that reverse swing is going to come into the game. It looks pretty dry - the square,\" Domingo said on Wednesday (March 22). \"They have played a lot of cricket here and there are a lot of used pitches which assist reverse-swing, we've got some good exponents of [reverse swing].\" \nWith the threat of rain looming large, the conditions are expected to remain overcast and aid conventional swing. While Morne Morkel could be the main man to threaten the opposition with reverse swing, it is Vernon Philander who could prove lethal with the new ball. He hasn't caused much damage so far, but the 31-year old swing bowler had returned with a 10-wicket haul on his last game at the Seddon Park. \n\"When Vernon hasn't been playing in our side, he is probably the bowler that's been the most sorely missed because of the control he brings,\" Domingo added. \"He is a very skilful cricketer. He has contributed in every single game. It might not be showing in the column with the wickets but in terms of controlling the game and building pressure, he has been our leader,\" Domingo said. \nWhile New Zealand need a win to level the series and end their home summer on a pleasant note, South Africa too have rewards at stake by finishing with a draw or a win. If Australia lose at Dharamsala against India, South Africa will finish the season as the No. 2 side in Test cricket and pocket USD 500,000 in prize money. \n\"It's something we want to get to but our focus is on this game. We want to get up the rankings again. We know what it's like to be at No.7, we were there only a few months ago. We find ourselves at No. 3 now so we are a work in progress,\" Domingo concluded. © Cricbuzz TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T09:06:52.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
