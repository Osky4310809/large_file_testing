game, FOX Sports pored through the archives to pick the 21 best uniforms worn in sports this year. Given the frequency of throwbacks, alternates and third jerseys, we opered up the rankings to any uniform worn in the last year. 21 Washington Redskins \nThe Redskins wore gold pants during the Sonny Jurgensen era but didn't bring back the look until 2012, when they were especially helpful in highlighting how many ways Robert Griffin III's knee buckled at the end of the season. The unis make ocassional comebacks these days and though 'Skins fans tend to only like things as they were during the halycon days of the 1980s (white jersey, burgundy pants), these are retro enough to get a pass. Geoff Burke Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports 20 Toronto Blue Jays \nThe Blue Jays fell victim to the sterilized, shiny and bland logos of the 2000s (think Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots) but went back to the future in bringing back the original blue jay with maple-leaf flag logo and these double-lined unis that were worn in the team's first two decades. Dan Hamilton Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY Sports 19 Buffalo Bills \nWhite-on-white is a good look for weddings, baptisms and the Notorious B.I.G. but not much else. Still, the Bills manage to pull off the look by adding the white helmet with that awesome charging bull to the simple blue and red stripes, numbers and piping. Dennis Schneidler Dennis Schneidler-USA TODAY Sports 18 Army football \nWest Point brought out these Nike-designed, 82nd Airborne inspired uniforms for their annual brawl with Navy. Designed to mimic the military uniforms of the paratrooping division that performed some of the biggest tasks of World War II (they're black because jumps often took place under the cover of night), there's a reference to the division's 'All-Americans' nickname, regimental patches, a 48-star flag on one shoulder (Alaska and Hawaii had yet to join the Union), camouflage netting on the helmets and tactical helmet symbols. The name on the back? Simply \"ARMY.\" Wearing the unis, the Black Knights defeated Navy for the first time in 14 years. Tommy Gilligan Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports 17 Baltimore Orioles \nI texted my mom - born and raised in D.C. - today asking \"what do you think about the Orioles logo\" and then made a bet with myself on how quickly she'd respond with an insult. When my phone dinged 16 seconds later, I'd lost despite my most optimistic prediction. Even with my mom's Washington-based bias affecting me while I was young, I still have a soft spot for that goofy bird and am forever pleased that the O's finally got rid of that Audubon-looking bird off their hat. Tommy Gilligan Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports 16 Golden State Warriors \nThat Golden Gate Bridge logo, complete with the number showcased inside, is a classic that not-so-coincidentally coincided with the team's return to glory. You credit Steph Curry. I'm giving it to the Rick Barry jerseys. Gary A. Vasquez Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports 15 Kansas City Royals \nAs you'll see in later rankings, we have a soft spot for sky/powder blues in uniforms. Denny Medley Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports 14 Oakland Raiders \nThe original Raiders colors were black and gold (very Steelers-like) but when Al Davis came in, he changed from gold to silver. In the 50 years since, the sports uniform that best personifies the team that wears it has barely changed. Davis was a visionary in many ways. Who thought fashion would be near the top? Kirby Lee Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports 13 Los Angeles Dodgers (road) \nStill better with \"Brooklyn\" across the front than Los Angeles,\" but the simplicity of the Dodgers' road duds are a baseball classic. Jake Roth Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports 12 \nAs are the Dodgers' home unis. Gary A. Vasquez Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports 11 Kansas basketball \nKansas does the throwback thing better than anyone and these jerseys, inspired by the 1946 unis, are nearly perfect: a script \"Jayhawks\" across the front, the old school mascot on the shorts and, just like back then, an Adidas logo above the right breast. Jay Biggerstaff Jay Biggerstaff-USA TODAY Sports 10 Montreal Canadiens \nThe Canadiens logo has undergone several small changes over the decades but, at its core, the modern design is a lot like the one that debuted in 1936. Matt Kartozian Matt Kartozian-USA TODAY Sports 9 Cleveland Cavaliers \nThe Cavs wore an orange throwback earlier this year (out of the Brad Daugherty era) that were pretty great but the simplicity of these regular unis, an old-school-inspired one based on the team's original wine-and-gold design are even better and make the first LeBron go-round look as dated as that oversized headband he used to wear. Sergio Estrada Sergio Estrada-USA TODAY Sports 8 Los Angeles Lakers \nCan't say I'm a fan of the purple stripe down the side of the jersey (Kareem, Magic and Worthy never had to deal with such royalty color creep), but even that's not enough to take away from the nearly perfect Lakers home kits. USA TODAY Sports Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports 7 Washington Wizards \nClassics populate the list but the new, striped jersey of Washington's basketball team (which so wisely ditches the Wizards name in favor of the home city) is a modern delight and makes you rue that Wizards greats like Kwame Brown, Andray Blatche and Michael Jordan had to wear a purple, black and gold monstrosity. Noah K. Murray Noah K. Murray-USA TODAY Sports 6 UCLA football \nWasn't lying about the light blues. This one is called \"UCLA blue\" and is often referred to as Westwood's \"hero\" colors. Snobbiness aside, these are perfect for football under the bright California sun. Jayne Kamin-Oncea Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports 5 Dallas Cowboys \nWhen you're America's Team you don't need to resort to gimmicks. The Cowboys logo is the best in sports and the rest - from the neck down - is easy. Kevin Jairaj Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports 4 North Carolina basketball \nThe most famous color in sports - Carolina blue. Curious how UNC got its famous shade? F rom the UNC library blog History on the Hill : \nThe use of a distinctive light blue in association with UNC began not long after the first students arrived on campus in 1795. The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies were a huge part of student life at the time. Through the nineteenth century, students were required to be members of either the Di or the Phi. These two literary and debate societies were both an academic and a social way of life at the time. It was traditional for students from the west of Chapel Hill to affiliate with the Di and students from the east to join the Phi. The Di’s color was light blue and the Phi’s was white. \nSo, in other words, just as snooty as you'd expect. \nCarolina couldn't even keep its own color straight, changing blue hues as often as a Chapel Hill sky. Six different Pantone colors have been officially used as the school's color until UNC and Nike officially made Pantone 542 the color of the University of North Carolina. Rob Kinnan Rob Kinnan-USA TODAY Sports 3 San Diego Chargers (RIP) \nThe refusal of Chargers management to make the old powder blues an official jersey instead of a mere throwback is a perfect metaphor for San Diego's decision to flee to play second-fiddle in a 30,000-seat stadium in Los Angeles. New isn't always better. Jake Roth Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports 2 Alabama football \nJersey numbers are the greatest helmet design of all. The crimson crispness is as classic as the Bear's houndstooth. And, like the other great jerseys on this list, Alabama has been untouched by the Under Armourization of sports.
