Stratton, director of athletic bands. \nReaction hasn’t been completely harmonious. Some alums started an online petition for the school to pull out of the parade, saying Trump’s behavior is at odds with the Christian university’s teachings. \n“We value all opinions, and that is the point of a university,” says junior Tori Kober. \nComing from a religious background, many feel their presence and their music can help a nation heal step by step. \n“Be an example for everyone and show positivity can come through, no matter the environment around the election,” Austin Brown says. \nThe band and marching units are 170 strong. They’ll be marching down Pennsylvania Avenue, playing their signature song, The Chicago Tribune March.
