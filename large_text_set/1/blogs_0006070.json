Smith shared some difficult news on Saturday, releasing a video with his wife, Jewel, regarding complications the couple has experienced with the birth of their daughter, Dakota.\nIn the video, Jewel explains that Dakota was born five months premature and weighs just 1 pound.\n“We decided to share with the world, what’s been going on with our family the past five days,” Jewel says in the Uninterrupted video. “We know a lot of you guys congratulated us on the expectancy of our little baby girl, but we had her five months early. She’s five days old today, and her name is Dakota, and she weighs 1 pound. We know we’re not the only family going through this, who has been through this, or who will ever go through this, and that is why we decided to share what we’re going through. Please keep us in your prayers and we’ll do the same for everyone else.”\nSmith is recovering from surgery he underwent in December to repair an injury to his right thumb. He is expected to return to play for Cleveland by playoff time.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T02:15:01.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
