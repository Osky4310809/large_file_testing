Leila De Lima has expressed fear for her safety once she is taken into custody in relation to drug-related charges against her. Senate PRIB/File Photo \nMANILA, Philippines â€” Sen. Leila De Lima expressed on Tuesday fears for her safety if she is taken into custody in relation to drug charges filed against her. \nDe Lima hopes she would be placed in a safe and secure place in the event that she's arrested for the cases filed against her in connection with the proliferation of the drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP). \nREAD: De Lima sees looming arrest over drug charges \n\"Ang pakiusap ko lang po, sakaling may mangyari na, God forbid, yung eventuality na yan, ay sana ilagay naman ako sa isang lugar na magiging safe and secure ako,\" De Lima, a former Justice secretary, said in an interview. \n\"Marami na ho ang nangyayari, diba? Pinapatay din sa loob ng selda. So, what is another EJK?\" she added. \nDe Lima's fears stem from the spate of extrajudicial killings in the wake of the government's campaign against illegal drugs of which the senator is a staunch critic.   \n\"Sa mga laban ko sa EJKs, and since I am being tagged as Bilibid drug trade queen, I am being tagged as public enemy number 1 pa nitong si Solicitor General Calida. There will be groups that will be interested in eliminating me,\" she said. \nThis criticism of the government's anti-drugs program is the reason why she has been the target of a blistering wave of criticism and attacks from the government and its allies, the senator believes. \nDe Lima said that it's President Rodrigo Duterte himself who wants her to be incarcerated. The senator has since expressed her preparation for any eventuality. \nREAD: De Lima: I'm prepared for the 'worst-case' scenario \nDuterte has labeled De Lima as the highest official to have benefited from the illegal drugs trade at the NBP during her time as Justice secretary of the Aquino administration. The NBP is under the Department of Justice (DOJ). \nDe Lima supposedly received P8 million from convict Jaybee Sebastian to finance her campaign kitty in last year's May senatorial election. She, however, has vehemently denied the allegations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:49:49.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
