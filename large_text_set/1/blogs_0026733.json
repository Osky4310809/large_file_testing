I bring her back with me which is cool, it was nice to come back together. \n“Rosie is a very ditzy character. There is my character that is serious, Kevin is serious, Sally is la-di-dah and then Rosie just shoots a bit more into it. \n“Helen is still funny. Because of having Matilda she is very maternal and she has always been lovely. \n“I think the thing is with Helen from being in it so young, a lot of people got under her skin and a lot of people pushed her into certain things and forced her to say things she didn’t mean. \n\"She is a bit more aware of that and obviously coming back after taking time out. I would still say she is crazy but she is my friend and she is funny.” \nBrooke also insists her break from the soap to star in Be My Baby on stage for nine weeks will will benefit her acting in the soap too.
