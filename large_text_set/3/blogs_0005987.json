New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: AMD Bulldozer and Piledriver Overclocking Guide - Asus Motherboard Poll Results: Was this helpful? About the Guide Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show) This Guide was created as a simplified method to Overclocking Bulldozer and Piledriver CPU's. I've listed the most important settings to change in order to reach stability, in order to take the guess work out. FSB Overclocking is not discussed, as it's not required with a Black Edition CPU. **But if you know about FSB Overclocking, you can just use what you learn here, and apply it to that method. ***Overclock at your own Risk Software Recommended Stress Tool is Prime95 Version 27.7 or newer Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show) Known bugs and fixes: 1. Does not work on AMD Bulldozer processors. Fixed in gwnum 27.5 (there will not be a prime95 27.5). 2. Length 1280K FFT crashes on Pentium 4s with 512K L2 cache or less. Fixed in 27.6. 3. Hyperthread detection is not working properly. Fixed in 27.6. 4. The 6K 2^N-1 and 8K, 10K, 12K, 16K 2^N+1 AVX FFTs are missing. Fixed in 27.6. 5. Some exponents above 536 million generate roundoff errors and incorrect results. Fixed in 27.6. 6. FFT crossover points need retuning. Many can be more aggressive, but a few need to be more conservative. Fixed in 27.6. Package Temps, aka Core Temp (62C Max) CPU Temp, aka Socket Temp (70C Max) Ai Overclock Tuner - Auto, Manual, DOCP CPU Ratio - Adjusts the CPU Clock Multiplier (CPU Multi x FSB = CPU Speed) AMD Turbo CORE Technology - Disable in order to manually Overclock the CPU CPU Bus Frequency - A.K.A. FSB. This adjusts the base clock for, HTT, NB, CPU, DRAM. PCIe Bus Frequency - Defaults to 100, not recommended to change, as it may damage GPU/HDD. Memory Frequency - Adjust the Memory Divider. (DRAM Divider x FSB = DRAM Speed) CPU/NB Frequency - Adjust the CPU/NB Divider - Defaults to 2000-2200Mhz HT Link Speed - Adjust the HT Link Divider - Defaults to 2600Mhz CPU Spread Spectrum - Disable - to increase overclock stability PCIe Spread Spectrum - Disable - to increase overclock stability EPU Power Saving Mode - Disabled CPU & NB Voltage - Offset and Manual Mode - Change to Manual Mode for Overclocking CPU Manual Voltage - ** Available under Manual Mode - Increase the CPU Voltage when increasing the CPU frequency. CPU/NB Manual Voltage - ** Available under Manual Mode - IMC Voltage - Increase when overclocking memory - may require an increase when increasing CPU frequency. CPU VDDA Voltage - Default 2.5v. Higher setting 2.695v will stabilize voltages under load but increases temps. Lower setting 2.2v will lower temps. DRAM Voltage - Adjust the voltage for DRAM. Default 1.5v NB Voltage - Adjusts the voltage for the North Bridge Chipset on the motherboard - Default 1.1v NB HT Voltage - Adjusts the voltage for the Hyper Transport - Default 1.2v NB 1.8V Voltage - Adjust the voltage for the Chipset/CPU Multiplier. Higher multi requires more voltage SB Voltage - Adjusts the voltage for the South Bridge Default 1.1v DIGI+ Power Control & CPU Configuration Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show) Wiki: The AM3+ Socket offers improved power regulation and power quality specifications, including an increased maximum current support of 145 A versus 110 A. DIGI+ CPU LLC - Adjust CPU LLC. Recommended - Ultra High (75%) CPU/NB LLC - Adjust CPU/NB LLC. Recommended - High (50%) CPU Current Capability - Sets the Maximum Current Support. Recommended 130% CPU/NB Current Capability - Sets the Maximum Current Support. Recommended 130% Note: Raising the Maximum Current Support does not make the CPU draw more Current. It just allows it to scale properly with voltage, to prevent Overvolting. Watts = Volts x Amps CPU Power Phase Control - Sets the Phase Control. Extreme helps stability, but increases thermals CPU Voltage Frequency - More testing required VRM Spread Spectrum - Enabled runs in reduced EMI Mode - Recommended Disable CPU Power Duty Control - Extreme gives better stability, but higher thermals. T-Probe tested to 4.7Ghz CPU Power Response Control - Recommended Auto CPU/NB Power Response Control -Recommended Auto CPU Power Thermal Control - 130 Tested to 4.7Ghz (not sure what this effects) DRAM Current Capability - Set higher Capability for higher frequencies - Recommended 130% DRAM Voltage Frequency - more testing required DRAM Power Phase Control - Extreme gives better stability but higher thermals. Recommend - Optimal Advanced Tab Cool'n'Quiet - Always Enabled will lower frequency of Cores under load. Recommend - Always Disabled - or Always Enabled once your Overclock is fine tuned. C1E - Enhanced Halt State. Lowers Power Consumption - Recommend - Disabled while testing Overclock (Enabled - Once fine tuned) SVM - Virtual Machine - Recommend - Disabled unless running Virtual Machines Core C6 State - Effects Overclock. Recommend - Disabled HPC Mode - Recommended - Enabled - Prevents Throttling when Socket Temp gets high. (In some cases it may cause freezing - if this occurs its recommended to disable) Amp Master Mode - Disabled - (Set to Auto once Overclock is fine tuned) DIGI+ & CPU Config Image Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show) ***Picture Requires updating to reflect Recommended Settings What to expect from your CPU Cooler Tricks to Keep things Cool Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show) Whether you are using a closed loop water cooler or air cooling, here are some trick to lower temps even more. You can use the Stock CPU Cooler fan, with some double sided foam tape and either stick the fan to the case, or stick it to the Close Loop Cooler block, so that it is positioned blowing down over the VRM heatsink. Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show) Another way to lower Socket and VRM Temps is to install a fan behind the motherboard so that it is blowing on CPU Socket. All the components link at the socket, so if you can move heat from it, it will help with overall cooling. DRAM Voltages and OC Stability Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show) By using 1.5v or lower for DRAM voltage you can reduce the stress on the IMC to improve stability with overclocked settings. Special thanks to DEUSXXX for testing How to Apply Thermal Paste Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show) Why it's just the Center of the IHS (Integrated Heat Spreader) that really matters, when applying Thermal Paste. *** Do not Delidd your FX CPU it's soldered. It's only meant to represent the size of the CPU Die. M5A97 Notes Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show) It seems that the LLC functions on some of the M5A97 Motherboards does not function as intended. If you run into stability issues and strange voltages using LLC, it's recommended to leave it set to Auto.
