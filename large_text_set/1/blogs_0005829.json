And if it is back in earnest, the Seahawks are absolutely true Super Bowl contenders again. \nSeattle’s title hopes always were going to be tied to its incredible defense, but if it has an offense that’s capable of keeping up with the NFL’s best — and you can’t do that without balance — the Seahawks are a formidable foe in the NFC indeed. \nSeattle’s offensive resurgence could all be because of the Lions’ bad defense — that’s a fair criticism, for sure — but you know who else has a bad defense? \nThe Falcons, Seattle’s opponent in the next round. \nYou know whose defense isn’t all that great either? \nThe Cowboys’. \nSeattle’s run game was almost non-existent this year — there were only two games in 2016 in which a Seahawks running back went for more than 80 yards — and it seemed, at times this season, that the Seahawks’ offense was only Wilson and Baldwin, and those two players, while tremendous, cannot outscore Atlanta and Dallas. \nBut when the Seahawks’ run game was clicking, like it was in those two contests (Week 3 and 13) and Saturday, Seattle averaged nearly 24 first downs and 446 yards per contest. \nThat’s an offense that deserves to be feared. \nPerhaps it was a one-off against a bad team, but maybe it wasn’t. It’s certainly unlikely that Rawls will break his own team postseason rushing record in these playoffs, but with that defense and a talented offense that seems to have rediscovered its identity, who would bet against Seattle? \nThe Seahawks, who limped into the postseason, aren’t limping anymore, all thanks to their great runner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T07:27:02.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
