She and Theresa Feaster of Providence College are the first women hired as full-time staff members for Division I men’s hockey teams. Credit Gretchen Ertl for The New York Times BOSTON — During a men’s hockey game between Boston University and Providence College in early December, Brittany Miller sat in the press box near center ice. She tracked statistics and typed notes in her laptop. Across the rink, Theresa Feaster kept a close eye on the game, logging video of the action. They could have been mistaken for reporters or merely diligent fans. But Miller and Feaster are much more than devoted followers of their beloved teams. They are 24-year-old trailblazers. Last fall, Miller and Feaster became the first women to serve as full-time members of an N.C.A.A. Division I men’s hockey coaching staff when they were hired by their alma maters. But Miller, Boston University’s director of hockey operations, and Feaster, the coordinator of hockey operations at Providence College, say their gender rarely comes up in conversations with coaches or players. “I’m just on the staff and come to work every day and work hard,” Feaster said. “That’s all there is to it. It’s not really something that crosses my mind.” Continue reading the main story Miller and Feaster had noticed each other during games when they both worked as student managers, first as undergraduates and then as graduate students. But they did not formally meet until a meeting of the Hockey East Association, the teams’ conference, after both had been hired full time. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “It’s nice to have someone else who worked hard as a manager and proved herself to her coaching staff,” Miller said. “It shows that Hockey East is really moving forward in hiring females.” Each has been around hockey for as long as she can remember, though they came to their new jobs from opposite directions. Miller grew up on the ice, learning to skate at age 3 and playing competitive hockey through her high school years at Boston Latin School. Feaster did not play, but she began learning the game while bouncing around the minors with her father, Jay, and gained a newfound interest when his job as general manager of the Calgary Flames led to a connection to Providence while she was studying there. Miller, who had followed her older brother into the game and was coached by her father, started working as a manager at B.U. during the first semester of her freshman year, attending all of the Terriers’ practices and games while still managing a full class load. She was finishing up her master’s degree and working as an intern for a sports marketing research company in London last summer when she received calls from Coach David Quinn and the athletic director, Drew Marrochello. The Terriers had an opening on their coaching staff, and both men thought Miller was the perfect candidate. Now she is in charge of all of the teams’ travel logistics, ensures players handle their academic work and helps track statistics. Miller said Quinn and the rest of the staff had treated her as an equal since she accepted the job in September. “They trust me to do a good job, and they know that I can do this job just as good if not better than any guy,” she said.

Credit Gretchen Ertl for The New York Times Marrochello said he had known early on that Miller would be successful in any endeavor she chose. “I’m frankly glad it is in hockey, in college sports,” he said. “I know she’s got a high ceiling.” While Miller’s love for hockey has burned since her youth, Feaster’s was more like rekindling an old flame.
