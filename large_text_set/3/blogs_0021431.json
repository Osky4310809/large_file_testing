This is not a money problem. \n“One thing is for certain: if he leaves PSG, it will be for a top European club.” \nVerratti appears to have grown increasingly unsettled in Paris following the club's embarrassing 6-1 defeat against Barcelona in the Champions League, which saw them exit the competition having won the first leg 4-0 in the French capital.
