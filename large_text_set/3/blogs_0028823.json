Games cannot legally be sold in Australia without a rating. \nBut now, upon further analysis, the Australian Classification Board has changed its mind and the game is listed with an R18+ rating . \nIn the new listing Outlast 2 rates as \"high impact\" (the most mature level) for sex, violence and \"themes\". It's only \"strong impact\" for language and nudity, however. And drug use is merely rated as a \"moderate impact\". \nDeveloper Red Barrels issued a statement to Press Start clarifying that the game was not altered in any way to achieve this rating. \n\"Outlast 2 has been rated R18+ by the Classification Branch in Australia and will be released 26th April 2017. There will be only one version of Outlast 2 available worldwide,\" the studio said. \nOutside of Australia, the game will launch one day earlier on 25th April for PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
