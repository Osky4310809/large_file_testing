In Rory Reid’s Road Trips the British presenter takes us on a tour of some of the world’s most amazing roads in equally amazing vehicles. \nIn this episode, we join Reid as he drives an Aston Martin Rapide S on the Furka Pass in Switzerland, a 31-km stretch of road that features 12 hairpin bends. By the time you reach the top, you’re 8,000 feet above sea level and should be in view of the Rhone Glacier. \nIf the road looks familiar, you’re probably thinking of the car chase in the 1964 Bond film Goldfinger , where 007 in a DB5, is pursued by a Ford Mustang. Unlike Bond’s car, the Rapide S has significantly more power, seats and cylinders than the DB5, making things a little nervy especially when you consider the pass’ 2,429 metre maximum elevation. \nWe’ll let Reid do his thing, giving you more information about the road, accompanied by some gorgeous cinematography that is synonymous with Top Gear .
