It remains deeply divided between factions based in the east and west that back rival governments and parliaments. \nHaftar, who is aligned with the eastern parliament and government, has been fighting a two-year military campaign with his LNA forces against armed groups in Benghazi and elsewhere in the east. \nBDB is composed partly of fighters who were ousted from Benghazi by the LNA. Analysis: Libya peace talks in jeopardy \nMeanwhile, US and security sources on Tuesday told Reuters that Russia has deployed special forces and unmanned drones at Sidi Barrani, about 100km from the Egypt-Libya border, adding any such Russian deployment might be part of an effort to support Haftar. \nThe reports were later denied by both Moscow and Cairo. \nBack in January, Haftar was given a tour of a Russian aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, according to Russian media reports, a show of Kremlin support for the faction leader who opposes Libya's UN-backed government. Escalation of violence \nThe latest fighting around the terminals has raised the prospect of a new escalation of violence and put at risk a sharp boost to Libya's oil production achieved after the LNA took over four ports in September, ending a blockade at three of them. \nThough Es Sider and Ras Lanuf have been reopened for exports, they were badly damaged in past fighting and are operating well below capacity. READ MORE: Will losing oil ports end Haftar's power? \n\"Haftar claims to control most of the eastern part of Libya around Benghazi,\" Oliver Miles, former British ambassador to Libya, told Al Jazeera last week. \n\"But, control is a loose word. He's been fighting for a long time to deal with them and it has taken a long time time to clear them up. He's repeatedly said they've dealt with the problem but they keep reuniting.\" \nLibya's oil production has recently been fluctuating around 700,000 barrels per day (bpd), more than double its output last year but still well under the 1.6 million bpd the OPEC member was producing before a 2011 uprising.
