PRESIDENT BUHARI RETURNS. 14C President Muhammadu Buhari Returns to abuja. \n“In the same vein, we thank the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, for holding forth creditably while the president was away. \n“We urge him to continue to work assiduously to lift the nation out of this debilitating economic recession. \n“To achieve this all hands must be on deck.
