(Source: ANI/Twitter) \nIn a historic first, Manipur will have a BJP -led government in the state as N Biren Singh took oath as the new Chief Minister at the Raj Bhawan in Imphal on Wednesday afternoon. His swearing-in ceremony took place in front of a full house that included Union Minister Prakash Javadekar and senior BJP leader Jitender Singh. After taking the oath, Biren Singh shook hands with the former Chief Minister of the state, Okram Ibobi Singh who also attended the ceremony along with current state Congress president TN Haokip. \nAfter N Biren Singh, Joykumar of NPP also took oath as the Deputy Chief Minister of the state. Joykumar is a former DGP of Manipur and was once considered Ibobi Singh’s right-hand man. He was given the post of Deputy CM after his party formed a post-poll alliance with BJP in the state. Th Biswajit of the BJP, L Jayantakumar of the NPP, Karan Shyam of LJP, L Haokip of NPP, N Koyisi of NPP, Losie Dikho of NPF also took oath as Ministers along with Th Shyamkumar who contested the elections on a Congres ticket. \nYou may also want to watch: \nBiren Singh himself is a former Congressman. He contested the 2007 elections with a ticket from the Indian National Congress and held the post of the Minister if Irrigation and Flood Control and Youth Affairs & Sports. However, in 2016, he fell apart with CM Okram Ibobi Singh and joined hands with BJP. \nSince March 11, the day of the results, both the Congress and the BJP had claimed support in order to form the next government. Although the Congress emerged as the single largest party with 28 MLAs, the BJP, with 21 MLAs, claims to have the support of NPP (4), NPF (4), LJP (1), and three others. Despite Congress’ continuous objection, Manipur governor invited BJP to form the government as it was able to prove majority.
