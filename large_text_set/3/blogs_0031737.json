He might not get the call-up this year, but if the Pirates trade Andrew McCutchen, Meadows is the man who is going to get the call — don't be surprised if he softens some of that blow. Jake Roth Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports Manuel Margot - OF - Padres \nThe Padres' centerfielder of the future is likely to get the call this year — the only thing keeping the speedster off the Padres not-so-great (ok, really bad) major-league roster is former first-round pick Travis Jankowski, who will have a chance to keep his job with strong play early in the season. If not, Margot's plus glove and base-stealing ability will be at the top of the Friars' order. Kim Klement Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports Trey Mancini - 1B/RF - Orioles \nWhat does a guy have to do to get a full-time call-up? \nMancini has been wildly impressive since he was called up last September (3 homers in 15 plate appearances), posting an OPS of 1.001 this spring. \nWhile it's unlikely such a form will continue in a full major-league season (or even half) you can't entirely write it off . Scott Rovak Scott Rovak-USA TODAY Sports Ozzie Albies - 2B - Braves \nLed the Southern League (Double-A) in hitting last year and can only be described with two words \"spark plug\". \nAlbies is the Braves' second baseman of the future, which, if Brandon Phillips disappoints, could be 2017. Charles LeClaire Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports Tyler Glasnow - SP - Pirates \nThere are serious questions about Glasnow's ability to start at the major-league level because of lax control, but few doubt that his arm has the capability to strike out a lot of hitters — he had a K rate of 30 at the Triple-A level. Six-foot-eight and 23 years old, there's plenty of time for the fifth-round prospect, but he needs to show that he can translate his elite stuff to the Major League level for more than an inning or two. If he can — look out. Kim Klement Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports Clint Frazier - OF - Yankees \nFrazier was just called up to Triple-A by the Indians when they traded him to the Yankees as the centerpiece of the Andrew Miller deal. \nThere's no doubt that Frazier will need to get at-bats at Triple-A to start this season, but if he posts a 125-plus wRC+, as he did at his previous minor-league stops, the Yankees won't be able to keep him out of the major-league lineup. \nSorry, Brett Gardner. Reinhold Matay Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports J.P. Crawford - SS - Phillies \nCrawford's 2016 season at Triple-A wasn't great — he hit .248 — but his major-league ready glove and strong plate discipline mean the Phillies aren't worried. If he bounces back early this season, he'll get the call and take his place on the left side of the infield for what the Phillies expect will be a decade to come. Caylor Arnold Caylor Arnold-USA TODAY Sports Josh Bell - 1B - Pirates \nBell isn't going to win any home run titles, but he's an advanced hitter with a strong eye and his bat is developing more pop with every at-bat. \nIs he ready to be a significant contributor? The Pirates are certainly hoping so — he's set to start at first to start the season. Anthony Gruppuso Anthony Gruppuso-USA TODAY Sports Robert Gsellman - SP - Mets \nYes, another young Mets pitcher with awesome stuff. Gsellman, with his 95-mile-per-hour power sinker and nice complimentary arsenal, is slated to start the season in the Mets rotation, Matt Kartozian Matt Kartozian-USA TODAY Sports Lucas Giolito - SP - White Sox \nThe star has faded a bit for the man who was the top pitching prospect in baseball last year, so much so that the Nationals included him in a trade (along with another top prospect on this list) for Adam Eaton this winter. \nGiolito struggled in 2016, as the Nationals tried to tweak his mechanics and then moved him around the minors and up to the majors as if all the parks were within a 10-minute walk of each other. \nGiolito is 22. He's 6-foot-6 and 250 pounds, and he's while he's going to start the 2017 season at Triple-A, expect him to be part of the major-league rotation in Chicago this year, which means lessons with Dr. Cutter, White Sox pitching coach Don Cooper, who isn't much for messing with natural mechanics. \nThat shine could come back in 2017. Troy Taormina Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports Yulieski Gurriel - 1B - Astros \nA rookie in designation only, Gurriel, a Cuban defect, is 32 years old and poised to be the Astros' opening day first baseman. His .949 OPS this spring should turn some heads. Kim Klement Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports Jose De Leon - SP - Rays \nThe centerpiece of the Logan Forsythe trade, De Leon is one of the top pitching prospects in baseball, who is ready for a full major-league season after striking out 33 percent of hitters in Triple-A last year. With a plus fastball and far-too-good-for-his-age changeup, De Leon has the stuff to be an ace at the major-league level. Rick Scuteri Rick Scuteri-USA TODAY Sports Reynaldo Lopez - SP - White Sox \nThe other pitcher the Nationals included in the Adam Eaton trade, Lopez has a fastball that can touch triple digits and a curveball that can make grown men crumble. It remains to be seen if he's a starter — some see him as a lights-out closer — but if he can cut it there this year, expect a big impact. Mark J. Rebilas Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Francis Martes - SP - Astros \nMartes is a power pitcher in the classic sense, despite the fact that he's only 6-feet tall. He boasts a mid-90's fastball and a really good curveball that hasn't been fully realized. Control is an issue, and he'll start the season at Triple-A to work on that, but given Houston's rotation, Marte could prove to be a quick call-up. Soobum Im-USA TODAY Sports Lewis Brinson - OF - Brewers \nThe centerpiece of the trade that sent Jonathan Lucroy to the Rangers, Brinson is ready to make an impact — a big one — at the major-league level this year, as evidenced by his .973 OPS this spring and success at the Triple-A level in his career. A rangy center fielder with a plus glove, if Brinson's bat shows up at Triple-A to start the season, the Brewers won't be able to keep him down much longer. Joe Camporeale Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports Mitch Haniger - OF - Mariners \nAt 26, Haniger doesn't fit the typical prospect mold of a prospect, but the late bloom is viable — Haniger is a strong outfielder who is slated to start in right field for the M's this year and his revamped swing led to a .999 OPS (leading the minor-league) and 25 homers last year. Matt Kartozian Matt Kartozian-USA TODAY Sports Jharel Cotton - SP - A's \nOne of the most exciting and intriguing pitching prospects in recent memory, Cotton is defined by his jawdropping changeup, which is already an elite major-league pitch, coming in 15 miles per hour slower than his fastball. In five starts for the A's last year, he posted a 17 K-to-BB ratio, which should improve with more reps. \nCotton has a chance to strikeout 10 batters per nine innings at the major-league level, as a starter, despite having a fastball in the low 90's. If he does, he's your Rookie of the Year favorite. Butch Dill Butch Dill-USA TODAY Sports Amed Rosario - SS - Mets \nThe Mets didn't want to send Rosario to Triple-A this spring — his performance in camp didn't warrant it either — but they did. Something about never playing above Double-A... \nRosario has an awesome glove and his bat shouldn't be a detirment at the major-league level, though it could use some seasoning in the minors (hence the demotion). \nBut with Asdrubal Cabrera starting the season as the Mets' No. 1 shortstop, Rosario might not be long for the farm — and when he comes up, you'll hear all about it. Rick Scuteri Rick Scuteri-USA TODAY Sports Yoan Moncada - 2B - White Sox \nThe top prospect in baseball, it's unknown at what point the White Sox will call up Moncada, but it will be this season. \nMoncada is a rare mix of power, average, and speed, with a major-league-ready glove. When he does get the call, it'll be because he's ready to make a big impact for the next decade. Jason Getz Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports Dansby Swanson - SS - Braves \nWe got a taste of what Swanson can provide last year, and it has all of baseball craving more. \nThe No. 1 overall pick in 2015, Swanson wasted no time getting to the majors after being traded by the Diamondbacks, and along with a Gold Glove-caliber glove at short, he posted a 107 wRC+ in his 38 major-league games. \nWith plenty of offensive development to go, the sky is the limit (or the ceiling is the roof) for this uber-talented rookie. Kim Klement Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports Andrew Benintendi - OF - Red Sox \nThe Red Sox' farm system was so stacked that two of their prospects were considered the best in baseball towards the end of last year. One of those prosepcts, Moncada, was dealt to Chicago for Chris Sale, but Benintendi stuck around and is slated to start in left field in 2017. \nA .300/.350/.500 slash line is optomistic, but not out of the question for the 2015 Baseball America College Player of the Year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:09:08.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
