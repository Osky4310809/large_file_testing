First things first: How do you feel about children’s songs?\nAt the Westworld PaleyFes t over the weekend, the showrunners and some of the cast took to the stage to tease what we can expect when HBO’s epic show returns. While everyone was pretty tight lipped when it comes to plot points, Nolan and Joy were game to confess one thing that’s made it into Season 2. And it’s only made its way into Season 2 because it’s made its way into their heads, and now we’ve got to suffer with it, too.\nWhile talking about the music for the show — and that amazing player piano — Joy decided it was time to reveal one song that will appear in Season 2. HBO HBO “I can give you a hint about [one of the songs],” she told the crowd. “At home we have a little girl—” “She’s our little girl!” Nolan was quick to point out, so the crowd wouldn’t start thinking that they’ve got, like, a young robotic Anthony Hopkins living with them.\n“So we spend a lot of time watching children’s movies, and one of them has proven to be musically,” Joy continued. “Like, incredibly inspiriting. So there may be a strange shoutout to a very kind of, innocent and joyful song that we will take a co-opt and make dark and crazy. Just to traumatize our daughter.” \nOkay, IDK about you guys, but when I hear “incredibly inspiring” and “innocent and joyful” and “children’s movie” the first thing that pops into mind is Frozen . It’s the most song-heavy children’s movie of the past few years, and if there’s one movie on repeat in the Nolan-Joy house, this is a safe bet.\nCould we really hear the Westworld player piano bust out “Let It Go?” We’ll find out in [ long, low wail ] 2018.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:57:27.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
