The documentation reveals that the Galaxy S6 , Galaxy S6 edge+ and Galaxy Note 5 will receive the upgrade during the third week of February, while it’s expected to arrive on the Galaxy S6 edge at the very end of the month. \nProviding things go according to plan, it should then start making its way to the Galaxy A (2016) series in May and finally the Galaxy J range in July. Seeing as the paperwork lists the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge as being graced with the latest flavor of Android this month, and the upgrade started rolling out earlier today , we have no reason to doubt the credibility of the roadmap. \nMore on Android 7.0 : Galaxy S6 Nougat update manual reveals key details \nUnfortunately, these specific timeframes are only good for Turkey. There’s no telling how much longer it’ll take for subsidiaries in other countries to start distributing the upgrade. However, Samsung usually likes to keep them all somewhat in sync for the larger regions, which has led some to believe that the OTA will arrive on the Galaxy S6 trio in Europe over the course of the next few weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:12:06.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
