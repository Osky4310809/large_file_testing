Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr and his coaching staff will lead the West in New Orleans on Feb. 19, per the team's Twitter account: GoldenStateWarriors @warriors Steve Kerr & his staff will coach the Western Conference at the 2017 #NBAAllStar Game! More Â» https://t.co/2xN1KSav7o https://t.co/0TPHwqkeqi 1/24/2017, 4:58:18 AM Former Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Lakers coach Mike Brown is one of Kerr's assistants, as is Ron Adams. The Warriors' official website noted Kerr and his staff earned the honors by clinching the best record in the West through Feb. 5 for those coaches who are eligible to participate. The 38-7 Warriors are just 2.5 games ahead of the San Antonio Spurs, but Gregg Popovich coached last year's All-Star Game and cannot be given the distinction two seasons in a row. Even though Golden State lost to the Miami Heat on Monday, the Houston Rockets' 127-114 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks ensured the Warriors would have the best non-Spurs record in the West through Feb. 5. Kerr coached the West in the 2015 All-Star Game. The Warriors' website said he will become the first coach to lead an All-Star team in two of his first three seasons since the Phoenix Suns' Paul Westphal did so in 1993 and 1995. Kerr's counterpart will not be Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue even though the defending NBA champions have the best record in the East at 30-13. Lue coached the East in last year's game and, like Popovich, is ineligible. The Toronto Raptors' Dwane Casey sits in pole position at 28-16, but the Boston Celtics' Brad Stevens isn't far behind at 26-17. Here is a look at the starting lineups Kerr and the East coach will have at their disposal in New Orleans: 2017 All-Star Game Starters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T13:15:42.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
