(Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) \nBy Bryan Altman– \n(CBS Local) The NCAA has issued a statement on a missed goaltending call by the officials in top-seeded Gonzaga’s 79-73 win against eighth-seeded Northwestern in the second round on Saturday, saying that the officials “missed a rules violation” but also reaffirming the officials’ decision to issue a technical foul Wildcats Chris Collins on the play. \nAfter trailing by 20 earlier, the Wildcats went on a 23-8 run to cut their deficit to 63-58 at the time of the controversy, which resulted from Gonzaga’s Zach Collins rejecting Northwestern’s Dererk Pardon’s layup attempt by putting his hand through the inside of the cylinder, which is illegal. \nThe refs missed the call, however, resulting in Collins stepping onto the court to confront the official, who then called a technical on Collins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T06:05:53.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
