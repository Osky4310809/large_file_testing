Several reasons. But in part unfinished business,” she said, listing several stories she’s covered for years, that are still unresolved. Like the case of the kidnapped girls in Nigeria and that of American Robert Levinson missing in Iran since 2007. “Returning to news gives me opportunity to play a small part in trying to help,” she said. \nAmong her first show’s guests were beltway insiders from both sides of the aisle, including “fellow cheesehead” Reince Priebus , who will be Pres. Trump’s chief of staff, and Valerie Jarrett who is Pres. Obama’s senior adviser. She also got a surprise phone call from a NFL hall of famer Brett Favre . “My favorite quarterback. How are you,” Van Susteren asked. “I’m doing great.
