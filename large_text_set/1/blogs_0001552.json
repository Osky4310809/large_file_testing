The UFC fighter was knocked out in the first round by Amanda Nunes last night (December 30) at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. \nThis was Rousey ‘s first match in 13 months when she took a hiatus after suffering the first loss of her career, a knockout at the hands of Holly Holm in November of last year. \nHer comeback was short lived as Nunes, the defending women’s bantamweight champion, came out the gate throwing punch after punch that landed right on Rousey’s face. Referee Herb Dean called off the match less than a minute in. \nHip Hop responded to the fight with shock and helped fuel the swirling speculation that the 29-year-old fighter will retire. \nCheck out all the reactions below.
