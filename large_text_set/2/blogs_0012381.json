So far, the company has only released one photo, which you can see above. \nNo details have been made available, either, but expect it to feature the same powertrain as the LC 500h coupé . That car is powered by a 3.5 litre direct-injected Dual VVT-i V6 that produces 294 hp at 6,600 rpm and 348 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm, mated to an electric motor and a 44.6 kW lithium-ion battery to deliver a total system output of 354 hp. \nThe Multi Stage Hybrid system , as it is called, also features a four-speed automatic gearbox for a more direct driving feel. The new transmission replaces the reduction gear that amplifies the engine’s output in a traditional hybrid, allowing much greater drive power to be generated when accelerating off the line. \nThe system simulates the feel of a 10-speed gearbox – the eCVT has three virtual ratios, multiplied to nine through the auto’s first three ratios; the final, fourth gear is the 10th virtual ratio. This enables engine speed to rise in a linear and direct manner under acceleration, eliminating the typical CVT “rubber band” effect. Lexus LS 500 \nElsewhere, expect the LS 500h to come with the same accoutrements as the LS 500, including optional 28-way power adjustable front seats, rear seats that can be reclined up to 48 degrees, heating, cooling and massage functions front and rear, a 12.3-inch centre display and the world’s largest head-up display, measuring a whopping 24 inches diagonally. \nAlso available is Active Noise Control, a 3D-surround Mark Levinson sound system with in-ceiling array speakers as well as Lexus Safety System + with pedestrian detection and avoidance. Another new feature is Lexus CoDrive that provides semi-autonomous driving on highways. \nLonger (than even the outgoing long-wheelbase model), lower and wider than before, the new LS is based on Lexus’ new global architecture for luxury vehicles (GA-L) – first used on the LC – which promises to improved handling agility and performance without sacrificing comfort. A diet of lightweight materials including ultra-high tensile steel sheet and aluminium contribute to carve over 90 kg from the platform and body alone. \nGALLERY: 2018 Lexus LS 500 Research Lexus Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T11:04:43.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
