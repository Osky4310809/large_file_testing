In an effort to play our part in supporting diversity and expanding the accessibility of tech education, Treehouse is introducing the Treehouse Scholarship Program . Our Scholarship Program is focused on nonprofits who provide support for: Veterans and their families Underrepresented populations in tech Socio-economically disadvantaged populations \nToday, we’re honored to announce our first three scholarship award recipients. Each of these organizations has taken inspiring strides to break down barriers. \nVeteran-founded, and led, Operation Code is on a mission to get active military, citizen-soldiers, veterans and their families coding and building software to change the world. \nPath Forward is a nonprofit organization on a mission to get people back to work after they’ve taken time off to care for a loved one. Through partnerships with companies, they create mid-career internship opportunities allowing individuals to re-enter the paid workforce. \nLaunchCode is a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating economic opportunity for aspiring developers through job placement and training in technology. They take a two-pronged approach: both helping individuals gain the skills needed for a career in technology and helping companies find the technical talent they need to get the job done.
