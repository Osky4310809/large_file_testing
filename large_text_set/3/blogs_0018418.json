"Business News Minis could be latest victim of Brexit as BMW boss hints at moving production out of UK \n'business environment for car makers marked by 'volatility, unexpected developments and political uncertainty', chief executive Harald Krueger says  04   Online 'Much will depend on how Brexit is ultimately negotiated', the BMW boss said Reuters \nBMW hinted it may move production of the iconic Mini from England to continental Europe as a result of the UK’s decision to leave the EU . \nChief executive Harald Krueger said in a statement on Tuesday that the German car manufacturer was considering “different scenarios” to deal with any potential economic fallout from Brexit . \n“Our production network offers us flexibility,” Mr Krueger said, adding that “the UK remains an important location for us. Much will depend on how Brexit is ultimately negotiated.” BMW considers moving production of electric Mini to Germany from UK \nBMW makes around 200,000 Minis a year at its Oxford factory and employs than 24,000 people in the UK . Reports circulated last month suggested that the company was considering moving production of its electric Mini models to Germany. \nMr Krueger said the business environment for car makers is marked by “volatility, unexpected developments and political uncertainty,” but the fact that BMW had factories distributed around the world meant that it was well-positioned to adjust production depending on demand. BMW opened a new engine plant in China in 2016 and its largest factory is in South Carolina in the US.

Getty Images 2/26 London to lose status as 'gateway to Europe' for banks \nOne of Germany’s top banking regulators has warned that London could lose its status as “gateway to Europe” for the banking sector after Britain quits the European trading bloc. Andreas Dombret, who is an executive board member for the Bundesbank—Germany’s central bank—told a private meeting of German businesses and banks earlier this week in Frankfurt that even if banking rules were “equivalent” between the UK and the rest of the EU, that was still “miles away from [Britain having] access to the single market”, the BBC reports.
