The current bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act could slash by millions the number of individuals or families that are able to afford or maintain health coverage. The replacement bill — the American Health Care Act — could create tremendous uncertainty for families and individuals looking for affordable coverage. The health care bill could also limit benefits for current Medicaid enrollees and harm programs for our most vulnerable Americans — including children, the elderly, and the disabled. And these health care changes could affect us all by reducing our community hospitals' ability to provide essential quality care. Congress is moving quickly to vote on and pass the replacement health care law, so let Congress hear your voice today. Dear lawmaker, Please do not support the current repeal and replace bill, the American Health Care Act. This health care bill is likely to result in a substantial reduction in the number of Americans able to buy affordable health insurance or maintain coverage under the Medicaid program. The bill could lead to tremendous instability for families and individuals seeking affordable coverage. And the bill could limit benefits for current enrollees and harm programs that serve our most vulnerable populations — including children, the elderly and the disabled. This reduction or loss in coverage will put an additional burden on America's hospitals as they maintain deep provider reductions. The loss of coverage and funding will impact patients' access to quality care and hospitals' ability to provide services. As Congress moves forward on a path towards repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, please protect patients and ensure access to affordable health insurance. Do not support the American Health Care Act. [your comments]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:18:18.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
