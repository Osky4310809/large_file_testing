As a result, your arteries can dilate as much. When that happens often enough, it can lower blood flow throughout the body and make the heart work harder. \nBut peanuts may counteract this effect to some degree. Researchers believe it was because the nuts improved the dilation and constriction of the inner lining of the blood vessels, preventing the stiffening effect. \nNow, the study does have some limitations, including a small number of participants and a limited time frame—the men were only evaluated on two occasions of having the peanut-and-fat mix. That means it’s not possible to know if regular peanut consumption lowers heart risks overall, or simply immediately after eating. \nAlso, for those counting calories, three ounces of peanuts at every meal could be tough. That amount clocks in at just under 500 calories, according to the USDA. And it’s not clear from this study whether ingesting lower amounts of peanuts could lead to some benefit, either. \nAnother caveat is that the Peanut Institute sponsored the study. That tends to draw skepticism about the results—much like a recent Italian study that found eating pasta can help with weight loss , which was funded by Barilla Pasta. \nBut keep in mind that since the study appears in the Journal of Nutrition , it was peer reviewed before publishing. Also, this isn’t the first time that an association between peanuts and heart health have been identified. \nIn fact, a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2015 that looked at the diets of over 200,000 people worldwide found that those who regularly ate peanuts and nuts were less likely to die of heart disease than those who rarely ate them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:13:56.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
