Apparently, no one told Eden Sassoon that, however. On the January 31 episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills , the haircare heiress (who is not a full-time cast member … yet), seemed determined to interject herself into the lives of Kim and Kyle Richards , whether they wanted her to or not. (For the record, they did not.) PHOTOS: Celebrity Health Scares \nKyle was busy preparing for her Gatsby party, which would be a replacement to her annual white party. Lisa Vanderpump told Kyle she couldn't go because she was on vacation and out of town, but Kyle didn't believe her for one second. PHOTOS: Former Real Housewives Stars \nHarry Hamlin Serves Good Meat \nIn a less formal part of town, Lisa Rinna and hubby Harry Hamlin were preparing to host a barbecue in their backyard. Eden showed up with a \"love bottle\" for the hostess, who said it was a sweet gesture, but she wasn't sure what to do with it. Kyle, Dorit Kemsley , Eileen Davidson , Camille Grammer and Erika Girardi all came as well. (Rinna's teen daughters completely fangirled over Erika, which was actually pretty cute.) PHOTOS: Real Housewives' Plastic Surgery: See Their Before and After Pictures! \nEden didn't waste a breath before starting up about Kim again. \"I don't think Kim knows or cares what anyone else thinks,\" Eden sighed to Dorit, who tried to nip the conversation in the bud as quickly as possible. Eden seemed like she just couldn't stop herself, though. \n\"Kim's behavior at PK's birthday was really closed off. She didn't listen to a word I had to say, and she didn't care. As an addict, that's a red flag,\" she insisted to the camera. To Dorit, Eden said that when the right moment arose, she would \"jump in,\" but she didn't want anyone to be uncomfortable. Yeah … right. (Even Dorit commented to the cameras that she suspected Eden said some of these things just for shock value.) At least everyone agreed that Rinna's husband was as good of a barbecue master as she'd insisted. Also … he made pie. Dorit, Paul, Mauricio and Kyle attend the Great Gatsby Party Dorit Kemlsey Instagram \nEden Confronts Kyle \nEileen commented to Kyle that she'd had a nice chat with Kim at PK's birthday party. This was all of the introduction Eden needed to start discussing Kim again. \"She just wasn't nice,\" Eden whined to Kyle, who said she thought Eden was looking at things \"through a magnifying glass.\" Eden continued pressing, though, saying Kim was \"really abrasive\" toward her. \nRinna clearly felt uncomfortable (even though she'd made her own comments about suspecting that Kim was not 100 percent sober). \"Eat a hot dog, and go home,\" Rinna directed Eden — well, to the camera at least. Kyle repeated to Eden that she felt Eden was \"reading into things too much.\" As the conversation plowed forward, more and more of the women became uncomfortable. Camille, Eileen, Erika and Rinna all excused themselves and basically ran away. \n\"I'm not upset with you for having your feelings,\" Kyle said to Eden. She then added, \"We all need support systems, right?\" as she stood up to leave. Eden wasn't letting her off that easily, though, and forced Kyle to hug. Kyle was so not into it that she called Eden out for forcing her into a \"long and awkward\" hug. Eileen and Erika at the Young and Restless offices Bravo \nEden Confronts Kyle. Again. \nThe night of Kyle's party arrived. Dorit and PK rode with the hostess and Mauricio to the party, and on their drive, Dorit told Kyle that Eden had accused her of being an enabler. Kyle was not super excited about that, to say the least. Upon arriving at the venue (an insane mansion that Mauricio's firm was selling), Kyle immediately got stressed because the heaters weren't working properly, she didn't like the placement of the DJ booth, she couldn't see the ice sculpture and the moon wasn't nearly full enough. (Sometimes life is hard!) \nEileen, Camille, Erika, Rinna, Kim and Eden all showed up, dressed in their best '20s gear. Kyle had just started to relax when Eden came over to chat with her and Kim. Eden started off by saying that they reminded her of herself and her (dead) sister. \"Ugh! Stop!\" Kyle screamed to the cameras. Eden didn't stop, though. Instead, she told the sisters that they were \"the most incredible people.\" You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:48:12.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
