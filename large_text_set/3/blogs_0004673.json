Fallon blasts EU army plot as Britain set to OPPOSE creation of Brussels force 'BACK OFF!' Fallon blasts EU army plot as Britain set to OPPOSE creation of Brussels force DEFENCE Secretary Michael Fallon today blasted the EU’s plot to create its own army and urged it to back off. PUBLISHED: 09:15, Mon, Mar 6, 2017 | UPDATED: 09:48, Mon, Mar 6, 2017 \nThe Cabinet heavyweight described a euro force as “unnecessary” as he arrived in Brussels for crunch talks with EU defence ministers this morning. \nHe strongly implied that Britain is set to oppose the creation of such an army, which is backed by some member states including Germany. Related articles EU army could threaten NATO, warns report \nMr Fallon made the remarks as he jetted into the Belgian capital for a meeting of the EU foreign affairs council. \nThere ministers are set to discuss the implementation of the EU’s much-vaunted ‘Global Strategy’ on defence and security. EbS The Defence Secretary made the remarks as he arrived in Brussels for a summit GETTY The EU wants its own military to reduce its reliance on the US \nEurocrats have repeatedly insisted that the policy is not a military power grab, but critics say it will create a Brussels army by the back door. \nAnd the defence secretary made Theresa May’s views perfectly clear with a thinly veiled attack on the idea just before meeting his European colleagues. \nHe told reporters: \"Today we are urging the EU to cooperate more closely with NATO, to avoid unnecessary duplication and structures, and to work together on new threats including the need to strengthen cyber security.\" \nHe added: “Although we’re leaving the European Union we continue to cooperate with our European partners on defence and security and in the fight against terrorism and aggression. \n“We also continue to play our part in the European mission in the Mediterranean rescuing migrants and tackling people smuggling.” GETTY Michael Fallon urged the EU to rethink its plans for an army Today we are urging the EU to cooperate more closely with NATO Defence Secretary Michael Fallon \nMr Fallon stressed that the UK will continue to contribute to Europe’s defence and pointed out it is sending troops to Estonia and Poland and fighter jets to Romania this year. \nThe remarks were a pointed reminder to European leaders that all of those projects to guarantee their security are taking place under the NATO banner, a formula which has kept peace on the continent for 50 years. \nBrussels’ global strategy, penned by its foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, calls for the bloc to be handed the military power to “repel, respond and protect” against threats. \nTellingly it says the EU should have “strategic autonomy” in the world without having to rely on the US, or now Britain too, for its defence needs in a clear push towards acquiring its own army. \nThe paper states: \"We, as Europeans, need to take on a greater responsibility for our own security. \n\"We need to be ready and able to repel, respond and to protect ourselves against aggression, provocations and destabilisation.\" 11 things you need to know about NATO Tue, February 14, 2017 NATO - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4th April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party.

Photo shows: Signing the North Atlantic Treaty which marked the beginning of NATO, 1949. \nPossible areas of cooperation include the deployment of unmanned aircrafts, aerial refuelling services, satellite communication and cyber resistance and defence. \nThe plan would also see EU nations meet at least once a year to discuss how each country manages its defence budget. \nWriting in NATO Magazine in December, defence expert Sven Bishop from the Egmont Institute argued in light of the election of Donald Trump: “Including the objective of ‘strategic autonomy’ in the Global Strategy was prescient. \n“It is self-evident that Europeans nations need the enhanced military capabilities, and access to a command structure, that would allow them to act alone when that is the only option.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T11:55:15.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
