They may be low-key, but they make for a great partnership, and are definitely one of our favourite couples in Bollywood. And #AbhiAsh fans, like us, now have another reason to be even more excited - because the real-life couple is apparently all set to reunite on-screen once again, after seven long years. The duo was last seen together in Raavan , in 2010, which was directed by Mani Ratnam. If reports are to be believed, the couple will be reuniting for a film produced by Anurag Kashyap, called Gulab Jamun . The film is set to be directed by a newcomer, and (rumour has it that) Amitabh Bachchan is set to play a pivotal role in the movie too. We are super excited about this film!
