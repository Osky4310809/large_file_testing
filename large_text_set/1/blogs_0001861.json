Not one, but two sombreros over his hapless teammates, and then the perfect left-footed volley to cap it all off. Amazing. \nThe 19-year-old Portugal international is reportedly highly coveted by a number of teams around Europe, and it’s easy to see why with the ability to pull off goals like this. January is here, there will surely be more than a couple teams testing Porto with bids to come and take him away. \nGoals like this won’t dim the interest in him, training ground or not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:23:57.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
