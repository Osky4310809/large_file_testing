The two countries can join hands to write a new chapter in history,\" he said. \nMattarella endorsed President Xi Jinping’s remarks on the importance of globalization during the Davos Forum in January, stressing that a globalized, integrated and open market is fundamental to economic recovery and more balanced growth across nations. \nHe also harshly criticized trade wars, saying they are not a problem-solver but could only result in more people suffering. Likewise, nations need concerted efforts to tackle global issues from immigration to climate change. \n\"We need a multilateral world. China and the European Union should further enhance mutual understanding through economic, cultural and people-to-people exchanges,\" he said. \nSergio Mattarella is currently on a six-day visit to China that began from Tuesday.
