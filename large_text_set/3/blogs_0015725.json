At the same time that Comey and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers testified to the House Intelligence Committee about Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, the president tweeted a video from his @POTUS account, saying \"the NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process.\" The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process. pic.twitter.com/d9HqkxYBt5 \n— President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017 \nResponding to a question from Rep. Jim Himes about the president’s Twitter post that “ The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process,” Comey said: “ We’ve offered no opinion, have no view and have no information on potential impact because it’s never something we looked at .” POTUS account tweets falsely that NSA and FBI testified no influence on electoral process; testimony was specifically on vote tallying. pic.twitter.com/fV2OdJWiXg \n— NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) March 20, 2017 \nComey was then pressed on whether it was \"too far of a logical leap to conclude that the assertion that you have told the Congress that there was no influence on the electoral process is not quite right\" to which Comey responded \"It certainly wasn't our intention to say that today.\" \n\"Because we don't have any information on that subject. That's not something that was looked at.\" \nComey then again seemed to contradict himself when he said that \"we saw efforts to penetrate the voter registration databases.\" \nFive hours after its start, the hearing continues, with numerous extrapolations, with no actual facts presented, as the heads of the FBI and NSA redefine \"conspiracy theory.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:39:04.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
