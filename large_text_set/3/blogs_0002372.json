But the outcome could be worth it. \n“After they put on the tilapia skin, it really relieved the pain,” dos Santos said in the piece. \nUnlike traditional gauzes, the fish skins don’t have to be removed at all for milder burns, and they’re changed far less frequently for severe ones. That’s important, since changing the dressings can be a very painful process. And while the usual cream prevents infections, the new treatment also helps burns heal days before they otherwise would. \nIf further tests continue to show clinical promise, the researchers hope this becomes a common practice. \nIn the U.S., doctors sometimes cover burns with skin from another part of the patient’s body or from a dead human donor. When that’s not available, they might use pig skin. Massachusetts General Hospital scientists recently found that skin from genetically modified pigs protects skin for twice as long as baboon skin (which is similar to humans’). \nIn Brazil, these solutions are scarce, so the fish offer a cheaper, more widely available option. Their high tension, moisture, and concentration of collagen proteins that aid scarring actually make them preferable to human or pig skin. \nThe only issue might be sterilizing and preparing enough skin to meet hospitals’ needs, Dr. Jeanne Lee, interim burn director at the University of California at San Diego’s regional burn center, told Stat News . Still, she said, “I’m willing to use anything that might actually help a patient.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:29:37.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
