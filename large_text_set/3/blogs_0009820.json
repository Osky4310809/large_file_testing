(Photo: Channel 4) \nWith Spencer Matthews flying out ahead in the lead, closely followed by Kadeena, the gold medalist looked to be an easy second - and therefore safe for the final. \nRocketing down the slope, desperate to catch her, Amy went neck and neck with the sporting hero before cutting her up and sending the two tumbling. \nAnd as Amy slid over the line first, Kadeena couldn't help but throw a thunderous stare her way as host Davina McCall interviewed her. Fans accused the Paralympian of being a sore loser after Amy Willerton crashed into her during the final (Photo: Channel 4) \nSpluttering that amy had \"cut her up\" as a nasty tactic, Davina was quick to tell her Amy had to cross in front of her to make it over the finish line. \nAnd, it would seem that viewers of the show were left unimpressed with Kadeena's attitude following the race. \n\"She may be a gold medal paralympian but I'd award Kadeena Cox a Platinum medal in the sore loser stakes. Lock your door tonight Amy,\" tweeted one fan. \nAnother avid The Jump fan, @connolly_fi, wrote: \"Wow! Kadeena Cox having a sulk on #TheJumpC4 - it's only a game and I'm afraid you lost!\" \nAnd plenty of other agreed too, with @geeee96 opining: \"Kadeena Cox \"she kinda cut me up\" NO LOVE YOU LOST #TheJump2017 Well done @amywillerton .\" \nWhile @blue_windmill quipped: \"Poor sportsmanship from Kadeena Cox - she could learn something from my 3 year old about being gracious in defeat! #TheJump2017 .\" \nKadeena and Amy's epic crash came to nothing in the end, as once-again Amy became unbalanced later on in this show - resulting in her literally crashing out of the final round. \nLeaving it between Spencer Matthews and Louis Smith, former Made In Chelsea star Spencer managed to clinch an epic and unexpected win over Kadeena's fellow Team GB member.
