As the Washington Post notes: A new white nationalist energy Trump fomented in the Republican Party has already embroiled traditional conservatives who will now openly embrace the “America first” white supremacist ethos. Thus mark the moment when Evangelicalism became Trumpism. RIP Jesus. As the post notes: \nThe conservative movement in America now belongs to President Trump. \nThousands of activists will arrive in Washington this week for an annual gathering that will vividly display how Trump has pushed the Republican Party and the conservative movement toward an “America first” nationalism that has long existed on the fringes… \nPanels scheduled for the four-day conference include how the left does “not support law enforcement”; why the United States can’t have the same security standards as heaven (“a gate, a wall and extreme vetting”); and a discussion of “fair trade” that will put Breitbart editor Joel Pollak and progressive anchor Ed Schultz, who hosts a show on Russian-owned RT, on the same side. \nThat may sound like a celebration of a young presidency and the ideas that helped him win in November. But the event will also showcase the tension created as these new voices reshape conservative thinking. CPAC organizers had invited the inflammatory commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, right, to speak at the gathering. They disinvited him as controversy swirled over 2016 interviews where he’d criticized the age of sexual consent and joked about statutory rape. (Mary Altaffer/AP) \nPat Robertson announced the merger between the evangelical movement and Trump this way: billionaire Robertson said he had the authority to say anyone who does not support Trump is going against the will of God. Read Robertson’s message below: \nI think, somehow, the Lord’s plan is being put in place for America and these people are not only revolting against Trump, they’re revolting against what God’s plan is for America. These other people have been trying to destroy America. These left-wingers and so-called progressives are trying to destroy the country that we love and take away the freedoms they love. They want collectivism. They want socialism. What we’re looking at is free markets and freedom from this terrible, overarching bureaucracy. They want to fight as much as they can but I think the good news is the Bible says, “He that sits in the heavens will laugh them to scorn,” and I think that Trump has someone on his side that is a lot more powerful than the media. \nThe new nationalist energy has embroiled this year’s CPAC gathering in controversy. We now face fascist white faith merged with the old pro-life movement. Robertson, Franklin Graham and Jerry Falwell Jr. made it official. Now C-PAC and the entire movement follows Trump over the fascist white nationalist cliff. \nThis year’s CPAC schedule represents a marked shift toward Trump’s politics and penchant for showmanship and White Supremacist Nationalism. Gone are the usual pro-life speakers replaced by Nigel Farage, the pro-Brexit whites-only politician from Britain. Reality TV star Dog the Bounty Hunter will appear with a super PAC trying to draft Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, a regular Trump supporter on the cable news circuit, into Wisconsin’s 2018 Senate race. \nWhite House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who led Breit­bart before joining Trump’s team and has been a standard-bearer for conservative populism, will speak Thursday alongside his colleague, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Bannon hopes to explain Trump’s actions in his first month in office, in particular, policies on immigration and the creation of manufacturing jobs, according to an official familiar with White House discussions. Richard Spencer, the white “identitarian” president of the National Policy Institute, suggested that the movement has gained ground with Trump’s victory. The decision to book Yiannopoulos, said Spencer, “represented a creeping recognition on the part of CPAC” that the alt-right is a force. The alt-right is known for espousing racist, anti-Semitic and sexist views.“CPAC recognizes that it’s not 1979 or 1984 anymore and that it has to change its ideology and adjust to new circumstances,” Spencer said.Schlapp has denounced the “alt-right” movement, telling MSNBC this week that “we won’t endorse it and we won’t rationalize it.” On Thursday morning, ACU board member Dan Schneider will give a CPAC speech denouncing it.As even his supporters acknowledge, Trump first arrived at CPAC as an interloper. The gay Republican group GOProud, which was sometimes denied a table at the conference, capped off its 2011 CPAC agenda by inviting Trump to give a speech about “making America respected again.” As mass deportations start with a militarized national “security” apparatus, white evangelicals will be declaring war on their Hispanic brothers and sisters in Christ. As the president attacks free speech Christians will side with what McCain warns could be a dictatorship. \nA set Department of Homeland Security memorandums released Tuesday reveal that President Donald Trump has declared an open season on the deportation of undocumented immigrants. \n“The Department will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,” one document says. \nThey also expanded Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s ability to perform expedited removals on people who have been living in the U.S. for up to two years. The U.S. will also prosecute the parents of unaccompanied minors as smugglers, according to the documents. \nDHS directed ICE to hire 10,000 additional people to get the job done, according to one of the memos. Most of these folks torn from their families will be Hispanic charismatic and Catholic Christians. As the lights go out on mercy and justice the name of Christ will be forever linked to the jackboot. \nP.S.
