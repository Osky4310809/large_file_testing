Gale Sayers also accomplished this touchdown trifecta in 1965.\nLewis’ first touchdown came from this 13-yard pass from Tom Brady , where he sprinted down the sideline and cruised into the end zone.\nThen Lewis sped past everybody for a 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, finishing off what was a great first quarter:\nThe third play was a simple punching in at the goal line, giving the Patriots a 31-16 lead.\nThe Patriots always seem to have players step up in big games, and Lewis has certainly done that against the Texans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T07:32:23.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
