Your first reaction is to not let silence go too long, so I was in complete shock. I was like, 'Why did you let that happen?' And this is Mariah, who's an amazing singer and an amazing performer.\"\nThe America's Got Talent judge then got a little shady by speculating that the Elusive Chanteuse just may have not been able to hit the notes she used to belt out earlier in her career! She questioned: \n\"Maybe she doesn't have that voice anymore… I hate to say it … I think maybe she was having a rough day vocally and didn't even want to attempt that when it actually came to singing live because some of the track was pre-recorded, all of the high notes, and some of it was just blank for her to sing live.\"\nThat's a scary statement to make, Scary!\nThough we're pretty sure we did hear some isolated high notes…\nDo YOU agree with Mel B? Watch the clip (below) to hear her full case!\n\nWant to hear more? Watch the ladies of The Real go REAL in depth discussing Mariah's NYE fail (below)!\n\n\n[ Image via NBC / YouTube . ] \nTags: carson daly , daytime tv , dick clark productions , mariah carey , mel b , music minute , oops! , sad sad , shade , the real , tv news", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:22:17.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
