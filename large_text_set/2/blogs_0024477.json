Fellow Final Five gymnast Aly Raisman had also competed on Season 16 of the long-running reality series and finished fourth. \nBiles said she had wanted to compete on the ballroom series last fall, but her schedule didn’t allow it. \n“If I could do the spring season, I would love to do that!” Biles told ET. \n“I think [I’d like to dance with] Sasha [Farber],” Biles continued. “I think it would be cool to be with Sasha.” \nSeason 24 of “Dancing With the Stars” premieres Mar. 20 on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:55:56.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
