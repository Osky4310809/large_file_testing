The Foxes progressed 3-2 on aggregate as they booked a spot in the quarter-finals. Wes Morgan bundled the ball home after 27 minutes at the far post from a set piece, as the home crowd exploded into life. Marc Albrighton doubled the lead against the run of play after 54 minutes, just when the visitors had established a foothold in the match. Sevilla continued to work tirelessly for a route back into the fixture, but the Foxes matched them as they battled to move forward in the competition. Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel saved a late penalty from Steven N'Zonzi to put the icing on the cake for the home team. Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images Leicester boss Craig Shakespeare named an unchanged side from the team that defeated Hull City in the Premier League on March 4. In contrast, Sevilla had rested a number of players in their last outing, allowing coach Jorge Sampaoli to rotate eight of his starting XI. Sergio Rico, Adil Rami and Pablo Sarabia were the only players to retain their places. The visitors kept the ball in the opening moments of the match as the atmosphere at the King Power rocked the foundations of the stadium. The crowd were soon rewarded for their vocal efforts after 27 minutes as Morgan's knee connected with a free-kick from Riyad Mahrez, deflecting the ball past goalkeeper Rico. The skipper created history with his goal, according to OptaJose: OptaJose @OptaJose 1 - Wes Morgan has become the first Jamaican player to score in the #UCL history. Captain. https://t.co/qHbcRsWu8f Presenter and Leicester fan, Gary Lineker, was delighted with the strike: Gary Lineker @GaryLineker 3/14/2017, 8:12:51 PM Sevilla responded with intent as stopper Schmeichel was forced to deny full-back Gabriel Mercado's bullet effort, but the Foxes defence managed to frustrate much of the visitors' best work. The home fans continued to play their part, singing in unison as they supported the Premier League champions. The Foxes played on the counter-attack as Sevilla camped in the attacking third, and Jamie Vardy twice attempted to break free from deep. Squawka Football provided the vital statistics during half-time: Squawka Football @Squawka Leicester 1-0 (2-2 on agg.) Sevilla HT: Shots: 8-6 Pass accuracy: 68%-81% Chances created: 2-5 Possession: 41%-59% https://t.co/xEcao8OygC 3/14/2017, 8:35:33 PM Los Nervionenses were quickly out the blocks with a positive start in the second half, as the Foxes defence sank deeper and deeper with every passing minute. The hosts appeared nervous as they leaned against the ropes, but Sevilla couldn't land a clean punch as Leicester rocked. The Spanish side were unlucky not to earn an equaliser as Sergio Escudero rattled the crossbar with a swerving thunderbolt, but Leicester promptly responded with a rapid attackâ€”with Albrighton keeping his cool to find the bottom corner. OLI SCARFF/Getty Images The attacker controlled the ball on the edge of the area as Leicester counter-attacked, and he threaded his shot past Rico. The goal was against the run of play, but Leicester's game plan was clearly to use pace from deep to hurt the much slower La Liga outfit. BT Sport Football shared the magic moment for the champions of England: BT Sport Football @btsportfootball Here we go! Marc Albrighton hammers home to put @LCFC 3-2 up in the tie! ðŸ™Œ #UCL https://t.co/vwJZEWqJkL Sports journalist Tom Seymour tipped his hat to the goalscorer: Tom Seymour @tomseyms In 2015 Albrighton was deemed not good enough by Aston Villa. He's now a Premier League winner and playing in the Champions League #LCFC Lineker was left speechless by his team's performance: Gary Lineker @GaryLineker 3/14/2017, 8:56:11 PM The Foxes should have made it 3-0 shortly after the hour mark as Vardy scuffed his shot with the goal at his mercy, and the England international held his head in his hands as he spurned a golden opportunity in the box. However, Sevilla kept their tails up and pushed forward, but their attacking was becoming more desperate as the contest became stretched and frantic. A major flashpoint occurred with 15 minutes remaining as Samir Nasri and Vardy faced up to each other. The incident earned Nasri a second yellow card, reducing the Spaniards down to 10 men for the closing stages. Squawka Football highlighted the moment of madness: Squawka Football @Squawka Samir Nasri has been sent off for the first time since the 29th December, 2012. Butting heads. https://t.co/osc0swx3Md 3/14/2017, 9:17:50 PM Despite the sending off, there was a sting in the tail as Schmeichel was later adjudged to have fouled Vitolo, forcing the referee to point to the penalty spot. However, the great Dane atoned as he saved N'Zonzi's weak effort, once again triggering a wave of emotion around the stadium as Leicester fans sang their goalkeeper's name. Sampaoli was sent to the stands with eight minutes remaining after reacting against the officials, but Shakespeare remained cool and calm in his technical area. Leicester saw the job through despite constant pressure from Sevilla, and they deservedly progress after an inspirational night at the King Power. The Spaniards were technically better on the night, but the hosts produced an extraordinary display of fight to remain in the Champions League. Post-Match Reaction Schmeichel was delighted after the match and explained how much it meant to him and his team-mates to beat one of the best teams from Spain, per BT Sport Football.
