Online streaming is available through MLB Network , with adequate television provider authentication.\nThis is the second time in four WBC tournaments that the United States has reached the final four . The last time was in 2009, when Team USA lost to eventual tournament champion Japan.\nJapan has reached the semifinals of all four World Baseball Classics, the only team to do so, winning the championship in both 2006 and 2009. This year, even without international sensation and two-way star Shohei Otani — nursing an ankle injury — Japan is undefeated through two rounds, winning all six games in Tokyo.\nThe United States will send Washington Nationals pitcher Tanner Roark to the mound on Tuesday night. Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Chris Archer , who pitched four perfect innings in the first round but left to rejoin the Rays last week, was originally planning to rejoin Team USA to potentially pitch one of the final two games, but received word on Sunday morning that would no longer be the case.\nI received a message this morning that I am no longer needed to pitch in the final round of the WBC. I will not be leaving camp as I thought\n— Chris Archer (@ChrisArcher22) March 19, 2017 I had an amazing time representing our country wish I could take the ball one more time but it's out of my control. We're in good hands tho!\n— Chris Archer (@ChrisArcher22) March 19, 2017 Starting pitching has been the hallmark of Team USA in this tournament, with Archer, Roark, Drew Smyly, and Marcus Stroman combining for a 1.73 ERA with 25 strikeouts and just two walks in 26 innings.\nThat pitching will have to contend with a power Japanese lineup that has scored 46 runs in six games. Outfielder Yoshitomo Tsutsugoh — 8-for-22 (.364) — and first baseman Sho Nakata — 5-for-17 (.294) — both have hit three home runs and driven in eight in the tournament, and Tsutsugoh was named MVP of Pool B in the first round.\nTuesday night’s winner earns a spot in Wednesday night’s championship game , also at Dodger Stadium, and will take on Puerto Rico, who defeated the Netherlands with a walk-off on Monday . \nESPN Deportes will televise Tuesday’s game in Spanish, which will also be streamed online at WatchESPN .\nJapan vs. United States info When : 9 p.m. ET\nWhere : Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles\nWhat : World Baseball Classic semifinals\nTV : MLB Network, ESPN Deportes (Spanish)\nOnline : MLB Network , MLB.tv (subscription), WatchESPN (Spanish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:41:03.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
