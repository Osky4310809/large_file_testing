Oh, and it was also the year that they made the most embarrassing mistake in the history of the Oscars when they announced the wrong Best Picture winner! In honor of Hollywood's biggest night, here are a look at some of the best, worst and absolutely weirdest moments from this year's Oscars. \nvia GIPHY Instead of starting the show with a traditional pre-taped comedy montage, the Oscars decided to let the endlessly charismatic Timberlake open the ceremony with a live, energetic performance of his Oscar-nominated song, \"Can't Stop the Feeling,\" and it set the perfect tone for an exciting night. Jimmy Kimmel Pays Tribute to Meryl Streep \nvia GIPHY Following his hilarious monologue, Kimmel mocked President Donald Trump's laughable insults directed toward three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep by discussing her \"overrated\" career and asking the audience to give the \"lackluster\" actress a standing ovation -- which saw the entire crowd stand and give a round of cacophonous applause. Hidden Figures Cast Honors Katherine Johnson \nvia GIPHY So many \"based on a true story\" movies don't do their subjects justice, but the surprise hit Hidden Figures has done everything it can to share the greatness of the real women who worked tirelessly behind the scenes of NASA's space program. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae came out on stage to introduce the real star of their film -- 98-year-old Katherine Johnson, who joined the pair onstage to share her appreciation with the generation who have come to know and respect her immense contribution to the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:11:52.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
