Children, that’s who.\nAt least two school districts in Virginia and North Carolina are cancelling classes Wednesday because so many teachers won’t be showing up to do their jobs. Instead, they’re going to be lounging around and shopping only at small businesses that are owned by a woman or a person of color.\nThe Day Without a Woman is a nationwide protest organized by the same activists who spearheaded the pussy-hat protest (a.k.a. the \" Women’s March \") after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. The goal of the protest is to show men what life would be like if they didn’t have women in their lives. To that end, women aren’t doing any paid work or “unpaid” jobs like housecleaning, cooking, picking up the kids from daycare, etc. And they’re all supposed to wear red for some reason.\nIn December when they tried this same protest, the ladies of The View suggested that women also refrain from having sex with their husbands. That protest fizzled — with most people not even knowing it was happening — but this one is bigger, as women across the nation were inspired by the pink pussy-hats on parade that protested the president.\nBecause most teachers are women, schools are feeling the impact more than any other sphere. Alexandria, Virginia announced that it would be closing schools when more than 300 staff members asked to take the day off. The district’s statement wasn’t an endorsement of the protest per se (though no women are being disciplined or fired for refusing to show up to work):\nThis is not a decision that was made lightly. We have been closely monitoring requests for leave on March 8, including communicating with school leaders and our education association.\nThe decision is based solely on our ability to provide sufficient staff to cover all our classrooms, and the impact of high staff absenteeism on student safety and delivery of instruction. It is not based on a political stance or position.\nA Tale of Two Photos at the Women's March\nSchools in the Chapel Hill–Carrboro district in North Carolina will also be closing. Their statement was similar, except they made it a point to announce their support of female employees:\nThis coming Wednesday, March 8, is International Women’s Day, and has also been deemed, “A Day Without a Woman.”\nWomen across the nation, as well as men, will be participating in a one-day demonstration to recognize the value of women. As part of this demonstration, many will be staying home from work. ...\nChapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools values and supports its female employees. However, the decision to close schools is not an endorsement of the planned demonstration. The decision is made solely to avoid operating school on a day when there are insufficient staff to provide instruction and basic school services.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/parenting/2017/03/07/day-without-women-participants-should-be-ashamed-especially-with-schools-closing/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://thefederalist.com/2016/12/12/12-ways-celebratemen-instead-refusing-sex-protest-trump/", "https://www.womensmarch.com/womensday", "http://chccs-news.blogspot.com/2017/03/march-8-is-now-teacher-workday-delayed.html", "https://www.google.com/amp/www.ibtimes.com/day-without-woman-school-cancellations-protesting-teachers-cause-closings-virginia-2503070%3Famp%3D1", "https://www.acps.k12.va.us/"], "published": "2017-03-07T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T02:05:19.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
