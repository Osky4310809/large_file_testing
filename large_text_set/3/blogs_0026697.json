In fact, the Red Sox themselves couldn’t contain their excitement and looked like kids on Christmas morning when Aso arrived with his haul. \nYou might have noticed a lot of the players talked about their gloves’ SuperSkin, which is a synthetic material Wilson uses to replace some of the leather on the back. It’s lighter, softer and easier to break in than leather and is a favorite of Pedroia. \nBut no matter what the gloves are made of, it’s safe to say the team will be looking sharp on the field in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:24:09.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
