The dress, popular for its bold color, slimming black panels and tailored fit was available on Amazon for around $30, making it an ideal choice. \nA private Facebook group of female meteorologists came up with the idea to take the popularity of the dress and use it to promote women in STEM fields. AccuWeather's Julia Weiden is part of that group, and she came up with the idea to use \"the dress\" to raise awareness. \n\"The goal is to show young girls that it's possible for them to study science or math and have a successful career in STEM fields as adults,\" Weiden said. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:58:19.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
