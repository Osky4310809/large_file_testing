After playing a tape of Ivanka Trump saying she wouldn’t ever take a role if her father got to the White House, Noah said: “Donald couldn’t stand to be apart from Ivanka, you know? In his four-year term he was eventually gonna find some way to bring her in, but two months? This guy has the patience of a toddler.” \n“A smart man would go for the long con. You know? Trump is the guy standing outside the jewelry store going, ‘And now we wait till the guards go home. Screw it, let’s go in now!” \nHe then moved on to the story of Park Geun-hye, the South Korean president who was arrested after a corruption scandal. “Wow. A president impeached. Removed from office, and thrown in jail. Imagine that. No, no, seriously. Let’s all close our eyes and imagine that.” \nOn Wednesday night’s Late Show, Stephen Colbert had focused on Trump attending a women’s empowerment event; on Thursday night he made fun of Trump’s relationship with Russia. \n“All this Russia stuff boils down to one simple question: what is Trump’s relationship with Russia and when does he plan to leave it for a younger country?” he joked. \nHe then did a segment called leak-crets during which he talked to a secret source – someone behind a screen whose voice was disguised but looked a lot like Colbert – who said the staff at the White House were scared for their jobs. “Scared they’re going to lose them?” Colbert asked. “No, they’re scared they’re going to keep them,” came the reply. \nColbert also ripped into Mike Pence after the vice-president said he doesn’t attend events where alcohol is served if his wife isn’t present. “He’s so naughty that if you left him alone with a bottle of whiskey, he might try to have sex with it. And Jim Beam and Jack Daniels are both dudes. And he’s not into that scene. He has to pray away the Mount Gay.” \nHe then turned to Devin Nunes, and the Democrats’ call for him to recuse himself from his committee’s ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the US. \n“Nunes has refused to reveal who [his source] was out of concern that if his source was exposed, he’d have to come up with a new reason to keep canceling all the Russia hearings.” \nSeth Meyers also turned his attention to Nunes. \n“In the House the investigation is led by the Republican chairman in the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, who has basically done everything he can to delay or interfere with his own investigation, raising the question of whether he’s investigating Trump or working for Trump.” \nDiscussing reports that Nunes may have got information about Trump’s alleged surveillance from the White House, Meyers joked: “It’s like when you send yourself an email reminder and, two minutes later go, ‘Oh! A new email.’” \nHe then moved on to the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, who he showed struggling to give straight answers to reporters. “I bet Sean Spicer fantasises about having an easier job … like Bill Cosby’s publicist.” \nHe also joked about Trump’s low approval ratings in the latest Gallup poll. “Trump’s approval rating hit a record low 35%, and this is supposed to be the honeymoon period. Trump should be good at those … he’s had three of them.” \nHe also discussed the New York magazine story which claimed that multiple sources said they heard George W Bush say “that was some weird shit” after Trump’s inauguration address. “You know things are getting crazy when you can make George W Bush sound like he’s on shrooms,” Meyers said.
