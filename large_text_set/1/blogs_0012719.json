During an interview with Shoboy and Nina on 92.3 AMP Radio, the 25-year-old singer revealed that Rita Ora once helped him sneak into a party -- by posing as her then-boyfriend, Calvin Harris! WATCH: Ed Sheeran Announces the Release Date for New Album, Sings Acoustic Version of the â€˜Fresh Princeâ€™ Theme Song \"I went to an Oscars party at Madonna's manager's house by saying I was Calvin Harris,\" Sheeran revealed. \"It was at a time when no one knew what he looked like. He was just the DJ name, and I was with my cousin and Rita Ora.\" \"Rita Ora was with Calvin Harris at this point. She said, 'Calvin's on the list but I know he's not coming, so just say that you're him,'\" he explained. While getting into the party required a little impersonating, Sheeran has no regrets. \"It was a really amazing party, Prince was there actually,\" he said. \"The first person I saw when I walked in was Prince. And apparently Calvin Harris was there, a bit shorter and a bit less Scottish, a bit less abs as well.\" While Sheeran has been making the rounds promoting his new album, Ã· (pronounced \"Divide\"), he sang a different tune during an appearance on Heart 96-107 Radio with Emma Bunton on Thursday -- performing The Spice Girls' \"Goodbye\" with Baby Spice herself!
