Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nAlex Wilbert, Peters Township \nThe past week: Wilbert, a freshman goaltender for the Indians, stopped 23 of 25 shots in a 5-2 win against Central Catholic in the PIHL Class 3A Penguins Cup final, then made 37 saves in a 2-1 victory against Holy Ghost Prep in the Pennsylvania Cup state championship game. \nCheck this out: Wilbert was a gut choice to start the playoffs by Peters Township coach Rick Tingle that paid off with a state title. After going 2-3-0 in six regular-season games, he was 4-0 with a 1.00 goals-against average and a .964 save percentage including a shutout during the playoffs. \nWhat was your first reaction when your coach said you were the guy going into the playoffs? At first I was shocked, but I knew that getting a chance to play and to play next year I had to prove myself, so I kind of put a little pressure on myself. \nHave you kind of stepped back after the state playoffs and looked at what you did? A little bit. I was shocked but I was more relieved I had done something like this. I was relieved for the seniors that struggled through all season \nWhat was the difference for you during the season and the playoffs? I just honestly ... my numbers were just as good during the season as they were in the playoffs, but I feel like I just played to the best of my ability in the playoffs because I wanted to win so bad. \nWas there one save that stood out for you in the state championship game? Probably the save I made right after they scored their goal. It was on a breakaway and I stuck the pad out and saved it. \nThere was a flurry at the end of the game. What was the first thing that went through your mind when the clock hit zeroes? It was relief and a happy emotion. Obviously, I wanted to win that game. I just thought it was going to be very tough for us to do and it was just something I could do to help us get there. \nWhat do you do when you’re not playing hockey? I like to go to the gym a lot, hang out with friends, play roller hockey and dekhockey. \nIs there any particular player you look up to? I really look up to John Gibson. He’s a Pittsburgh guy. He struggled through, not making teams he wanted to. He had some setbacks and he’s playing in the NHL today and I just look up to that. As a kid, I went to goalie camps and he was one of the goalies there. \nGoalies always have some kind of ritual. What are some of yours? Before a game, I just sit there and I just sort of focus and clear my mind of everything else going on and focus on the game in front of me. During the game, I take a little loop in the corner and skate in a circle. It keeps me from standing still and keeps me moving. — By Keith Barnes \nAva Talorico, Beaver The past week: Talorico earned a bronze medal by finishing third at the PIAA Class 2A diving championships at Bucknell University. Check this out: Talorico is only 5 feet tall, but proves big things can come in small packages. A sophomore, Talorico also won the WPIAL championship this year. Her score at the PIAA meet was 387.70, only 4.65 points off her WPIAL championship total of 392.35. She is a quick learner, starting to dive only in eighth grade. As a freshman, she was fourth at the WPIAL championships and ninth at the PIAA meet. She comes from a family with two older brothers who played football at Beaver. Was finishing third at the PIAA meet surprising at all? A little bit, considering I was seeded a lot lower than what I finished. I was seeded eighth. Was it your best series of dives this year? I would say so. All of them seemed pretty consistent. So next year you win it all, right? Umm, I definitely think I can do it. My goal is just to work hard, learn some new dives and complete them. Beaver isn’t exactly known for producing great divers. How did you get into this? No, it’s not known for divers. I did gymnastics up until eighth grade. Then I quit because I had an injury to my back. I switched to diving because it’s similar. You still get to flip and twist, but it’s a lot easier on the body. Ever dive off anything, like a cliff? No [laugh]. Just a platform. No cliffs? No, not yet at least. People might be surprised to know ...? I had my first track practice [Tuesday]. I decided to do it this year for the first time. I’m doing the pole vault. Really, why the pole vault? My teammate in diving, Andrew Cestra, said he thought I’d be pretty good at it since I did gymnastics before I tried diving. He thought I would have the strength to do it. So I decided to give it a try. Do you have any fear at all of that event? No, not yet at least [laugh]. Well, how did the first day go? Pretty good, actually. Everyone was kind of surprised. I think it’s going to be OK. What’s the hardest thing about diving that the average person might not realize? I think learning how to hurdle in your approach to actually dive. You have to be in time with the board and that’s not always the easiest. — By Mike White", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T10:17:12.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
