Microbeads go down the drain and pollute the ocean Credit: PA \nThere must also be a clear and prompt timeline for phasing out the microbead ingredients, according to the coalition made up of the Environmental Investigation Agency, Fauna & Flora International, Greenpeace UK and the Marine Conservation Society. \nA statement from the groups said: \"'Many countries around the world, from India to Korea to New Zealand, are now looking at banning microplastics in products that can end up in the sea, and they're looking to the UK to provide a model of how best to do that. \n\"By implementing a robust and comprehensive ban of microplastics in all products which can reach drainage, this government can have a truly global impact. \n'We've already seen the problematic loopholes in the US legislation, which limited the ban to \"rinse-off\" products that perform an \"exfoliating\" function and ended up allowing other types of products containing microplastics to keep pouring into our oceans. \n'With trillions of microplastics already in the sea, this really is a global issue and the British Government must seize the opportunity to create a world-leading ban.\" Last updated Wed 8 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:42:52.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
