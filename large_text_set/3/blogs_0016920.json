Flights were cheapest toward the beginning of the summer, especially in May, according to the same data. \nKayak attributed the dip in costs to the rise of transatlantic low-cost airfare carriers , as well as the strength of the dollar. \nLondon is also a relatively frugal option for travelers to Europe this summer, as ongoing uncertainty concerning the so-called Brexit continues to keep the pound weak and prices in the U.K. low. \n“The pound is going to remain low indeed because Brexit negotiations are expected to start in April,” Benjamin LeRuth , a research associate at the University of Kent, told Travel + Leisure earlier this month . “They can find it as a good opportunity to go shopping.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:09:53.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
