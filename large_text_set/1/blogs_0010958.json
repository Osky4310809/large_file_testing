Here's former Redskin @DonteStallworth on new Rams coach Sean McVay … pic.twitter.com/6BlzvLRb3d \n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) January 12, 2017 \nWashington has two wide receivers eligible for free agency in the upcoming offseason: Jackson and Pierre Garcon. \nBoth are currently on the wrong side of 30. But it’s unlikely that they would re-sign both wideouts. Related: Which free agent wide receivers should the Rams target this offseason? \nJackson averaged 17.9 yards per reception this year, which beats the 13.2 from Garcon. \nHe also currently makes $6 million per season — which is less than the $8.5 million that Washington pays Garcon. One note, w/ McVay set to be coach: #Rams will probably be looking for a WR in free agency. DeSean Jackson, an LA native, loved McVay in DC. \n— Ryan Kartje (@Ryan_Kartje) January 12, 2017 \nThe market value for Jackson is $22.8 million over three years for an average annual salary of $7.6 million ( via Spotrac ). \nThat’s comparable to the $6.7 million estimate for Kenny Britt, who is a free agent as well. \nJackson, however, is from Los Angeles and recently had over 1,000 yards while playing under McVay.

It’s higher than Kenny Britt, who received a 76.5. Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:02:47.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
