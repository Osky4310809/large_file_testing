That’s not really an impressive thing to watch. What is impressive is watching a 7-foot tall behemoth flash the handles and passing ability. \nThis year, we have an amazing field, headlined by everyone’s favorite big man Joel Embiid as well as the Knicks’ budding superstar Kristaps Porzingis, Kings’ star center DeMarcus Cousins and Pelicans big man Anthony Davis to represent the home team. In total, the split this year is four true bigs, one small forward (Gordon Hayward) and three guards (Devin Booker, John Wall and Isaiah Thomas). \nFor an event that’s long struggled to get out of the shadows of the three-point shootout and dunk contest, Embiid and the other bigs are going to bring some shine and excitement to the skills competition. If the competition ends up being as fun as we expect, it has a chance at being the most entertaining event of the night.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:42:45.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
