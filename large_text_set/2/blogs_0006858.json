Brandon Magnus/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images \nOne name that Waterson didn’t mention was No. 1 ranked strawweight contender Claudia Gadelha, who has definitely given Jedrzejczyk her toughest matchup to date in the UFC. \nAccording to Waterson, Gadelha has been making appearances at the Jackson-Winkeljohn facility in New Mexico, which is the gym she’s called home for years. \n“Claudia has actually been cross training at our gym to me she’s not competition right now,” Waterson explained. “She’s a teammate and we’re using each other to get better.” \nWaterson seems to be in a great position to take advantage of her last win over VanZant as she moves forward into 2017. \nShe just recently inked a contract with an agent at William Morris Endeavor, who also happen to be the owners of the UFC, to help her with endeavors outside of the Octagon like potential acting roles or endorsements. \nWaterson is even starting to get adjusted to life as a top ranked fighter where other competitors in the UFC are calling her name out on a regular basis. \nWhile Waterson has been a stalwart of women’s mixed martial arts for years, she’s finally getting some much deserved recognition and she’s embracing every, single opportunity. \n“I’ve never had that before, or not to this extent. Everybody’s been calling my name after I fought Paige (VanZant),” Waterson said. “First it was (Jessica) Andrade after her opponent fell through and the Rose tweeted me out and then Felice (Herrig) this last weekend calling me out so it’s kind of nice having people call my name out. \n“I guess that’s how you know that you’re making a statement and that’s what we want right? We want to bring some attention to the strawweight division and hopefully that’s what my fight did.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:54:52.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
