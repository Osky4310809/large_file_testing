Now, they fear a second one is around the corner. \nViewers of the long-running show are panicked that a parallel storyline will also descend into loss of life - with Shirley, Sylvie and Tina Carter also at risk as they travel on the London Underground. \nThe possibility was heavily implied during Monday's episode, when the three women were seen getting sentimental on a rare tube ride - unusual scenes in the soap. \nAlthough BBC bosses haven't confirmed or denied it, there's surely some risk that the devastation will extend into tonight's instalment, especially as the rogue bus crashed into the railway bridge minutes earlier. Fans fear Shirley, Tina and Sylvie could be next in the soap's cull (Photo: BBC) EastEnders' shocking bus crash has startled viewers and critics alike (Photo: BBC) \nFans took to Twitter to express their theories, stating: \"Anyone else think the train is also going to crash tomorrow?\" while another added: \"Bus crash into tube bridge with the tube train coming...\" \nA third chimed in: \"Now the bus has crashed into the bridge, odds on their being a train crash tomorrow too!?\" \nThe Mirror have contacted representatives at the BBC, but are yet to receive a response. \nIf true, the organisation could be in for further criticism after some viewers were left angry at the 'insensitivity' of the storyline so soon after the Berlin terror attack on December 12, when a truck was driven into a Christmas market, killing 12 and injuring more than 50. Currently, up to 11 Albert Square favourites could be left with their lives in the balance after the shocking scenes on Monday night's episode.
