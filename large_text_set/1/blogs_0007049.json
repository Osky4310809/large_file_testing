The Wonky Spatula! Updated / Jan. 5, 2017 09:17 This week we're chatting to Nicola Halloran of The Wonky Spatula \nEach week on RTÉ LifeStyle we meet bloggers who are entertaining, informing and getting lots of attention for being pretty good at what they do. This week we're chatting to Nicola Halloran of The Wonky Spatula . Who are you and what do you do? I’m Nicola and I run The Wonky Spatula ! My site originally started out as a simple list of what is or isn’t paleo and has grown into a mission to illustrate the tasty way to be healthy through a combination of gluten free, dairy free, paleo and vegan recipes. \nI am constantly coming up with new and exciting ways to create delicious and healthy food. Most of us are aware that we shouldn’t be eating some of the things we do, however, it can be hard to find quick and easy alternatives. The Wonky Spatula provides simple, step by step recipes to help you stay on track without making you feel like you are on a diet. My focus is on leading a healthier lifestyle, ‘diets’ aren’t sustainable in the long run so I want to show people how they can eat healthy 100% of the time. \nWhy do you do what you do? I set up my website to share my recipes and show people that eating healthy doesn’t have to be seriously time-consuming or cost the earth, you can whip up a healthy meal that tastes amazing in 15 minutes or less. \nDescribe your audience! My audience is a pretty diverse. I get visitors from all over the world, the majority of which are from the US and Ireland. \nWhat’s your media diet? I’m a serious social media junkie so soon as I wake up I go straight on to Instagram to catch up on Instagram Stories and have a quick scroll through the news feed. Then I check my emails, and head over to Facebook for a quick scroll there too! Once I’m out of the shower then I catch up on Snapchat & Twitter, my phone is like my third hand, I’m constantly on it!! \nName three people you respect. Gary Featherstone & Peter Burke , the co-founders of Crossfit353 in Bath Avenue. They are amazing coaches & incredible entrepreneurs. I started Crossfit with them 3 years ago and it has been an absolute pleasure to follow their journey, they are so warm and welcoming, and incredibly humble. Starting training with them was what kickstarted my interest in health and fitness, so I owe a lot to them and I have no doubt they will continue to excel! Annalise Murphy , Ireland’s 2016 Olympic Silver medalist, is another person that I respect an look up to, as a keen sailor myself following her journey has been incredible. Finally, Donal Skehan who I see as Ireland’s original food blogger! \nWhat excites you right now and why? Its how the health food scene in Ireland is growing at such a rapid pace. Both in terms of new restaurants and cafés and the availability of key ingredients. When I started out, getting simple things like almond butter was difficult whereas now you can get it practically everywhere and there are even Irish companies producing it. I’m a huge believer in buying Irish so the growth of so many fabulous Irish food brands over the last number of years is amazing to see. \nProudest post? Finest moment to date? Most embarrassing moment to date? I’ve been so lucky to have had so many amazing opportunities over the last two years, between meeting some of my cooking idols, appearing on TV and being featured by so many fantastic websites, but I have to say that the most stand out moment was when my Instagram account began to grow. It’s literally happened over night! I couldn’t stop refreshing the page and genuinely didn’t sleep a wink. \nWhat social channels are your fav and why? Instagram is without a shadow of a doubt my favourite platform, without it I would never have even thought of starting a blog as the idea came from sharing countless images of what I was eating! \nTell us a secret - something we should know about you? I don’t really have many secrets but something you should know about me is that Brussel Sprouts are one of my all time favourite foods! I get a lot of stick over it but it doesn’t stop me eating them! \nWhat’s the master plan/dream? For the moment the master plan is to keep doing what I’m doing, I’m working on one or two pretty exciting projects at the moment which I can’t wait to share once everything is finalised!
