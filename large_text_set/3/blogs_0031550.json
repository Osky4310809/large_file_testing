Detroit will remain obligated for the $8MM owed to him for the coming season. \nPelfrey, 33, has struggled since inking a two-year pact with the team last winter. In 2016, he worked to an unsightly 5.07 ERA with just 4.2 K/9 against 3.5 BB/9 over 119 frames. And he was torched for 15 earned runs on 24 hits in his 17 innings this spring. \nThe Tigers were said to be looking for a taker for the righty, even offering to pick up some or all of his remaining salary, but it seems no other organization was interested in adding Pelfrey to its 40-man roster. Still, he seems an easy bet to land a minor-league deal from a club looking to bolster its depth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:49:51.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
