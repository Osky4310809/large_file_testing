Her talent lies in the nuance of her profession, her patience with recipients, diligence to see the job through, but also in preparing me for what lies ahead. 2 \nAngie and I touched down in Tulsa on October 6, 2016. “OK, John,” Angie asked me, “Have you ever been to a special needs day care?” \n“No, I haven’t.” \n“This one is special. The last of its kind for 200 miles in any direction. It’s being smothered now; more kids and less funding every year. These are the forgotten children. It’s going to make you mad, how the government has swept these kids under the rug, stay focused. Don’t get angry.” \nAs a philanthropist, it’s my job is to represent theCHIVE communities’ interest. Our mission is to champion the orphaned causes of the world. In more ways than one, I had arrived at an orphanage. \nThe Tulsa Special Kids Day Care. 3 \nThe most noble teachers you’ll find are the ones who love under tremendous hardship. I met Miss Jo and Laura when I walked in. They were kind people, real teachers. They introduced me to children of all ages and abilities, ranging from learning disabilities to autism and cerebral palsy. All are welcome here, nobody is turned away; even if their parents couldn’t afford it, they would never be billed for the balance. 4 \nWe had come because we heard the day care’s playground was in poor condition. It was really in no condition at all, an expanse of land that appeared to have been a place where kids once played. When you’re tight on cash, it’s always the toys that get cut first in favor of baby formula, lunch food, and other necessities. 5 \nBut there was a swing set, the loneliest swing set in America. It had one working swing and a lonely space to the right where a kid might swing. Instead, it served as a parking space for Jeremiah, a 9-year-old firecracker with cerebral palsy. Advertisement Advertisement 6 \nHis mother Tinesha told me Jeremiah’s favorite thing to do was watch the other kids on the swing. “He cheers them on as they soar higher and higher.” Tinesha told me there’s a real wheelchair swing in Oklahoma City, and she drove Jeremiah the 108 miles once to use it. “It was the happiest I’d ever seen Jeremiah. He was so overjoyed we had to stop swinging for a minute so he could catch his breath. But there’s more important needs here, and those wheelchair swings are so expensive. So Jeremiah finds his happiness watching the other children swing. Go ahead, John. Get on the swing and watch how happy he gets.” \nAs I went higher and higher, Jeremiah threw his hands in the air and cheered. The look of pure joy on his face, this child with cerebral palsy and scoliosis so bad it had literally crippled him, made me want to fight as hard as I could to get that wheelchair swing. How would we pull it off? 7 \nThe Oklahoma Chivers and I had a pow wow around a bouncy see saw and discussed what needed to be done. Even if we raised the money, it would take a tremendous amount of manpower to get these deserving kids what they needed. We talked logistics, it was overwhelming. Adults do that, we complicate things. Then Sebastian stood at the center of the see saw and I asked half-jokingly, “Sebastian, whaddya’ think we should do?” \nHe thought about it for a second, “Well, I already have a swing, so I don’t need anything. Jeremiah doesn’t have a swing. Get Jeremiah his swing, then you’ll get the rest of your stuff.” \nIt’s amazing how a child’s logic can be so simple, so selfless, and also, correct. “Yes, I think that’s just what we should do.” 8 \nThe next week, theCHIVE launched a flash campaign to get Jeremiah his swing. It would raise $135,000 in 24 hours. And all those people we would need to help build it? Wouldn’t you believe it, they showed up to help build all the rest of the stuff, just as Sebastian had promised. 9 \nChivers flooded in from all parts of Oklahoma, from across the country in fact. 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:25:31.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
