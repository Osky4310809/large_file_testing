The journal publishes all research study types, from protocols through phase I trials to meta-analyses, including small, specialist studies, and negative studies. Publishing procedures are built around fully open peer review and continuous publication, publishing research online as soon as the article is ready. BMJ Open aims to promote transparency in the publication process by publishing reviewer reports and previous versions of manuscripts as pre-publication histories. Authors are asked to pay article-publishing charges on acceptance; the ability to pay does not influence editorial decisions. All papers are included in MEDLINE/PubMed and Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science). \nThis home page is under development \nIMPACT FACTOR 2.562 Latest Content \nHealth services research: Exploring similarities and differences in hospital adverse event rates between Norway and Sweden using Global Trigger Tool (20 March, 2017) \nIntensive care: Investigating skin-to-skin care patterns with extremely preterm infants in the NICU and their effect on early cognitive and communication performance: a retrospective cohort study (20 March, 2017) \nDiabetes and endocrinology: Effectiveness of chronic care models for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Europe: a systematic review and meta-analysis (20 March, 2017) \nHealth services research: ‘right@home’: a randomised controlled trial of sustained nurse home visiting from pregnancy to child age 2 years, versus usual care, to improve parent care, parent responsivity and the home learning environment at 2 years (20 March, 2017) \nHealth services research:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:31:15.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
