NBC News reports that counties around the country have raised objections about the “raids” conducted by ICE agents in or around courthouses, including this ask from Multnomah County in Oregon, urging the public to report ICE raids at courthouses.

On Wednesday, criminal defense lawyer Octavio Chaidez’s client was arrested inside a courthouse in Pasadena, where he had just finished a criminal court appearance. ICE agents “swooped in,” confirmed his client’s name and then placed him under arrest. \nSpeaking to NBC, Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the Western reigonal office of ICE said “While ICE does arrest targets at courthouses, generally it’s only after investigating officers have exhausted other options.” \nCantil-Sakuyae’s letter reinforced the fact that courthouses exist “to ensure fairness and protect legal rights.” Creating an atmosphere of fear in and around the courts makes matters worse. “Enforcement policies that include stalking courthouses and arresting undocumented immigrants, the vast majority of whom pose no risk to public safety, are neither safe nor fair,” she wrote. “They not only compromise our core value of fairness but they undermine the judiciary’s ability to provide equal access to justice.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T04:47:48.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
