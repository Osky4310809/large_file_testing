Rod Blagojevich’s hopes for clemency from President Barack Obama now hinge on the next four days. \nCBS 2’s Dana Kozlov takes a look at the chances his 14-year sentence will be cut short. \nBlagojevich walked into prison life in March 2012. \nLast August, the ex-governor listened from afar as federal Judge James Zagel refused to reduce his sentence, even after an appellate court tossed some of his convictions. While attorneys appeal — again — Blagojevich’s family hopes Obama will let him out early. \nChicago political analyst Dick Simpson says that’s not likely, given what Blagojevich was convicted of. \nAnother reason is this: \n“You’re not supposed to get a commutation if you have a simultaneous appeal pending on the same issue in the local court, which Blagojevich does,” CBS 2 Legal Analyst Irv Miller says. \nObama recently declined to comment on the Blagojevich case, but said he has “very aggressively” used his commutation powers to offset “over-sentencing.” \nIf Obama takes no action on the Blagojevich request, there’s always incoming President Donald Trump, who got to know Blagojevich when he appeared on Trump’s “Celebrity Apprentice.” \nBack to Obama: Simpson says granting Blagojevich a full pardon would tarnish his presidency, but suggests a commutation would go comparatively unnoticed. \nIf his sentence was cut to time served, Blagojevich would be out the next day. \nThe only comment from the ex-governor’s wife, Patti, was “He didn’t say no.” That was on her Facebook page. \nDana Kozlov facebook Follow Dana Kozlov is a general assignment reporter for CBS 2 Chicago.
