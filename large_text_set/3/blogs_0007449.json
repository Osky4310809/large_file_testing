It was visible and I was embarrassed about what I'd done. So I made up a story and told a friend that a stranger had done it while I was walking. I was encouraged to report it to the police. I made the mistake of doing that.\"\nEnter Ann Arbor police Detective Robin Lee and Special Agent Sean Nicol of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who questioned Bass at the Ann Arbor Police Department on November 17.\nBass told them that she was targeted for wearing a \"solidarity pin\" (a show of opposition to President Trump and a signal to other liberals that she is a \"safe space\"). The idea was started by the losing side of Great Britain's \"Brexit\" vote and adopted by American snowflakes after Trump's election victory.\nShe said her safety pin \"was to show, yeah, solidarity with the people like we show your fear and we want to help you get through it.\"\nBass also claimed that the attack was part of the alleged surge in hate crimes following the election of Donald Trump a week earlier.\n\"I've heard of other people experiencing incidents recently, but not to me,\" she told police investigators.\nAccording to the police report, Bass cited the case of a hijab-wearing Muslim woman who said a man threatened to light her on fire if she didn't take it off. That one -- shocker -- also turned out to be a hoax, although the woman who reported that fake crime was not prosecuted.\nBass described the suspect as an approximately 45-year-old white male, with stubble on his face, wearing a black baseball hat pulled low over his face, a gray hoodie with the hood down and sweat pants.\nShe has now admitted to making up the suspect.\nBass posted about the attack on Facebook the same day she reported the attack to the police, according to the report.\nBass later told detectives she wrote the post to convey \"that all people are equal and deserve to have their voice heard and not feel endangered.\"\nDetective pointed out her post had a dozen shares and more than 100 likes.\n\"It blew up a little bit more than I meant to,\" she said about the post.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/07/hate-crime-hoax-michigan-snowflake-scratched-own-face-with-safe-space-safety-pin/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2017/03/ann_arbor_woman_pleads_guilty_1.html"], "published": "2017-03-08T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:25:44.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
