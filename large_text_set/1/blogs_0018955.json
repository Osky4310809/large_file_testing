Nusrat Sahar had mocked the language skills of Pitafi, insisting that the PPP MPA read an answer out – which was written in English. \nWhile responding to PML-F MPA, Pitafi had asked her to come to his chamber to listen to the answer. Nusrat Sahar was offended by the use of the phrase ‘come to my chamber’ as it has negative connotations attached to it. \n'Deputy speaker should have taken action' \nOpposition leader in Sindh Assembly, Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s (MQM) Khawaja Izhar called out the deputy speaker over the incident, saying she should have taken action when the argument broke out between Nusrat Sahar and Pitafi. \n“Sometimes even the deputy speaker enjoys the assembly session,” he told the media at the assembly on Monday. \nIzhar added that he hoped Nusrat Sahar would forgive Pitafi. 0 0 Nusrat Sahar threatens self-immolation if Pitafi not fired in next two days was posted in pakistan of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on January 23, 2017 and was last updated on January 23, 2017.
