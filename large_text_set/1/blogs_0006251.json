Recently, Mira made her TV debut with hubby Shahid on Koffee With Karan and since then, people went on accusing Mira of not being ambitious enough and called Shahid an advocate of arranged marriage. In an interview with a leading daily, Shahid has finally given it back to all the haters. He said, \"A mainstream star having an arranged marriage is unique. It is not every day that a Hindi film hero goes and marries someone no one even knows of. I am an actor. Most parts of my life are up for discussion, by default. It won't stop whether I like it or not. If people cross the line, we do get displeased. But the line itself is wide. We can't be touchy and say, bhai mere baare mein koi baat nahi karega.\" \"Mira seems pretty chilled out about what's written. My wife decides what she wants to do, where she wants to go, how she wants to go and who is allowed in the house. It is natural. In fact, that's how it should be,\" he added. Isn't Shahid just a perfect husband? What do you think about it?
