Payet celebrates with striker Bafetimbi Gomis (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nNew OM owner Frank McCourt is preparing more big spending in the summer, and Garcia - hired in October - is the man he wants to lead the club into a bright new future, dubbed 'the Champions Project'. \nThe ex-Lille boss has a reputation for fast, free-flowing football, and after a slow start on France's south coast, is beginning to put together a side hoping to challenge at the top of Ligue 1 next summer. \nA Champions League place looks out of the question this term, with them 16 points off the top three with just 14 matches remaining. \nBut optimism is growing that the 1993 European Cup winners will be among the contenders in 2016-17. Payet has been signed to lead Marseille back into the Champions League spots (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nAt the heart of that will be Payet and 22-year-old midfielder Morgan Sanson, also signed last month, and the pair were instrumental in a deserved victory. \nSanson played his part in the opener, his clever flicked header playing through ex-Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who fired home after 26 minutes.
