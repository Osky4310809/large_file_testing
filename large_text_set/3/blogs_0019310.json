That's my focus. \n\"I can play in different positions, I do not see as a problem. But I still see myself as a striker.\" \nAhead of Euro 2016, Origi was vying with Romelu Lukaku for a starting spot with Belgium, but the Everton striker is now comfortably winning the battle.

I play at a top club in Liverpool,\" he added. \n'Romelu is indeed doing well, because he works very hard and is focused on the right things. \n\"I want the same progression as Romelu and I'm working for it.\" poll loading Does Divock Origi deserve more opportunities at Liverpool? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:43:59.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
