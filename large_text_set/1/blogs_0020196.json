Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) who was Maryland political director for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, was nominated Tuesday night to succeed former state delegate Michael L. Vaughn in the General Assembly.\nLewis was chosen by the Prince George’s County Democratic Central Committee after a packed, hours-long meeting at which nine candidates were grilled on everything from ethics to revitalizing inner-Beltway communities to whether they’d support legislation to repeal a 2013 state law giving County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) broad powers to oversee the local public school system.\nEighteen committee members voted for Lewis to represent the 24th legislative district; the remaining 11 votes went to Maurice Simpson, president of the Prince George’s County Young Democrats , who has raised eyebrows among establishment Democrats by supporting candidates who have not been endorsed by party leaders . Three central committee members were not present for the vote.\nCommittee members questioned Simpson about his support for U.S. Rep. Donna F. Edwards in the 2016 U.S. Senate Democratic primary race. Edwards lost the contest to now-Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who received broad support from leading Democrats in Prince George’s and statewide.\nSimpson said that he took a “political hit” for backing Edwards but that he thought she was the right person for the state.\nSen. Joanne Benson (D-Prince George’s), the top elected official in the 24th District, testified in favor of Lewis but also took a moment to praise Vaughn, whose departure from the legislature was unexpected. She called Vaughn a “tremendous asset” to the community and said he will be “sorely missed” for his work with children and the district’s “homeless and hopeless.”\nVaughn’s letter of resignation was delivered to the office of House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) on Jan. 11, less than an hour before the start of the 2017 legislative session. It came days after federal authorities announced a long-running corruption investigation based in Prince George’s County that they said had implicated at least one sitting lawmaker.\nThe lawmaker’s name has not been released. But descriptions in court filings appear to match Vaughn’s legislative record, fueling speculation in Annapolis that he may be involved . Vaughn, in office since 2003, has not responded to repeated requests for comment. His resignation letter said he was stepping down for unspecified health reasons.\nThe Central Committee will send a letter nominating Lewis to Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who has 15 days to consider appointing him.\nVaughn’s seat is one of several recent vacancies in the General Assembly. On Tuesday, Hogan appointed Jheanelle Wilkins (D) to the House seat left empty when then-Del. Will Smith (D-Montgomery) was tapped to succeed newly elected U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D) in the state Senate.\nThere is a Senate seat formerly held by Lisa Gladden (D-Baltimore), who resigned after a long illness; and two delegate seats, one vacated by former delegate Jill Carter (D-Baltimore) and another by Barbara Robinson (D-Baltimore), who filled the Senate seat vacated by Catherine Pugh when Pugh became mayor of Baltimore.\nWith so many open seats, the General Assembly has delayed taking up overrides of Hogan’s 2015 vetoes. On Tuesday, the House of Delegates postponed action until next week on two bills; one would expand the use of wind and solar power and another would create oversight for the Maryland Transit Administration.\nThe Senate is scheduled to consider overrides Thursday.\nOvetta Wiggins contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@arelisrhdz"], "published": "2017-01-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:47:16.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
