The article was titled: “9 Reasons Constitutional Originalism is Bullsh*t.” 9 Reasons Constitutional Originalism Is Bullsh*t https://t.co/c9glcAtp8g pic.twitter.com/mDoDxjuOQh \n— Cosmopolitan (@Cosmopolitan) March 21, 2017 \nThe article said that judges who interpret the Constitution in an originalist fashion — in other words, in a manner that considers what the authors of the Constitution meant at the time they wrote it to be authoritative — are radical, racist and just completely wrong because “not even the founders were originalists.” \n“Instead, [originalism is just a] rational-sounding cover for a more insidious set of right-wing beliefs, a way to allow rampant discrimination against actual people while protecting the interests of corporate ‘persons’ and promoting the extreme ideologies of lobby groups,” the article said. \nMeanwhile, the article almost completely undermines itself at the end when it declares: “Of course the Constitution should be interpreted as it’s written.” \nNeedless to say, Twitter had a field day with the article.
