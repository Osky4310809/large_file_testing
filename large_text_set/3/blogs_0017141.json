Shortly after Lee Guk Joo made the post, it was deleted. After seeing news about the post, actor On Si Woo had some words for Lee Guk Joo. He said, “So you feel bad being made fun of in the comments? I wonder how the male celebrities that you sexually harassed during public events feel? When they had to just bitterly smile because they were in a position where they couldn’t be mad. You should’ve been sued ten times over already. Know when you should be embarrassed.” Lee Guk Joo has been on the receiving end of criticism for some time for taking liberties with physical contact for the purpose of comedy.
