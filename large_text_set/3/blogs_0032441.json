I saw something move in the corner of my eye and actually thought it was bark coming off the tree — yesterday in Victoria it was quite windy — I then looked up to see where the bark had gone,\" she told ABC News .\nIt soon dawned on Dickinson that the \"bark\" was actually a snake. While it had moved away from her daughter, it was still close enough to be a threat.\n\"All my instincts wanted to run and pick her up and scream and run away,\" she told the news outlet. \"I stayed still and luckily so did she and it just slithered off.\"\nIt's not known if the snake was an eastern brown or a king brown . Both are highly venomous, but the king brown is generally not found in Victoria.\nA pretty close call, regardless.\nWATCH: The darkest substance on Earth basically looks like a portal to another world", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/dxBnITIg.m3u8", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1275140935895276&set=o.22265760886&type=3&theater", "https://museumvictoria.com.au/discoverycentre/infosheets/snakes-found-in-victoria/common-or-eastern-brown-snake/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DPWqLBIizrhfDtfTPYK8P42aBtc=/http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fthumbs%2FdxBnITIg.jpg", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-31/brown-snake-photobombs-mums-snap-of-toddler/8402820", "https://australianmuseum.net.au/mulga-snake"], "published": "2017-03-31T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:57:18.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
