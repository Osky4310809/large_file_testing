Women have often been denied their due, be it in choosing their career over running their house, or making a decision that's good for them and sticking by it. But the world is fast-changing and in today's day and age we got to celebrate equality and equal rights by being #UnitedByHalf. \nUnited Colors of Benetton's latest campaign talks about just that. It urges women to claim their rights, reinstating the fact that women are equal halves to their male counterparts. \nHave a look: \nToday, we celebrate the success stories of some of the most influential power couples in India who have proven that by being #UnitedByHalf, you can literally achieve all your dreams. These power couples have made it big by supporting each other through the thick and thin, breaking stereotypes, and proving no woman is lesser in the half of a relationship. \nWe salute these couples who are true examples of #UnitedByHalf and Benetton for bringing forth that equal rights starts right from home. 1. Mukesh & Nita Ambani \nWhen Mukesh Ambani proposed to Nita, she had just one condition before agreeing. And that was she be allowed to work post marriage. Her ambitions were respected and now she's running the prestigious Dhirubhai Ambani International School, heading the Mumbai IPL Franchise and is a part of the Global Health Board. And of course, Mr. Ambani is taking Reliance to newer heights everyday. We salute the love and understanding that India's wealthiest couple share! A true example of #UnitedByHalf. 2. Narayan & Sudha Murthy \nThey'd backed each others' dreams and that's how the mighty empire of Infosys was built. Sudha Murthy is the chairperson of the company and also runs many orphanages. She takes lectures in colleges and also writes books while Narayan Murthy runs his brain-child company Infosys Limited. A perfect couple nothing short of #UnitedByHalf. 3. Akshay & Twinkle Khanna \nBoth of them have flourished in their respective fields. Akshay Kumar is a sought-after name in Bollywood, while yesteryear actress Twinkle Khanna found her calling as a writer much later in life. And we're happy she did. The couple follows a very simple lifestyle, which requires them to turn in as early as 9 pm and wake up at 4 am. We love how Twinkle adopted to Akshay's routine and it's a marvel to see Akshay support Twinkle's writing career as well as her profession as an interior designer. When two-makes-one really comes to life with this showbiz couple. 4. Mahesh & Lara Bhupati \nMiss Universe Lara Dutta has been ever-supportive of her husband's career, not just as a tennis sports star, but also as an entrepreneur. Apart from their own careers, they've undertaken a joint venture in the form of a production house called Beegi Basanti Productions with its maiden venture being Chalo Dilli . A true-blue gentleman and a genuine beauty, the story of Lara and Mahesh is all about supporting each other, making each other better. 5. Saif & Kareena Kapoor Khan \nWith baby Taimur being a part of the family now, the couple has been juggling work and family beautifully. A radiant mom, Kareena was quoted saying, \"Saif is home a lot to take care of the baby when I'm away.\" The mother of this new-born literally went back to work within days of giving birth, not without the support of her partner. A royal couple to the core, this is one couple who've left their egos in history (thankfully so!). Whether it's Saif supporting his wife in every step, or Kareena being the rock-solid partner behind this royalty. We love how Bollywood's power couple live life #UnitedByHalf.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:26:00.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
