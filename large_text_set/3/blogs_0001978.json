Arrested Peace Corps members \n“However, it has been observed that NMSA, Peace Corps, Maritime Security Agency and National Task Force are still operating outside their mandates and purposes for which they were registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC.” \nWhile noting that the Peace Corps, under the leadership of Akor Dickson, was registered as an NGO, Jimoh Moshood said the body, with brazen impunity and total disregard to the laws of the country, opened illegal training camps in some states, where thousands of youths and other persons without proper background checks and screening are receiving converts Military training.

The amounts range from N50,000 to hundreds of thousands.” \nHe urged anyone who must have paid money under any pretence to the Peace Corps to report to the nearest police station across the country. \n“The Corps has no legal authority to wear uniform, parade itself as a security outfit, post their personnel on guard duties, use ranking, insignia, badges of rank, which are semblance of that of the Police, Military and other paramilitary organisations without the approval of the Federal Government,” he declared. \nWhile adding that the arrested officials will be arraigned in court on completion of investigation, Moshood advised parents and guardians to prevail on their children and wards to return home from the illegal military camps opened in some states of the country by the Peace Corps, as the activities of the Corps are unlawful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T11:01:28.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
