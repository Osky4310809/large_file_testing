She is one cool woman. Kareena did a Facebook live with celebrity dietician Rujuta Diwekar, where she revealed that she plans to eat clean and workout religiously to lose that post-pregnancy weight. \nWhat’s interesting is that she spoke about how Taimur has changed her routine and is forcing her to get fit again because he loves being carried around. \nI walk a lot. My son cries if I sit with him in my arms. It is his way of telling me to walk a lot. He is keeping me on the toes already. I am happy he loves walking already. \nHaha. Looks like this kid is going to be quite the fitness freak himself when he grows up if he already loves walking! 11", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:51:08.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
