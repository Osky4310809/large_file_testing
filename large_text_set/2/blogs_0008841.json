I say you’re cute, then compliment your skills. \n“Say they’re cute. Compliment their efforts (i.e., making paper airplanes). Sit close to them. Body language like mirroring theirs. Touching their shoulder or hand.” — frosttenchi 31. I’ll sit next to you so our legs touch under the table. \n“The main thing I do is, when sitting in a group, I’ll sit next to him and get just a little closer than I normally would, so our legs/thighs touch under the table. Nobody else notices, only him.” 32. I giggle and say you’re funny. \n“ Giggle You’re so funny! Works every time.” 33. I lie on the couch with my pants off, spread eagle. \n“I lie on the couch with my pants off, spread eagle.” 34. I touch your arm and tell you that you’re funny. \n“I touch his arm and tell him, ‘You’re so funny!’” 35. I will stare at you until you feel uncomfortable. \n“I will make eye contact and stare at you until you feel uncomfortable.” — nadiakitten 36. I allow my tit to graze or rest upon your arm. \n“While standing next to them, stand close enough to allow your tit to graze or rest upon their arm. Never fails.” — Shipwreck_Medusa 37. I tease you more than I would other guys. \n“I tease him more than I would other guys. Is that a good thing or is it annoying? Honestly no idea…” — crunchyturtles 38. My vocal register goes up to sound more girly. \n“If I like a guy, I’ve noticed several changes in my behavior. My vocal register goes up. Just a bit. I guess it’s to sound more girly. Also, despite being a fairly touchy person to start with, I touch him a lot more if I like him. If we’re sitting next to each other and he makes a joke, I lean into him laughing. I tease a little more, partially to make more opportunities to touch him. \nBasically, I kick everything up a notch. He gets just a little more of me than anyone else in the room.” — rozsrredd 39. I will cook for you, bake for you, anything to make you feel taken care of. \n“Any increased show of nurturing, cook for you, bake for you, any little thing to make you feel taken care of, we listen when you’re upset, ask about your family or ask about the things that mean the most to you in life so you know that you are heard and your priorities are valid. We ask for your opinion or for your help, so you know you’re needed and useful and important. Above all else we laugh with you and we make you laugh, because that’s the best. This is all the stuff girls like me do. Other girls might punch you in the arm, others might make super overtly sexual comments and crass jokes, it’s all dependent on what kinda girl is the one interested in you.” 40. I openly flirt and tease you. \n“I openly flirt and tease you. \nIf I’m interested, I will purposely dress in cute form-fitting clothes, and find reasons to walk by you or quickly chat and make jokes. Use your name in a playful tone whenever I refer to your actions in conversation. Have real conversations with actual content not just playfully slapping your arms. Compliment your physical appearance so that you think about me finding you attractive. But once I can get you to laugh or start an inside joke, hook, line, and sinker. \nNow it’s just getting you by yourself. It’s more interesting when there’s other interested females, cause then you have to make a choice. Offer you a ride home or something, you accept because I know you’re interested and curious, slowly integrate physical contact in accordance with your body language while we talk. It kind of goes on from there. \nPlus I could feel your eyes burning holes through my clothes the whole time. I liked it. ;)” — cshslypc 41. I will laugh WAY too much when I’m around you. \n“Laughing WAY too much and smiling when I’m around you. Like even if I’m bored or not in the best mood, I will still smile around you because of the nervousness. Also, insults. Not anything super hurtful, but little jokes that will force you to lightly insult me back. Teasing, I guess.” — fu_kery 42. I send lots of hearts and kiss emojis. \n“I’m kinda obvious with it, I send lots of hearts and kiss emojis when I’m saying thank you for something, and I’m touchy as hell. I’ll grab your arms or face mainly, and of course I’ll try to hang out with you every chance I get.” — miss-class 43. I mock you and am meaner than usual. \n“Mocking them, being funnier/meaner than usual, general aloofness but also laughing too hard at their jokes and maintaining eye contact. Depends on the vibes. We are a fickle bunch. But it’ll be pretty clear if we like you tbh, and clearer if we don’t like you. \nThrow out a hook, if you get a bite:yay…if not:meh/ \nIf I wanna just sleep with someone I’ll pretty much just ask outright, though. We like to bone too.” — Jimjamjelly 44. At a party, I make you feel like you’re the only person in the room. \n“At a party or social gathering, I make them feel like they’re the only person in the room.” — emrocu 45. I tease, joke, and cook food for you. \n“I tease. I crack a lot of innuendo jokes. I also cook food and offer it to them. It’s easy to insinuate when you’re talking about food or gaming without putting yourself on the line for rejection.” — Thousandneedles 46. I purposely brush shoulders with you. \n“I’m usually over-touchy. Like I laugh and grab your shoulder. Or I sit close to you or purposely brush shoulders with you.” 47. I say that I want to see a movie, but all my friends are busy.. \n“I really want to watch [movie name], but all my friends are all busy lately. — jeanypoo 48. I avoid eye contact, laugh uncontrollably, and insult myself. \n“I won’t be able to make eye contact. When I’m attracted to someone I have a hard time looking them in the eyes. I’ll laugh uncontrollably like an idiot a lot. I’ll insult myself openly. On the flipside, if I really dislike you I won’t look at you either.” — BiteYourOwnTongue Read This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:24:17.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
