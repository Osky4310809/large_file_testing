They’re, like, one of our all time fav couples in Hollywood (and let’s be real, in general ) so we’re incr dibly excited to see them play off of one another on the big screen.\nThe film is called A Quiet Place , and it’s going to be John Krasinski’s third directorial foray, and he’s also going to write it, which is pretty cool. No huge surprise that he wanted his wife to star opposite him, but obviously Emily Blunt is phenomenally talented and deserves ALL THE ROLES.\nWe don’t know what A Quiet Place is about yet, but since it seems to follow the desire John Krasinski expressed to producers to do something in the vein of The Purge and Ouija , we think it’s gonna be spooky. Got to admit, we were hoping for some kind of real-life-to-screen rom-com because John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are SO charming together, but we super respect their desire to continue to push themselves in new directions creatively.\nA Quiet Place will be produced by Michael Bay and his partners, so we’re def expecting big things from this all around powerhouse team. \nBut to be perfectly honest, we’re happy with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt doing literally anything together, so we’re pretty sure we’re going to love it no matter what.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:37:38.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
