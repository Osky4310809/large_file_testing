'Live the dream' \nLast week Mr Coe wrote on Facebook that he loved fighting every month. \nHe wrote: \"Almost three years living in Thailand and with each year, I always learn more and more. \n\"Thank you to my team, family, friends and fans for always helping me on my journey. \n\"I recommend anyone to go with their gut feeling and follow their dream. No matter what it may be.\" \nMr Floan, a coach at the Glasgow Thai Boxing Academy, told BBC Scotland that Mr Coe began fighting at a gym in Grangemouth. \nHe later trained in Glasgow before he moved to Thailand after finishing school to \"live the dream\". 'Promising career' \nMr Coe lived in Ubon Ratchathani, in the east of Thailand, according to his Facebook profile. \nHe has fought in Australia, Japan and Cambodia, as well as in Thailand and Britain, said Mr Floan. \nHe won 11 out of the 12 fights last year, he added. \n\"As a person he was very cheeky,\" he said. \"He was an entertainer, everybody knows that he was famous for dancing out of the ring and dancing in the ring.\" \nMr Floan went on: \"As a fighter, he was tough as nails. He would fight anyone - he didn't care. \n\"He had a very, very promising career.\" \nThe coach has now set up an appeal to raise money for Mr Coe's family to help pay to repatriate his body and funeral expenses. \nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"We are providing assistance to the family of a British national following their death in Thailand. \n\"Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T17:03:43.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
