I think this suggest that Alexei Navalny's anti-corruption message is really reasonating at the moment in Russia, in a way that a more generalised anti-government messages don't. \n\"When people feel like the politicians above them are cheating them, that it seems is when Russians get angry, and stand up and do something.\" At least 30 opposition demonstrators were reportedly detained in Vladivostok on Sunday [Reuters] \nRussian authorities had warned Navalny's supporters on Friday not to attend the rally because the event had not been sanctioned by the city administration. OPINION: Russia's soft warfare \nThe Russian constitution allows public gatherings but recent laws have criminalised protests unauthorised by city authorities, who frequently refuse to grant permission for rallies by Kremlin critics. \nIn the far eastern city of Vladivostok, a Reuters news agency reporter saw the detention of at least 30 protesters at an unsanctioned rally drawing hundreds of young people to a square near the city's railway station. \nThe detentions started after protesters unfurled banners reading \"Corruption steals our future\" and \"The prime minister should answer\". \nThe protesters then marched to a local police station to demand that police free those who had been detained. Police officers detain an opposition supporter during a rally in the city of Vladivostok on Sunday [Reuters] \nHundreds also rallied in the city of Yekaterinburg in the industrial Urals region. \nWitnesses said at least four people holding banners were detained on the city's Labour Square, where opposition protesters, nationalists and supporters of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party gathered. \nPolice said 500 to 700 people had gathered on Labour Square but did not confirm that there had been any detentions. \n\"Corruption affects every person. The fight against corruption can unite all people irrespective of their convictions,\" 20-year-old student Ivan told Reuters, asking that his last name not be published. \nProtesters held unsanctioned rallies in Moscow and St. Petersburg in the afternoon. \nSome demonstrators have protested with their faces painted green, a reference to a recent attack on Navalny when an assailant threw a green anti-septic liquid onto his face. OPINION: Under surveillance in Russia \nIn February, a Russian court found Navalny guilty in a retrial of a 2013 fraud case, which barred him from running for president next year. \nJudge Alexei Vtyurin handed down a five-year suspended prison sentence and a fine of about $8,500 to Navalny for embezzling timber worth about $500,000. \nNavalny, 40, pledged to appeal against the \"politically motivated\" ruling and continue with his plans of challenging President Vladimir Putin in the forthcoming presidential elections, even though the Russian law bars anyone convicted of a crime from running for a public office for 10 years.
