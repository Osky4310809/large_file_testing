He threatens other cops in the station. He's a complete and total jerk.\nAs we previously reported, Parry was a belligerent mess when cops initially confronted him -- slurring to cops, \"Who did I have auto theft with?\"\nHe also calls a female officer a \"bitch\" ... spews homphobic slurs ... and calls one officer a \"fat f**k.\"\nDespite the videos, Parry pled not guilty to felony robbery , felony unlawful use of transportation and misdemeanor threats.\nHe's due back in court next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T17:44:56.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
