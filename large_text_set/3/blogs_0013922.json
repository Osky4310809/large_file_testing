The offensive conceit ― that he and his college buddies would be revolted by Asian wings ― was clearly written into the show before it was even filmed. \nHere are some great responses from Twitter.   @dumplingskin @Eater @FoodNetwork @thepioneerwoman not anywhere even close to racist… Simple bit of fun not at all anti-asian   \n— Josh Bunch (@TheMrBunch) March 8, 2017  3'); }); @Eater Could it be because they are anything but buffalo? And why does a food site have to have an SJW agenda? I cannot escape this crap. \n— Tim Kuiper (@timpac) March 8, 2017 @timpac @Eater Racist? No. It was buffalo wing swap-out joke. Buffalo wings were expected, swap could've been any other dish. \n— Faith is 24 x 7 (@FaithIs24x7) March 9, 2017 @Eater People love to be offended… \n— Shinzo Abe Froman (@RockRollGhost) March 8, 2017 \nExactly. \nThis is why we can’t have nice things. \nYou have to have a lot of free time on your hands to complain about something this ridiculous. \nAlso, it’s a slap in the face to victims of actual racism.  4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:38:24.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
