DeMille Lifetime Achievement award at the Golden Globes, and used the opportunity to not only say what a piece of garbage Donald Trump is, but to express her support of the free press. Her support has inspired the support of many. \nThe Associated Press reports that by mid-afternoon on Monday, the Committee to Protect Journalists had received 700 donations online, and $60,000 in total. CPJ’s communications associate Mehdi Rahmati told the AP that this is an unprecedented amount, as the organization generally receives only a “handful of donations” over most nights.

Trump actually used to be a big fan, and probably had his feelings hurt. In 2015, The Hollywood Reporter asked him who his favorite actresses were. Guess who made the list? \nJulia Roberts is terrific, and many others. Meryl Streepis excellent; she’s a fine person, too. The problem is I’ll name three or four or five and then the hundred that I know will be insulted, and I don’t mean to insult them. \nSomehow, this shout out did not influence Streep’s political leanings.
