Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said \"we ought not treat a traitor like a martyr.\"\n\"When I was leading soldiers in Afghanistan, Private Manning was undermining us by leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks,\" Cotton said. \"I don't understand why the president would feel special compassion for someone who endangered the lives of our troops, diplomats, intelligence officers, and allies.\"\nSen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) told CNN that Obama's action was surprising and sent a dangerous message of clemency to those who would endanger national security.\n\"I'd like to hear why it is that he took this step,\" Menendez said. \"There are very serious consequences when you release the kind of documents she did... at the end of the day, there was enormous damage done.\"\n\"You cannot ultimately put the United States at risk because of your individual actions... there have to be serious consequences.\"\nThe announcement came after press secretary Josh Earnest held the administration's final briefing today. Obama is scheduled to hold his final press conference on Wednesday.\nActivists who lobbied for the commutation or a pardon claimed that Manning had been mistreated in custody and that the information leaked served the public interest instead of compromising national security.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union also said Manning's gender dysphoria was a critical factor, with ACLU LGBT & HIV Project staff attorney Chase Strangio noting last week that Manning has attempted suicide twice in the last six months and \"has faced the perpetual indignity of being subjected to male grooming and hair standards and held in an all-male facility as a woman.\" Strangio added that Manning's \"prospects for surviving another year are grim.\"\nIn a clemency application, Manning wrote, \"I take full and complete responsibility for my decision to disclose those materials to the public. I have never made any excuses for what I did. I pleaded guilty without the protection of a plea agreement because I believed the military justice system would understand my motivation for the disclosure and sentence me fairly. I was wrong.”\nAmnesty International also rallied its members to pressure the Obama administration to free Manning, saying \"she was oversentenced as an example to others, and has already served time for her actions.\"\n\"It is critical that President Obama grant Chelsea Manning’s application in recognition of her acting in the public interest, for the treatment she endured in her early pre-trial detention, for due process shortcomings during her trial and to mitigate the chilling effect on future potential whistleblowers,\" Amnesty said.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2017/01/17/obama-commutes-sentence-of-wikileaker-chelsea-manning/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.amnesty.org.uk/actions/obama-free-chelsea-manning-now?utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=20170117181000&utm_campaign=Amnesty", "https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/why-president-obama-should-commute-chelsea-mannings-sentence"], "published": "2017-01-17T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:04:56.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
