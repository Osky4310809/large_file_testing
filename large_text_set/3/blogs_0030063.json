Perhaps his biggest save came against Predators forward Viktor Arvidsson when he made a stellar point-blank glove save to preserve the Bruins’ lead. \nTo see Rask’s fantastic save, check out the video above from the DCU Save of the Day. \nThumbnail photo from Bob DeChiara/USA TODAY Sports Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:22:24.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
