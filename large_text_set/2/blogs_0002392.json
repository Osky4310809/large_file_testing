Naruto: Shippuden is heading into its final episodes as the anime finishes a series of filler epilogue arcs, and fans are feeling gutted about the anime’s end. However, fans will not need to mourn for too long. Thanks to Masashi Kishimoto, Naruto will be brought back to life in a much-anticipated spin-off anime featuring a whole new cast of ninjas. And, now, the creator is speaking out about what fans can expect from the series. UP NEXT: Upcoming Naruto Anime Spin-Off Reveals New Story Details \nIn a recently translated interview from Weekly Shonen Jump , Kishimoto was asked about his work on Boruto : The Next Generation and how its tone will differ from Naruto. In that regard, the artist said he wanted the new anime to be a lighter affair that audiences of any age could get into. \n“As it went along, the Naruto stop kept getting more introspective and darker and darker. So for Boruto, I want it to be a little bit more happy and fun. Something that the younger boys and girls can also enjoy,” he explained. \nOf course, manga readers will know that Boruto does get off to a rather dark start. Kishimoto says the tonal shift was an intentional one, but he does not plan for the dreary storylines to continue. He said, “I wanted the start of the manga to be happy, but I also wanted to show that there’s a dark turning point coming in order to grab the reader’s attention.” \nAnd, when asked what he was most excited for with Boruto: The Next Generation , Kishimoto teased a slew of yet-introduced characters. \n“There’s a lot of characters that haven’t shown up in Boruto yet,” the creator said, “so I’m excited about the drama involving them.” \nAs fans prepare for Boruto: The Next Generation to get underway in April, U.S. fans can meet the precocious ninja through film. In March, Viz Media will be debuting the dubbed version of Boruto: Naruto The Movie - and fans are more than ready to get their hands on the home release. \nYou can read the summary for Boruto: Naruto The Movie below: \n“With Naruto as the Seventh Hokage, Hidden Leaf Village is planning to host the Chunin Exams to train new shinobi from the village and from their allied villages. Among the entrants are Sasuke's daughter, Sarada, Mitsuki, an exceptionally talented yet mysterious shinobi… And Boruto, Naruto's talented but impetuous son. \nMORE: Live-Action Hollywood Film Confirmed, Creator Involved With Project / Anime Spin-Off Series Announced / Epilogue Novels Will Be Adapted Into Anime \nMeanwhile, Sasuke who’s been on a mission in another dimension appears before Naruto to warn of a strange impending danger. Shrouded with an evil aura, Momoshiki and Kinshiki appear and attempt to assassinate Naruto. Petrified, Boruto is shielded by Naruto, only to disappear in front of Boruto's own eyes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:37:15.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
