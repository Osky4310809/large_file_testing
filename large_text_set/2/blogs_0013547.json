who avoid touching children are guilty of child abuse, experts claim \nChild psychologists say physical contact with pupils is “absolutely essential” for brain development  15   Online While physical contact between teachers and students is not illegal, the Government advises schools to have a “no touch” policy Getty \nTeachers who avoid physical contact with children in the classroom are guilty of child abuse, experts have claimed. \nMembers of the British Psychological Society (BPS) said teachers who do not touch children when they are happy, upset or worried could in fact cause harm and hinder pupils’ development. \n“What’s missing is a recognition of how important touch is,” child psychologist Sean Cameron told TES , “And that withholding touch is, in itself, a form of psychological abuse.” Schools failing mentally ill pupils due to lack of support \nPsychologists from the society have called on schools to change their attitudes towards physical contact with students, explaining to parents that touch is not only necessary, but an integral part of the teacher-pupil relationship. \nProfessor Francis McGlone, head of affective neuroscience at Liverpool John Moores University , said that physical contact with students is “absolutely essential” for children’s brain development. \nSpeaking at British Psychological Society conference on touch in schools and children’s services he said denying physical contact was akin to “denying a child oxygen.” The most expensive schools in the world The most expensive schools in the world 1/10 La Rosey, Switzerland \nThis prestigious

It’s another form of abuse. \n“The scientific evidence is incontrovertible. I’m not just talking psychononsense; I’m talking about proper, evidenced neuroscience.” \nWhile physical contact between teachers and students is not illegal, the Government advises schools to have a “no touch” policy. \nDepartment for Education guidance states that while it is often necessary or desirable for a teacher to touch a child, for instance when dealing with accidents or teaching musical instruments, physical contact can easily be deemed inappropriate and unprofessional. \nAt the BPS conference last week, former Prime Minister David Cameron said, in his experience, many headteachers viewed touching a child as an unjustifiable risk.
