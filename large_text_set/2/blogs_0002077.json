Click here for the preview CHRIS JORDAN to bowl from the other end. 0.7 OVERS India: 4/0 T Mills to V Kohli, ALMOST DRAGS IT ON! Well, is the pitch two-paced? 0.6 OVERS India: 3/0 T Mills to L Rahul, Outside off, finally Lokesh finds the gap and earns a single behind point. 0.5 OVERS India: 2/0 T Mills to L Rahul, Full on middle, flicked straight to short mid-wicket. 0.4 OVERS India: 2/0 T Mills to L Rahul, Outside off, Rahul taps it towards the off side, sets off for a single but his skipper sends him back. Rightly so. Had they gone through for the single, one of them would have been walking back to the pavillion. 0.3 OVERS India: 2/0 T Mills to V Kohli, That ball has taken the inside edge of the batsman and thudded into his pads. One run added to the total. 0.2 OVERS India: 1/0 T Mills to V Kohli, WIDE. Strays down the leg side, Virat misses his flick. India off the mark. 0.1 OVERS India: 0/0 T Mills to V Kohli, Oops... a nervous start. Landed outside off, Kohli looks to tap and run but the ball hits the bottom of his bat and goes behind. Just eludes the stumps. The national anthems have been done and dusted for the final time in this tour. VIRAT KOHLI and KL RAHUL are out in the middle to open the batting. TYMAL MILLS to begin the proceedings with the ball. Here we go... India captain, Virat Kohli says he too would have batted first but isn't too disappointed with the toss. On the pitch, he reckons it's dry and will began to crack as the game progresses. Adds that first innings would be the best time to bat as the ball will hold on a bit in the second. Rishabh Pant makes his international debut, replacing Manish Pandey. England captain, Eoin Morgan says that the pitch looks good and they will look to chase whatever is thrown at them. Adds that what happened last match has been left behind by them. Feels that his bowlers have been really good in the first two T20Is. One Liam replaces the other as Plunkett comes in for Dawson. TOSS - Morgan calls it correctly for the third time in a row and opts to field first. India on the other hand after losing two consecutive matches, they got back to the winning ways in Nagpur. However, it wasn't a great performance from the hosts. The Indian fans will hope that they would have saved the best for the last and come up with the goods in Bengaluru. So, with both teams going for the kill, we are in for a cracker of a match. Stay tuned for the toss! Hello and a warm welcome to the third and final T20I between India and England at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium. This also happens to be England's final match of this tour. The stage has been set perfectly for them to leave India on a positive note by winning the T20I series. After a dismal start to the tour, England have come back strongly and put on a great show in the coloured outfits. They would look to do the same tonight as well and clinch the series. 05:59 PM (IST) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:40:25.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
