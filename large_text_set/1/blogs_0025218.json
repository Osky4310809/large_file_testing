At least, that's the idea behind Alo , a new smartphone concept that imagines a touchscreen-less smartphone.\nCreated by French designer Jamie Olivet with art direction from acclaimed designer Philippe Starck, Alo ditches the typical smartphone display. Instead, the voice-activated phone will project holograms from its camera that show your text messages or let you watch videos, according to Dezeen's interview with Oliviet.\nWhile the core of the device is molded aluminum alloy, the outer shell is a \"gelatinous, supple and natural envelope that perfectly fits your hand,\" Olivet writes on his website. I am not really sure what that means (I've reached out to Olivet for more information) but Deezan reports the surface will also vibrate and give off heat as another means of interaction.\nThough Olivet promises Alo will fit \"perfectly\" in your hand, the concept images look slippery as hell and not ideal for those prone to dropping their phones. But the designers have apparently thought of this too as the as-of-yet-unknown magic outside material also \"repairs automatically as soon as it is damaged.\"\nAlo will also come with an AI assistant (not to be confused with Google's AI-centric messaging app, Allo, which comes with Google Assistant) that will respond to voice commands and learn each user's speech patterns as it \"becomes your privileged personal assistant,\" Olivet says.\nAlo is just a concept for now but the designers, who developed the futuristic concept for French electronics company Thomson, do apparently have a plan to at least make some sort of prototype, though it seems unlikely we'd see an actual version of it any time soon.\nBONUS: This portable charger is powered by energy created with your hand", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/OXm72eD_Zmoentc3plJSCQr-trI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366624%2F3b8b4a76-d2db-4caa-9e87-a7c1284b4bfc.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/70WDxt2Y6NwxoC2Ig3m4PfiZqEc=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366639%2Ff77833b5-5dfb-42b2-87e2-f1816bb5df1d.jpg", "https://www.dezeen.com/2017/01/26/philippe-starck-jerome-olivet-design-gelatinous-vision-future-alo-smartphone-technology-voice-control/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Qi6bRS5soCRPyqV4zZc70OkkB3U=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366458%2F43b2768e-000d-4fd9-ae51-b8b67a5ba595.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/a4JT7o0F.jpg", "http://jeromeolivet.com/portfolio-item/alo/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/a4JT7o0F.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yUqylTjeUnz4NnOkwhoiWonyq58=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366639%2Ff77833b5-5dfb-42b2-87e2-f1816bb5df1d.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xPA8_oFT578qrYppyY3eW0AeZcQ=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366624%2F3b8b4a76-d2db-4caa-9e87-a7c1284b4bfc.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4WhTZhT7CIW9SUA4DAXd4bFpXGE=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366458%2F43b2768e-000d-4fd9-ae51-b8b67a5ba595.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-31T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T04:10:20.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
