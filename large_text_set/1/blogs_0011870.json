For those of you who don’t know, let me tell you that Haraamkhor is based on the love story that blooms between an old teacher – Shyam (Nawazuddin) and his younger student – Sandhya (Shweta). The movie showcases to us how they fall for each other, how they keep their relationship hidden and the issues that follow. While some have liked this concept, some have opposed it. In fact, the CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification) had banned the movie coz of this unusual plot. However, Nawazuddin begs to differ. In an EXCLUSIVE interview with us, the actor mentions how Haraamkhor is actually portraying the reality of life. He even mentions how he himself had a crush on one of his teachers. \nTalking about choosing the movie coz of its unique story, Nawazuddin mentioned, “It (the movie) is a reality. The kind of story (that we are showing) is happening everywhere in reality.” The actor also added that he was also fascinated by one of teachers, when he added, “Of course, I have fallen in love with my teacher. In every man’s life, it happens. You get fascinated by them.” ALSO READ – Haraamkhor movie review: Nawazuddin Siddiqui excels in the creepiest role of his career \nElaborating on the teacher he had a crush on, he revealed, “I didn’t study in a school or college or university where a female teacher used to teach us, but when I was in the National School of Drama (NSD), we had a lot of female teachers.
