My God—will these people ever get over it? I mean I hope they don’t. The more they whine, the better the Republicans’ electoral chances look in 2018 and 2020. Still, have these folks forgotten about the 9/11 attacks? And Halperin also added that Trump’s victory was more cataclysmic than 9/11 (via Daily Caller ): “Outside of the Civil War, World War II, and including 9/11, this may be the most cataclysmic event the country has ever seen,” Halperin said on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert Thursday, appearing with collaborator John Heilemann. \n“I don’t want to minimize the loss of life in 9/11, and in the wars,” Halperin said. “Obviously that is beyond anything that has happened. But if you think of how this has convulsed the country — More than half of the country that voted against him and is upset about his being president — it’s self inflicted.” \nHalperin commented on the divide between how Trump supporters and others in the country view the new administration. “I’ve traveled a lot since [Trump] got elected and there are people who are hopeful, and optimistic, and really think this is the kind of change we need. And there are adults who say to me, ‘This is the worst thing that’s happened to me in my life.'” \nNow, before we pounce on Halperin, he might have a point: liberals are now using violence to shut down events they don’t like, they’ve rioted, and they’ve become more susceptible to believing in conspiracy theories to cope with Hillary Clinton’s loss, one of which is that Russia tampered with the vote tallies . There’s zero evidence to suggest that, as there is no evidence of collusion between Russian intelligence and the Trump campaign. Another theory used by Democrats to discredit the Trump White House because old, sick Hillary couldn’t seal the deal. Frankly, the people who we should really be taken aback by are the ones who feel that Trump winning is worse than the 9/11 attacks, the Civil War, and World War II? For God’s sakes, the most infamous genocide occurred during the latter—and the Civil War remains our bloodiest war in terms of the number of American lives lost. Oh, and the whole part about our country (and our government) collapsing, but hey—Trump winning is worse than all of that. Grow up, liberal voters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T19:20:34.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
