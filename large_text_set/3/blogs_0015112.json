I am furious, and every citizen of Orange and Osceola counties should be as well.\nAs a former witness coordinator for the State Attorney's Office, who was laid off by Ayala when she took office, I am at a loss for words. In my view, this would have never happened under Jeff Ashton, her predecessor.\nAlso, as we all know, her campaign was heavily financed by George Soros, who is anti-death penalty. Is it a coincidence? I think not.\nMy sister was murdered, and as a victim, I can understand what the families are going through right now. I hope they demand an investigation as to why Ayala is not seeking the death penalty, because if any case deserved it, this one does.\nHer actions should wake up our community because she does not deserve to be in office if she is not going to uphold the laws of the state of Florida.\nSteve Zellers Apopka\nAdmiration for promises kept President Trump told us we would have health care for everyone, better and cheaper than our present system. What is now under consideration doesn’t provide that; yet he says that if the current proposal isn’t put into law, he will watch the current system implode and blame the Democrats for the failure.\nThat is not acceptable. Trump is the president of all Americans.\nHe must give us the good health care he said we would have, cheaper and better than what we now have, and Trump will certainly get from everyone the sincere thanks and admiration he will have earned.\nHarold Garde New Smyrna Beach\nTrump right for U.S. The Orlando Sentinel declares on its front page every day that it is “trusted, balanced, local.” But why did the lead story on March 15 deal with President Trump’s 2005 taxes? Was this the most important news of the day?\nHere are just a few things that have been going on in the past couple of months that could have been on the front page instead:\nThe stock market has been going through the roof. The U.S. economy has added 600,000 jobs. Companies are staying, and companies are coming back. De-regulation is benefiting all businesses.\nMeanwhile, there are fewer immigrants entering the United States illegally, and immigrants who are criminals are being deported.\nThe new American Health Care Act will prevent the federal government from going bankrupt. The swamp is being drained; officials who have been wasting money are being purged from the government.\nBetter educational choices are on the way for America, because we are in the lower half of academic performance among nations, but spend more per student than almost any other nation.\nTrump has done more in two months, in every way, than President Obama did in eight years. And let’s not forget the harm that Obama did to America, befriending our enemies and shunning our allies. Yet the Sentinel maintains a negative tone in coverage of Trump, as if everything he has done is bad.\nIt’s not who’s right — the Democrats or the Republicans, who are not my favorites, either. It’s what’s right for the country.\nBob Williams Orlando\n Crime Homicide Donald Trump Democratic Party Markeith Loyd Debra Clayton", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58cb1791/turbine/os-ed-letters-aramis-ayala-anti-death-penalty-20170316"], "published": "2017-03-17T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:53:52.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
