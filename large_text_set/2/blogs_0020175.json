He began throwing her around the room, and repeatedly punching her. He later called the authorities when he noticed Xixi was having trouble breathing.\nIn a video released by police, Matthews attempted to explain his actions. He said he was trying to have a “conversation” about her relationship and she wasn’t taking it seriously:\n“I asked her what she was doing, where she had been today, who she was with. She would just not tell me.\nI grabbed her by the front of the T-shirt with two hands and picked her up off the sofa, then I dragged her with one hand around the sofa and threw her into the bedroom.\nThen I picked her up from there and threw her into a cabinet. I picked her up from there and I punched her in the stomach. She said something really really, I can’t put my finger on it.\nThen I picked her up… I just lost it the moment she said something she’d said before, something to do with her friend Ivy I swear.\nAfter she said that, I instantly punched her pretty, pretty hard in the solar plexus area around here. She instantly, pretty much, bent over, pretty much fell to the floor. I held her up […]\nI could see that that hurt. So I apologized to her. After that we just sat on the bed, and she had a little water and spilt it everywhere.”\nHis own video testimony can be watched below. It may contain elements disturbing to some readers:\n\nXixi and Jordan both lived together in the United Kingdom. They met on the popular dating website “Plenty of Fish” after Xixi moved to the country for her education.\nXixi was the heir to a multi-millionaire dollar company back in her home country of China. She was described as a kind and intelligent young woman. Her brother made the following statement to the court:\n“Xixi was needlessly and selfishly killed by Jordan Matthews, a person which she trusted. Xixi was a kind, friendly, approachable person. She was intelligent and had the whole world in front of her. The heart has been ripped out of our family. We as a family will never come to terms with our loss, and Xixi will always be in our hearts however broken they are.”\nWales News Service Unfortunately, the relationship between Xixi and Jordan appears to have been abusive almost from the start. Jordan would apparently beat Xixi if she refused to have sex with him, and he would send her abusive texts and voicemails. Voicemails that were submitted to the court as evidence included:\n“F*** you. Stop texting me you worthless piece of s**t.”\n“You never do anything right. I can’t be bothered texting you.”\n“I have to hit you repeatedly in the head while screaming at you.”\nFriends and family remarked that while dating Jordan, Xixi became more withdrawn and appeared to be covering up bruises with larger quantities of makeup.\nMugshot Jordan initially told first responders that he had nothing to do with her death, saying that they fought, but that the argument just resulted in “make up sex” that was “better than regular sex anyway”. He eventually plead guilty to manslaughter, saying it was not his intention to kill her.\nHe repeatedly referenced Xixi as his “wonderful girl” and offered to show investigators the ring he planned to propose to her with.\nJordan will serve at least 18 years in prison before he is eligible for release.
