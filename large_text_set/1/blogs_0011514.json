But, in recent weeks, the way we have played is encouraging. If we keep playing like that then the top three is our target.\" Vidic believes the Red Devils' title hopes are over (Photo: Carl Recine/Reuters) \nUnited currently sit in sixth place, four points behind Arsenal in the fourth and final Champions League place. \nThe Serbian says Sunday's draw at Old Trafford was a fair reflection, but rued his former side's failure to take their chances. \n\"After 1-0, you take the 1-1,\" he said. \"In the first half, we played well. We had three or four good chances and didn't take them. If you want to win the match, you have to take the chances we had. Ibrahimovic scored a late equaliser (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) The Swede celebrates his goal (Photo: Reuters) \n\"In the second half, we didn't play as good as in the first one - but we scored a goal. Ibrahimovic showed his class again. One chance, one goal. Overall, 1-1 is a fair result.\" \nThe Red Devils face a trip to Stoke next weekend, before their EFL Cup semi-final second leg against Hull and their FA Cup fourth round tie against Wigan. poll loading Where will Manchester United finish this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T19:04:04.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
