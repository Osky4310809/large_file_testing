Maybe somebody is moving away, or you’ve just grown apart, or you’ve had a huge argument.\nWell, this couple did have a huge argument. But it wasn’t a fight that your parents would’ve had. The entire thing unfolded on Twitter.\nIt started with this tweet from the boyfriend, @almostKj : \nTwitter / @almostKj This was apparently a subtweet toward his girlfriend, @Kencaveee , who didn’t want to go out. \nShe decided to call him out:\nTwitter / @Kencaveee And everything just start going downhill really, really quickly:\nTwitter / @almostKj Twitter / @Kencaveee She got a lot of retweets on that comeback.\nTwitter / @almostKj Um, wow, this is a lot of information about their personal life.\nNothing is too personal to use in a Twitter fight, amirite??\nTwitter / @Kencaveee Um, what?\nTwitter / @almostKj Twitter / @Kencaveee Who are these people that they are dragging into this social media brouhaha?\nTwitter / @almostKj Meanwhile, outside this thread, @Kencaveee makes clear that her and this guy are 100% done:\nTwitter / @Kencaveee But @almostKj decided to start fighting her on this point too:\nTwitter / @almostKj He tried to start playing it off like they were never “actually” a “couple,” but she comes back at him on this idea:\nTwitter / @Kencaveee And for some reason, he decided this was the right time to start bragging about how much he cheated (on someone he previously claimed to have not even dated?).\nTwitter / @almostKj Um…\nTwitter / @Kencaveee Plot twist: she was sleeping with his dad?\nTwitter / @almostKj He claims to be laughing with his “pops”, but wait for the surprise at the end:\nTwitter / @Kencaveee This whole conversation seems too crazy to be real, but who knows? The internet is a wild, wild place.\nA random sample of twitter users based on my very brief scan of Twitter seems to have @Kencaveee as the winner. But did anyone really win except for those of us who got to watch?
