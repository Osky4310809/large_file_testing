Jan 31, 2017 \nThis post will be continuously updated until the winners are announced on February 26, 2017. \nNow that the Oscar nominations have been announced, we're really counting down to the Oscars—that shiny golden evening when Hollywood recognizes the best of the year's cinema. \nWho's impressed the Academy the most? We've been predicting just who will take away those coveted awards right here. We'll continue to update our picks as other award ceremonies fly by. Check back here to see our latest predictions as the wins and nominations stack up, right up until that one night in February. \n(In case you want to play along, catch up on our awards reports this season so far: Golden Globes nominations , winners , and snubs ; Oscar nominations , R. Eric Thomas' response to the nominations , and snubs .) Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best Picture \nNominees: La La Land , Moonlight , Arrival , Fences , Hidden Figures , Hell or High Water , Manchester By the Sea , Hacksaw Ridge , Lion \nWhich film will win? La La Land \nWhy it'll win: Hollywood loves nothing more than an industry tale (see: The Artist , Argo , Birdman ) and this glowing, although somewhat surface-level, tale of struggling artists feels perfect for the Oscar. The fact that it's a mostly feel-good movie also gives it the upper hand in a tense political climate. The movie embraces escapism while maintaining a real bittersweetness, and musicals are often Oscar bait—even if La La Land doesn't have the same show-stopping numbers as Chicago or West Side Story . The film also earned a whopping 14 Oscars nominations, which gives us a pretty good indication of its impact. \nOther awards so far: A sweep at the Golden Globes: La La Land took Best Motion Picture–Comedy or Musical, and six other awards, setting a record for the ceremony. It also took Best Picture at the Critics' Choice Awards. \nMain competition: Moonlight , Arrival , and Lion have earned critical acclaim and various nominations. Moonlight , in particular, is a strong contender, with its moving tale of a gay black man searching for his identity; it also won Best Motion Picture (although in the drama category) at the Golden Globes. Lionsgate Best Actress \nNominees: Emma Stone ( La La Land ), Isabelle Huppert ( Elle ), Ruth Negga ( Loving ), Natalie Portman ( Jackie ), Meryl Streep ( Florence Foster Jenkins ) \nWho will win: Emma Stone ( La La Land ) \nWhy she'll win: We had Natalie Portman pegged as the victor for her spot-on portrayal of Jackie Kennedy, which revealed a deep, emotional dive into the character. But it looks like Stone could take home the gold. Her wide-eyed, impassioned performance as an up-and-coming actress has charmed everyone this year. Plus: singing and dancing. \nOther awards so far: A Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture–Musical or Comedy; a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. \nMain competition: The aforementioned Portman for Jackie ; Meryl Streep for Florence Foster Jenkins because, well, she's Meryl Streep; and Isabelle Huppert for Elle . Huppert scored at the Globes, but Stone will probably trump the French actress on Oscar night. Summit Entertainment Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best Actor \nNominees: Casey Affleck ( Manchester By the Sea ), Andrew Garfield ( Hacksaw Ridge ), Ryan Gosling ( La La Land ), Denzel Washington ( Fences ), Viggo Mortensen ( Captain Fantastic ) \nWho will win: Casey Affleck ( Manchester by the Sea ) \nWhy he'll win: Despite persistent controversy over past harassment charges against him, Affleck's performance in Manchester by the Sea is attracting a lot of positive attention this awards season. The actor's portrayal of a grieving father, ex-husband, and brother who becomes his nephew's sole guardian is strong and affecting. Going by the recognition he's already received for his performance, Affleck is a strong contender for the award. \nOther awards so far: A Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture—Drama; a SAG Awards nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role; and the Critics' Choice award for Best Actor. \nMain competition: Denzel Washington in Fences and Ryan Gosling in La La Land . These are both formidable opponents, especially Washington, who just nabbed a SAG Award, but Hollywood certainly seems to have decided that Affleck should be celebrated for this role. Gosling won at the Globes, but Oscar voters tend to favor dramatic, tragic roles over whimsy when it comes to the guys. Claire Folger, Courtesy of Amazon Studios and Roadside Attractions Best Supporting Actress \nNominees: Viola Davis ( Fences ), Naomie Harris ( Moonlight ), Nicole Kidman ( Lion ), Octavia Spencer ( Hidden Figures ), Michelle Williams ( Manchester By the Sea ) \nWho will win: Viola Davis ( Fences ) \nWhy she'll win: While Harris' heart-wrenching performance in Moonlight is one of the most memorable of the year (we initially had her pegged to win), it looks like Davis may have the edge this year. Her work in Fences is emotionally raw and assured, which could lead voters to single her out on Oscar night. Her acceptance speeches have all had an incredible impact, too, and have made her even more of a standout this awards season. \nOther awards so far: A Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role; a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role; and a Critics' Choice win for Best Supporting Actress. \nMain competition: Davis has strong competition from a slew of amazing actresses, who make this a really strong year in the category. She will primarily face off against the aforementioned Harris, as well as Michelle Williams in Manchester by the Sea . However, Davis has won three awards so far—the Critics' Choice Award, the SAG Award, and the Golden Globe—so she's looking extremely likely at this point. Zero Media Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best Supporting Actor \nNominees: Mahershala Ali ( Moonlight ), Dev Patel ( Lion ), Jeff Bridges ( Hell or High Water ), Lucas Hedges ( Manchester By the Sea ), Michael Shannon ( Nocturnal Animals ) \nWho will win: Mahershala Ali ( Moonlight ) \nWhy he'll win: Ali was pipped by Nocturnal Animals actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson at the Golden Globes, taking many by surprise, but he should be the victor at the Oscars. Ali gives an incredible, generous performance in Moonlight , and although he is not onscreen for most of the film, his scenes have a lot of impact. \nOther awards so far: A Golden Globes nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role; a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role. \nMain competition: Dev Patel for Lion and Jeff Bridges for Hell or High Water , both of whom are favorites but probably not buzzy enough to triumph this year. A24 Best Director \nNominees: Damien Chazelle ( La La Land ), Denis Villeneuve ( Arrival ), Mel Gibson ( Hacksaw Ridge ), Kenneth Lonergan ( Manchester By the Sea ), Barry Jenkins ( Moonlight ) \nWho will win: Damien Chazelle ( La La Land ) \nWhy he'll win: Damien Chazelle is the up-and-coming director to watch in Hollywood and his vision for La La Land has proved super compelling for audiences so far. The movie has an auteur quality in its epic musical numbers—Chazelle obviously poured his heart and soul into the project. Plus, everyone loved his last feature film, Whiplash , and that will carry over here. \nOther awards so far: A Golden Globe for Best Director—Motion Picture; and a Critics' Choice award for Best Director. \nMain competition: Kenneth Lonergan for Manchester By the Sea and Barry Jenkins for Moonlight . These directors both stand a chance but Chazelle currently has the upper hand, which has been helped by La La Land 's Globes sweep. And, please, no statue for Mel Gibson, Academy.
