The Cavaliers went into Chicago on Thursday night looking to right their own ship and end the Bulls streak but they found out they could do neither. \nThe Cavaliers came out strong in the first half, looking like the Cavaliers team we expect to see. LeBron James had been harping that his team lacked defensive toughness and in the first half, James backed up his words with fantastic play. He led the way with 19 points, throwing down this monster dunk.\nHe also led the way on defense, with a chase down block that was quite similar to his block on Andre Igoudala in the NBA Finals last season.\nWhile the Cavaliers went into the half up 50-40, but the Bulls would not go away quietly. Chicago went on a 15-2 run in the third quarter, giving them a seven point lead to end the third quarter, 78-71. Nikola Mirotic was huge for the Bulls, hitting six three-pointers and scoring 28 points.\nBack-to-back triples for @threekola pic.twitter.com/P2wXZbS4Pd \n— Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) March 31, 2017 Jimmy Butler finished the night with 25 points, with 10 of those in the fourth quarter.\n4th quarter = Jimmy time! pic.twitter.com/NUlcoX4F5k \n— Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) March 31, 2017 This was a huge win not only for the Bulls TNT streak but also for their hopes to reach the playoffs. The Bulls came into Thursday night a game and a half out of the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference. They now sit one game behind the Pacers for eighth place, while the Cavaliers dropped a half game behind the first place Celtics .\nThose TNT Bulls might be onto something.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:42:14.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
