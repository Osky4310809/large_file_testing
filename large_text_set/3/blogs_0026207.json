Yesterday afternoon, Kate attended yet another mental health engagement as part of her, William, and Harry’s Heads Together initiative. The charity event, organized by Best Beginnings, focused on child health and the mental well-being of new mothers. Kate Middleton wore a vintage-style skirt suit by Eponine London. [Photo: PA] More In a rare speech, Kate gave personal details of her own struggles with parenting: “Personally, becoming a mother has been such a rewarding and wonderful experience. However, at times it has also been a huge challenge. Even for me, who has support at home that most mothers do not. “Nothing can really prepare you for the sheer, overwhelming experience of what it means to become a mother. It’s full of complex emotions of joy, exhaustion, love and worry, all mixed together.” She also spoke of the pressures to be perfect, adding: “There is no rule book, no right or wrong. You just have to make it up and do the very best you can to care for your family. For many mothers, myself included, this can at times lead to a lack of confidence and feelings of ignorance. Sadly, for some mothers, this experience can be made so much harder due to challenges with our mental health.” You can still buy the Duchess’s LK Bennett clutch. [Photo: PA] More For the charity visit, Kate rewore a $1,500 red skirt suit by Eponine London. The checked vintage style was first seen on the Duchess last March . These tailored skirt suits seem to be dominating the Duchess’s work wardrobe this year, with several styles in play over the past couple of months. She paired the fitted look with her favorite suede Gianvito Rossi heels and a nude box clutch by LK Bennett . Both are still available to buy (though probably not for long).
