Earlier this year, a report indicated that the 2017 iPhone would sport wireless charging. Now a fresh report by notable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests otherwise. Credit – Behance \nKuo suggests that all three iPhones this year will sport wireless charging. He also mentioned that since the use of wireless charging increases the internal temperature of devices, Apple is expected to develop a new 3D Touch module for the display of the iPhone 8 / iPhone X. This model is expected to bring a refreshed design and an OLED display. The new 3D Touch module will reportedly feature additional graphite sheet lamination, which will prevent the phone from malfunctioning due to overheating. \nAs per the report, the new 3D Touch module could be up to $5 (approx. Rs 330) more expensive than the old one. A separate report claims that the next-gen iPhones could start at as much as $1,000, roughly translates to Rs 66,930. The brand is expected to unveil the new iPhones at its annual September event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:06:08.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
