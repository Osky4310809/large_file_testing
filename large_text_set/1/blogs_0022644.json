The harder, better, faster, stronger version of CM will be ready for download this weekend, with the Lineage team adding a download portal , wiki and install stats pages to its website.\nSee also: Cyanogen Inc. co-founder Steve Kondik speaks out about company failings December 1, 2016 Over 80 devices will be supported, with both Nougat and Marshmallow builds being prepped as we speak – the device list will be posted separately on the Lineage blog. Every week will see a new release candidate let loose, with signed private keys for authentication and signature permission control. Root will not be baked in but can be enabled separately with an optional zip.\nWhile a fresh install is a better idea, if you’re upgrading from a CM 13/14.1 build to Lineage, you can try out the (experimental) data migration builds. These data migration builds will be offered alongside the release candidates for the first two months only. There’s no guarantee these migration builds will work perfectly, but if you want the path of least resistance go right ahead. Just be sure to back everything up before pulling the trigger.\nThe Lineage team also goes out of its way to thank the many that have volunteered to help get the project off the ground, proving not only that there is a lot of residual goodwill stored up for the project, but also that Lineage is, true to the former CyanogenMod team’s word, returning to a grassroots community effort.\nWill you be flashing Lineage OS this weekend?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T13:53:22.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
