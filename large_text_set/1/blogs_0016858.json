It was exhilarating to have successfully completed the course and to brandish a certification that is recognised worldwide. I did it because it’s something that excites me, interests me and adds dimension and depth to what I already do. While this may be of professional and personal interest to me, learning new things is something we are all capable of. Don’t you want things to be different? Don’t you want more? More happiness, more fun, more excitement, more amazing memories? Then go out there and make it happen!\nWe get so set in our ways that we keep reaffirming to ourselves, ‘this is me’, and look at others around us with despair and say, ‘they are like that only, nothing will change’. The beauty is we all want to change others, not realising the key is in changing ourselves. The moment you are different, everything around you will automatically start to change in reaction and resonance with the new energy you have brought into the environment. It could be simple little changes like bringing flowers home to your wife randomly but often, extra hugs and kisses, giving your partner a foot massage, or simply putting your head on their chest while doing the typical routine of watching TV together. These don’t seem like dramatic changes, but you will notice how resistant you are to even trying them. When you know affection, touch, caring are all positives, you need to ask yourself why you are so averse to the thought of re-introducing it into your relationship. And also, observe the fact that you may do it once in a ‘see I did it, nothing changed’ manner.\nChange isn’t easy and though theoretically change is constant, change is uncomfortable and takes consistent effort to break established patterns. Look at the way your relationship with your loved one started and look at it today. So many things about it must have changed. You gradually let it change. If it changed for the worse, it is you who allowed it to do so. So, if things are going to change for the better, it’s you that needs to put in the effort. Ask yourself, is it more of an effort to put up with drudgery, unhappiness and boredom or to initiate and infuse into the relationship the dimensions and feelings of your choosing. Yes, you old dog! You can learn new tricks!\nMy boss and I have been having heated discussions for the past few months. And this one day, I just couldn’t take it and was about to put my papers down as I thought I deserved better. That’s the day my boss asked me out and my best friend has been eyeing him for long. What do I do?\nWell, if you’re having heated discussions and also because of the fact he’s your boss, the first thing you need to do is quit the job. Staying on only means an irritating boss, who’s now going to make you physically uncomfortable and cause emotional stress with your best friend. Besides, work ethics should deter you from being involved with your boss.\nI’m attracted to this musician and he too seems interested in me. However, I am married, but I’m unable to control myself through this since he’s really charming. I went out with him for a date last week and we happened to get slightly intimate with each other. I don’t know what to do?\nIf there is a void in your marriage, I suggest you address it rather than attempting to fill it with something that is illegal, unfair and hurtful. You chose to be married and you need to respect your choices and also the man who committed to loving and caring for you all his life. You cannot let some silly attraction compromise your moral fibre and the larger picture of what it is that you want for yourself.\nI’m almost 40 and still unmarried. However, I really like this guy in my office who is about 12 years younger to me. He too seems to like me as well. But I don’t know if it will the right thing to take this relationship ahead, considering the wide age gap. Please advise.\nAt 40 you are looking to get married, and at 28, he still has time. The issues will include both families’ aversion to it. Also, the fact that you may connect in the first flush of romance but find you’re completely incompatible in the long run with different interest levels based on age. Do some research on the net, get family feedback and combine that with gut instinct and you will have your answer.\nMy live-in girlfriend has been behaving weird these days, she does important things even without asking for my suggestions and then says that she has the right to do it. From investing my share of my salary into mutual funds to calling my parents over to the house for dinner almost every two days, I feel extremely claustrophobic. How do I get things straight?\nEstablishing boundaries are crucial in every relationship. Make it known that even if and when she is your wife, you will not appreciate such behaviour. Tell her that giving her access to your funds is based on trust and you feel she violates that by investing it without your consent. Add that as an equal part of this relationship you would like a say in who comes over, how often they come over and to also plan the week based on other needs the both of you have.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T04:00:22.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
