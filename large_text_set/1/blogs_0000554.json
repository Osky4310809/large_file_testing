However, a lawsuit before the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. is hoping to end that trend.\nAccording to Business Insider, Level The Playing Field, et. al. vs. FEC was heard before the federal court on January 5. The plaintiffs argue that the Committee on Presidential Debates (CPD), which has organized the national debates for the past 24 years, is run by members of the two leading parties, and is violating election laws by making rules that effectively exclude outside parties.\nCurrent rules by the CPD state that candidates must average 15 percent of voters' support across multiple national polls. In 1992, Ross Perot was allowed to participate in the debates even though he only held eight percent of the national vote. Since then, the debate's admittance threshold has tightened.\nAt the peak of his popularity, Libertarian candidate hit 12 percent support among voters nationally. Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, never broke out of single-digit support.\nIn an October op-ed, former Democratic presidential candidate and chair of the Democratic National Committee, Howard Dean, argued the case for rank-choice voting as a method of breaking the two-party hold on American politics.\n\"I learned to appreciate ranked-choice voting in 2000, when seeking re-election as governor of Vermont,\" Dean wrote. \"I faced strong challenges from the Republican and Progressive Parties. With votes split three ways, I barely won a majority. In Vermont, the Legislature elects the governor if no one achieves a majority. I think the voters should do that. Major parties can take two approaches after such an election: fight the very existence of minor parties, or change laws to handle increased voter choice.\"\nAlso in October, after being denied participation in the national debates, Johnson grieved the loss.\n\"Really, really it just sucks -- no other way to put it,\" he said, notes the Los Angeles Times. \"I'm the only third-party candidate on the ballot in all 50 states.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:46:46.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
