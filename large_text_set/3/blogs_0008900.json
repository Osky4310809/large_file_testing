It includes land that’s already frequented by lots of hikers, because it’s close to the park and the line between public and private land isn’t clearly marked. \nNot much will change—and that’s the point—to make sure it’s protected from possible development and kept as open space for the public, said Trust for Public Land project manager Becky Bremser. \nCourtesy of the Trust for Public Land The orange area represents the land that was added to Runyon Canyon Park. The parcel also includes the land on which a local landmark known as the Pink Mansion sits. The house, which dates to the 1990s, sold in 2014 to Michael Straumietis, CEO of Advanced Nutrients, which sells supplies for hydroponic weed growers. Straumietis appears to go by the nickname “Marijuana Don,” and has used the house to throw pot-themed parties . The house was not included in the purchase. \nBremser says sections of the new parkland that abut the mansion to the northwest and southwest will be owned and operated by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority. The triangular sections to the east and southeast of the residence, including the knoll that serves as a popular destination for Runyon Canyon hikers, will be owned and operated by the city’s rec and parks department. Angelenos will have access to it all. \nCity could add nearly five acres to Runyon Canyon Park [Curbed LA] \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:33:13.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
