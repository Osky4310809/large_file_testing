Lord had harsh words for the sexual abuse victims of former Nittany Lions assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, according to an email to The Chronicle of Higher Education. \nIn the email, Lord said he is “running out of sympathy” for the “so-called” abuse victims. The statement comes days after former Penn State president Graham Spanier was convicted of child endangerment related to the Sandusky abuse scandal. \nLord, a former chief executive of Sallie Mae, was elected by alumni to serve on the Penn State Board of Trustees. He has been a vocal supporter of Spanier. \n“Running out of sympathy for 35 yr old, so-called victims with 7 digit net worth,” Lord said in an email on Saturday. “Do not understand why they were so prominent in trial.” \n“I am tired of victims’ getting in the way of clearer thinking and a reasoned approach to who knew what and who did what,” Lord said in the interview. \n\n\nAnother one of life’s great unanswered questions answered: How long is too long to have sympathy for people who were diddled by creepy old men when they were children? What’s the statute of limitations on feeling bad for little children who were sexually molested and abused and taken advantage of by an adult in a position of power? Looks like Penn State trustee Albert Lord has set the time period at around 20ish years and $1 million-plus in legal settlements. People forget that money awarded by a court two decades after the fact erases all the trauma from a sexual assault. \n\nSick of these fucking “victims” still whining about shit that happened in the past. I mean, get over it already. How long are you going to whine about it? Seriously don’t even get Albert STARTED on the Jews and the blacks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:25:13.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
