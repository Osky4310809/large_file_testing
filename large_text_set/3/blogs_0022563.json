Or single.’\nWoman spends ages making her cat a castle - cat totally ignores it Luckily the friend in question had an abortion. It was a quick, practical process and her life is better for it. But what she said has stayed with me.\nThere is a concept, one that many of us carry, that there are ‘good’ reasons to get an abortion.\n‘Good’ abortions are for people who have been raped. They are for people whose lives would be endangered by carrying on with the pregnancy. For people who are very young or very poor or being abused.\nAnd the rest of us? We have ‘bad’ abortions. Selfish ones.\nWomen who have abortions in their twenties and thirties despite being in relationships and having money, because having a baby doesn’t suit us? ‘Bad’.\nWomen who find that the foetus they are carrying has a disability and don’t feel equipped to continue the pregnancy? ‘Bad’.\nWomen who have abortions because they’ve already got two children and that seems like enough? Also ‘bad’.\nPerhaps the best example of the abortion dichotomy is Josie Cunningham, the unlikeable stock character who shot to fame by claiming the NHS owed her breast implants. Cunnigham spoke openly about wanting to have an abortion so that she could go on reality TV show Big Brother.\n(Picture: Getty) People were outraged. They asked how anyone could be so selfish.\nOf course, had Cunningham had an offer to study at Oxford University, or start a career with a high ranking finance firm, things would have been different.\nIf you agree with a woman’s right to chose, then you cannot start moving the bar around based on whose reasons you do and do not respect.\nIt’s a choice. Just like the choice to smoke, or skydive, or wear religious insignia: you don’t have to like it, you just have to respect that it’s not your decision.\nThe zenith of the ‘bad’ abortion is a woman who had an abortion because the foetus she’s carrying isn’t the gender she needed it to be, a topic which hit the news over the weekend.\nProfessor Wendy Savage, an expert for the British Medical Association, spoke openly about condoning sex selective abortions, echoing that original call to arms ‘your body, your choice.’\nProfessor Wendy Savage (Picture Lucy Young / Eyevine) Savage’s comments have caused outrage, with people on both the pro and anti-choice sides of the debate decrying her stance.\nOf course those who hold anti-abortion beliefs disagree with Savage, but at least (and I cannot believe I’m about to say a word in their defence) they are consistent. Anti-abortionists don’t want anyone to have an abortion, ever.\nIt’s the pro-life camp who are wrestling with hypocrisy here, by trying to redefine what choice means.\nThere are many, many reasons that a woman chooses to abort a foetus on the basis of gender. Dowry payments, social conditioning and the fact that the world is crueller to women are just some of those reasons.\nThere is, without a doubt, an issue with families putting pressure on a woman to abort a foetus of the ‘wrong’ gender. In those situations we are not talking about choice, we are talking about coercion and control.\nWhat Savage (and myself) are defending is the right to choose, whatever your motivation.\nAs a feminist and impassioned supporter of women, it breaks my heart to think that people are aborting their potential daughters. I hate that we live in a world where women are more of a liability. But you know what I hate more than that?\nThe idea of a child growing up in a home where it is not loved or wanted because of its gender.\n(Picture: Jana Birchum/Getty Images) But even aside from the logistical and practical reasons to allow sex selective abortions, the ultimate truth here is that we should not try to pick and chose which abortions we approve of. In truth, choosing to have an abortion on the basis of gender is no better or worse than choosing to have an abortion for any other reason.\nI believe, being pro-choice does not come with a disclaimer. You cannot be pro-choice within the perimeters of your own morals. Either you believe that it is a woman’s right to control her womb, or you don’t.\nMORE: Women should be allowed to have sex-selective abortions, claims expert \nMORE: Why we need to talk about our abortions ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:51:09.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
