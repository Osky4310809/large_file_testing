He sleeps like a rock,” Nicole said of Michael.\nRELATED VIDEO: Michael Phelps and Nicole Johnson Share Wedding Ceremony Photos \nBoomer couldn’t make it to the event, which started at 7 p.m. and lasted for hours. But Michael noted that he normally gets up with his young son, as he tends to be an early riser anyway.\n“It’s a fair trade,” Nicole said.\n“He’s at home!” said Michael. “We went and watched golf for a little bit in Arizona,we flew down here and then we are heading back. It’s a nice little getaway.”\nDad and I made a great putt today on 16!! #wastemanagementphoenixopen \nA photo posted by boomer phelps (@boomerrphelps) on Feb 1, 2017 at 7:48pm PST \nAlthough the couple surely missed their son (who has his own Instagram account !) — they were able to raise money for a good cause.\nThe tournament winner also receives six months of private coaching by World Series of Poker Champion Jamie Gold and a seat at the Main Event of the World Series Poker, a VIP experience at the 2017 ESPY Awards and the 2017 Masters. \n“There’s no better way than for all of us to come here for a good cause,” said Phelps.\nreporting by HEATHER STAIBLE ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:04:13.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
