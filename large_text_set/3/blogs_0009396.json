But, when you’re entering another country, you still potentially have to deal with long lines. While we’ve written about fast-track arrivals programs other countries offer, there’s one that seems to be especially overlooked: Germany’s EasyPASS-RTP . \nOnce enrolled, Americans (and citizens of Hong Kong) can enter the European Union in Germany using the automated gates typically only available to citizens of the EU. And, unlike Global Entry, it’s free to enroll in EasyPASS. For me, it’s already come in handy — cutting around 15 minutes off of both my arrival in Frankfurt (FRA) last November and my arrival in Berlin (TXL) last week. This may take a while… \nAnd @JTGenter cut the line with some sort of ezpass thing. Cheater! pic.twitter.com/6vJbVdN5cw \n— Jason Rabinowitz (@AirlineFlyer) March 7, 2017 \nWant to “cut the line” for future trips to Germany? Here’s the process to enroll: You must apply in person. So, the next time you’re in Germany, head to one of five Germany airports (Hamburg [HAM], Berlin-Tegel [TXL], Dusseldorf [DUS], Frankfurt [FRA], Munich[MUC]) with an enrollment center. Head to the German federal police office and ask to enroll in EasyPASS. The process, which includes a quick interview and filling out a couple of forms, takes about 10 minutes from start to finish. \nIt’s that easy. If approved, you’ll immediately have access to any of the automated EasyPASS eGates in seven German airports (FRA, MUC, Cologne [CGN], DUS, Berlin-Schönefeld [SXF], TXL and HAM). And, you’ll be able to continue to use these gates every time you enter Germany through the end of the validity of your passport. \nHere’s a quick video on how the eGates work: \nFeatured image courtesy of the Bundespolizei (German Federal Police).
