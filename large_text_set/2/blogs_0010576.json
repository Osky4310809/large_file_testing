If they’re toddlers, they may not sit still for long, or maybe they love their new baby sibling a little too much, making cuddly photos a bit of a calculated risk. But sometimes, you click at the perfect moment and capture something truly incredible, like this photographer mom managed to do. \nPhotographer Juliet Cannici and her wife Nikki are the proud parents of two gorgeous sets of twins: Nico and Siena, nearly three, and Gia and Gemma, just over two weeks old. Cannici, owner of West on Jade Photography , took photos of the new baby girls a few days ago and Nico and Siena got in on the action for one adorable shot.

Cannici tells Scary Mommy that the pose was one she had planned, but her first try didn’t work out so well. \n“Earlier in the day I had tried to have our older twins sit and hold the newborns…it was an utter failure. I gave the kids a half hour break and brought them back into my home studio and laid them down to take this photo. It took two minutes. To get those big smiles I told them to “act goofy” (which apparently is super funny to them).” \nLooks like the second time’s the charm, as the precious image is definitely one to remember. And Cannici got quite a few sweet ones of Gia and Gemma too.

And even though she couldn’t get too many shots of all four kids together, it’s not because these sweet older siblings are unhappy to have their baby sisters. Cannici shares with Parents , “Nico and Siena have been in love with their baby sisters long before they were even born. They are both amazingly gentle with the girls, love holding and feeding them, and look forward to the days when they can take them down slides and on tractor rides.” \nOf their double sets of twins, Cannici says Gemma and Gia were a total shock. She explains that due to “science and odds” Nico and Siena’s twin status wasn’t a big surprise. But identical twins have nothing to do with science. “My wife Nikki and I were mind-blown throughout my wife’s entire pregnancy, and we still are. We never imagined we would have four kids under 3 years old.” Image via West on Jade Photography \nAs for getting more photos of their brood together, there are plans in the works. “I will no doubt throw the four of them together for more photos as they grow. I’m totally thrilled with that one photo of them all together as newborns though.” \nOverall, Cannici and her wife are happy the photo is spreading joy to others and possibly, providing a little hope too. “I’m happy to have our story out there, especially if answers any questions for LGBT couples trying to conceive.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T22:08:09.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
