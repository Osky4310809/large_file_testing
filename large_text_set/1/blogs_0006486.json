It’s not like we didn’t know that the Australian actress tends to be a total knockout at any event she attends , but this is a little excessive. Her dress is gorgeous, but so whimsical and unique that we’re totally obsessing. It’s so ~her~ that we’d like her to offer an online class on how to take our personal styles to this level of perfection , please and thank you.\nHer whole look was amazing, but take special note of the heart on the bodice of the dress — that’s definitely our heart and she can KEEP it because we love this dress so much. C Flanigan / Getty Images Obvi, Nicole herself looked totally stunning in simple makeup with a killer red lip. We also l ve her purple necklace. It’s a great pop of color since the dress, though kinda busy, is fairly neutral overall. C Flanigan/ Getty Images She kept her nail polish similarly neutral, but again her ~accessories~ made the whole look a little brighter and more fun. PLUS, look at the amazing detail on that dress. It should be exhibited in a museum, tbh. C Flanigan / Getty Images We’re also totally in love with the way the bottom of her dress bunches when she holds it up. Her whole look is so romantic and lovely, we feel like she’s about to step off of the red carpet and into a fairy tale. Michael Kovac / Getty Images In that fairy tale she is the benevolent, magical queen who raises us in her image. Obviously.
