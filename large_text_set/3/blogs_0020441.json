The U.S. needed a win in hostile territory to qualify for the 1990 World Cup. The Soca Warriors entered the match hugely confident, and the day of the game was declared a national holiday. But Paul Caligiuri's goal and Tony Meola's goalkeeping led the U.S. to a 1-0 victory, one that allowed the Americans to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 40 years. \n\"We had a really young team at the time, so I don't think we felt the kind of pressure that we should have felt,\" said then-midfielder Tab Ramos in a phone interview. \"But at the same time, you know that all you've been working for and your dream of qualifying depends on one game. That creates pressure. You're thinking, 'If we don't go to the World Cup I'm not going to have a soccer career.' \n\"After the whistle, I just collapsed on the field. I couldn't believe it. We're going to the World Cup. It was definitely a great feeling,\" he added. \nU.S. 0-1 Costa Rica; May 31, 1985 \nNot every crunch match has gone the Americans' way, though you have to search back to 1985 to find the most recent example. The U.S. thought it had done the hard part when it secured a 1-1 draw in Costa Rica, meaning all it needed to do was draw the Ticos at home in order to progress to the final round. What transpired instead was the U.S. team's worst nightmare; a 35th-minute goal from Evaristo Coronado put Costa Rica ahead and the U.S. could never find an equalizer. \n\"We dominated that game,\" said then-U.S. midfielder Hugo Perez via telephone. \"We hit the post a couple of times. It was frustrating because we were at home. And some of the guys, they had been in the national team program for years and their dream was to go to a World Cup. Sometimes when you miss your opportunity to go to a World Cup, there are certain players on the team who don't get another chance. I was young, but some of them that was their last opportunity.\" \nThe U.S. team's dream of World Cup qualification would have to wait. \nU.S. 2-1 Jamaica; Oct. 7, 2001 Landon Donovan and the U.S. ground out a nervy 2-1 win over Jamaica to clinch qualification for the 2002 World Cup. \nWhat at one stage looked like a procession to World Cup qualification was thrown into doubt as the U.S. suffered a three-game losing streak, leaving it level on points with Honduras for the last qualifying spot with two games to play. That put the Americans in what was essentially a must-win situation against Jamaica in the penultimate match at the old Foxboro Stadium. \nThe U.S. ground out a nervy 2-1 win over the Reggae Boyz thanks to Joe-Max Moore's 81st-minute penalty. The Americans then received a gift from the soccer gods, as previously winless Trinidad and Tobago upset Honduras 1-0 in San Pedro Sula, thus clinching qualification for the U.S. \n\"I remember I chipped a tooth in that game,\" said defender Jeff Agoos. \"I literally earned a cap. \n\"I just remember the relief. It's such a long process. What people don't realize is they get to tune in from game to game, but the team goes through a good 12-18 process in qualifying. It's a lot of different experiences all put together to get you to the World Cup. I was really happy to be able to get through, especially after the poor performance in 1998. We felt like we had to get back to show that '98 was more of a fluke.\" \nU.S. 4-0 Barbados; Nov. 15, 2000 \nThe Jamaica match wasn't the only close call the U.S. encountered during the 2002 World Cup cycle. The last game of the semifinal round saw the U.S. travel to Barbados needing to win in order to advance to the final round Hexagonal. Don't be fooled by the 4-0 scoreline. It wasn't until the 63rd minute that Clint Mathis put the U.S. up, and just prior to that Meola saved a Barbados shot that then deflected off defender Carlos Llamosa and the bar. The U.S. found some daylight after Mathis' tally with goals coming from Earnie Stewart, Cobi Jones and Ante Razov, and the team could finally breathe easy. \n\"It goes to show that in World Cup qualifying, every game is really difficult,\" said Ramos, who played his last game for the national team that day. \"Although in the end, against a smaller country with less experience, you can break the game open at some point, it can take a long time. You have to have the patience to do that and it's not easy.\" \nU.S. 1-0 Costa Rica; March 22, 2013 \nOn the surface, the \"Snow Clasico \" as it came to be known, didn't rise to must-win status, at least in terms of the standings. The match was just the second of the 10-game Hexagonal. But the U.S. had lost its opener on the road to Honduras and then a now-infamous article painted a picture of a team in disarray, one that had little faith in manager Jurgen Klinsmann. The pressure on the U.S. was immense. \n\"It wasn't do-or-die in the sense of points, but it was do-or-die in the sense of character,\" said Herculez Gomez, who was on the field that night. \"I think all eyes were on us in that moment. But that game was a parting of the waters for us and Jurgen's tenure. From there on it was smooth sailing, but up to that point it was very rocky. That game was a defining moment for us.\" \nThe U.S. ultimately prevailed 1-0 in near-blizzard conditions thanks to a Clint Dempsey goal, with Jermaine Jones' snow-glazed hair making for an indelible image. Herculez Gomez described the 'Snow Clasico,' which the U.S. won 1-0 over Costa Rica, as 'do-or-die in the sense of character.' \nU.S. 3-1 Guatemala; Oct. 16, 2012 \nThe final game of the semifinal round of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup saw the U.S. needing at least at draw against Guatemala to guarantee passage to the Hexagonal. But nerves were put on edge after just five minutes when old nemesis Carlos Ruiz put Los Chapines ahead. Order was soon restored when Carlos Bocanegra scored from a corner. Dempsey then struck twice before half-time to send the U.S. on its way to a 3-1 win. But it was an innocuous play that got it started. \n\"After Guatemala's goal, everybody's mindset was 'Let's go, let's go,'\" said Gomez. \"There was a play where I chased the ball down in the corner and we won a corner kick. It seems like something so meaningless, chasing down a lost cause. But off that set piece Bocanegra ended up scoring. You could feel the tide turning, 'We're back in this!' \n\"It's all about taking advantage of your moments and once that moment happened, the tide shifted,\" added Gomez. \"You could feel the confidence in our team growing and decreasing in their team.\" \nU.S. 4-0 Guatemala; March 29, 2016 \nThe U.S. had been humbled by Los Chapines four days earlier, losing 2-0 in Guatemala City. The result left the Americans in third place after three matches, so tension was running a bit higher than normal for the return encounter at MAPFRE Stadium in Columbus, Ohio. \nThe U.S. was soon operating on cruise control and ended up hammering Guatemala. First-half goals from Dempsey and Geoff Cameron put the U.S. in front and the hosts ran away with it in the second half, as Graham Zusi and Jozy Altidore scored as well. The win ultimately propelled the U.S. to a first-place finish in the group. \nJeff Carlisle covers MLS and the U.S. national team for ESPN FC.
