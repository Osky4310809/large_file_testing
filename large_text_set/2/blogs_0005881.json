Photograph: BBC View more sharing options Thursday 9 February 2017 09.35 GMT Live feed 09:28 \nFor many years there was an assumption that an EU referendum, and Brexit, would split the Conservative party. But, as last night’s vote confirmed, that actual process of leaving the EU is creating much more turmoil for Labour , as became apparent when Jeremy Corbyn was interviewed on BBC Breakfast this morning. Here are the key points from what he had to say. Corbyn dismissed claims that he has set a date for stepping down as “fake news”. When he was asked about these claims, he dismissed them as “absolute nonsense”. \nThat’s in the ‘Imadeitupyesterday.com’. \nWhen pressed, he criticised the presenter for even raising the issue. \nI’m really surprised that the BBC is reporting fake news. There is no news. Listen, I was elected leader of this party. I’m very proud to lead this party. We will go through this process demanding from the government social justice in Britain, setting out our economic plans for an investment-led economy, opposing this government on the crisis in social care and the health service, demanding real action on the housing crisis taking place all over this country. That is our agenda. That is what we are united on. And that is what I’m doing. \nThe claim that Corbyn has set a date for stepping down may have been first made by Adam Boulton in a column in the Sunday Times (paywall) in December. Boulton wrote: \nCorbyn is due to celebrate his 70th birthday on May 26, 2019. According to a very senior Labour source, he has said privately he does not want to serve as leader beyond then. He has also hinted that he does not want to fight a general election as party leader. \nAt Westminster the rumour mill started whirling again on this issue yesterday, prompted to a large extent by this tweet from the Manchester Evening News’s Jennifer Williams. \nHere’s the clip, tweeted by the BBC’s Jamie McConkey , who points out that the BBC was not reporting this supposed “fake news” but just asking Corbyn if it was true. Jamie McConkey (@JamieMcConkey) BBC: We want to avoid reporting fake news, so please clarify something for us.Corbyn: I'm really surprised the BBC is reporting fake news. pic.twitter.com/lsYGGdb7y4 February 9, 2017 Corbyn ejected claims that the resignation of Clive Lewis showed that Brexit was a “disaster” for Labour. When this was put to him, he replied: \nNo, it’s not a disaster. Look, the majority of Labour MPs voted to trigger article 50. Fifty-odd voted against it, mainly on the basis of their strong message from their own constituents. My argument is, it was a national vote, it was a national referendum, and parliament has to respect that. \nOn all the other votes there is unity. On all the other campaigning points there is unity. He defended the tweet he posted last night saying the “real fight” on Brexit starts now. When it was put to him that Labour should have started fighting on this issue earlier, he said that most Labour MPs had campaigned for yes. He said Theresa May had been forced to give parliament a vote on the final deal. And he rejected the claim that, by backing the article 50 bill last night, Labour was agreeing to everything May wanted to do. \nNo, we have not agreed with everything. Do you not understand? This was a one-clause bill, a one-clause bill that authorised the government to start negotiations, and recognised the result of the referendum ... \nThe government does not have a blank cheque to set up an offshore tax haven in Britain. All that it has is authority to proceed with negotiations, which is what the referendum was about. \nHere is Corbyn’s tweet. Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) Real fight starts now. Over next two years Labour will use every opportunity to ensure Brexit protects jobs, living standards & the economy. \nAnd here is our story about the reaction it has provoked.

They will vote at 5pm. \nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter.
