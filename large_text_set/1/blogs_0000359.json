He's mature as a coach now and I'm truly happy for him.” \nAnd Ancelotti compared Conte's flying start in England to the success legendary player Zinedine Zidane is enjoying at Real Madrid in his first taste of senior management. \nHe said: \"[Zinedine] Zidane has won the Club World Cup after winning the Champions League [with Real Madrid], and there were people who thought he was not a coach. \n“The truth is Conte and Zidane had quality on the field and they've taken that into their new jobs with them.\" Ancelotti (second right) won Chelsea the Double but they fired him just a year later (Photo: Action Images) Read More \nChelsea could hardly have a tougher test to pass to equal Arsenal's record in the shape of in-form Spurs. \nThe rivalry between the two clubs has cranked up a notch over the last couple of seasons. \nSpurs hammered Chelsea 5-3 on New Year's Day two years ago in a famous win for the north Londoners, but Chelsea gained some revenge by beating Spurs in the League Cup final that season. \nAnd they hammered the final nail in Tottenham's title coffin last term by fighting back from a 2-0 down to hold Spurs to a dramatic, ill-tempered 2-2 draw and hand Leicester the league. \nDespite the animosity and their history bid defender Gary Cahill insists it is business as usual for the Blues.

We've just kept going. \n\"Being aware of the record and wanting to achieve them, there's nothing wrong with that. Every player wants to be a part of records - I'm not shy about saying that - but it's not something we speak about.” poll loading Will Chelsea beat Tottenham to make it 14 wins in a row? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T20:02:21.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
