And any way you slice it, a grown man complaining about another man getting more positive attention than him is just embarrassing. \nWemple’s kvetching is not over anything important, like his kids or wife are sick. Or that someone in his own family is getting into a dog shit of a fight with a neighbor. \nInstead, Wemple is all bent out of shape about a profile that The Atlantic ‘s McKay Coppins wrote a profile on Fox News anchor and The Daily Caller founder Tucker Carlson , whose show is enjoying masterful ratings since he replaced Megyn Kelly . [RELATED: Wemple Can’t Even Get A Word In As Tidal Wave Tucker Washes Him Out To Sea] \n( Full disclosure: Yes, Carlson hired me. I’m biased in who I like better here. But I also speak the truth. ) \nCome on, Wemple, admit it. You’re still wah wahing about your recent appearance on Carlson’s program, in which you sat their bug-eyed as you failed to defend your own crappy brand of journalism. As Carlson presented the hard truth about your hypocritical reporting, the angrier you became, the louder your doughy, thuggish voice grew. I particularly enjoyed your most infuriated moments, when you addressed Carlson as “ Mister Carlson.” You also took the opportunity to praise yourself, saying you’d hold your own reporting and ability to write about The Washington Post against anyone’s reporting in the entire media industry. \nWow, Wemple. Even for you, that was pretty disgusting and not even true.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:24:45.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
