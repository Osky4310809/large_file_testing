It’s the fashion. \n“For pundits, he’s the best midfielder in the world. Oh! He’s very good, but I played against him three weeks ago, and that’s not the case. \n“He’s a fantastic destroyer in a phenomenal team, but not a creator.” Barton has rubbished suggestions Kante is the world's best (Photo: Mark Robinson) Kante looks set to win back-to-back league titles (Photo: REUTERS) \nIt was Chelsea legend Frank Lampard who labelled Kante the best in the world after his FA Cup quarter-final winner against Manchester United two weeks ago. \nHe said: “I'd go as far to say that he's the best central midfield player in the world.\" \nAnd Chelsea winger Eden Hazard claimed Kante’s work-rate is so high it is like playing with twins. \nKante, a £30million capture for Chelsea last summer, has been a key figure in helping Antonio Conte’s side to a commanding advantage in the title race. \nBut Barton believes it will only be once the Frenchman plays in the Champions League next that he can be correctly assessed in relation to other superstars in his position around the world. \nBarton has made 13 appearances for Burnley this season, scoring once and picking up six yellow cards.
