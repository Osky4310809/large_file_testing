I have done it for 20 years. \n“Every day I see the effects of your government cuts on the services that we so desperately want to deliver for our older persons. \n“Hospitals should be able to admit older persons straight away and welcome them. Not have them waiting for 14 hours on trolleys.” This audience member works in the NHS and says that, having witnessed the impact of cuts, the government just 'doesn't get it' #bbcqt pic.twitter.com/Y0weyxOt2x — BBC Question Time (@bbcquestiontime) March 9, 2017 \nHe continued: “And when it’s time for them to be discharged from hospital, we should be able to do that safely. \n“Your government doesn’t get it. Elderly people, care of the elderly, need more resources.” \nHis comments received a loud applause from his fellow audience members in Sunderland, where the show was being filmed this week. \nMany viewers watching the programme from home also felt passionately about the NHS, blaming underfunding and staff shortages for its failings. You won't get a better system than the NHS. The UK Govt just needs to fund it properly. But Tories never do, and never will. #bbcqt — Thomas Hemingford (@THemingford) March 9, 2017 Nothing is working because the NHS is underfunded, under resourced and under manned #bbcqt — Sara Mason (@piglet2602) March 9, 2017 'Investing in social care actually saves our NHS money' - @kezdugdale bang on the money on the social care crisis #BBCQT — Kieron Higgins (@HigginsKieron) March 9, 2017 A means tested #NHS will be the end of the NHS & create a two-tier system. Those who need the free version will have worse care. #bbcqt — Ross S Purves (@RossSPurves) March 9, 2017 \nBradley responded to the accusation, saying: “I don’t think that anybody in the government has said we don’t need to address this problem, that’s why the money was put in in the budget. \n“We do need to make sure that we get this right.” \nBradley said it was “not just about money”, adding that it was also down to how local authorities manage funding. \nBut host David Dimbleby made the point that councils all had their budgets slashed 40% by the government.
