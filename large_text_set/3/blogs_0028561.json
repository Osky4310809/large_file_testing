Murray was in the stands when 11-seed Xavier pulled out a win over the 2-seed University of Arizona. Murray's son, Luke, is an assistant coach of the Xavier Musketeers.

(Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSAN JOSE —There’s no telling what Bill Murray will be wearing when the actor shows up to watch 11th-seeded Xavier play top-seeded Gonzaga on Saturday. But it’s hard to imagine anything that could rival his outfit from from 15 years ago as remembered by Murray’s son Luke, a Xavier assistant. \nBill Murray used to show up for his son’s basketball games wearing Ugg boots, purple shorts and a fur vest. \n“I like to think I have a lot better fashion sense,’’ Luke Murray, 31, told USA TODAY Sports on Friday. \nRespectably clad in a beige fisherman’s vest and a pale blue baseball cap, Bill Murray created a stir Thursday night at the SAP Center when he was spotted in Xavier’s raucous cheering section. When a reporter told Luke Murray that he’d sat near Bill Murray during the frenzied game, Luke grinned and said, “Oh, I apologize.’’ \nWhen told Bill Murray was repeatedly on his feet throughout the game, Luke grinned again and said, “Oh, I’m sure he was.’’ \nA day later, Murray said it was a thrill to have his father on hand for the game — and no surprise to learn on the day of the game that his father was actually coming. \n“That’s just kind of how he operates,’’ Murray said before Xavier’s practice Friday. \nIf Xavier fans were hoping to get in Luke Murray a carbon copy of his father, they’re out of luck. Luke Murray said he doesn’t have a favorite joke, and there’s no mystery about whether he’s as funny as his father is. \n“I think that’s pretty clear early on,’’ Luke Murray said with a sheepish grin. “We’re different people, and I think he probably likes it that way.’’ \nBut Luke Murray did something almost brazen as showing up to a basketball game in Ugg boots, purple shorts and a fur vest. \nAs a freshman in Fairfield (Conn.) University, he took over as coach of a local AAU basketball team. Some college kids were pledging the fraternities, and there Murray was running players through the three-man weave. \nMurray grew up in New York City and played high school basketball. But when he realized he wasn’t good enough to play big-time Division I basketball, he set out to make it as a coach. \nHe’d been scouting players since he was 14, quite possibly to his father’s chagrin, he said. \n“I think he thought it was a strange hobby to have when i was a kid,’’ said Murray, in his second year at Xavier, following stops at Rhode Island, Towson and Wagner. “But now he sees how far it’s come, and he’s really proud of it.” \nYes, on Thursday night there was Bill Murray — wearing a prominent X pendant and no fur vest — cheering madly as Luke Murray and Xavier’s coaches and players spilled onto the court Thursday night after Xavier had beaten Arizona, 73-71. \nLuke smiled when asked if he and his father have talked about his career aspirations. \n“You know, we don’t really have those traditional father-son conversations that it seems that a lot of people do,’’ he said. “It just wasn’t part of my upbringing. But I do think there was probably a time where he made a change in mentality as far as what I was doing. \n“As I’ve kind of grown and climbed the ladder in college basketball, so to speak, I think he has a greater appreciation for it. And at this point, he’s as big a supporter as anyone.’’ \nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SWEET 16 Facebook   North Carolina forward Isaiah Hicks (4) celebrates a basket during the second half against Butler in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament at FedExForum in Memphis.
