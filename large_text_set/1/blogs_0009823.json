The 33-year-old thespian also won the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy. \nThe freshman show, slated to return for a second season , beat out veteran series Transparent, Black-ish, Veep and Mozart in the Jungle. \nDuring his acceptance speech, the Georgia-born artist gave a gracious thanks to Migos for nothing more than giving the world “Bad and Boujee.” \n“I’d like to thank the Migos — not for being on the show, but for making ‘ Bad and Boujee .’ Like, that’s the best song … ever,” he said. Quavo acknowledged the gratitude and tweeted a clip of Childish Gambino’s acceptance speech praising them for the song. \n— QuavoYRN (@QuavoStuntin) January 9, 2017 \nThe series has been an award-winning and nominated beast so far. Atlanta won the award for Top 10 Television Programs at the AFI in December and is also nominated for four NAACP Image Awards , a People’s Choice Award nod for Favorite Cable TV Comedy as well as nominations for the Producers Guild of America Awards and Writers Guild of America Awards. \nThe show, created by Glover himself, has gotten mad praise since its debut , garnering a Metacritic score of 91 the morning after it aired. \n“African Americans have more options for quality television unseen since the late ’80s/early ’90s and one can place ‘Atlanta’ within the same pot as upper echelon shows Power , Black-ish , Insecure , The Get Down and Queen Sugar ,” HipHopDX’s Senior Features Editor Ural Garrett upon seeing a preview. “The contrast of overtly hilarious and super serious moments were in abundance from what was shown.” \nWatch Donald Glover’s Golden Globe award acceptance speech above.
