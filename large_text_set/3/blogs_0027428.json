It includes a boost for the Canadian Space Agency, to the tune of $80.9 million, on a cash basis, over five years.\nPlans include “quantum technology” and “Mars surface observation,” with Canada aiming to NASA’s next Mars Orbiter Mission. An additional $10 million will fund the Institute for Quantum Computing for two more years, which provides the opportunity for many more memes of the prime minister standing in front of a chalkboard.\nNathan Denette/The Canadian Press/File Justin Trudeau at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, where he learned about quantum computing. Marijuana surveillance \nAs the government prepares to legalize weed, it proposes $9.6 million over five years, and $1 million every year thereafter, for “public education programming and surveillance activities.” The suggestion of “surveillance” without any explanation seems a little dubious. Finance Canada, swamped with media requests Thursday, didn’t get back to us on that one.\nWhatever spying takes place, it is presumably all in the name of keeping dope away from kids and profits out of the “pockets of organized crime.” We can’t verify whether your local mob prefers pockets over other money-hoarding methods, such as the soon-to-be-defunct Canada Savings Bonds.\nDarryl Dyck/The Canadian Press Watch out, kid. The government might be watching. Childcare today, gone tomorrow? \nLiberals were congratulating themselves in the House of Commons Thursday for bringing in billions worth of childcare benefits. But the significant $7 billion in spending, divided up over 10 years, will only start in 2018, with a majority coming after the next federal election. Tom Mulcair’s New Democrats, who’ve long advocated for better childcare services, decry the delay and say the 40,000 possible new spaces are slight in comparison to the 800,000 needed.\nAnother measure sure to impact many prospective parents: same-sex couples and individuals who want to have kids are now eligible for tax credits for fertility services (as the budget puts it, “reproductive technologies”).\nGetty Images They won't be smiling when they realize the money won't be coming for years. Sweet Haitian threads \nTucked at the back of the foreign policy drawer are cuts to origin rules that’ll cost the government $17 million in foregone tariff revenues over five years. “More apparel products” imported from the least-developed countries will be imported duty-free, and “particularly from Haiti,” the budget document says.\nWe weren’t able to iron out whether we’re talking fedoras, jeans or what. Maybe it’s an opportunity for Conservative MP Scott Reid to obtain some chaps, which we learned during a lengthy filibuster this week are an item missing from his Victorian-era steampunk outfit.\nSean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press MP Scott Reid explaining what chaps are in the House of Commons? Services in the slammer \nCanada’s prison population will benefit from $57.8 million over five years, and $13.6 million a year thereafter, for mental health services. Per the John Howard Society of Canada, treating rather than punishing the mentally ill is one of five key pillars to fixing the corrections system, and according to Correctional Service Canada, “promotion of mental health stability may contribute to increased public safety.”\nGarnering praise Thursday from the Canadian Psychological Association, almost $6 billion in this budget is tied to mental health, including $5 billion over 10 years for general mental health initiatives and $828.2 million over five years for First Nations and Inuit “medical and mental health care.”\nGetty Images Treating rather than punishing the mentally ill is one of five key pillars to fixing the corrections system. Coding lessons for kids \nCalling all young hackers! Get ready to benefit from federal government-funded “coding and digital skills” workshops. With $50 million in funding over two years, after a competitive process, “digital skills training organizations” will bring the likes of C++ and Python and Java into classrooms.\nWe’ll bet nothing sounds more exciting right now to Canada’s youth, post-March Break. More like March Break-that-encryption, am I right, kids?\nGetty Images Digital skills training today, Anonymous tomorrow. Learning about plants \nNew money should put new life into a research centre operated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. With $80 million on a cash basis, over five years, Liberals plan to lay roots for a “new, world class plant health research facility” in Sidney, B.C.\nThe centre is in Green Party leader Elizabeth May’s Vancouver Island riding, and she says the news leaves her “very glad.” With agri-food safety advocates, we suspect the government is also barking up the right tree.\nJustin Tang/The Canadian Press Of course the Green Party leader is happy about plant health research. Taxing taxi taxes \nThe Liberals plan to tax commercial ride-sharing services the same way they do taxis by subjecting them to GST and HST. Uber’s Canada manager, Ian Black, fired back in a statement Thursday calling this a “tax on innovation” that would hurt one million Canadians. “We should be supporting policies that make sustainable transportation more affordable, not more expensive,” Black said.\nConservative leader Rona Ambrose suggested this is all because Justin Trudeau wants your nights out to be more expensive, from the cents added to the cost of alcohol (a two-per-cent increase on duty excise tax) to the elimination of a tax credit for transit passes.\nRelated Andrew Coyne on federal budget 2017: No money, no ideas, but a wealth of bafflegab and buzzwords from the Liberals Liberals hope to get Canada ready for the future with budget for ‘everyday folks’ — and $28.6B deficit Federal budget 2017: The full document and the finance minister’s speech to Parliament A non-tax hike \nWhile the Tories complain about tax hikes, Liberals are hoping to sway you with other hikes. Who’s ready for a 24,000-km trek across the Great White North? It’ll cost $30 million over five years for Parks Canada to oversee the completion, enhancement and maintenance of the Trans Canada Trail, this year’s budget says. The network of trails takes you from west to east and through every provincial capital.\nWe checked, and to walk the most direct route from Vancouver, B.C. to Glace Bay, on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, it’d take you 53-and-a-half days of straight walking.
