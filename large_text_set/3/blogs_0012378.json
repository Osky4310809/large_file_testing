Us black people every time Bow Wow says something pic.twitter.com/M6X4Hw2sxb \n— Trinity Travis (@TrinityTravis2k) March 15, 2017 Some Trump supporters feel there is “no feminist outrage” over Bow Wow’s comment solely because it targets Melania. Of course there's no feminist outrage over Bow Wow's misogynistic comments about Melania. Because feminism is about politics, not women. \n— Brittany Pettibone (@BrittPettibone) March 15, 2017 It seems there is outrage though, and it’s coming from all sides, not just Trump supporters. Bow Wow temporarily created a cease-fire between the Right and Left while everyone agreed to call him an idiot in tandem. What a hero. \n— Your Local Jacob (@YourLocalJacob) March 15, 2017 His comments triggered his critics to even attack his personal life, but he kinda asked for it. In Bow Wow's defense, since every woman in his life has been pimped out including his own mom, naturally he thinks that's all a woman is for https://t.co/2oPQMhZOI4 \n— Cristina Laila (@cristinalaila1) March 15, 2017 People are even calling for the Secret Service to investigate Bow Wow for his comments about Melania. Bow Wow must be investigated by @SecretService for his threat to the First Lady just like any other threat made on the president's family \n— Jack Posobiec (@JackPosobiec) March 15, 2017 We’ll just have to see where this goes, folks. But all this does is further prove one FACT (it’s so true). Anytime Bow Wow trends I know something ain't right. \n— Erica Rocker (@EBizzy4) March 15, 2017 Neither Snoop Dogg nor President Trump have commented on Bow Wow’s “pimp your wife” threat. Snoop did post this video though. \nSomething tells me he is anything but sorry! \nOh, and Bow Wow, as Hillary would say, “delete your account.” Social Media Expert Breaks Down Trump's Twitter   \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
