The headset is going to utilize inside out tracking, which is a much more accurate solution for tracking — not to mention it’s easier to use, which will make it simpler to set up as well. Right now it can be difficult to set up things like the HTC Vive, especially if you don’t have the space to set up the sensors all around your living room.\nThe headset doesn’t yet have an official name for us to call it by, but it will feature all of these impressive specs and ships later this year for about $300 to $400, which is pretty affordable in comparison to the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. If you’ve been waiting for a lower-cost solution for exploring virtual reality on your PC, this might well be your ticket. Even if you’ve got one of the other headsets you might be interested in this one too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T13:53:35.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
