They plead guilty to the amended charge. \nDuring the proceedings before the sentence was pronounced, Counsel to the accused, Miss Y.A. Ajayi, while appealing for leniency, recalled that the men had been in custody since 2011. \n“My Lord, the defendants have been in prison custody since Dec. 2011 which is over five years ago, the items that were stolen were recovered and returned to the owner. Please temper justice with mercy,” she said. \nNewsmen also reports that during the trial, the state prosecutor, Mrs O.A. Olugasa told the court that Taiye and Babalola of No. 14, Etu-epo St., Abule Egba, Lagos, committed the offence on Nov. 13, 2011 at 8.00 p.m. along WAEC Road, Yaba, Lagos. \n“The defendants while on a commercial motorcycle robbed Miss Funmi Dayo of her handbag which contained undisclosed sums of money, a mobile phone and other personal effects. \n“The woman raised an alarm which led to the arrest of Taiye. He was about to be lynched by a mob but was saved by some policemen from Sabo Police Station. \n“He led the police to fish out Babalola, his accomplice,” she said.
