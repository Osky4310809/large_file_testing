It goes back originally to the Emperor Niro. More recent history: \nAdolf Hitler was allegedly an Ibsen fan. (Some historians say they believe that he read the plays as prophecy of the Third Reich.) He reportedly read “An Enemy of the People” closely, even weaving some key lines into speeches. His administration deployed this rhetoric to describe Hitler’s main enemy: the Jews. “Each Jew is a sworn enemy of the German people,” Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels wrote in 1941. “… If someone wears the Jewish star, he is an enemy of the people. Anyone who deals with him is the same as a Jew and must be treated accordingly. He earns the contempt of the entire people, for he is a craven coward who leaves them in the lurch to stand by the enemy.” \nAround the same time, leaders of the Soviet Union were transforming enemy of the people into a major tool for oppression and silencing enemies. Vladimir Lenin, founder of the Bolsheviks, used “the peoples’ enemies” as a label to stigmatize anyone who didn’t fall into line when the revolution happened. Enemies of the people were ostracized and even their friends were under suspicion. \nFor foes of Joseph Stalin, being branded an enemy of the people was a death sentence. The Soviet leader deployed that language against politicians and artists he didn’t like. Once branded, the accused were sent to labor camps or killed. Best case? An enemy would be denied education and employment. “It is one of the most controversial phrases in Soviet history,” Mitchell Orenstein, professor of Russian and East European studies at the University of Pennsylvania, told Voice of America… \nChinese dictator Mao Zedong deployed the phrase against people critical of his policies and dictates. The leader, who created a famine that killed 36 million Chinese, was obsessed with identifying and rooting out his enemies… \nToday, enemy of the people is still deployed. But mostly, you hear it from dictators. \nSo Trump’s in some pretty awful company. And let’s not forget that this is just the latest salvo in a nearly half-century effort by the right to make Americans distrust the media that has been wildly successful. They have essentially inoculated about a third of the population against anything the media reports. Anything negative whatsoever about any conservative figure or any reporting that doesn’t fit the right-wing narrative is simply dismissed out of hand as “biased.” \nThis is how autocrats work. It’s also how cults work. The first thing any cult teaches is not to trust anyone who isn’t in the cult. Everyone else is lying, out to destroy the tribe. And then there’s the added element that Trump, like Lenin and Stalin and Hitler, is replacing “the people” with himself. An attack on him is an attack on “the people.” It’s an old script, and a dangerous one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:27:08.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
