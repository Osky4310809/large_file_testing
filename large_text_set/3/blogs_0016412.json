When before representatives of the zoo came to visit us in the Studio a month ago and filed a Claim ‚Äì we took it as a joke. The Claim stated that: \"removing raccoon in the video we did harm populations of raccoons\". We believe that this situation is absurd, worthy of a Hollywood script, a Comedy. Please consider this the official position of our Studio.\nIf we fail to resolve the conflict with a petting zoo amicable agreement ‚Äì we intend to submit to the court a counter-suit. In it we will claim compensation of our bra of the actress, who gnawed raccoon on the set. Our Studio had to compensate him the cost of shooting the girl in excess of the fee for filming in promotional video.\nValeriy Bogatov,\nHead of video distribution Studio of video ART-MSK\"\nLast Thursday, Art-msk shared the following behind-the-scenes video of the shoot on their YouTube channel, which shows the actress trying to wrestle her bra from the raccoon.\nIt's worth noting at this point that this whole situation could be nothing more than a cleverly-manufactured marketing stunt.\nOn the one hand the zoo has shared official-looking documentation and a video that appears to show animal rights' activists, and the statement from the agency appears to be genuine.\nBut on the other hand, the exact nature of the advert remains unclear, and both the zoo and the agency are clearly benefitting from the now-global publicity surrounding the story.\nThe video above proves that a raccoon did indeed take part in some sort of film shoot with a semi-naked model ‚Äî but the exact nature of the shoot, and its purpose, remains something of a mystery.\nWATCH: The story behind the viral Polish Christmas ad that stole our hearts", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BRnJYl_h9cL/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39290208", "http://www.art-msk.ru/news/342-3-go-avgusta-studiia-videoreclamy-art-msk-provela-semku-novogo-reclamnogo-rolika", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRnJYl_h9cL/?taken-by=teatrzoo", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRnX2lihU-9/", "http://www.art-msk.ru/news/359-the-official-statement-from-studio-video-art-msk-according-to-recent-media-information-filed-against-us-lawsuit", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/r6HQjsgg.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/OvjpMd-3uqJEdpI3jO2BidiX1N0=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419752%2Fe8befd40-6413-465d-891e-cc80710f3762.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/r6HQjsgg.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/y5WXut6eusQtp75X7JFseHgsLzA=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419752%2Fe8befd40-6413-465d-891e-cc80710f3762.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRnnTXYBeIX/"], "published": "2017-03-21T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:57:25.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
