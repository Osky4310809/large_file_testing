AFP \nLONDON, United Kingdom — Queen Elizabeth II missed a New Year’s Day church service on Sunday because of a lingering “heavy cold” that also forced her to stay at home on Christmas Day, Buckingham Palace said. \nThe 90-year-old, the world’s longest reigning monarch, is however continuing to receive her red boxes containing official papers and is up and about, a royal source said. \nThe queen as usual spent Christmas at her private Sandringham estate in Norfolk, eastern England, with members of her family. ADVERTISEMENT \nREAD: Queen Elizabeth II misses church due to ‘heavy cold’ \nThe royals normally attend church services at the local St Mary Magdalene church but the queen, who is the supreme governor of the Church of England, missed the Christmas Day ceremony. \nAhead of Sunday’s service, the palace said in a statement: “Her Majesty The Queen will not attend Sunday worship at Sandringham today. \n“The queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold.” \n“The queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold.” \nThe monarch’s 95-year-old husband Prince Philip had also been suffering from a cold and the royal couple’s journey to Sandringham was delayed by a day because of their illness. \nWhen she failed to appear on Christmas Day, speculation grew about the queen’s health, and a fake report on Twitter that she died prompted news stories in some of the tabloid newspapers. \nPhilip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was well enough to attend church both on Christmas Day and on Sunday, when he arrived in a car in pouring rain. \nAmong the royals attending on Sunday were two of their children, Prince Edward and Princess Anne. \nWhen asked about her mother’s health, Anne said she was “better”, according to the Daily Mirror.
