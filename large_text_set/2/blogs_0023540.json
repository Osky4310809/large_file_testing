By: FE Online | Updated: February 23, 2017 6:41 PM Interestingly, BJP has declared party’s win on 81 seats while appealing to 4 other corporators to lend support to the party. \nBharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) leader Shaina NC on Thursday claimed that the mayor will be chosen from their party. Speaking to Times Now she said, ” BJP has the support of 4 independent corporators and the mayor will be from the party”. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Elections 2017 results are out and there is no clear majority for either Shiv Sena or BJP. While Shiv Sena won 84 seats, BJP 81 seats to its name. \nDevendra Fadnavis addressed a press conference hailing the party’s performance. The BJP made decisive gains in civic polls in Maharashtra retaining power in at least six civic bodies — Pune, Nashik, Ulhasnagar, Akola, Nagpur and Amravati — out of the 10 corporations for which the elections were held on Tuesday. \nCongress was relegated to the third position in the civic body tally with 31 seats followed by NCP with 9 seats. MNS won 7 seats, AIMIM-3, SP-6, Akhil Bhartiya Sena-1 and others-4. The Congress Party has suffered a major setback as the grand old party was only able to win 31 seats in BMC. \nThere was a lot at stake for both Shiv Sena and the BJP, two saffron allies for over 20 years, who have been going through a fallout. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had openly criticised the BJP government in the state under Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s demonetisation scheme. \nYou may also like to watch: \nFor the most part of the day, it looked as if the Shiv Sena would run away with an absolute majority for more time but BJP changed gears towards the end of the day and raced to 82 seats. Although, since none of the parties gained the required 114 seats to reach an absolute majority, the picture still remains unclear as to who will take over the reigns of the richest Municipal corporation in the world.
