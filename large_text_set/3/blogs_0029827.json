Stick with them for now. Back them in. \nRookies is where our focus needs to lie as we head into Round 2. Let’s nail them. \nDEFENDERS \nOUR defensive rookies were rubbish . Absolute rubbish. \nTom Stewart (Geelong, $117,300) was the most prolific of the sub-$200,000 options — and all he could manage was 57 SuperCoach points. \nJoel Smith (Melbourne, $117,300, 23SC) looked sharp before he stuffed his shoulder late in the first quarter. He’s cooked. Hold him on your bench for now until we learn more about some replacement options. \nPopular options Curtly Hampton (Adelaide. $160,000 50SC) , Mitch Hibberd (North Melbourne, $123,900, 23SC) and Andy Otten (Adelaide, $123,900, 45SC) all staggered around the joint like drunks. One or two of these lads will be under pressure at the selection table. \nIt was the slightly more expensive trio of Caleb Marchbank (Carlton, $236,100, 97SC) , Andy McGrath (Essendon, $211,800, 83SC) and Harry Marsh (Sydney, $238,700, 79SC) who delivered. Carlton’s Caleb Marchbank had a league-high 13 intercept possessions in Round 2. Source: AAP \nHold your nerve. Watch them this week. \nConsider bringing in McGrath or Marchbank this week only if you’re desperate for a warm body on the park. \nRemember, we have the luxury of watching all players for another week before the first SuperCoach price rise kicks in. \nMIDFIELDERS \nNOT quite a rookie, but David Swallow (Gold Coast, $280,200) was a late withdrawal on Saturday, which left plenty of us a little brown in the SuperCoach pant. He faces a fitness test this week, so watch this space and have a replacement ready. \nIf you don’t have Sam Powell-Pepper (Port Adelaide, $135,300, 78SC) , I’d like you to stop reading this article to spend a few minutes reassessing your priorities. I’m always here to help you when you’ve decided to make a fair dinkum crack at this SuperCoach caper. Lock the young bull in. \nA surprise selection for Carlton after an injury-interrupted pre-season, Sam Petrevski-Seton (Carlton, $189,300, 59SC) looks a real find. Eight of his 11 possessions were contested and he racked up seven tackles. Carlton rates him and so do I — he was better than his 59 SuperCoach points suggest. Watch. \nLISTEN TO THE LATEST FOX FOOTY PODCAST BELOW, OR TAP HERE TO SUBSCRIBE IN ITUNES \nBrisbane will persist with Jake Barrett (Brisbane, $127,900, 46SC) . He didn’t set the world on fire with his 11 touches but remains a valid selection. Hold him if you have him, but consider snaffling him after Round 2 if you don’t and he performs against Essendon on Saturday. Watch him lift this weekend. \nDemon Alex Neal-Bullen (Melbourne, $264,400, 90SC) was involved in 10 scoring forays and impressed me. Of his 23 disposals, 16 were kicks, which bodes well for his SuperCoach future, as does his tackling ability. Watch. Could be an option if you’ve had a gutful of David Swallow. \nFORWARDS \nIF you’re one of the 80 per cent of SuperCoach owners that don’t have Dan Houston (Port Adelaide, $117,300, 72SC) , I’d wait another week before you stuff the kid into your squad. He looked good down back, but it was a wet old day, so have another look at the kid on Sunday afternoon. Remember, Jasper Pittard will also want his job back when he returns from injury in a few weeks. \nDan Butler (Richmond, $123,900, 96SC) delivered SuperCoach silver service — thank you, try the veal — with two goals and 19 possessions in his debut against Carlton on Thursday night, buying himself at least another handful of games. Consider. \nYoung Mitch Hannan (Melbourne, $117,300 96SC) was the surprise packet. He pumped the pill inside 50 five times and had 16 disposals at 82 per cent efficiency. He should be front and square on your selection radar over the next week. \nJy Simpkin (North Melbourne, $162,200, 35SC) , Oliver Florent (Sydney, $166,800, 44SC) and Jack Bowes (Gold Coast $171,300 64SC) didn’t look much chop. Leave them alone for now unless they pull their finger out this week. Giant Tim Taranto had a quiet debut game. Source: AAP \nThose who backed in young Tim Taranto (GWS, $207,300 44SC) should start making plans to move him on. Another performance like this and he’ll be on the selection chopping block. \nWith our wealth of cheaper forward rookies, a smart play might be to downgrade Taranto to a cheaper option, using that spare cash to upgrade an underperforming rookie on another line. \nIf you’re not keen on that idea, consider Will Hoskin-Elliott (Collingwood, $213,300, 88SC) as his replacement after this weekend. His job security at the Pies is rock-solid and I was impressed with most of his 22 distributions of the Sherrin. \nOthers to consider pending form this weekend include Ben Ainsworth (Gold Coast, $198,300, 79SC) and Troy Menzel (Adelaide, $183,900, 81SC) . \nBe patient with both Brett Eddy (Port Adelaide, $102,400, 30SC) and Jarrod Pickett (Carlton, $123,900, 28SC) . As a young small forward, Pickett will always have his ups and down, while the wet conditions in Sydney weren’t Eddy’s cup of tea. \nBEST of luck in week two of the SuperCoach season, community. Remain calm, resist the urge to pull the trade trigger if you can and, above else, enjoy yourself. \nCatch up with you Thursday before teams drop for the live chat here at foxfooty.com.au .
