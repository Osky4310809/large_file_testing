If you’re trying to pare down, but can’t quite say goodbye to some things you know you don’t need, a “limbo box” can help. \nIn this video from the Clean My Space YouTube channel , Melissa Maker shares four of her favorite decluttering tips, including a way to ease the pain of letting go. Take the items you’re attached to and place them in a box, then hide them away as if you’re getting rid of them.
