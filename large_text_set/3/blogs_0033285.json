This means that cities and local government would not be able to pass their own rules for another three years. \n\"l support the House Bill 2 repeal compromise that will be introduced tomorrow,\" Gov. Cooper said publicly. \"It's not a perfect deal, but it repeals House Bill 2 and begins to repair our reputation.\" \nBut LGBT advocacy groups are saying they were not consulted on the bill and that it doesn't allow any local government entities to pass their own anti-discrimination laws. \n\"This is no repeal. This is HB2.0 and is perhaps more insidious in its targeting of LGBTQ — and particularly of trans and gender non-conforming — people,\" Chase Strangio , staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote on Thursday. \"It is a backroom deal that shows no input from the community, that shows no leadership from lawmakers, that shows a callous disregard for the basic humanity of the trans and gender non-conforming people that call North Carolina home.\" \nEssentially, the bill simultaneously repeals HB2 while also introducing new legislation that prohibits cities and local governments from passing anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people in 2020. It also continues to prevent transgender people from using the bathroom of their choice for the foreseeable future. \nSo far, it appears LGBT advocates are not falling for the bait and switch. Do not be fooled by HB2.0. There is no repeal only the further and insidious targeting of trans people & lives. #RepealHB2 #nofakerepeal pic.twitter.com/UhKJM84Tfe", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T11:52:34.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
