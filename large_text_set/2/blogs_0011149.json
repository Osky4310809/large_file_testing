But with one Arrow plotline, it's starting to sound like fans need to expect the unexpected. \nArrow executive producer Marc Guggenheim hinted that the relationship between Oliver Queen ( Stephen Amell ) and Susan Williams (Carly Pope) will play out in an unpredictable way. Oliver and Susan are now officially in a romantic relationship, even sleeping together at the end of last week's episode, ' Bratva '. Oliver even actively made a point to defend Susan from Thea Queen's (Willa Holland) teasing. \nBut Susan appears to be secretly uncovering some sort of news story about Oliver's ties to the Bratva - and possibly revealing his identity as the Green Arrow to the public. \n\"I'll just say, based upon what little [fan theories I've seen] ...I try to avoid online, but it's online, so it's impossible to completely avoid stuff. I t seems like the general prevailing theories about how we're going to play that subplot off are wrong.\" Guggenheim explained to ComicBook.com. \"That's kind of my impression. Everyone's expecting something we're not doing, for better or for worse.\" \nThose fan theories about Susan's alliances range from her directly being involved with the Bratva, to her being related to or aligning with the season's big bad, Prometheus. At this point, it's unclear which of those theories Guggenheim is referring to, or if elements of them will still appear on the show in some way. \nIt appears that fans that are curious about Susan Williams - and how exactly any revelations of her will impact her relationship with Oliver - will just have to wait and see. \nWILD DOG’S HISTORY IS REVEALED — A traumatic attack on City Hall triggers painful memories for Rene (Rick Gonzalez) about his family. Flashbacks reveal how Rene went from simple family man to a hero named Wild Dog. \nMeanwhile, Oliver ( Stephen Amell ) must deal with the perpetrator behind the attack and realizes the best way to do so is as Mayor Queen instead of the Green Arrow. Tensions run high in the Arrow bunker. \nKristin Windell directed the episode written by Marc Guggenheim.
