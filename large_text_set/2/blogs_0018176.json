Shares \nBlizzard has given us our first tease of the upcoming 24th Overwatch hero: a blog post spotlighting Efi Oladele, an 11-year-old robotics prodigy from Numbani and the recipient of \"the Adawe Foundation's prestigious 'genius grant.'\" \nThe blog post is an in-universe Q&A with Oladele discussing her achievements in robotics and artificial intelligence. Similar blog posts were made before previous character announcements, such as during the Sombra ARG . \nThis information backs up a statement made by game director Jeff Kaplan that suggested the 24th Overwatch hero would not be Doomfist , as many people had speculated. It's unclear if Oladele herself will be the 24th hero, or if she simply has something to do with the upcoming character's lore and backstory. Looks like we'll find out in the coming days.
