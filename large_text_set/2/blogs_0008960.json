Here are our top picks” \nFor the past few months, we’ve witnessed some interesting budget smartphones being launched with a bunch of killer specifications for their price. That said, all that bragging about features and specifications is of no use if you can’t use them without worrying about the battery life. In comparison to the other hardware components inside a smartphone, the battery tech has largely been the same for quite a while. But, this hasn’t stopped the brands to stuff their smartphones with some massive batteries, resulting in an improved battery life for the smartphones. A combination of bigger batteries, power efficient processors, and better-optimised software has resulted in an exemplary battery performance in some smartphones. Today we look at five such smartphones, which come under the price tag of Rs 10,000. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Rs 9,999) \nLaunched in India recently, Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 4 ( review ) is probably the phone to beat in our list. Being a successor to the highly popular Redmi Note 3 ( review ), the device has some big shoes to fill. The 2GB RAM model of the smartphone comes with 32GB of internal memory, and is priced quite aggressively at Rs 9,999. For this price, you get a 5.5-inch full HD display, a Snapdragon 625 processor, and a premium looking metal unibody design along with a fingerprint scanner. For the shutterbugs, the smartphone comes with a 13MP rear CMOS camera, as well as a 5MP selfie shooter. In our review, we found the 4,100mAh battery of the Redmi Note 4 to be quite stellar. The handset lasted for about 17 hours in our video loop drain test, giving a clear idea how amazing the battery life is. The company is also selling a 3GB RAM variant of the smartphone with 32GB of internal storage at a price of Rs 10,999, as well as a 4GB RAM / 64GB storage variant at a price of Rs 12,999. Lenovo K6 Power (Rs 9,999) \nWith the K6 Power ( first impressions ), Lenovo has offered a powerful compact offering in the sub-Rs 10k segment. Additionally, as suggested by its “Power” moniker, the device bets big on battery life, with a massive 4,000mAh battery stacked inside its metal unibody design. You can even use the smartphone’s battery to charge other devices, just like a powerbank. The Lenovo K6 Power has got all one would wish for in a handset of its class… a fingerprint scanner, a 5-inch full HD display, an octa-core Snapdragon 430 SoC as well as 3GB of RAM. The 32GB internal storage can be expanded further via a microSD card. To top it off, Lenovo has also included a 13MP / 8MP camera combo on the device. Moto E3 Power (Rs 7,999) \nThe Moto E3 Power ( review ) is more or less the same as the regular Moto E3 smartphone, albeit featuring a bigger 3,500mAh battery and double the internal storage than the regular variant. The entry-level smartphone comes with a MediaTek MT6735P SoC clocked at 1GHz, coupled with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. Running a near stock version of Android Marshmallow, the Moto E3 Power gets an 8MP primary snapper along with a 5MP secondary camera. The device is also perfect for one hand usage, thanks to the smaller 5-inch 720p canvas. Motorola promises rapid charging for the Moto E3 Power, claiming up to 5 hours of usage on just 15 minutes of charging time. Xiaomi Redmi 3s (Rs 6,999) \nTalking about one-hand usage, the Xiaomi Redmi 3s ( review ) is also a perfect device in this aspect. It features a 5-inch 720p display encased in a premium metal design. Under the hood, the smartphone is powered by quad-core Snapdragon 430 processor, mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. The company has also unveiled the Redmi 3s Prime, which comes with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and even a fingerprint scanner at a price of Rs 8,999. But the strongest point in favour of the device is its massive 4,100mAh battery, which can easily last you about two days on regular usage. In our video loop test, the device lasted almost 14 hours before giving up, showing how good the battery really is. That said, such a big battery also takes a long time to go from zero to 100. ASUS ZenFone Max 2016 (~Rs 8,599) \nThe ASUS ZenFone Max 2016 which was launched in May last year, is still a great device, especially after receiving its share of price cuts. It sports a 5.5-inch HD display protected by Gorilla Glass. Other specifications of the device include a Snapdragon 617 SoC, 2GB of RAM and a 13MP / 5MP camera combo. The highlight of the device however, is its monstrous 5,000mAh battery that promises 37 hours of talktime. This means, it should easily last you two days on moderate usage. Another interesting point worth mentioning is that one can also use the ZenFone max as a powerbank to charge other devices via an USB OTG cable. \nThanks to the growing competition, you now have an ample amount of long lasting smartphones to choose from.
