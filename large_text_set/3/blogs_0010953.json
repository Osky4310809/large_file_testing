For all of us—Demi, Nick, it would be funny to do a spin on it. Do the graduating days, make it kinda dark. An adult film. Well, not an adult film. An R-rated film. We’ve joked around about the idea a couple times.” LOOK: Joe Jonas, Demi Lovato tease fans with ‘Camp Rock 3′ \nOn the other hand, the “Skyscraper” songstress exclusively told Entertainment Tonight that “Camp Rock 3″ is currently in the early stages of development. When asked by reporter Lauren Zima about the intriguing musical sequel, Lovato said, “Yes, and we’re totally gonna do it,” Lovato teased. “It’d be like ‘American Pie’ meets Disney Channel…It’s going to happen.” \nLast month, several fans grunted their thrill when Jonas, 27, posted a selfie with Lovato, 24, during the Roc Nation Pre-Grammy Brunch and captioned it with “CR3?” A young teen Lovato played the peppy character of Mitchie Torres in the first “Camp Rock” film, while Jonas played Shane Gray, the hunk singer of the summer campus. His real-life brothers Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas bagged roles in the film as his on-screen siblings. Even after the sequel “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,” Lovato and the Jonas brothers have maintained their bond, teaming up for global gigs in the past few years.
