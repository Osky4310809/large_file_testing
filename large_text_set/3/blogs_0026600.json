Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nListening to Gareth Southgate in Dortmund , it was impossible not to assume we saw two retirements in one night at the Signal Iduna Park stadium — the official one marked by a storybook goal and a farewell that could not have been fonder, and the unofficial one unfolding in a Cheshire living room. \nSouthgate is moving on without Wayne Rooney . \nThat much is now blindingly obvious. \nIt was clear from the moment the England boss hinted Rooney might have been fit for Manchester United’s game against Middlesbrough last Sunday (he wasn’t) yet still did not select him in the squad. \nIf Southgate thought Rooney might be fit to play at the Riverside then he surely thought he could be fit a week later, when England meet Lithuania at Wembley.

Of course not. \nNo drama, said Southgate, and it wasn’t. \nIt was just confirmation that the Rooney era was over. \nPost-game in Dortmund on Wednesday night, there was special praise for those playing in positions Rooney might expect to contend for, across the front three.

He did not say it… but in a way Wayne cannot. \nRooney, ill-advisedly, announced last summer he would be retiring from international football after World Cup 2018. \nIt looks like Southgate has done it for him well before time. \nRooney’s nature is such that he will no doubt strive to prove he can still win a 119th cap, wherever he ends up playing his club football next season. He has shown enough determination and bloody-mindedness in his career to suggest he might be able to meet this challenge. \nAnd don’t forget, in the absence of their record goal-scorer, England failed to score on Wednesday.
