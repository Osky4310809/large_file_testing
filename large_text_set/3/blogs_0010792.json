Our budget cycle is not normalized, we need to really prepare ahead. \n“We are yet to get any allocation from 2017 budget. Clearly, we are not going to have a budget for that election because we are conducting it in February 2019. We will not have a budget. \n“We have only next year to prepare for the poll. So, we should be partly looking at supplementary budget and 2018 budget to conduct the poll. We cannot be talking of the preparation for the poll without having a date in view. \n“We are already costing how much is required to conduct the elections. We shall soon be going to the National Assembly with the budget. \nAsked if political officers would not be distracted by the new timetable, he said: “INEC has nothing to do with distraction of governance. Instead, the timetable will enhance good governance and delivery of dividends of democracy. \n“Elected public officers should know the day of accountability is near, the day of judgment is now known. \n“We need to be taking steps to be maturing the electoral process. It is good for every stakeholder to prepare.” \nOn his part, the National Commissioner (in charge of South West), Solomon Soyebi, said the release of the timeline was to set a template in line with international best practices. \nHe said: “It is just an example of what we want the election year to look like; is just like a standard practice as the case in the United States, Ghana, Switzerland, Mexico and others. \n“We have decided to fix the date for the National Elections for the third Saturday in February of the election year, followed by State elections two weeks later. \n“It is not about this year, it is about all future elections in Nigeria. The same template will apply to 2023, 2027, 2031 and subsequent elections. It is a principle to hold the elections around 100 days to the end of term. \nOn the effect of the timetable on governance, Soyebi also added: “There is no politician that does not know his or her terminal days, it is a template we are institutionalizing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T02:56:02.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
