The queen of the cuchi-cuchi that is. Charo and professional dance partner Keo Motsepe made their Dancing With the Stars debut on the season 24 premiere and netted a 21 out of a possible 40 for their salsa to \"Cuban Pete\" by Mambo Companeros . \n\"I was so proud,\" Keo told E! News' Sibley Scoles after the premiere. \"I had never seen her dance like that.\" \nDuring rehearsal, Keo said Charo told him, \"Keo, I need the audience. I'm a performer, I have audience all the time.\" Photos \nDancing With the Stars : Meet the Season 24 Cast! \n\"I love audiences,\" Charo said. \"They are my oxygen. I only breathe with audience. When I'm alone, I am normally a miserable you know what.\" \nAfter the critiques, Charo told longtime judge Bruno Tonioli that she was watching him. She took that one step further with us. \"I've got a message for Bruno: If he wants to be alive for his next birthday, you better give me bigger numbers. Bigger! I'm watching you,\" she said. \"We already have a controversy. Because I am the queen of the cuchi-cuchi, OK? Don't mess with me because, Bruno, I look at you.\" \nCharo wasn't the lowest- scored dancer. That distinction went to Saturday Night Live veteran Chris Kattan and his partner Witney Carson , they scored a 17 out of 40. The highest shouldn't be a surprise: Olympic gymnast Simone Biles and partner Sasha Farber took home a 32 out of 40. \nDancing With the Stars airs Mondays, 8 p.m. on ABC.
