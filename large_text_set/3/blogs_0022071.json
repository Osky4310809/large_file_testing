The bombs never went off. \nRelated: U.S. Restricts Laptops, iPads in Carry-On Bags From 10 Airports \nAmerican counterterrorism officials have previously said that al-Asiri has shared his expertise. \nIn 2013, John Pistole, then head of the Transportation Security Administration, said that \"There is intel that he has unfortunately trained others.\" \nIn 2014, the U.S. gathered intelligence suggesting that al-Asiri had trained bomb-makers among a group of al Qaeda fighters in Syria known as the Khorasan Group. Many of that group's leaders were subsequently killed in U.S. air strikes, but the concerns about cooperation between militants in Yemen and militants in Syria — where ISIS is now the most powerful terror group — remains.
