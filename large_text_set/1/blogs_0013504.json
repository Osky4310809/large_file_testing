Add egg white and beat for 1 minute. Slowly add sifted flour and salt and beat at medium speed until a soft\ndough forms. Cover bowl and chill in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 300°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or silicone\nbaking mat. Roll dough into a 1/4-inch thick rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Cut into six, 3×5-inch rectangles. Place cookies on prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, until\ngolden brown. Remove from oven and cool for 30 minutes. FOR TOPPING: \nSpread 1 tablespoon of chocolate-hazelnut spread on each cookie,\nleaving a border of about 1/8 inch around the edges of each cookie. Set aside. FOR GLAZE: \nWhisk powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons of the milk, and the vanilla\nextract in a pie plate until smooth. Add additional milk if the glaze is\ntoo thick. Set aside 2 tablespoons of glaze in a small bowl. Dip each cookie, chocolate-hazelnut side down, in the glaze to cover\nthe chocolate. Set on a wire rack to dry. Mix remaining glaze with desired color or colors of food coloring. Use a\nfork to drizzle colored glaze on top of the cookies.
