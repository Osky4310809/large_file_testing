She opted a sheer white, oversized shirt from Chloe and paired it with dark blue skinny jeans. We all know that a white shirt and blue jeans is a classic combination and no one can ever go wrong wearing it. She paired this look with a pair of comfy, tan slip-ons. And we must addâ€”it was the perfect thing to do! A post shared by Deepika Padukone Fanpage (@deepika.padukone.fanpage) on Mar 22, 2017 at 11:06am PDT \nShe wore this casual look for a fun date with her friends and yet managed to turn heads. While it was pretty simple, the silhouette of this basic white shirt just turned up her style game a couple of notches. She tied her hair in a bun which was perfect for the occasion. \nWe loved this timeless and classic look on her!
