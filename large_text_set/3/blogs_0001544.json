But Trump wants a wall, not just a fence. \nImage: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images By Sasha Lekach 2017-03-03 21:49:43 UTC Perched literally on top of the Mexican-American border, Mexican congressman Braulio Guerra released a video Friday to tell Donald Trump in no uncertain terms that his wall plans are “totally absurd.”\nFrom the top of the structure at the border north of Tijuana, Guerra explained in a video how easy it was for him to scale the wall. And then posted all his evidence and thoughts on Twitter. \nGuerra, who’s from the state of Querétaro, called Trump’s idea to build a $12 to $15 billion wall across the entire roughly 2,000-mile length of the border “unnecessary and absurd.” \nThe politician said he made it to one of the higher parts of the fence without much difficulty and that plenty of people are able to make it over all the time — he even showed other people on the wall while he was at the beach site making this video. \nGuerra also pointed out that the proposed wall will destroy what’s left of Mexico’s relationship with the U.S., while also harming human rights and dignity. \nOf course Guerra couldn’t get away with posting so many photos of himself without the Photoshop jokes trickling in. \nOther more dirty jokes of the congressman straddling the fence also emerged online. We’ll leave those to your imagination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T11:23:46.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
