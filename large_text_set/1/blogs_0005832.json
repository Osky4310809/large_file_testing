Most recently, the actor posted a selfie to Instagram featuring a Russian-language \"Make America Great Again\" cap, a clear reference to the president-elect's continued praise of Russian president Vladimir Putin as well as his skepticism that Russian hacking affected election results in November. SEE ALSO: You can take the subway, but you can't hide from Donald Trump's face According to a translation provided to Mashable by Olga Massov, the hat literally says \"Make America Cool Again\" — but it's obviously intended to be a mocking take on Trump's famous \"MAGA\" slogan. Shortly after Baldwin's joke, Trump released even more contentious tweets about Russia. On Saturday morning, he tweeted that \"having a good relationship with Russia would be a good thing, not a bad thing,\" and that only \"stupid people\" would believe the opposite. Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only \"stupid\" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and.... \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 The U.S. intelligence community believes Russia was behind cyberattacks targeting the Democratic Party throughout the election season. A report released Friday by U.S. intelligence agencies reasserted that, at the very least, Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted a Donald Trump presidency. You know, just like on SNL.
