Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nRonaldo has hit back at Michael Owen after his former Real Madrid teammate's jibe about his weight. \nThe Brazilian was the best striker of his era but has piled on the pounds since he called time on his glittering playing career. \nOwen and Ronaldo were reunited at the Bernabeu for the La Liga clash against Granada recently, where they were joined by Los Blancos legends Luis Figo and Raymond Kopa as Cristiano Ronaldo was presented with his Ballon d'Or. \nThe ex-England striker played alongside Ronaldo in 2004/5, and made a lighthearted comment about the forward's weight on social media. \nHe tweeted: \"I thought I was gaining weight until I saw my old mate Ronnie.\" \nHowever, Ronaldo did not take the joke in good spirit. \nHe told AS: \"I am shocked as to how much importance my weight garners in the world we live in. I don't know why it is so important, to be honest.\" (Photo: Angel Martinez) \nRoberto Carlos lent his support to his compatriot, adding: \"I don't like these type of jokes. Ronaldo is a very good friend of mine and we have to be careful. \n\"The thing about Ronaldo is not about his body, it's his heart, he has a very big heart.\" poll loading Who was the better player in their prime? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T13:26:08.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
