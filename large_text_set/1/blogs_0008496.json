Foy won first for her eerily on-point performance as the young Queen Elizabeth II , before the show itself took the award for best TV drama, beating out big-deal and big-budget contenders like Westworld and Stranger Things . God save the Queen … to your Netflix queue. PHOTOS: Most Memorable Golden Globes Moments \nThis … Isn't Us \nDespite being one of the best-loved new shows on television this year, This Is Us was sadly passed over in both its nominated categories. Chrissy Metz and Mandy Moore had bids for best supporting actress but were beaten by The Night Manager 's Olivia Colman (who was absent from the ceremony). Also losing was This Is Us actor Sterling K. Brown , who wasn't nominated for that show but in the limited-series supporting-actor category for his role as Christopher Darden on The People v. O.J. Simpson . ( The Night Manager 's Hugh Laurie took that prize.) \nAnd when it came to the award for best TV drama, The Crown was the winner — but hey, if the Pearsons had to lose to someone, they could do worse than the Royal Family.

It's already unusual for an actor to be nominated for a Globe for a role not in English, and even rarer for one to win, especially when facing the fierce competition as Natalie Portman in Jackie. This might explain why Huppert was practically hyperventilating with delight as she celebrated her victory and then raced to the stage to make a breathless speech. \nAnother big-name star who lost out on receiving a trophy for a heralded role was Fences ' Denzel Washington , who was praised in Casey Affleck 's acceptance speech after the Manchester by the Sea star prevailed for best actor in a drama. \nStreep stirs things up \nIt's never exactly a shock when awards shows include some post-election commentary, but this year's big political moment came from a surprise source: Hollywood grande dame Meryl Streep , who made a powerful statement as she collected the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement. In a speech that stunned the room, she called out President-elect Donald Trump for a heartbreaking \"performance\"— referencing a moment during the 2016 campaign when Trump mocked a disabled reporter. \nThis big surprise also created the most suspenseful moment of the night, which is still unresolved: Will Trump take to Twitter to call Streep a loser and a hater? We'll see! \nTell Us: Which Golden Globes snub bothered you the most?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T09:01:33.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
