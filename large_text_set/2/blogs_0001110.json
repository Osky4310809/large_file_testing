God is sending the message to us today that we should go and re-examine the level of our leadership. Are we in true leadership or we are thoughtful; this is a take home message for us because it is very important to us,” she said. \nResponding to the third in the series of Pastor Enoch Adeboye annual birthday public lecture which was delivered by Pastor Femi Atoyebi, SAN, on “Excellent Leadership in Pluralistic (and Ethno-Religious) Society Like Nigeria,” in Ikeja, Lagos, she urged church leaders to direct their offsprings back to the basic traditional values associated with our cultures. \nIn addition, Pastor Adeboye emphasized the need for elders in the church to inculcate in the younger generation the values of contentment, which she argued was one of the fundamental principles of child upbringing in the country.

I want us to take time to be with our children and go back to the basics. \n“The Bible says Godliness with contentment is a great gain, we couldn’t have had anything like corruption in our country if everybody had been contented with whatever he is and wherever situation he is or can afford, but people want to do more than they are. They show their children what they are not; whereas they are nothing and such child would build on that and never be satisfied in the school or among his colleagues because at home he has never been trained to be satisfied. \n“We know how all of us started, in the morning your parents give you ‘ ogi ’ with one piece of akara and if you did not take it before going to school, you will come back to take it because they will not give you more food. But today, your children have options and as a result, their life is not streamlined, they lack guidance. \nBack to the basics \n“Brethren, let us go back to the basics. We should respect our position as elders, this is very important. We can only respect ourselves as elders when we talk like elders, think like elders, make decisions like elders. Elders should stomach lots of things, there are things elders should not say. \n“We should assume our positions as elders, we should be father, teacher, leader and pastors to our children and also let us show leadership across, all over, not in our homes alone but also in the society,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:24:57.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
