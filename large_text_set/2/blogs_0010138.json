The James Gunn -directed Marvel sequel has scored a perfect 100 in an early test screening — an extremely rare feat and the highest ever number for a Marvel movie. However, there are a few caveats. More about the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 test screening score below. \nThe Hollywood Reporter got the scoop on the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 test screening score. The film beat out Marvel’s two previous record-holders, Iron Man 3 and The Avengers , both of which rated in the high 90s. It is the only Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to achieve a perfect 100 in a test screening. All of this bodes very well for Vol. 2 , which based on the trailers and promos released so far seems to have recaptured the wisecracking humor, interpersonal chemistry, and colorful, out-there action that made the first film such a hit. It’s funny to recall now that Vol. 1 felt like a daring risk at the time. After the smash success of that movie, Vol. 2 looked like a surefire hit for Marvel — and now we’ve got the test scores to bear that out.\nBut lest you assume this means Vol. 2 will definitely be the best movie of all time (or whatever), it’s worth mentioning that Marvel’s test screening pool is very particular. While most studios try to assemble a somewhat random group of potential moviegoers, Marvel’s test screening scores comes from “friends and families” showing, which means these viewers might be more predisposed to love Vol. 2 (or any other Marvel movie) than most. We should also note that test screenings, while interesting and useful, are hardly the be-all end-all of a film’s quality. Plenty of strong films have had weak scores, and vice versa. All the score really tells us is that a select group of people connected in some way to Marvel Studios liked this movie. It’s not nothing, but it’s certainly not everything.\nStill, if you’re a Guardians fan who’s been worried that Vol. 2 couldn’t possibly live up to the original, this update might put you at ease. Anyway, you won’t have too much longer to see for yourself how the film turned out — it opens in less than three months, on May 5 .\nThe post ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2’ Scores a Perfect 100 in Test Screening appeared first on /Film .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:32:56.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
