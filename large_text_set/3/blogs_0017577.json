Most Popular By Jack Holmes Mar 17, 2017 These are transformative times for Jake Tapper. Once seemingly seduced by the both-siderist hellscape of Beltway punditry, Tapper has undergone a reinvention in recent months, speaking hard truths to powerful people. That came to a head today with his segment following the joint press conference between President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, which surely must have had any German viewers who tuned in thinking someone slipped mescaline in their Weihenstephaner.   You see, the president is at this point quintupling down on his evidence-free claim that President Obama had him wiretapped during the campaign. His press secretary, Sean Spicer, managed to cause an international incident Thursday by hitting forward on an email from Uncle Judge Napolitano claiming Obama asked British intelligence to do it—another unfounded claim—and Trump seems to think that was just all fine and dandy.
