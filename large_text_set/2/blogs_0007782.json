She returned to rehab in 2011, for anxiety and depression. \nWriter Rob feared Tara might not complete the interview­ as she had become so upset. But he noted that “between sniffles, she valiantly said, ‘Don’t worry, I will come through’”. \nAsking to be remembered­ as “cheerful, beautiful and loved by all”, she discussed the funeral she desired. Tara with her sister Santa (Photo: Rex Features) \nDays earlier, she had been asked what she’d like the order of service to be. \n“I don’t like funerals where everyone has a good time and gets drunk ,” she said. “I want a simple service, a positive eulogy and meaningful readings.” \nBut the battler in her refused to give up and she vowed to “get back to full health” after suffering a brain tumour and an auto-immune condition. \nDuring the same interview, she said Noel Harrison’s song The Windmills Of Your Mind moved her to tears, and quoted a poem written by George Frost to his father in 2014. Tara Palmer-Tomkinson and Duncan James (Photo: Rex) \nQuoting the poem, she recited: “To my darling children, who wonder what to do/Just have a wonderful time, as I will, living through you.” \nSpeaking to the Daily Mail’s Weekend magazine, published today, she said she would like to be remembered “like a Bernese mountain dog - cheerful, beautiful­ and loved by all.” \nTara’s body was discovered by her cleaner at her beloved penthouse flat in Earls Court, West London. She described the pad, purchased 15 years ago, as her most prized possession­. \n“It’s like a New York loft. Very rock star - it represents everything I worked for.” Tara Palmer Tomkinson with Princes William and Harry (Photo: Alpha Press) \nIn November, Tara revealed she was being treated for a non-malignant growth in her pituitary gland and added that she feared she would die. \nShe was diagnosed with the tumour last January after she returned from a ski trip. She was also suffering with an auto-immune disease which caused tiredness, joint pain and acute anaemia. \nTara’s close friend Ivan Massow - who had discussed having Tara as a surrogate­ for his children - said the socialite had looked “very thin and obviously unwell” when he last saw her a few months back. \nHe continued: “She had become dangerously underweight. Her body was covered with the thinnest layer of skin, her legs and arms were like little poles and her face was gaunt. Tara Palmer Tomkinson and Mick Hucknall (Photo: Rex Features) \n“I would try to get her to eat or even to talk about her weight, but she couldn’t be told.” \nHe added that despite her frail condition­ she had shot a pilot for a TV show, and was planning a comeback. \nTributes to her have poured in from Tara’s famous friends, including Prince Charles, and the Duchess of Cornwall who said they were “deeply saddened” by her death. \nSarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, said her family were “shocked” by the death of “the magnificent, beautifully energetic­ soul of Tara.” Tara Palmer-Tomkinson as a Dr No Bond girl Ursula Andress in 1998 (Photo: Rex Features) \nTara’s sister Santa Sebag-Montefiore and her husband Simon spent the morning cleaning the penthouse flat. \nSanta, 47, wearing jeans and a blue coat with her fur-lined hood up, arrived just before 9am with 51-year-old Simon. \nMinutes later Santa could be clearly seen through the penthouse window washing-up, opening the windows as well as cleaning and drawing the blinds. \nBefore the couple entered the apartment, they collected two bouquets from the doorstep.

He said: “We have left tributes online, we don’t want to say anything.” \nSanta left just after 1pm with her hand over her face and being comforted by an older man in his sixties. \nMet Police are treating Tara’s death as “unexplained” but “not suspicious”. \nA death notice in Daily Telegraph read: “Tara Clare died peacefully­ in her sleep,” and added that a private funeral will be held. \nAuthor Santa posted online: “My darling sister. I miss you.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:20:34.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
