The concert will be streamed on the band's Facebook at 4:10 p.m. EST. \nSlowdive released three studio LPs – including shoegaze masterpieces like 1993's Souvlaki and 1995's Pygmalion – before breaking up in 1995. Nearly 20 years later, Neil Halstead and company reunited for a 2014 tour, as well as plans to record their fourth LP together. \n\"When you're in a band and you do three records, there’s a continuous flow and a development,\" Halstead said in a statement. \"For us, that flow re-started with us playing live again and that has continued into the record.\" \nSlowdive is due out May 5th via Dead Oceans. The group previously shared the first single \"Star Roving.\" \n1. \"Slomo\"3. \"Don’t Know Why\"4. \"Sugar For The Pill\"5. \"Everyone Knows\"6. \"No Longer Making Time\"7. \"Go Get It\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:31:07.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
