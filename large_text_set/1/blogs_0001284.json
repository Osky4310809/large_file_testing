Paul Beaty / AP ID: 10251532 Johnson said that despite attacks on Chicago police doubling in 2016 over the prior year, “officers responded bravely by making more gun arrests and recovering more guns than we did in 2015, which is more than New York and LA combined.”\nHowever, data obtained by CBS’s 60 Minutes found that overall police activity dropped in all of Chicago’s 22 police districts.\nDuring Sunday’s news conference, Johnson outlined a plan aimed at curtailing the violence. The plan includes “addressing the flaws in sentencing guidelines for repeat gun offenders,” “targeted data driven enforcement,” and “renewed community engagement and partnership programs.”\n“In 2017, community policing will morph into a department-wide philosophy,” the superintendent said.\nThe department will also hire more police officers, promote more detectives, and equip every officer with a body camera ahead of schedule.\n“Through these actions we’ll be able create a culture of accountability for repeat gun offenders so we can actually have meaningful deterrents to gun crime and trigger pullers who’ll think twice about the consequences of their reckless actions,” Johnson said.\nMcCarthy, however, was less optimistic during his radio interview. He pointed to what he described as the “legitimizing of non-compliance” by everyone from the White House to local officials. And though McCarthy expressed optimism about Sen. Jeff Sessions’ selection as US Attorney General in President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, he also didn’t foresee rapid improvement.\n“The political environment that exists in this city and across this country is contributing to a sense of lawlessness,” McCarthy said, “and I don’t see it turning around in the short term.”\n1.\nChicago Sees Deadliest Month In Nearly 20 Years As Gun Violence Surges\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10251378 3.\nChicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy Ousted After Fatal Shooting\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10251528", "external_links": ["http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-chicago-police-activity-declines-as-murders-spike-data-shows/"], "published": "2017-01-02T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T07:07:46.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
