African migrants from the Nigeria wait at Tripoli’s Mitiga International Airport prior to being repatriated to their homeland under a voluntary repatriation program coordinated by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on March 23, 2017. / AFP PHOTO \nThe Nigerians, wearing tracksuits and new sneakers, were driven to the airport near the Libyan capital in two buses. \n“I wish I could go to Europe but I can’t,” said a woman called Fate, carrying a baby in her arms. \n“I’m happy to be going home,” said another Nigerian woman. \nIOM head William Lacy Swing, who was in Tripoli on Wednesday, visited a reception centre for migrants accompanied by the UN special envoy for Libya, Martin Kobler. \n“We can no longer turn our back on the communities affected by the current migration crisis” in Libya, said Swing, who met with Libyan officials. \nKobler said it was “a humanitarian imperative” to improve the living conditions of migrants and help with repatriations. “Voluntary return must be assisted,” he wrote on Twitter. \nA group of 150 nationals of the Ivory Coast, gathered from detention centres around Libya, were flown home on Tuesday. \nSix years since a revolution that toppled dictator Moamer Kadhafi, Libya has become a key departure point for clandestine migration to Europe via perilous boat crossings of the Mediterranean. \nThe IOM has said 521 migrants died in the Mediterranean from January 1 to March 5, 2017. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:02:58.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
