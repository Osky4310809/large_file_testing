Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nEllis Genge has been hailed as a “beast” of a prop, after making a spectacular late claim for Six Nations inclusion. \nGenge is the fiery young Leicester loosehead so admired by England coach Eddie Jones, yet surprisingly axed from the Aussie's elite squad on New Year’s Eve. \nBut Jones might just be having second thoughts after watching the 21-year-old’s scrum masterclass against Premiership leaders Wasps on Sunday. \nLast year's Grand Slam winners have injuries to their two first-choice looseheads. \nMako Vunipola is ruled out until at least the end of February with damaged knee ligaments, and his understudy Joe Marler is awaiting the result of scans on a calf injury which forced him out of Harlequins’ game on Saturday.

Every game he plays, he gets better,” said Leicester coach Aaron Mauger. “He is a very physical, powerful beast. \n“When you need a bit of front-foot ball, he is one of those guys who puts his hand up and carries the ball well. Vunipola is set to miss at least three of England's five games with a knee injury...

We are pretty happy with his performance.” \nWasps boss Dai Young, capped 54 times at prop by Wales and the British & Irish Lions, agreed the youngster goes from “strength to strength”. \nJones has long rated Genge, whom he capped against Wales in May before selecting him for the summer tour of Australia after just 121 minutes of top-flight rugby.
