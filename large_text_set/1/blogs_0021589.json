Photo by Laurie Skrivan, lskrivan@post-dispatch.com \nWith their two sons grown and living on their own in Los Angeles, Nick and Sharon Blaine were ready for a change from their 6,000-square-foot house in St. Louis County. Having other real estate investments, including a lake house and the homes their kids have lived in and rented, they wanted to downsize and simplify their lives, as well as take advantage of what city living had to offer. +23 \nIn the second-floor sitting room, Nick fitted a unique pole lamp he purchased at the Future Antiques onto a kidney-shaped table he made himself. The vintage leather chair came from his father's office. Laurie Skrivan \n“Our kids lived in Hollywood a block off Sunset Boulevard, and we really love that walkable, hip city vibe,” Nick says. “We were tired of our county house and all of the maintenance it required.” \nBoth fans of midcentury modern design (and having already built a collection of midcentury modern furnishings), they looked at some homes from the period in Crestwood, but most didn’t have what they wanted in terms of space. \n“Our kids were in town for a wedding, and we had lunch at Olio in the city. When we were walking to our car, we spotted a few of the UIC display homes in the neighborhood, and we were intrigued,” Nick says. \nThey visited with UIC Homes founders Brent Crittenden and Sarah Gibson and saw some open lots in the Grove where they could have a custom modern home built to suit their specific needs. They began building in July 2015 and moved into their new home in March 2016. \n“Sarah is really envelope-pushing,” Nick says. “We knew we wanted an open, floating staircase, and she designed the stairs and unique railing. We also wanted a laundry room right off the bedroom, so she worked to customize that space as well.” \nThe three-story, three-bedroom modern home is open, light-filled and offers easy living for the Blaines as well as a private space for their sons when they visit. Bamboo flooring on the main level is both beautiful and sustainable. Fans of color, the Blaines used a combination of muted green and bright red custom cabinetry in the open kitchen, complemented with recycled glass countertops that pop with flecks of blue, red, green and gold. \nPratt & Lambert “Lambswool” paint throughout the house provides a neutral backdrop for the Blaines’ many brightly colored works of art by both local and national artists, including Theresa Disney, Ken Kohoutek, Josh Agle (a.k.a. “Shag”) and Nat Reed. \nNick and Sharon are thoroughly enjoying their new city lifestyle, particularly being able to walk to favorite haunts in the Grove like Urban Chestnut Brewery, as well as getting to know their neighbors who live in other UIC homes on the street. \nNick and Sharon Blaine \nAges • Nick is 62 and Sharon is 61. \nOccupations • Both Nick and Sharon work for Wells Fargo Insurance Services, where he is a senior vice president, and she is an account executive. \nHome • The Grove neighborhood of St. Louis \nFamily • The Blaines have two grown sons, Jason and Preston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T09:47:28.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
