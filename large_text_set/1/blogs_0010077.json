Photos Courtesy Sky Arts \n\"Unfortunately, this is what my family has to deal with. No words could express the blatant disrespect.\" \nFiennes is portraying the Grammy-winning icon in the television film on Sky Arts, which is centered around the road trip that Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando took with Jackson. \nThe famous trio drove from New York City to Ohio after the September 11th attacks. \nAnd it's not just the Jackson family who disapproves of the casting, fans have created a petition to boycott the film. \n\"It's easy to see why the story would make a compelling filmâ€”but it's harder to understand why the actor best known for his role in Shakespeare in Love was the first choice to play one of the world's most iconic black musicians,\" the petition states. \nThe petition is currently nearing its target goal of 25,000 signatures.
