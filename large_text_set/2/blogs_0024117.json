Real Housewives of New Jersey star Jacqueline Laurita , who struggled with several miscarriages before having her youngest son, Nicholas, congratulated Kotb on Instagram: ‚ÄúI was crying listening to how happy you were while announcing her,‚Äù wrote Laurita, who became a grandmother last year when her daughter Ashlee Holmes gave birth to her first child. ‚ÄúYou will be an amazing Mother.
