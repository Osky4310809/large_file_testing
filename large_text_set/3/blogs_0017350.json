First, he lost tax-exempt status for his National Policy Institute (NPI) “think tank,” which complicates any future “ Heil Trump !” parties for the group. He also earned the ire of Depeche Mode’s Dave Gahan, who referred to him as “ a very educated c*nt .” Yet these indignities were nothing compared to how Spencer tried to invoke a Cabaret song and earned serious comeuppance from one of the composer’s relatives.\nEverything started innocently enough when Bloomberg View Columnist Eli Lake tweeted a link to a story about how Western unity can defeat Russian tactics. Spencer was itching to start a fight and asked, “Who is ‘we’?”\nWho is \"we\"? https://t.co/MQkUMvKxGp \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) March 18, 2017 \n\nLake wasn’t interested and delivered the barest of answers: “Patriots.”\nPatriots https://t.co/qiMeco3g6i \n— Eli Lake (@EliLake) March 18, 2017 \n\nSpencer then tried to accuse Lake of political impropriety, and this effort went nowhere productive.\nI have never had my drinks paid for by a lobbyist for a foreign government. Can you say the same? https://t.co/mLloOaxLs3 \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) March 18, 2017 \n\nHowever, Talking Points Memo Editor Josh Marshall was ready to pick up the baton. He tweeted, “You’re a Nazi & a stain on this country’s greatness.”\nYou're a Nazi & a stain on this country's greatness. I can say that. https://t.co/fMDgiKPDDT \n— Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) March 18, 2017 \n\nIn response, Spencer only had a lame porn joke to offer.\n. @joshtpm don't you have some porn to tweet out?\n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) March 18, 2017 \n\n\nMarshall was armed and ready to fire back. He told Spencer to “take your trash philosophy back to the 1930s.”\nTake your trash philosophy back to the 1930s, chump. You're just a punk. https://t.co/VTkcuPmlPO \n— Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) March 18, 2017 \n\nSo, Spencer invoked a song that’s often mistaken for a Nazi anthem . This would be “Tomorrow Belongs To Me,” which is best known from the Cabaret movie of 1972 (and the musical’s Broadway productions, which have spanned decades). Spencer insisted, “1930s? No, tomorrow belongs to us.”\n. @joshtpm 1930s? No, tomorrow belongs to us. https://t.co/gpmWYIITr4 \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) March 18, 2017 \n\nSpencer may have thought he hit a home run, but Jason Kander — CNN contributor and nephew of composer John Kander — informed Spencer of the song’s origins: “Hey buddy, that song you love was written by my uncle. He’s been married to my other uncle for 40 years. And he’s a Jew.”\nHey buddy, that song you love was written by my uncle. He's been married to my other uncle for 40 years. And he's a Jew. \nSing it proud. https://t.co/yrL4242sl5 \n— Jason Kander (@JasonKander) March 18, 2017 \n\nWell, Spencer failed to come back from that remark, and how could he? That’s a knockout, and arguably even better than the time Spencer was literally punched in the face during an Inauguration Day interview.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:05:22.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
