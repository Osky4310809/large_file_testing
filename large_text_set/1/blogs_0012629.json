These voluntary vehicle inspections will be carried out at all Puspakom inspection centres, except those in Shah Alam, Taman Bukit Maluri, Mak Mandin and Kota Bharu, which cater specifically to commercial vehicles. \nThe VVI is a 25-point inspection which examines the brakes, rims and tyres, instruments, front and rear lamps and exhaust. The inspection also checks for leaks from the transmission, engine and other areas for roadworthiness. \n“Many are expected to travel to their hometowns or go on holiday during this festive season. With that in mind, Puspakom is taking the initiative to help vehicle owners ensure that their vehicles are in good condition, which will give them confidence when driving. This is part of our social responsibility,” said Mohammed Shukor Ismail, chief executive officer of Puspakom. \nThe free-of-charge VVI campaign will take place from 8am until 5pm every day (subject to operating hours of specific outlets). Priority will be given to VVI customers, who can visit any participating Puspakom branch, with no prior appointments or documentation required.
