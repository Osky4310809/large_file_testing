He has looked laboured in the current campaign, netting just twice in the English top flight in 14 games, and he is some way from the player who lit up the division alongside Luis Suarez back in 2013-14. Per Richardson, it is \"certain [that] Sturridge’s days on Merseyside are numbered,\" and a summer departure is now inevitable, but the Reds may not be prepared to simply loan him to PSG and will likely look to make some money on him. Meanwhile, Liverpool may reportedly look to bolster their attacking line by signing Athletic Bilbao's Inaki Williams. Aitor Alcalde Colomer/Getty Images According to ilBiancoNero.com (via Calciomercato ) , Italian giants Juventus and the Reds both scouted the 22-year-old Spaniard—who has a €50 million (£43.2 million) release clause—in Athletic's recent 1-0 loss to Sevilla in La Liga. One of Bilbao's most exciting attacking threats, Williams has provided five assists and netted two goals so far in the Spanish top flight in 2016-17, per WhoScored . He could be a fine addition to a Liverpool side currently in dire need of further attacking depth as he can play both as a centre-forward and on the right flank—so he could provide necessary cover for Sadio Mane. It is unlikely, though, that the Anfield outfit will be prepared to meet his steep release clause and will likely look to negotiate his price down should they decide to make a move.
