Tucker Civic Center in Tallahassee. \nThe Blue Devils (14-2, 2-1 ACC ) will be without coach Mike Krzyzewski as he continues to recover from back surgery. His team responded well to his first absence from the sidelines with a 93-82 home win over Boston College on Saturday. \nJayson Tatum led Duke with 22 points and six rebounds. \nThe Seminoles (15-1, 3-0 ACC ) are one of the early season's biggest surprises and are a perfect 11-0 on their home court this season. But they can expect the challenge level to rise significantly with the Blue Devils coming to town. \nThey enter this game with 11 straight wins including at No. 19 Virginia and home against Virginia Tech. \nBleacher Report's live coverage is set to begin at 8 p.m. ET. \nYou can watch live on ACC Network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:37:15.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
