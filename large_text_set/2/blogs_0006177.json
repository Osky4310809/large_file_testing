That, folks, is love in the wintry air as the 14th of February fast approaches. And it doesn't matter if you don't have that special someone in your life, because there's plenty of love to go around in the movies. \nAs we head towards Valentine's Day, we present the most romantic films of the past 50 years—one per year, starting with 2016 and going all the way back to 1966. It's too early to call the most romantic movie of this year (though there's plenty on the way, from the live-action Beauty and the Beast to the Fifty Shades sequel and festival favorite Call Me By Your Name ). In the meantime, pick any of the following for your V-day viewing, and let a little love into your life. More Equals (2016) Equals (2016) \nThe pick could have easily been Moonlight or La La Land but there's no need to pit these Best Picture nominees against each other yet again. Equals follows a tried and true forbidden love formula but, damn, is it an emotional wrecker. In the film's feeling-less dystopian society, two perfect human specimens (Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Hoult) accidentally catch feelings for each other, and what starts off as a steamy secret affair becomes a profound statement of love. Seriously, have some tissues on hand. 01 Of 50 Carol (2015) Carol (2015) \nCarol is the most romantic movie of this century—there, I said it. In this 1950s-set melodrama about two women who fall in love with each other, director Todd Haynes shoots with such tenderness that it will take more than just a single viewing to catch all the intonations and hand touching that add up to the film's lingering romantic subtext. It is quite perfect. 1 Of 50 Equals (2016) \nThe pick could have easily been Moonlight or La La Land but there's no need to pit these Best Picture nominees against each other yet again.

It is quite perfect.   3 Of 50 Only Lovers Left Alive (2014) \nPlease do not hit back with a \"But Twilight —\" because, as silly as this is to say about, um, vampire movies, the slow-burning, centuries-spanning, rekindled romance of Adam and Eve (Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton) in Jim Jarmusch's stylish drama is just so much more…real. Yes, there's romance—and, boy, are these pale, blood-drinking leads sexy—but there's also a romanticized notion of high art that makes their love story très chic. 4 Of 50 Her (2013) \nIt may have just been a really dark time in my life, but I couldn't leave my couch for three days after watching Her , Spike Jonze's android romance starring porn-stached Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson's voice as Samantha, the Siri-esque technology Phoenix's Theodore starts \"dating.\" It initially seems like a silly premise, but Her boldly questions our notion of love—and, wait, why are my eyes so teary all of a sudden?   5 Of 50 Amour (2012) \nIs it screwed up that a Michael Haneke film is on a \"most romantic movies\" list? Yes, absolutely. And the amorously titled Amour is certainly no feel-good film. Jean-Louis Trintignant and the late great Emmanuelle Riva meet a disturbing fate as Georges and Anne while Haneke brutally drags the audience along with the deteriorating couple. But there's never any question that the love between them is real—interpret that ending however you will—and that's why Amour makes this list. 6 Of 50 Weekend (2011) \nAndrew Haigh's gay romantic drama plays out like a crystallized memory of a sweet but short-lived affair, one you remember fondly years later. After what seems like a mere one-night stand, Russell and Glen spend a passionate weekend together—filled with drugs, sex, and heated arguments. Their relationship may come with an expiration date (Glen plans to move to America) but Haigh doesn't dismiss the idea that great love can be a brief one.   7 Of 50 Blue Valentine (2010) \nSorry to keep bogging you down with these not-so-happily-ever-after movies, but at least Blue Valentine doesn't keep up a façade that things end well for Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams). Knowing their eventual end makes the flashbacks to their happier days even more devastating, and yes, heart-wrenchingly romantic. Love isn't always forever. 8 Of 50 Bright Star (2009) \nThis is the life of a Romantic poet (John Keats, as portrayed by Ben Whishaw), through the lens of a romantic filmmaker (Jane Campion, no stranger to period pieces), and the result is lush and melancholic. Sadly, Keats died at 25 from consumption, so the chaste relationship between the poet and his one true love (Abbie Cornish) is a fleeting one, but it feels as grand and everlasting as one of his poems—even when it's mostly just a lot of PG hand touching.   9 Of 50 Two Lovers (2008) \nThere's something incredibly relatable about Joaquin Phoenix's Leonard, a man with a few demons who becomes involved with—yup—two lovers. There's the caring Sandra (Vinessa Shaw), a family friend who is as \"marriage material\" as they come, but then there's his neighbor Michelle (Gwyneth Paltrow), as exciting a presence in life as she is a doomed one. Thing is, we've all known a Michelle… 10 Of 50 Atonement (2007) \nWho can forget that scene in the library with James McAvoy and Keira Knightley in that iconic green dress? Ow, ow, ow. (You know, it hurts when your heart breaks.) That's the sweetest memory of this movie, but it soon turns to the most bittersweet thanks to a devastating plot turn. Like Romeo and Juliet , Atonement comes with tragic star-crossed lovers and the terrible consequences of a family coming between them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:38:54.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
