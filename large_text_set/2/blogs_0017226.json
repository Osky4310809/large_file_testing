(PTI) \nUnion Textile Minister Smriti Irani in a rally on Wednesday hit out at the Akhilesh Yadav -led Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, said, “Even Dimple Yadav, the wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is not safe from the Samajwadi Party workers, they have been warned by ‘bhaiya’ Akhilesh, a news channel telecasted this news yesterday.” While no sources have yet confirmed the news of Dimple Yadav not feeling safe among the Samajwadi Party workers. Smriti Irani was addressing a rally at Varanasi on Wednesday. \nWhile addressing a series of rally in the past Irani had described the Samajvadi party has the “protector of rapists.” She also said that their 5-year rule in the state will be remembered only for the crimes that took place against the women. She said, “It is a disgrace that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had in his cabinet a person like Gayatri Prajapati who has been accused of rape. That the court had to intervene and order that an FIR be lodged against the minister proves that SP is a protector of rapists. No wonder under its rule, women of UP have never felt safe.” \nYou may also want to watch- \n\nEarlier this month Smriti Irani had said in a press conference that she was working for people of Amethi despite losing to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in 2014. But, Priyanka has avoided campaign in the district because of the “unfulfilled” promises. She said, “Priyanka wants to avoid people’s questions,” as quoted by PTI in a report. The Congress had responded to Irani’s swipe by saying that Priyanka was overlooking the campaign of the party. Interestingly, it seems Irani’s attack on Priyanka forced the Congress think tank to urge Priyanka to appear on the poll scene. She is now expected to attend her first election rally in Uttar Pradesh this year today along with brother Rahul in Rae Bareli, which is the family pocket borough of the Gandhis.
