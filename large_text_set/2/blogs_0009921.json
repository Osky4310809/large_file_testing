Arroyo, now free and a deputy speaker at the House of Representatives, was jailed while De Lima was secretary of justice. \n\"Kasi katuparan lang yan ng utos ng Pangulo. Ilang beses na ho iyan sinasabi na he wants me locked up in jail to suffer the fate of the former president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo,\" De Lima said. \nREAD: De Lima sees looming arrest over drug charges \nDuterte has accused De Lima as having benefited from the illegal drugs trade inside the national penitentiary, the New Bilibid Prison, during her stint as Justice secretary. \nDe Lima is facing drug-related charges filed with the Department of Justice by the National Bureau of Investigation, non-government group Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption, former NBI directors Reynaldo Esmeralda and Ruel Lasala and inmate Jaybee Sebastian.
