Fresh off a showstopping performance at the Super Bowl last weekend, Lady Gaga showed up on the Grammys adorned from head to toe in black leather. \nThe look included a daring crocodile-print embossed jacket that was both backless and showed an impressive amount of cleavage, while the neck and arms of the jacket featured lots of fringe. \nThe bottom portion of her ensemble included half a patent leather leotard decorated with chains and thigh high leather boots. She completed her outfit with fishnet stockings, aviator sunglasses and pink highlights, giving off motorcyclist vibes. \nWe've seen looks like this from Gaga before. The high platform on her boots has become one of the songstress's favorite looks; she wore similarly high shoes to the Grammys last year .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:09:21.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
