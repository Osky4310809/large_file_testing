Not only does he star in both MTV’s Teen Wolf and The CW’s Arrow , but Colton just got engaged to Jeff Leatham . Yeah, it’s been a big year already for the handsome star, and it’s only March. But now, things are getting even more exciting. Via his Instagram, Colton just dropped another huge announcement, making his 2017 an even bigger deal than it already was.\nWhen we looked at Colton’s Insta bio , we noticed something a little different that wasn’t there before. And it suggests that there’s some VERY exciting news to come.\n“Uncle. Soon to be father. Traveler. Actor. Goof.” Yep, it says it right there in totally low-key terms. Colton’s letting us all know that he’s soon to be a father. And we think that all the congratulations are in store for the adorable couple.\nColton Haynes Instagram A post shared by Colton Haynes (@coltonlhaynes) on Feb 26, 2017 at 1:03pm PST \nColton and Jeff seem so incredibly happy, so it’s no wonder that they’re starting a family ASAP.\nColton also posted this very cryptic Instagram from the pool. Sunday Fun Day. Covering that layer of pregnancy while I can @jeffleatham lol!!! \nA post shared by Colton Haynes (@coltonlhaynes) on Mar 20, 2017 at 2:27am PDT \n“Sunday Fun Day. Covering that layer of pregnancy while I can @jeffleatham lol!!! ” Obviously, we know that Colton isn’t pregnant. But clearly, he’s hinting that he and Jeff are expecting. And he makes us LOL through our frustration that we don’t know more details.\nWe bet Colton will make an awesome dad, because he’s already so close with the rest of his adorable family. Sitting at home on a Friday night thinking about how important it is to have a solid relationship with ur family. I have to admit, I've shut a lot of ppl out in my life, including my family, & just want to say I am sorry. I wear my heart on my sleeve & never have the intention to hurt anyone or anything. Just feeling a bit sad & wish I could be with my family at all times so I can make up for lost time \nA post shared by Colton Haynes (@coltonlhaynes) on Jul 8, 2016 at 10:31pm PDT \nSo sweet! We wish all the best to Colton and Jeff. And we can’t wait to hear more about their expanding family!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:29:59.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
