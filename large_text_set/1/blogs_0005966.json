That didn’t happen and Samsung kept us waiting for a very long time until it finally kicked off the Gear S2 iOS beta program some four months ago. Just last month we reported on the leaked Gear Manager app for iOS which enabled Gear S2 and Gear S3 owners to use the smartwatch with their iPhones. The company is finally following through on the promise it made back in 2015. \nSamsung has officially announced today that the Gear S3, Gear S2 and Gear Fit 2 are now compatible with iOS. Users can download the Samsung Gear S app for the Gear S2 and the Gear S3 or the Gear Fit app for the Gear Fit 2 on compatible iOS devices from the App Store or via apps.samsung.com/gear. Once the relevant app has been downloaded, all users need to do is connect to their iOS device by tapping on “Connect to Gear” and the app will automatically sync with the wearable device. Bear in mind that features and functions will vary by device. \nCompatible iOS devices include all smartphones from the iPhone 5 and up running iOS 9.0 or above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:22:32.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
