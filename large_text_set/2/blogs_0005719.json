Anthony had been accused and subsequently acquitted of killing her 2-year old daughter in a case that garnered national attention.\nFootage from a local Florida newscast showed Anthony standing amongst other protesters at the Saturday evening rally. While she did not speak to WPTV's camera, she told them off-camera that she was against Trump's policies.\nThere were nearly three thousand protesters who participated in the march, which included people angered by Trump's executive order that temporarily restricts travel for refugees and immigrants from seven countries. There were no arrests during the march.\nFollowing Anthony's acquittal in 2011, she has stayed out of the spotlight, Fox News reported .\nCasey Anthony has laid low in the years since the jury acquitted her in 2011. Defense attorneys argued that her daughter drowned in a swimming pool. Crews found Caylee Anthony's remains inside a trash bag in the woods near the family's home in December 2008, months after she disappeared.\nYears later, Casey Anthony started getting \"bored,\" sources told People magazine last summer.\n\"She sort of lives like an old person, on a fixed income without much going on in her life,\" one source said. Anthony apparently set up a photography business but didn't seem to get many clients.\nThe march on Saturday headed two miles. Protesters shouted anti-Trump slogans and set up a flag-draped coffin that they said represented the death of democracy.\nThe post Casey Anthony Participated in An Anti-Trump March to Mar-a-Lago appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:51:28.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
