They inquired as to the availability and sign-ability of several marquee players at the position, but took a more modest road to improving their offense.\nA day after making a splash with the signing of towering receiver Brandon Marshall, the Giants took a more subtle route by adding tight end/fullback Rhett Ellison, a 28-year old former Vikings tough guy who is known primarily as a blocker.\nThe Giants gave Ellison a four-year, $18 million contract, with $8 million fully guaranteed, so they must really like what he brings to the field.\nThe five-year veteran caught only nine passes for 57 yards in 2016, starting six of the 15 games he played. In his career, Ellison has just 51 receptions for 515 yards and three touchdowns. His most productive season was 2014, when he caught 19 passes for 208 yards and one TD.\nThe Giants went without a fullback for the entire 2016 season. Will Johnson, the former Steelers fullback/tight end hybrid, was signed last year, but hurt his neck and spent the entire season on injured reserve. After Johnson went down and Nikita Whitlock was sidelined with a foot issue, head coach Ben McAdoo decided to go without a fullback on the roster. As it turned out, that hurt the running game and the pass protection. The Giants also did not have a tight end adept at blocking and went without a lead blocker in the backfield.\n“It just really depends on how things shake out, whether it’s the free agency market or it’s the draft class, it depends on what you have to choose from,” McAdoo said last week when asked about adding a fullback. “The guys on our roster going into the season, we had two players that we felt pretty good about playing fullback for us and neither of ’em stayed healthy and that was a part of it. For one reason or another they weren’t part of the team, so we had to go in another direction and we used what we had.’’\nJohnson has another year remaining on his contract and, if healthy, will compete for a roster spot.\nEllison is 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds and could be of blocking help to left tackle Ereck Flowers, if the Giants decide to keep their 2015 first-round pick at that spot. This move allows the Giants to look for a pass-catching tight end in an NFL draft that is stocked with talent at that position. Ellison, a 2012 fourth-round pick, was a team captain at USC in 2011, and the school created the Rhett Ellison “Machine’’ Trojan Way Leadership Award in his honor.\nThe Giants do not have the money to land any big-ticket tight end. Jack Doyle re-signed with the Colts on a three-year, $19 million deal, too rich for the Giants’ blood. The top left tackle on the market, 35-year old Andrew Whitworth, left the Bengals for a three-year, $36 million deal with the Rams. The Giants could not afford to go shopping in that district.\nThe Giants re-signed Orleans Darkwa on Thursday. AP Marshall’s contract officially comes in as a two-year, $11 million deal that includes a $2 million signing bonus, plus $1 million in incentives to push the potential total package to $12 million. The cap hit for the Giants in 2017 is $4.5 million, leaving them approximately $7.2 million under the cap. They will need to reshuffle some contracts or cut some players on the roster to get much else done in free agency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T04:25:19.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
