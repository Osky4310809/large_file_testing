It’s called Aurora, and it was designed and manufactured by BB Merah Putih, the company licensed to sell BlackBerry-branded devices in Indonesia.\nAurora is the first BlackBerry device with dual SIM card support, allowing users to juggle two numbers simultaneously. It is a midrange offering, featuring a 5.5-inch 720p display, a Snapdragon 425 processor, 4GB of RAM, a 3,000mAh battery, and 32GB of internal storage that can be expanded via the microSD card slot. Cameras include a 13-megapixel rear-facing shooter, and an 8-megapixel selfie sensor.\n\nAurora ships with Nougat pre-installed, and it will be available in black, silver, or gold. Those who pre-order the device for IDR 3,499,000 (approx. $260) will receive a free JBL Go speaker and an official smart flip case for free.\nIndonesia is one of the few countries that isn’t covered by BlackBerry’s deal with TCL, the Chinese firm responsible for the KeyOne and the DTEK series of devices. This allows BB Merah Putih to produce devices carrying the BlackBerry name. However, it means that it’s highly unlikely we’ll see the Aurora on sale in any other market.\nOf course, you probably will be able to import one to the U.S. and other territories by buying the Aurora online from a third-party seller, but we’ll be holding onto our cash for the KeyOne.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T15:08:14.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
