The result figures to be the most comprehensive overhaul since the first set of rules was published in 1744. \nBut in this case, the Rules of Golf actually shrunk. \nThe proposal, which now faces six months of public feedback, reduces the number of rules from 34 to 24. \nIn many cases, penalties have been rescinded.

That cost him a two-shot penalty in the 2003 Masters. Under the proposed rules, it wouldn’t be a penalty. \n“The primary objective was, ‘How do we make the rules easier to understand and easier to apply around the world,\"’ said Thomas Pagel, the USGA’s senior director of rules and amateur status. \n“I think what you’ll see is that part of this process is to evaluate all the outcomes and identify outcomes that are more reasonable and common-sense based.” \nRory McIlroy has been informed of the changes and liked what he heard. \n“I think golf’s emphasis on the rules can sometimes turn people away from it,” McIlroy said. \n“To modernise and make it simple is a good thing. With what’s happened in the last couple of years, with some rulings and high-profile things that have happened at crucial stages in tournaments, people who look at that and might want to get into the game say: ‘You know what? It’s too complicated.’ \n“Making them more modern to move with the times is good.” Adam Scott takes a penalty drop.

That is most prominent on the LPGA Tour. If the modern rules are adopted, caddies would have to move as soon as their players take their stances. \n“This is one we stepped back and said, ‘Aligning yourself is just fundamental to playing the game,\"’ Pagel said. \n“It’s not that caddies can no longer help the player. But when a player goes to set up to the ball, that challenge is the player’s.” \nAnother significant proposal, which got McIlroy’s attention, was how to drop. The goal was to get the ball back in play quickly. Modern rules would more easily identify where to drop, and players would only have to hold the ball above the ground without it touching anything. The recommendation is at least 1 inch above the ground or grass. Currently, players have to stand upright and hold the ball at shoulder height and arm’s length from their bodies. \nSeveral proposed rules were geared toward improving the pace of play, such as encouraging players to hit their shot when ready. Players would have only three minutes to search for a lost ball instead of five minutes. \n“It is important that the Rules continue to evolve and remain in tune with the way the modern game is played,” said David Rickman, executive director of governance for the R&A. \n“But we have been careful not to change the game’s longstanding principles and character.” While the Rules of Golf would only be 24 rules, that’s not to suggest 10 rules were simply eliminated. That indicates how the book was taken apart and put back together. \n“Probably a bit more than 10 went away,” Pagel said. Rickie Fowler of the United States.

Under the proposal, they can still use it. \n— Players who touched the line of their putts or the putting green in pointing out a target faced a two-shot penalty. The modern rule has no penalty, provided they are not improving the condition of the putt. \nRule changes to come into effect on January 1, 2019.
