I hate the track. \nI avoid the track because I hate the track. Advertisement \nQuote of the Day, motivation, and inspiration — every morning rundown \nAdvice on training, nutrition, shoes, and more — every evening Keep this field blank \nThe track works, they say. The track scolds you and coaxes you and inspires you. The track is where legs and lungs are are made stronger for the long haul. \nThe track is where lunches are lost, I say. Slow, fast, slow, fast, no, yes, no, yes. \n100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1200, 1600. Mix them up any way, like lottery numbers, and create your own workouts. \nFine. \nRELATED: 5 Speed Workouts Every New Runner Should Try \nBut I’ll still hate the track. \nIn the darkness of morning and the quietness of a still-sleeping campus, one runner loops the 8th lane, then the 7th, then the 6th in a workout that he does week after week. His steady pace is quicker than my fast one. Noticing this makes me realize it’s why I’m here. \nThe rule of the oval is that there are no bailouts. You map your plan, your times, and you stick to them. No matter what. \nNo matter how you feel. No matter what miles you did yesterday. No matter if lane 1 has puddles or boogers or other runners. No matter what. That’s why the track works, they say. \nFine. Go. \nDamn. Feel like an Amtrak, look like a tugboat. \nFirst week, ugh. Second week, less ugh. Third week, okay. Fourth week try to channel those who run on this oval at top speeds. Make the last one the best one, they say. \n#LastOneBestOne , they tweet. Last one best one is where they grow. \nGo x9. Three more. Last three best three, I say. Nail it on 10. Nail it on 11. Last one left. No bailouts. \nFine. Go. \nLast one best one, I crush. \nTrash can on the sidelines, I want. \nCooldown trot, I smile. \nI less-hate the track. I less-hate the track. \n* * * \nTed Spiker’s preferred oval is a hoagie roll.
