Most arenas achieve 60fps in up to four-player split-screen play too, apparently.\nDigital Foundry ran a Rocket League PS4 vs. Xbox One Face-Off last week and found PS4 hitting 60fps fairly consistently - a marked improvement over the game's performance when it launched.\nRocket League welcomes a couple of paid-for cars today as well.
