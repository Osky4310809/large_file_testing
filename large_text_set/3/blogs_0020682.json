In a Facebook post created last Wednesday (March 15), the band reacted negatively to a paparazzi photo originally posted by Daily Mail that caught West going out for dinner in Los Angeles wearing a long-sleeved T-shirt displaying the name of the outrageously dark Suffolk outfit. \n“Kanye West. Cradle Of Filth fan. Fortunately not a collaborator,” the post read, making it clear the members of the group want nothing to do with Yeezy. West, however, presumably has better things to do than sweat what the longtime metal band thinks of him. The celebrated rapper was just featured on Drake’s recent More Life track, “Glow,” and is most likely working on some kind of masterpiece that may or may not involve a NASA theme.
