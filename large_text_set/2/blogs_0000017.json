The cruel nurse then slams Betty back into the seat with force (Photo: SWNS.com) \nBetty's family immediately reported the disturbing recording to police. \nBegum, who worked as an auxiliary nurse, avoided jail when magistrates handed her a 12-month community order with 40 hours of unpaid work and fined her £270. \nShe was caught on September 15 last year. \nBetty, who has four grown-up children and is a grandmother of 10, is heard screaming in pain as the carer roughly pulls her forward as she tries to change her. \nProsecutor Noreen Ashraf told the court Betty was \"left slumped in her chair with significant leaning to her side\" after the incident.

The defendant forces her arm and pushes her back into the chair. \n\"The complainant cries out. She slams her head back into the chair with significant force to cause the chair to rock.\" \nBegum said she accepted her actions were \"reckless rather than intentional or deliberate\" in a letter read out in court. \nNazia Jan, defending, said Begum was \"very, very remorseful\". The spy cam found two occasions in which Betty appears to have been mistreated (Photo: SWNS.com) \nShe added: \"It's cost her her chosen career. \n\"This act was completely out of character, blemished her good character and caused her unquantifiable distress.\" \nThe secret camera also captured footage of another carer spraying deodorant over Betty, who tells her to \"stop it\" in the same week. \nIn the footage, the woman can be heard laughing and saying \"better than poo\" when a colleague, who is also in the room, says \"it's really gone in my mouth\". \nWest Midlands Police said a 43-year-old woman had been voluntarily interviewed \"in connection with an assault on a 77-year-old woman in a care home\". \nA spokesperson for the force said inquiries were ongoing relating to the deodorant incident. \nSpeaking after Begum was sentenced, Betty's relatives hit out at the sentence and said she should have been jailed.

Within four days we had the footage of Begum slamming her head into the chair. \n\"I felt sick as a dog when I saw that. We went straight down there and called the police. \n\"The sentence was a disgrace. She should have gone to prison. That would have send a message to other carers who treat people like this. \n\"I am disgusted by what she did. But I also feel sorry for her because she has to live with it for the rest of her life.\" \nGranddad-of-one Nigel said the family were also horrified when they saw footage of the carer spraying deodorant in Betty's face. \nHe added: \"That happened in the same week.
