Eggs are off the menu in Flavortown share Photo by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images for Planet Hollywood Observatory World-famous culinary dude Guy Fieri consumes only the boldest of flavors, and eggs simply don’t have what it takes. A recent Fieri interview with the Tampa Bay Times reveals the spiky-haired chef “notoriously” dislikes the breakfast staple: Oh, I eat eggs every once in a while. My buddy Andrew Zimmern, he was on the show in Minneapolis a couple of years ago, and they put a raw egg on the pizza and he said, \"C'mon, eat it.\" Alright. Hard-boiled and scrambled — that's just not the way I like to party. My wife will sit there and bust that yolk and scoop with the bread and the whole thing and … “That’s just not the way I like to party.” Classic Guy. The pizza in question was featured on an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives in 2012, and it’s from Minneapolis’s Pizzeria Lola. The eggs aren’t raw, but instead are served sunny-side up after spending a few minutes in the restaurant’s wood-burning oven. Watch the scene , and it’s clear Fieri has more than a small aversion. “No, don’t cut through the yolk!” Fieri exclaims in agony as chef Ann Kim slices into the pizza. Zimmern calls the pie “real food for cold-weather people,” and he declares even his young children would enjoy a slice. Fieri counters by saying the eggs on top are “liquid chicken.” The scene ends with the Mayor of Flavortown looking rather repulsed, and it’s unclear if he ever works up the nerve to take a bite. It’s no surprise a quick scan of Fieri’s restaurant menus reveals no egg-centric dishes to be found. Though, there are some Caesar salads with “housemade dressing.” Hopefully no one has shown the Food Network star an ingredient list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:10:58.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
