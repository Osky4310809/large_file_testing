But if she feels that she needs to quit, then she is free to do so.” \n“But as far as I know, she still said that she would be continually supporting the President in whatever capacity that she has,” he added.   \nUson, who has been using her blog to support Duterte and to malign and discredit Duterte’s critics, including the media, was appointed to the MTRCB last December. \nHer appointment to the board, which is tasked to censor television and movie materials, raised eyebrows due to her stint as a sex adviser and leader of the all-female sexy dance group Mocha Girls.
