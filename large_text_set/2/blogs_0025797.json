She is the daughter of Susan Wiles, Trumpâ€™s Florida campaign director. Caroline resigned Friday before the background check was completed. \nShe was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. Two sources close to Wiles said she will get another job in the Treasury Department. \nLansing left February 9, after working through the issue. His official file says he left on his accord. \nThe intensive background check includes questions on the applicant's credit score, substance use and other personal subjects.
