The chick-shaped marshmallow candy Peeps might not be your favorite (guilty as charged), but they are working on changing your mind — and hard. That’s because Peeps have launched Delights and if marshmallow alone doesn’t satisfy your sweet tooth, these dipped Delights are a game changer.\nIf you’re always delighted (sorry, had to do it) to indulge in a sugary Peep — whether you celebrate Easter or not — then these new flavors will either be an added incentive to bite into one or you just might think they are screwing up a great tradition. Yet, Peeps having inventive flavors (like cinnamon roll!!) is nothing new.\nActually, these old school treats are pretty cutting edge since they have partnered with other companies to bring the world Peeps-flavored milk (uh what?) and the newly-released Peeps Oreos . Peeps Oreos have popped up on Walmart.com! I wouldn't run out just yet, but this does mean they should be out soon let us know if you find them! #thejunkfoodaisle \nA post shared by The Junk Food Aisle (@thejunkfoodaisle) on Feb 15, 2017 at 6:06am PST \nYet, even if milk or Oreos go just too far for you, these Delights sound universally tasty for Peeps lovers and non-Peeps lovers alike.\nThat’s because they are dipped in CHOCOLATE and FLAVORED FUDGE. To help you wrap your head around all 12 – yes, 12! — of these delicious-sounding Peeps , here’s the breakdown:\n1. Milk chocolate \nA traditional marshmallow peep dipped in milk chocolate.\n2.

This is gonna be one Peep-filled Easter.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:07:40.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
