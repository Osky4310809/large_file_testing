Even if you think you’re very good at leading, you probably don’t understand your own leadership approach much. When you can figure out the pros and cons of your leading style, you peak your leadership skills. No one is perfect, so is any kind of leading style. \nSome leadership types work best in specific occasions, while not really well in others. For example, leaders who put a lot of emphasis on the vision can get team members to achieve greater things by providing them a clear direction; yet if the vision is a bit far from reality, it can cause low team morale. \nNo matter what your management style is, you need to understand your own strengths and weaknesses, so you can amplify your strengths and improve your weaknesses. \nThe simple flowchart created by Headway Capital helps you identify the type of leader you are, and provide you with some handy tips to make you a more charismatic leader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:35:15.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
