The interview was released by CNN on Monday. \n\"You know, I am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I -- if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\" Obama said. \nHis comments were part of a wider discussion of what he called \"ugly\" sentiments of racism and xenophobia that surfaced during the 2016 campaign. \nObama repeated his assertion that Clinton faced a double standard as a woman, which put her at a disadvantage. \nBut he also said a kind of complacency set in that made the Clinton campaign too cautious and thus unable to get its message out sufficiently. \n\"If you think you're winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer,\" Obama said. \nDuring the interview, Obama also spoke of his family, the strength he'd gotten from wife Michelle and the improbability of his own political career. \nAnd the president said the spirit that his candidacy originally inspired, especially among young people, was \"never snuffed out\" despite the last eight years of turmoil. \n\"The idealism and the dedication stayed with the staff and got us through some really hard times,\" he said. \nTrump later responded to the remarks on Twitter. \nUPDATE \n2:07 p.m.: This article was updated with Trump's response. \nThis article was originally published at 12:28 p.m. White House Dec. 23, 2016, 2:28 p.m. Reporting from Honolulu Michael A. Memoli (Justin Lane / European Pressphoto Agency) \nPresident Obama personally directed Friday that the U.S. abstain from a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement activity, seeing the escalation of settlement building as an increasing threat to the viability of a two-state solution to the region's problems. \nAhead of the expected vote, Obama, who is vacationing with his family in Hawaii, convened a discussion Thursday with Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and other top national security officials. \nThe vote was postponed, but U.S. officials continued to monitor discussions over the Egyptian-authored resolution until Friday. Obama spoke with national security advisor Susan Rice on Friday to issue his final decision. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s intervention in the discussions, which included a conversation with Egypt’s president Thursday that preceded the delay in the planned vote, did not affect Obama’s calculations, deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters.. \n“There’s one president at a time,” he said. \nThe decision to allow the resolution to pass, rather than cast a veto to block it “is consistent with long-standing, bipartisan U.S. policy” opposing Israeli settlement activity, Rhodes said. \nOne of the administration’s great concerns was that such activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem “has accelerated significantly” since 2011, when the U.S. last vetoed a comparable resolution. \nU.S. officials also have been concerned about continued incitements of violence by Palestinians, and Rhodes said the resolution voted on Friday included greater balance to reflect that than past resolutions. \n“We’ve been very concerned that these accelerating trends are putting the very viability of the two-state solution at risk,” Rhodes said. “In that context, we therefore thought that we could not in good conscience veto a resolution that expressed concerns about the very trends that are eroding the foundation for a two-state solution.” \nHe also underscored what he called Obama’s iron-clad commitment to Israel and its security, noting that the administration recently concluded a major military assistance package. \nThe U.S. did not vote for the resolution because of continued concerns about the United Nations as a venue for Middle East peace discussions, Rhodes said. \nHe also responded to what he called “strident” comments of Israeli officials criticizing the U.S. move. “It seems like the Israeli government wants the conversation to be about anything other than the settlement activity,” he said. Dec. 23, 2016, 9:50 a.m. Trump team seeks to ease fears on women's programs at State Department Tracy Wilkinson (Andrew Harnik / Associated Press) \nDonald Trump's transition team said Friday its requests to the State Department for details on positions and funding for global women's programs were part of an effort to \"ensure and protect\" gender equality. \nThe statement appeared to be an attempt to allay concerns that Trump might seek to cancel or roll back gender-focused programs at the State Department following a request by the transition team on Wednesday for information about them. \nMost were created or championed by Trump's campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, when she served as secretary of State during President Obama's first term. \nThe transition team statement Friday did not outline Trump's plans for the programs, which seek to promote equality, education and vocational training for women around the world as well as combat gender-based violence. \n\"President-elect Trump will ensure the rights of women across the world are valued and protected,\" the statement said. \n\"To help fulfill this promise, the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State Department that helps [sic] foster gender equality, ends gender-based violence, and promotes economic and political participation — finding ways to improve them.\" \nThe statement said the inquiry was one of hundreds of requests it sent to federal departments as part of the transition effort. Dec. 22, 2016, 11:49 a.m. Tracy Wilkinson \nDonald Trump’s transition team has asked the State Department for details on programs aimed at benefiting women around the world, including identifying staff members who worked to reduce gender-based violence and promote women in the workplace. \nIn an email sent to numerous State Department offices Wednesday, the president-elect’s transition team asked for urgent response to its inquiries about “gender-related staffing, programming and funding.” \nMany of the programs were begun or were championed by Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of State during President Obama’s first term and who lost to Trump in November. \nThe unusual request to the State Department follows a similar email to the Department of Energy. There the transition team asked for names of staff members who had worked on efforts to combat climate change, which Trump has dismissed as a hoax. \nSeveral Obama administration officials called that query chilling. The Trump team withdrew the request after it was widely criticized. \nThe latest email suggests the incoming Trump administration will attempt to roll back some of the State Department's most innovative programs and may seek to penalize people who worked on them. \n“People are freaked out,” said a senior State Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly. \nThe email asked the State Department to deliver “issue papers from bureaus and offices (one paper max per bureau/office) outlining existing programs and activities to promote gender equality, such as ending gender-based violence, promoting women’s participation in economic and political spheres, entrepreneurship, etc.\" \nIt said the issue papers should note jobs \"whose primary functions are to promote such issues,\" as well as money allocated for those activities and programs in fiscal year 2017. \nWhile at State, Clinton made women's issues a top priority. \nAn office was created to deal exclusively with “global women’s issues,” and money was allocated for programs that promote education of girls, train women in marketable skills and offer microloans. Dec. 22, 2016, 11:34 a.m. Trump taps seasoned Republican operative Sean Spicer as White House press secretary Lisa Mascaro Sean Spicer (Associated Press) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump named Sean Spicer as his new press secretary, tapping a seasoned Republican operative as the public face of the new White House. \nSpicer, a top Republican National Committee strategist who brought a measure of establishment Washington to Trump's operation, is known for his combative but engaging approach to communications. \nHe will likely take over the press podium as the top spokesman at the incoming White House. \nTwo other veterans of the Trump campaign's press operation also will get White House jobs: Jason Miller, who had been Trump's communications chief after moving from the campaign of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, will stay in that role as communications director at the White House. \nHope Hicks, who was Trump's spokesperson on the campaign trail and one of his earliest campaign aides, will be assistant to the president and director of strategic communications, and Dan Scavino will serve as director of social media. “Sean, Hope, Jason and Dan have been key members of my team during the campaign and transition. I am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will Make America Great Again,” Trump said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T22:22:55.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
