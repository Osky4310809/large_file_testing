Every timetable change means working through what that means in cost terms.” \nBusiness groups were outraged that commuters could face almost two more years of disruption. Tim Cobb, president of the Eastbourne Chamber of Commerce said: “This is clearly very, very bad news for the long suffering, distressed commuters of south of England. I had hoped that the fall in the share price of Go Ahead today would give management the impetus to sort this out but it is clearly not top of their agenda. Every day I hear more stories of people just giving up on London .” Property price slump along Southern Rail line \nBut Mr Brown insisted he could “guarantee that by the end of 2018 — when London Bridge infrastructure is finished and the last timetable change is in place — the major issues should be resolved and people will have a much better service. But it’s still dependent on good industrial relations. \n“Until then, we do believe we can improve things: over the past few weeks, we have operated a decent service with fewer than 20 trains cancelled per day, out of 2,500, which is down from 600 daily cancellations at the height of the industrial issues.” Southern commuters are braced for continued travel misery (Jeremy Selwyn) \nSouthern, used by 300,000 passengers a day in Sussex, Surrey and south London, has been hit by 29 days of strike by the RMT and Aslef unions over the past year including a total three-day shutdown in December. The RMT has called for urgent talks ahead of a meeting to discuss further strikes. \nMr Brown said Go-Ahead was in discussions with the Government about recouping expenses it has had to pay due to the Southern disruption. \nHe said: “A lot of this industrial action has been beyond our control, but involved an awful lot of costs for us. We need to be recompensed for them. On some issues the Government will agree with us, on some it won’t.” \nMr Brown — recently the subject of “wanted” posters of the “dirty half dozen Great Train Robbers” blamed by commuters for Southern’s continuing strikes — ruled out handing the franchise back to the Government. \n“It can only get better,” he said. “Some of the infrastructure changes are coming good, we’re getting more trains in, and hopefully we can resolve the industrial relations issues. But I appreciate that if you’re a passenger waiting for your train, you’re not happy with that.” \nMr Brown said: “Our customers have suffered months of disrupted travel, impacting work and family lives and we are sorry that such inconvenience and hardship has been caused.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T09:33:37.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
