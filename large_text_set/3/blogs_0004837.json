And they’ve got to make a choice... maybe, rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to spend hundreds of dollars on, maybe they should invest in their own healthcare .\" \nThe Hill notes that Chaffetz went on to explain how the plan eliminates parts of ObamaCare that “people said that they don’t want,” referring to the individual mandate, which requires people to purchase health coverage or pay a fine. GOP Rep. Chaffetz: Americans may need to choose between \"new iphone... they just love\" and investing in health care https://t.co/5Hxwn2uOl5 \n— New Day (@NewDay) March 7, 2017 \nOf course, such honesty comes at a price and liberals across the nation seized on the cruelness of making Americans choose between health and Insta-chatting. Chaffetz was quick to clarify on FOX News... \nANCHOR: I want to give you a chance to respond to comments too that you made on CNN about people making a choice between buying an iPhone and buying healthcare. And you said people are going to have to make sacrifices. Some folks didn't like the way that came out and suggesting that some people, especially those who are in the lower income brackets are going to have to give up things in order to make sure they're covered. \n\nCHAFFETZ: Well, what we're trying to say and maybe I didn't say as smoothly as I possibly could, but people need to make a conscious choice and I believe in self-reliance . And they're going to have to make those decisions. We want people to have access to an affordable healthcare product. \nSelf-Reliance? Blasphemy in the new normal!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:35:51.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
