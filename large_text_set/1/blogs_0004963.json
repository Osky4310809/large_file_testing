Slaven Bilic has admitted his admiration for Defoe and Hogan \n\"We are not going to discuss the players that are not ours at the moment,\" Bilic said. \"The chairman is trying really hard to get some players, in a position that we need. But I am not going to talk about names here in public.\" \nHe did, however, expand on Defoe and Hogan. \nOn the Sunderland striker, Bilic said: \"I said last time that he does the things that are the most important in football; score goals. West Ham 0-2 Man Utd \n\"He did that last year and he was probably the main reason Sunderland stayed up. He is doing it again this season, but he is also making chances and making them into goals.\" \nHogan, 24, has scored 14 goals in 26 appearances this season and Bilic said: \"Scott is a good player. I watched him a few times. Scott Hogan has scored 14 league goals this season \n\"He is, again, scoring goals. He is very sharp, quick. A good finisher - doing it in the Championship, young and a good prospect.\" \nZaza has failed to score in his five Premier League appearances this season and Bilic confirmed West Ham will be looking to offload the Italy international. Simone Zaza has played his last game for West Ham \n\"Zaza came to West Ham,\" he added. \"We wanted him and he wanted to come. Maybe his wish was to stay in Italy but because of his contract, I can say that his story with West Ham has finished. \n\"He is still our player until he goes somewhere, but mainly because of the situation with his contract he is finished here. Nobody knows what happens in football. He is definitely a good player. It just wasn't to be. \n\"Unfortunately we had to judge him on six, seven games, which is not big amount to judge a player in general.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T13:36:19.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
