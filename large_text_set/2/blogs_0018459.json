While there is a general reason for the number appearing, only the person who keeps seeing the number will be able to work out the exact reason why. \nGuidance comes in many forms, and sometimes it arrives in the least expected of ways, so it can take a little time to figure out its meaning. There are many of us who notice that numbers regularly appear in particular sequences on clocks, phones, registration plates, checks or receipts. This is simply the universe’s way of communicating with us through signs and synchronicity. \nBelow I have written an outline description to explain the meaning of each number sequence. It is then possible to decipher the true meaning of these sequences appearing, when relating it back to each individual’s circumstances. \nNumber 2. \nThe number 2 is the most feminine of all the numbers, and its vibration resonates with the vibration of joy, balance and peace. It relates to the desire for love, health, harmony and happiness within all relationships, and those who see this number regularly are authentic, artistic, creative, tolerant, emotional, highly sensitive, loyal, devoted and intuitive. \nThis number asks us to have faith and trust wholeheartedly in our inherent supernatural abilities, so that we can gain valuable insight into our relationships as well as our circumstances. \nThis number is the most underestimated number, as it is both strong and graceful at the same time; its shape bends but never breaks under pressure. When the going gets tough, the number 2 arrives to show us that we can adjust to our circumstances, as we have a great deal of empathy and understanding. \nDespite adversities, we remain fair, flexible and adaptable, so we are able to compromise and maintain peace. \nWhen the number 2 appears, it is a nudge to surrender to universal energy. We should maintain faith and courage, as whatever we are hoping to achieve is in the process of manifesting, even if it seems like nothing is happening. Our patience is being tested, but everything is playing out exactly how it needs to, so that we learn valuable lessons on our destined journey. \nThis number is a warning to use our intuition to sense those who could cause us drama or destruction. We are being told to be wary of people we feel exhausted around, as those who consistently need attention and validation are attracted to the calming, soothing, healing energy of those who vibrate on the same frequency as the highly charged number 2. \nThe number 2 comes to us as a reminder to be true to ourselves, while also being thoughtful, compassionate and considerate, so that we don’t offend or upset those closest to us while we focus intently on our soul’s calling. \nNumber 22. \nThe person who sees number 22 is a master builder. Number 22 is possibly the most powerful and successful number to receive as a sign, as it means that we can master anything we set our minds to. It represents ancient wisdom, transformation, the manifestation of dreams, evolution, creation, intuition, light, universal love, an idealistic future and turning our imagination into reality. \nIt appears as a sign to let us know that we are on the right path and to keep moving optimistically along it, as everything is working in our favor and with divine timing to assure a successful outcome. As with everything, this number has a shadow side, which can represent nervous energy, anxiety and stubbornness. We are being asked to look at ways we can alleviate anything that causes our energy to become tense and constricted, as we need our energy focused on materializing our ambitions, dreams and goals. \nThe number 22 is an expansion of the number 11, which is the root of the number 22. There is four times more power, vibrational energy and responsibility held in the number 22 than there is in the number 11. Number 22 represents the continuation and accomplishment of the intentions we sent out into the universe when we previously frequently saw the number 11. \nWhen the number 22 appears, it is a reminder that it is essential to build a firm foundation for the plans we are making. When we see this number regularly, we will likely have greater insight and vision into the completion of plans than others who are working on the same project. Therefore, we have the responsibility of accomplishing everything that is intended, as others won’t have the same positive outlook and belief in the grand dream. This is possible by keeping the mind free from fearful, doubtful, pessimistic, negative, repetitive thoughts. \nWhen we see this number regularly, it means we have a strong calling to achieve our soul’s purpose, and the plans that are in progress are for something that will benefit humanity or Mother Earth. The reason for this is that the number 22 has conscious awareness closely connected to it. \nNumber 222. \nThe number 222 carries attributes of both the number 2 and 22, so it is an extremely powerful number to receive. The vibrational energies of 222 are extremely high, and it is a positive reminder that everything is in divine order and that there is no need for negative thoughts or concerns. Worries and doubts eat away at our energy reserves, and the number 222 appears to comfort us whenever anxiety tries to creep in. \nThe vibrational qualities of this number represent introversion, acceptance, inner strength, knowledge, forgiveness, harmony and humbleness. This number is a blessing from the universe and an encouraging sign to keep on believing in ourselves, and our dreams, and to move forward with a bright, optimistic and positive mindset. \n222 appears regularly when we are being asked to pay particular attention to our friendships, relationships and to certain people whose names appear suddenly or we bump into unexpectedly. \nWhen we witness the number 222 around the same time as we see or hear about a particular person, they likely have an important message for us, or their presence in our life has a profound meaning. Therefore, we are being called to open to them to discover what the connection holds in store. \nIf the number occurs in sequence with someone we are currently in a relationship with, it is a sign that all is well, and that our union is fulfilling and has been written in the stars. Regardless of whether the relationship lasts a week or a lifetime, it has occurred in our life for an essential reason. \nWhen we see this number, it is a nudge to let go of someone or something that may be causing us pain or hindering us in any way. It is a time for releasing old hurts, healing wounds and surrendering to the beauty of the present moment. \nNumber 2222. \nAgain, this number is an immensely powerful one, as it carries the vibrational energy described in 2 and 22. When 2222 appears, it shows that we are maintaining a balance in our lives, despite the ups and downs. It also signifies that whatever plans and dreams we previously set intentions on are manifesting just as we hoped. \nThis number represents balance, decisiveness, serenity and tranquility. It assures us that nothing happens by accident, and that everything we intuitively choose is brought to us for a greater reason that will unfold when divine timing is right. \n2222 also comes to let us know that we can place our trust in the excitement that occurs when we begin a new venture. When we see this number, we are receiving a spiritual push to encourage us to let go of one thing that is limiting and no longer serves us and to pick up something new that will nourish and deeply satisfy our soul. \nIt is a sign that our life is healthy and balanced, so we can have peace of mind to know that as long as we continue being mindful and remain consciously aware of our words and actions, everything we have been working toward will be effortlessly accomplished. Therefore, we can relax and reap the rewards of all our hard work, knowing that the universe is supporting us and will offer a guiding light whenever we need one. \nIf we are going through a particularly difficult time when this number regularly appears, it is a sign that our troubles will soon pass, and there are lighter, brighter days on the horizon, so we need to keep moving forward with hope and faith. \n2222 is telling us that it’s really time to listen to our intuitive heart and follow it faithfully, as the heart knows the way to our greatest desires. A positive, inspirational affirmation will work miracles right now if we put enough belief into it while we are chanting. \nOverall, this number is saying to us that we should not give up hope, despite how difficult things may seem, because our struggles are temporary. We are moving in the right direction, and all will be revealed in divine timing. Whenever something doesn’t work out as we might have hoped, this is actually the universe doing us a favor, and it is actually because there is something far better planned. \nThis J.M. Storm quote aligns perfectly with 2222: “Keep going. Magic happens when you don’t give up, even when you want to. The universe always falls in love with a stubborn heart.” \nWhen certain numbers spontaneously appear, it is not a coincidence. There is great benefit to paying attention to the meaning that they have in our lives. \nThe universe works in mysterious ways, and everything within it carries an energetic vibration. When our vibration matches the same vibration as the entities out there, we are being assured that we are safe and protected and are being shown subtle signs that proving miracles can happen. \n.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:01:37.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
