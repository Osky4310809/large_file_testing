When the pressure to be royally perfect becomes too much for Mal, she returns to her rotten roots on the Isle of the Lost where her archenemy Uma, the daughter of Ursula, has taken her spot as self-proclaimed queen of the run-down town. Uma, still resentful over not being selected by Ben to go to Auradon Prep with the other Villain Kids, stirs her pirate gang including Captain Hook’s son Harry and Gaston’s son Gil, to break the barrier between the Isle of the Lost and Auradon, and unleash all the villains imprisoned on the Isle, once and for all. \nEmmy Award-winning director Kenny Ortega ( Descendants , “High School Musical” movies, 2016’s “The Rocky Horror Picture Show”) returns as director, executive producer and choreographer of Descendants 2 . \nDove Cameron (“Liv and Maddie”), Cameron Boyce (“Gamer’s Guide to Pretty Much Everything,”“Jessie”), Booboo Stewart ( X-Men Days of Future Past ), Sofia Carson (“Adventures in Babysitting”) and Mitchell Hope are reprising their starring roles as Mal, Carlos, Jay, Evie and King Ben, respectively. China Anne McClain (“A.N.T. Farm”) will join the cast as Uma, the daughter of Ursula from The Little Mermaid . Casting will be announced soon for additional new characters, including the progeny of villains Captain Hook and Gaston. \nLauded writers Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon (“The Starter Wife,”“Runaway Bride”), who won a 2016 Writers Guild Award for Descendants , wrote Descendants 2 and will also executive-produce with Wendy Japhet ( Descendants , An Education , The Italian Job ). “Descendants” costume designer Kara Saun (“Project Runway”) and production designer Mark Hofeling (“Teen Beach Movie,”“High School Musical”) are also signed on for the sequel.
