This instruction comes from the Public Works department (JKR) citing concern over the safety of motorcyclists taking shelter under fly-overs and bridges when it rains. \nAccording to JKR, such shelters are necessary as stopping by the roadside under bridges to avoid inclement weather is unsafe, Bernama reports. In a statement, JKR stated the design of such shelters should place emphasis on the safety of motorcyclists, and should incorporate all necessary safety elements. \nIn addition, JKR believes special motorcycle lanes should also be built along highways, considering the increasing number of fatalities involving motorcyclists along highways. Such safety measures will include guide lines for motorcycles, as well as the amenities and design for motorcycle lanes. \nMeanwhile, the Malaysian highway authority has proposed that the building of dedicated motorcycle shelters along highways should be made compulsory and part of the conditions of the concession agreement.
