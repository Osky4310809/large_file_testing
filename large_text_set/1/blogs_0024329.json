It all helps!\nSee if any of these ideas stick with you:\n1. The financial notebook \nThis one comes from Sarah who shared it on Millionaire Day this year:\n\"I started keeping a financial 'notebook.' I write in it every time I do something that moves me closer to the FI mark. (Ok,  so I am rather liberal with what counts … reviewing the kids' 529s counts, as much as paying an extra $100 to the debt monster.) Flipping through it helps keeps me motivated in the dry spells and reminds me when it's time to review some bill or policy!\"\nSo pretty much, a financial diary. Which is much more juicier than a normal one, if you ask me!\n\n\n2. An awesome way to charge your kids rent \nFrom Paul:\n\"I am going to provide my kids a (mostly) judgment-free place to live when they are done with schooling. My only caveat is I will charge them rent, and that rent will be in the form of proof that they are maxing their 401(k) and IRA and investing 50% of their net pay. As long as they do that, they can live here until they get married.\"\nAnother great benefit: They'll be able to move out faster with all that money saved!\n\n\n3. Chart your net worth progress against your goals \nLOVE LOVE LOVE this from Bill Furst:\n\"I wanted to pass along a neat little tracker I put together that I use monthly (now, and previously just yearly) with my own net worth updates. It basically tells me that I am on track for my retirement goal ($$ and time) with a visual chart. The larger the green section, the more ahead I am. You just input in the grey boxes and the yellow parts calculate for you.\n\"I filled this in with your stats dating all the way back from 2008  … I did yearly from 2008-2015, and then monthly from 2016 on. Line 8 is your historical net worth amounts. I don't know what your time line is for your cool $1M, but if it's 2020, you're ahead of the game.\"\nSo smart, right? Looks like the first year and a half I was falling short of my goal of \"a million,\" but from there we took off and are set to hit it earlier than expected. I really like this because it gives you a super fast idea of how well you're doing or not in relation to your OWN goals and not anyone else's. And it'll now be yet another addition to my sturdy spreadsheet I've been tweaking over the years — woo!\nI'll have to make a template of it one day for y'all, but for now here's the spreadsheet Bill created for any of you who'd like to copy/test it out yourself: Net Worth Comparison Chart .\nThanks Bill! (And your wife is right — you totally need to share your thoughts online somewhere! Start a blog already so we can check out all your other ideas you've got brewing.)\n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T21:20:06.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
