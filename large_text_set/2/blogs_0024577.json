Pictures: Peter Kelly Annangrove Public School adds sunglasses to school uniform policy Jessica Oxford, Hills Shire Times February 24, 2017 11:30am \nANNANGROVE Public School students will be one of the cool kids, donning shades to protect their eyes from the sun’s glare. \nThe Parents and Citizens Association agreed to incorporate sunglasses into the Annangrove Rd school’s uniform policy. \nSecretary Kylie Seward said it was an unanimous decision. \n“We had School Shades come out to talk to us about eye safety and he said that wide-brimmed hats only block out 50 per cent of the sun’s UV rays,” she said. media_camera Joel Lewis, Osha Kadirpur and Georgia Candy are one of the first to wear the school’s new sunglasses. \n“It’s very important for their eye health and will be part of the uniform policy all year round.” \nPrincipal Paddy Rich said it was a logical step forward for the 82-student school. \n“We are delighted to be able to offer our students School Shades sunglasses to wear at school,” he said. \n“Wearing a hat has been part of our uniform for some time now but we have decided our students needed an extra layer of protection from harmful UV rays that School Shades can provide.” \nWith schools such as Epping Public School, Broken Hill North Public School and Mudgee Public School on board with the cool shades, Annangrove Public is one of the first schools in the Hills to incorporate shades into their uniform policy. \nThe maroon sunglasses come emblazoned with the school’s name and a hard case that can attach to the student’s school bag. media_camera Annangrove Public School has incorporated shades into their uniform policy. \nThe sunglasses will cost $15 but there will be discounts for multiple children. \nSave Sight Institute’s Dr Con Petsoglou said: “Recent Australian studies have demonstrated that sun-related eye conditions start at a young age. \n“Children as young as 8 years of age show permanent sun-related scarring on their eyes. Appropriately designed sunglasses do prevent this damage. Public health initiatives to protect children’s eyes and encourage sunglasses usage are vital for good eye health within our community.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:32:03.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
