He’s a huge liability in pass coverage, though. Maybe a change of scenery and lining up next to future HOF’er Mack will be good for him. Mar 20, 2017 4:11 PM \nHe sucks. Like a lot. hanspard says: Mar 20, 2017 4:13 PM \nI’m guessing the numbers were modest. We have a good track record of getting guys in free agendy at LB, having them perform well, then letting some other team throw too much money at them. Phillip Wheeler, Malcolm Smith, etc. My guess is this is the latest project. I’m sure his pay is in line with his experience.

Curtis Lofton was a major bust. None of the LBs drafted have performed overly well, either.
