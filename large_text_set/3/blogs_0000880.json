PUBLISHED: 19:01,   19:45, Tue, Feb 28, 2017 \nMr Hammond told Ms Creagh not to be “hysterical” during a parliamentary question session on the upcoming budget announcement, his comments prompted accusations of sexism from the Labour MP. \nMs Creagh asked the Chancellor whether reassurances could be offered to UK businesses to stop them moving to Ireland as Theresa May negotiates Britain’s departure from the European Union . \nThe Chancellor responded: “I would urge her not to be hysterical about these things; many companies are making contingency plans, including setting up the incorporating subsidiaries. \nIn an angry response to his comments, Ms Creagh said: “My question on the register of companies in Ireland had nothing to do with the condition of my womb travelling to my head – as is the traditional ‘hysterics’ rhetoric. PARL.TV Philip Hammond was accused of making sexist comments in the exchange I did not of course accuse her of being hysterical Philip Hammond \n“I expect that sort of language from sketch writers of the Daily Mail not from the Chancellor of the Exchequer.” \nThe word ‘hysterical’ is derived from the Greek for womb and is often considered derogatory and mostly directed towards women. \nMs Creagh added: “This sort of sexist language used to diminish women who make a perfectly reasonable point – that is the sort of language that would not be used had I been a man.” \nMr Hammond responded: “I did not, of course, accuse her of being hysterical – I urged her not to be hysterical. \n“But if my comments have caused her any offence I, of course, withdraw them unreservedly.” \nAnd Commons Speaker John Bercow added: “I thank the Chancellor for what he said. There is a difference between order and taste, and people will have their own view about taste. \n“But the point has been raised and the Chancellor has made a gracious statement in response. I think we should leave it there.” \nDuring the Commons debate, Ms Creagh claimed many UK firms have registered companies in the Republic of Ireland to “hedge their bets” due to uncertainty regarding regulation and policy following Britain’s vote to leave the EU. \n“Can he urge his Cabinet colleagues when they’re negotiating round the table to give policy and regulatory certainty to industries like the chemical industry who aren’t waiting to see what the Government is doing, but are simply haemorrhaging jobs and investment out of this country?” she asked. Who voted for Brexit?

Mr Hammond will make his announcement just after midday, once Prime Minister’s Questions have finished. \nHis announcement is likely to come under scrutiny after ministers were ordered to draw up plans for a fresh round of spending cuts of up to six per cent. \nTreasury Chief Secretary David Gauke wrote to Ministers asking them to draw up the plans for new cuts in their departmental budgets as part of plans to slash a further £3.5 billion a year from public spending. \nExpress.co.uk have contacted the offices of Mr Hammond and Ms Creagh for comment.
