It wasn't something I debated too much, maybe because my mom had a tubal ligation after she delivered her second child via C-section over 30 years before and still said it was no big deal, maybe because I wanted to control my reproductive life, and very possibly because my husband had made it very known that, considering I was already going through a surgery where sterilization could just be a fun add-on , a vasectomy was out of the question.\nAnd so, after I delivered my son three years ago, my husband went with him to recovery while I stayed in the O.R. by myself (minus the team of two doctors and a handful of nurses) for about another 20 minutes, where they officially closed down my baby-making parts, then wheeled me in to see my newborn. That, ladies, is efficiency.\nFor me, it was very easy (I realize that's not always the case ), didn't add any recovery time to my C-section , and has been complication-free ever since. Which is why I'm always surprised when my friends have C-sections knowing they are delivering their last baby and don't opt for a tubal ligation.\nRelated:\nBaby Jayden's Dramatic (and Early) Arrival Into the World\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/LLsm7XqYrH9qF15KW2ZKPAcGMks/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/09/800/n/24155406/075bcc52b4f3c5a5_8329139008_e7a3fb2195_o.png"], "published": "2017-03-20T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:48:53.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
