It’s not that there’s anything wrong with his old one, it’s just that he’s had it for 30 years and he’s ready to swap it out. Happily, celebrities ranging from Liam Neeson to Anna Kendrick to Rebel Wilson to Lin-Manuel Miranda were more than willing to offer their services, each vying pitifully to have their vocal cords associated with one of the greatest minds in modern physics.

Kylie Minogue, standing under the shade of a tree, insisted she should be his new voice, since all of her songs are about...science. Lin-Manuel rapped. \n“No.” Hawking said, his horror palpable.

He didn’t even have to audition. Figures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:31:55.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
