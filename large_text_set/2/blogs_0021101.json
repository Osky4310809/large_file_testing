Other times, only a towering tiara will suffice. \nKing Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain are currently hosting the President and First Lady of Argentina, Mauricio Macri and Juliana Awada, in Madrid. After welcoming the couple on Wednesday morning, they held a gala dinner at the city’s royal palace in honor of the Argentinian visit. \nAnd for the evening’s event, the always-chic Letizia , 44, broke out a tiara she has never worn before — one with a fair amount of historical significance. The piece is called the Fleur de Lys Tiara and is also known as La Buena . It was crafted in 1906 by still-existing jeweler Ansorena as a wedding gift from King Alfonso XIII to Queen Victoria Eugenia, who was the great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria . Borja Benito - Pool/Getty Images \nThe impressive diamond piece, which features a fleur-de-lis in the center, was last seen on the head of her mother in law, Queen Sofia, in 2014. It has passed from Spanish queen to Spanish queen through the generations, along with the diamond earrings and bracelets Letizia also wore last night. \nWith all that sparkle, she kept her clothes fairly simple in an elegant long-sleeved gown from Spanish designer Felipe Varela and a blue sash. Borja Benito - Pool/Getty Images \nNot to be outdone by Letizia’s epic jewels, Awada wore an embellished pink gown. The two woman clearly get along well — they entered the dinner arm-in-arm, laughing. \nWearing any tiara at all was already a big move for the Spanish queen, as she hadn’t worn a tiara in more than a year, but debuting this sparkler surely made up for the drought.
