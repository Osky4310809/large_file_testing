You were 56 years old. I was just a kid. But I saw the way my mother looked at you—the way some people look at a puppy, or a pack of cigarettes—and, I don't know, I guess I felt safe. She obviously loved you. Why shouldn't I?\nRelated 7 Valentine's Day Chocolates Better Than Russell Stover View article Not that it was love at first. How could it have been? Our meetings were too few and far between for anything serious to develop. I'd get to see you on Easter , and on those random occasions when somebody would show up with you for dinner. I always saw you on Valentine's Day , of course, but that hardly counted—everybody got a piece of you on Valentine's Day.\nNo, it wasn't until I was a teenager that I got any alone time with you. I remember the afternoon I found you hiding in a closet in the dining room. What were you doing hanging out in a closet? What was I doing hunting through a random closet in the middle of the day? We didn't ask questions. We didn't speak at all, actually.\nYou were so sweet. That was no surprise—that's what I had always liked about you. But throughout my high school years, I got to know you more and more. There was more to you than people gave you credit for. You gave me so much to chew over. And dude, you were so damn nutty sometimes.\nDid I think about you when I went away to college? I'll be honest: I didn't. You were my old life, my extremely weird life of hanging out in closets among fine china and silver trays. You were happy there. I wasn't. Not for nothing, but I slimmed down considerably after I left. You're still looking chunky, by the way—are you going to do something about that?\nSorry, sorry, I know that's harsh. I don't know, Russell, sometimes I don't know how to treat you. There's so much propaganda out there. People tell me you're cheap, and that you get around. I see you hanging out in drug stores, in airports—I think I saw you at a gas station once. That's a bad look, man!\nWhat am I supposed to tell my friends? They look me in the eye and say \"You still like Russell ? That stuff is so old.\" I tell them you aren't old, you're classic. They say you're undignified; I say you're American . \"There are more fish in the sea!\" they say. \"Look at everything that's open to you! Sample the goods! Get yourself a taste of it all !\" I could do that, I concede. Maybe I will. I have cravings, Russell. Like you wouldn't believe.\nBut who am I kidding. I'm coming back to you, Russell . I'm walking to the drugstore I saw you in this morning. I know you're going to be there waiting for me, and this time, I'm going to pick you up and carry you out of there. I'll whisper to you as I walk down the street, holding you in my arms. \"We aren't in the closet together anymore, Russell,\" I'll say. \"It's Valentine's Day, Russell. I choose you.\"\nCONTINUE READING tags: Valentine's Day Chocolate Dessert Preach", "external_links": ["http://www.russellstover.com/"], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:00:07.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
