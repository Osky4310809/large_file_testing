Mark Chelgren, a Republican. The legislation was filed on Monday.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm under the understanding that right now they can hire people because of diversity,‚Äù Chelgren told the Register . ‚ÄúThey want to have people of different thinking, different processes, different expertise. So this would fall right into category with what existing hiring practices are.‚Äù\nThe bill seeks to ‚Äúrequire partisan balance‚Äù of the faculty members who work at institutions governed by the Iowa Board of Regents, according to its text. That means the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa.\n[ A professor called Trump‚Äôs win ‚Äòan act of terrorism.‚Äô The student who filmed her got suspended. ]\nUnder the bill, a candidate would not be hired as a professor or instructor if their political party affiliation on their hire date would ‚Äúcause the percentage of the faculty belonging to one political party to exceed by ten percent the percentage of the faculty belonging to the other political party,‚Äù it states.\nState Sen. Mark Chelgren (R-Ottumwa). (Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo) Each year, the state commissioner of elections would turn over voter registration records to the universities that are governed by the Board of Regents, the bill states.\n‚ÄúThe Board of Regents is opposed to the bill,‚Äù spokesman Josh Lehman said in an email to The Washington Post. ‚ÄúWe expect our universities to hire the most qualified faculty to teach our students, and we believe in diversity of thought.‚Äù\nA person who does not declare a party affiliation ‚Äúneed not be considered in determining the political party composition of the faculty,‚Äù the proposed bill states.\n‚ÄúWe have an awful lot of taxpayer dollars that go to support these fine universities,‚Äù Chelgren told the Register. Students, he said, ‚Äúshould be able to go to their professors, ask opinions, and they should know publicly whether that professor is a Republican or Democrat or no-party affiliation, and therefore they can expect their answers to be given in as honest a way possible. But they should have the ability to ask questions of professors of different political ideologies.‚Äù\nChelgren ‚Äî who represents the Iowa Senate‚Äôs 41st District, in the southeastern part of the state ‚Äî told the Register that he was worried about ‚Äúextreme views on either side.‚Äù\nThe second-term senator did not immediately reply to an email or telephone message from The Post.\nRep. Mary Mascher, whose district includes the University of Iowa flagship campus in Iowa City, told the Register that she thought Chelgren‚Äôs proposal would discriminate against job candidates.\n‚ÄúWe do have a Constitution and it‚Äôs there for a reason, and it‚Äôs to try to protect equity and to make sure that we don‚Äôt judge people on the basis of their race or religion, their creed, their political beliefs,‚Äù Mascher, a Democrat, told the newspaper.\nIn an interview with NBC affiliate WHO , another Democrat, state Sen. Herman Quirmbach, called the bill ‚Äúone of the worst ideas I‚Äôve heard in 15 years here.‚Äù\n‚ÄúTo establish quotas by political party association in academic departments would just destroy our public universities,‚Äù he told the station.\nSF288 by sarah_larimer on Scribd\nRead More:\nHarvard law clinic sues DOJ over for-profit college case files\n‚ÄòMy family still could not afford to pay‚Äô: Despite generous financial aid, a top student struggles to get by\nA university takes on one of its own, alumna Kellyanne Conway", "external_links": ["http://whotv.com/2017/02/21/proposed-bill-would-base-university-hiring-on-balance-of-professors-political-ideology/", "https://twitter.com/@slarimer", "https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=87&ba=SF288", "https://www.scribd.com/user/31874448/sarah-larimer#from_embed", "http://www.iowaregents.edu/the-board/faq/what-is-the-board-of-regents/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPYihMwDxmS/", "https://www.scribd.com/document/339963752/SF288#from_embed", "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/20/iowa-senator-wants-political-balance-among-university-professors/98167182/"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:25:30.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
