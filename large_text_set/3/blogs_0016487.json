Sara C Nelson Senior Editor, The Huffington Post UK \nThe sunny spells of last week are all but a faded memory, for this week it’s going to be cold and wet with a chance of ice and snow. \nA wave of much colder air is coming our way, being pushed down from Arctic Canada, bringing temperatures down across the UK. \nYellow severe weather warnings have been issued for Monday night, into Tuesday morning, with a risk of ice and snow in most of northern Ireland and Scotland. — Met Office (@metoffice) March 20, 2017 Good morning, Turning cooler this week. Check out the 30 day outlook https://t.co/9SH5cv1dZO Hi, Rob here #loveukweather pic.twitter.com/kcD3CTnHIg — Met Office (@metoffice) March 20, 2017 \nThere will be heavy showers in the evening, with the chance of precipitation turning into snow in areas above 100m. \nBetween 1-3cm of snow are likely in many areas between 100-200m, and 5cm+ is expected above 300m. \nShowers will continue through Tuesday, with any lying snow at lower levels set to melt. Due to the unstable air, there is also a chance of wintry showers of hail and lightning – translating into an outside chance of thundersnow .
