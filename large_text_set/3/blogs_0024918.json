That's according to John Cross of the Daily Mirror , who reports Spurs have yet to pay the Dutch side the full Â£20 million fee owed but will sell the 22-year-old nonetheless. Per the report, Janssen could return to the Netherlands. Ian Walton/Getty Images The striker has yet to score a Premier League goal from open play and has found the net just once in 20 appearances in the league, per WhoScored.com . He's been used almost exclusively as a backup behind Harry Kane, who is currently sidelined with an injury. Per Cross, Janssen admitted earlier this week he's been frustrated with his poor form in the Premier League and has yet to adapt to the English game. The report comes at an odd time, just days after Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino backed the under-fire striker and said he'll play a bigger part moving forward, per sports writer Ben Pearce: Ben Pearce @BenPearceSpurs #thfc Pochettino on Vincent Janssen: \"He will have the possibility to play more and be more involved. I think he showed great energy.\" 3/19/2017, 5:34:51 PM Janssen's rise to the top of Dutch football was a steep one, as he played for minnows Almere City until 2015. He exploded in his one season with AZ and also impressed for the national team, prompting Spurs to bring him to north London. The move was a risky one, as Janssen really only had one good year on his resume. Per Cross, it seems Tottenham won't give the Dutchman more time to make good on his promise and large transfer fee. Janssen was part of a mixed batch of summer arrivals for Spurs, as Moussa Sissoko has also failed to make much of an impact. Per Cross, he too will likely be sold.
