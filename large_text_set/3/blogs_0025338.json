Players assume the role of a dog named Chado, but you'll also be able to develop his four companions as they embark on a sprawling adventure.\nEnigami estimated that the game would be roughly 20 hours long, which may be small by JRPG standards, but for a small indie studio that's pretty ambitious.\nShiness raised roughly $140k on Kickstarter back in the day before publisher Focus Home Interactive paired up with the developer.\nYou can currently pre-order Shiness on Steam where it's 15 per cent off at £21.24.", "external_links": ["http://store.steampowered.com/app/366640/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ps5Ah9guXmE"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:10:15.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
