Big battle today at Trump International with Clear CEO Garry Singer @McIlroyRory @PaulONeillYES @realDonaldTrump Drain the putt… pic.twitter.com/AZJqEVtlBT \nAfter the photo was posted, McIlroy — the third-ranked player in the world — received scathing criticism for his choice in golf partners. \nMany on Twitter expressed anger at the four-time champion. @BePeeArr one of my childhood heroes has unfettered access to the president and the only thing I feel is shame and anger.Nothing makes sense Why in heaven's name would Rory McIlroy play golf with Trump?I hope he never wins another tournament. \nWhile many of the tweets were critical of McIlroy, there were also tweets of support.

He’s a decent player for a guy in his 70s!” \nMcIlroy is not the only golf pro who has been invited to join Trump on the course. \nThe president has also played with Tiger Woods and Ernie Els since he took office.
