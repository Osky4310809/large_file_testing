With low counters and garage doors that open when the weather is nice, it was designed to welcome in the community. \n\"In some ways that makes us a really nice target,\" Hart said. \"You can get in and out of that cafe in less than 20 seconds with everything in the drawer, just by virtue of the way we structured it.\" \nHart said he's seen an increase in crime in the entire neighborhood, not just at the cafe. \nThe Mount Royal Improvement Association and the Maryland Institute College of Art will host a town hall meeting on safety issues from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Feb. 1 at Falvey Hall at 1300 W. Mount Royal Ave. \nCentral District police commander Maj. Kevin Jones could not be reached for comment for this story. \nHart said he's lost some employees due to the robberies. \n\"I’ve had staff who couldn’t take the stress or the pressure for obvious reasons,\" he said. \nAlthough people have been inside the restaurant during each incident, Hart said he's grateful no one has been hurt. He also noted that more customers are turning out to support Park Cafe in the wake of the robberies. \n\"On the opposite side of the tragedy,\" he said, \"here is the community pulling together and patronizing the cafe more than ever.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:57:11.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
