A majority of people were disgusted by the cartoon. Equating DeVos, a well-connected billionaire who paid her way into the Cabinet, with the heroic Ruby Bridges is ignorant and offensive. https://t.co/5Q2tGWb4Ob ‚Äî Tim Gibson (@timgibson) February 15, 2017 I'm disgusted.What we're NOT gonna do is compare Ruby Bridges to Betsy Devos.NOT TODAY.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:52:45.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
