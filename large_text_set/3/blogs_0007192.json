Also, a variety of student experiments submitted from schools across the United States were activated inside the orbital laboratory. \nDragon is due to return to Earth and splash down in the Pacific Ocean March 19. The resupply ship will carry back gear and science samples for analysis by NASA personnel. Plants that were grown on petri plates for the APEX-04 study will also be returned aboard Dragon. Astronaut Peggy Whitson harvested those plants today helping researchers study the molecular changes that plants experience when grown in space. \nFuture scientists had their experiments activated today inside the NanoRacks commercial space research facility aboard the station. Students from five U.S. schools will be exploring ways to reduce infections, improve muscle injury treatments, grow plants on Mars, filter bacteria and solve common slippery surface problems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:06:11.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
