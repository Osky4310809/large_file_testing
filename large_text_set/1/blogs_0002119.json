The deal contains $7.42 million guaranteed, including a $4.384 million signing bonus. 2016: $7.79 million, 2017: Free Agent Share: Latest News Recent News Speaking Monday, Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said the team will franchise tag impending free agent Chandler Jones if a long-term deal is not reached. Calais Campbell and Tony Jefferson are also headed to the open market, but the Cardinals want to keep 27-year-old (in February) Jones after he tallied 11 sacks his first year in the desert. A long-term deal is the most likely outcome. Jan 2 - 1:23 PM Source: Darren Urban on Twitter FOX Sports Arizona's Mike Jurecki reports the Cardinals would like to work out a long-term deal with impending free agent OLB Chandler Jones, but they could use the franchise tag in the \"worst-case\" scenario. Jones has had an exceptional first season in Arizona, recording 9.5 sacks, getting consistent pressure, and standing up pretty well against the run. The Cardinals would not have traded for Jones unless they planned on keeping him around after this season, and it would be a surprise if he is allowed to hit the open market. Jones might not hit the $100-million mark with his next deal, but he should get pretty close. Tue, Dec 27, 2016 08:53:00 AM Source: Mike Jurecki on Twitter The Cardinals are discussing a contract extension with OLB Chandler Jones. Arizona sent New England a second-round pick (and since-released G/C Jonathan Cooper) in exchange for Jones, and isn't going to let him walk after one year in the desert. Jones has been an early-season animal for the Cardinals, piling up five sacks and two forced fumbles through seven starts. He's 26 years old. Mon, Oct 24, 2016 06:02:00 PM Source: Profootballtalk on NBC Sports Teammates believe Cardinals OLB Chandler Jones can get 20 sacks this season. \"Thereâ€™s no doubt about it. He has that potential to be a 20-plus sack guy,\" Patrick Peterson said. \"If (Dwight) Freeney had eight sacks in a backup role, Chandler should probably get 20 in a starting role,\" Tyrann Mathieu added. Considering only 10 players have ever cracked 20 sacks, that might not be a realistic goal for Jones, but it is a sign of how highly he is rated inside the clubhouse. After coming over from the Patriots via trade this offseason, Jones should offer Arizona the true pass-rushing threat they have been missing for several years.
