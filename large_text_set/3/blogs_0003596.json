His mother and father, Marinella and Alfonso, must have dropped by a few weeks ago to organise a birthday cake for their boy. Donnarumma turned 18 on Saturday and he can't have believed his eyes when he saw it. The cake was in the design of San Siro and there on top of it, supported by those iconic towers and rafters, was a tricolour sponge with a figure of Donnarumma in his gold Milan kit and the Italian Super Cup he won in Doha before Christmas. \nThe pastry chefs at La Sfogliatina d'Oro surpassed themselves and, in recognition, they featured in a video message, along with Donnarumma's friends, family and girlfriend, wishing him a happy birthday. Milan filmed Donnarumma as he watched it at Milanello. The teenager has stopped a lot of shots in his short career, but on this occasion he couldn't stop the tears. \nDonnarumma's birthday was also a matchday. It was a neat coincidence that Milan's opponents should be Sassuolo. The Neroverdi were the team he made his debut against as a 16 year-old. Since then, Donnarumma has notched up 60 top-flight appearances, breaking record after record. In August he became the youngest ever player to save a penalty in Serie A. Then in September he became the youngest ever goalkeeper to play for Italy. \nWhen Gianluigi Buffon made a mistake against Spain in October there were already -- premature -- calls that Donnarumma be made Italy's No. 1. Vincenzo Montella, his manager at Milan, believes he has the potential to become the first goalkeeper since Lev Yashin to win the Ballon d'Or . \nWatching him this season, it doesn't sound at all far-fetched. Some of the saves he has made have been jaw dropping. In October, Donnarumma pulled on his cape and tipped a long-range effort from Sami Khedira over the bar to see out a 1-0 win against Juventus at San Siro. A week later he denied Pescara's Gianluca Caprari in similar fashion. And it was of course the save he made from Paulo Dybala in the penalty shootout at the end of the Italian Super Cup that ended Milan's five-year wait for a trophy. \nIncredibly, of the 10 penalties Donnarumma has faced, he has been beaten just 43 percent of the time. Donnarumma has saved two, the other three have been missed, but here's the thing: he helps make them miss. The goal looks so small with him in it, penalty-takers get psyched out, which is apparently what happened to Domenico Berardi at the weekend. You might say it was sweet revenge for Donnarumma, as the first goal he ever conceded was a free kick scored by the Sassuolo striker. \nBy Mino Raiola's calculations, all this adds up to €170 million . That's the valuation Donnarumma's super agent has arrived at. Raiola says: \"He's like a Modigliani.\" \nNow that Donnarumma is 18 and no longer a minor, the rules allow Milan to start talks to lock him down to a longer contract than the three-year deal they struck with him back in 2015. On his birthday, Milan's long-time chief executive Adriano Galliani told Donnarumma : \"I hope you get everything you want in life: happiness and many other things but above all a long contract with Milan.\" Galliani rather poignantly bought him a pen. Until Milan's prospective new owners demonstrate their commitment to the club, Gianluigi Donnarumma's future may lie elsewhere. \nThe problem, however, is that a new contract isn't Galliani's to offer. Galliani is on his way out. In fact, he has been on his way out for six months now. The proposed takeover of Milan does not foresee a role for him within the club. Initially due to be completed last December, the deadline was extended until Friday but, to great despair, it has been put off again, as prospective new owners Sino Europe Sports (SES) have not been able to get all the cash together. \nThe longer this goes on, the closer the clock ticks to the expiry of Donnarumma's existing deal at the end of next season. As Berlusconi decides whether to pull out of the sale or to once again extend the deadline for SES to complete the deal by another month, there is a growing sense of urgency and anxiety around Donnarumma's future. Confidence in SES has been seriously knocked. Even before the news of another potential postponement, Paolo Maldini said last week that he feels entirely vindicated in declining the role they offered him to return to the club should they replace Berlusconi at the helm. \nWisely, Raiola will not allow Donnarumma to commit his long-term future to the club until he gets to meet the people involved and is able to judge for himself whether they are serious in terms of ambition and backing. The agent isn't prepared to take Marco Fassone's word for it. Fassone was named Galliani's successor in August but, beyond the front men at SES, Han Li and Li Yonghong, the identity of who exactly is behind the takeover remains shrouded in mystery. \nA free agent in June 2018, the same time incidentally that Buffon's contract expires at Juventus, there have been rumours about the Old Lady making a move for Donnarumma. Asked, jokingly, on Radio Deejay if the car of Juventus general manager has been seen spotted parked outside the dorm near San Siro where Donnarumma has lived since moving to Milan, Galliani quipped : \"No, because we'd get security to remove it.\" \nThe only reassurance Raiola has offered thus far is that if Donnarumma does move, he'd do Milan a favour and make sure he goes abroad. And there'd be no shortage of suitors: Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United -- if David De Gea swaps Old Trafford for the Bernabeu. \nIt'd be a shame for Milan. Donnarumma is the present and the future of this side. He has quickly come to symbolise Milan. His No. 99 shirt is the best seller in the club shop. A lifelong Milan fan, he has said it would be a dream to captain the club one day. \"Conceptually I don't have a problem with the idea of spending my entire career with one club,\" he said. Fans loved how he kissed the badge after Milan won the Super Cup and then posted that he is legatissimo -- very attached -- to the club. Donnarumma is extremely grateful that Milan had enough faith in his ability and the courage to make him their first choice keeper at just 16. Ultimately, as Montella has said, this is his decision, not Raiola's. \nHowever, other than the fact SES have already made €200m in down payments to buy Milan and are prepared to write another cheque for €100m to postpone the takeover's completion until April, the goalkeeper's agent is yet to be convinced they are credible. Asked if Donnarumma deserves a great Milan, Raiola replied rather chillingly : \"No, he deserves a great team. I'm not married to anyone, my job is not to be a fan of a team.\" \nResolving this as soon as possible obviously has to be the top of Milan's priorities. But which Milan? Until the club's future is sorted, Donnarumma's own is in limbo. Unlike his birthday, this is anything but a piece of cake. \nJames covers the Italian Serie A and European football for ESPN FC Follow him on Twitter @JamesHorncastle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T10:18:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
