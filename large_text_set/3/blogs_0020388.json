Jim Ross first revealed the situation Tuesday on his Twitter account , noting she was hit by a car while riding a Vespa. He went into greater detail on his personal website Wednesday. \"Jan suffered a catastrophic brain injury including multiple skull fractures,\" Ross wrote. \"My little Angel was unfortunately not wearing a helmet, which arguably would have prevented the extreme nature of her injuries.\" She is being kept alive via life support equipment. \"We hope that the swelling of Jan's brain will subside soon as it must for her to survive,\" he explained. \"It's that simple.\" Jim Ross was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007 for his work as an announcer with the company from 1993-2013. Since leaving WWE, the 65-year-old has contributed as a writer on FoxSports.com and works as an announcer for the New Japan Pro Wrestling.
