He made an estimated $15 million for the 12 months ending in June 2016, according to Forbes ' recent ranking.\nHis book This Book Loves You made the New York Times bestseller list and his YouTube Red series Scare PewDiePie was renewed for a second season. His second video game, PewDiePie’s Tuber Simulator, was downloaded more than 1 million times within 24 hours of its release.\n\nMaker Studios also teamed up with PewDiePie to create a new network called Revelmode , which focuses on content, community and charity. He also launched a sock line.\nAll this despite the fact that he has tweeted that he and YouTuber Jacksepticeye have \"joined ISIS \"; bashed reporters for singling him out in articles about the Federal Trade Commission and Warner Bros. \"pay for play\" settlement; hated on a rival channel which stars a a 5-year-old ; and trolled fans by saying he would delete his channel after 50 million subscribers and instead deleted a secondary channel he barely uses.\nThe YouTuber did not respond to Mashable's request for comment. His most recent tweet said \"#resistpewdiepie.\"\n#resistpewdiepie \n— pewdiepie (@pewdiepie) February 13, 2017 \nOn Sunday, he posted on his Tumblr that he wanted to “clear some things up\" about some of his videos featuring the anti-semitic remarks.\n\"I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes. I make videos for my audience.\"\n\"This originated from a video I made a couple of weeks ago,\" he wrote in the post . \"I was trying to show how crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online. I picked something that seemed absurd to me—That people on Fiverr would say anything for 5 dollars. I think it’s important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes. I make videos for my audience. I think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary. I know my audience understand that and that is why they come to my channel. Though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive. As laughable as it is to believe that I might actually endorse these people, to anyone unsure on my standpoint regarding hate-based groups: No, I don’t support these people in any way.\nBONUS: National Geographic's 'Origins' is like 'Cosmos' but about the nature of human civilization", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:34:50.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
