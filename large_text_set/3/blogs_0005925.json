It’s cheap in bundles and they are going for daft prices.\n‘Heroin users are saying it’s the worst stuff going. It’s dangerous.’\nHowever, there are fears that a more dangerous strand of the drug is now circulating on the streets of Manchester.\nThis embed is invalid\nJulie Boyle, a support worker with charity Lifeshare, said she called an ambulance to help a woman who had taken the drug. Paramedics said they had been called out 26 times that day to similar incidents.\nZeebrugge ferry disaster: Services to honour lives of 193 people who drowned She said: ‘In the city centre there are people who just look like they are frozen, like the walking dead, sat in a catatonic state not moving.\n‘You wouldn’t even know they were alive – it’s like when you press pause on the telly. They don’t know where they are.\n‘I first noticed it probably the beginning of last week but then it’s intensified more as the week’s gone on.’\nThe number of people admitted to hospital has grown significantly The charity believes that 95 per cent of young homeless people in Manchester are on Spice – a general term for a synthetic drug originally classed as a legal high but outlawed last April. It is now being dealt on the streets instead of being bought in shops.\nThe drug has already been causing chaos, with Lifeshare warning of youngsters being trafficked, gang raped, contracting HIV and even dying as a result. But Julie told the MEN the latest strain – which she is hoping to get tested for its contents – is even worse.\nMPs to debate making it illegal to force women to wear high heels at work ‘Whatever’s going round the city centre at the moment is causing this,’ she said. ‘Every corner where there are beggars or homeless people hanging about, out of every six or so at least two will be catatonic.\n‘People are falling without even putting out their hands, which would be your natural instinct,’ she said. ‘They’re just falling face down, injuring their face or the back of their head. It’s horrible. It was bad enough before but this is another level.’\nLewis Morris, 37, who has been living on the streets since December 2016, knows all about this new strain of Spice. He said: ‘It’s lethal.\n‘I was walking down Market Street the other day and 17 people went down on it. They hit the deck shaking out of control and I had to phone an ambulance.\n‘It’s madness. It’s so cheap. Whoever is selling it they are making a lot of money on it. It’s unreal.\n‘The new stuff is mixed with the tranquilliser they use when transporting koi carp to calm them down.\n‘Somebody could offer me £1,000 of it now but I would just burn it. That’s how against it I am.\n‘It’s really cheap. People are getting it for £5 a gram and it will last you all day. It’s taken over heroin and crack.’\nAnother homeless man Michael Cauchi, 37, said he accidentally took the new strain of Spice and thought he was going to die.\nHe said: ‘Somebody passed me half a roll-up once and I didn’t realise it was Spice. I thought I was dying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:34:02.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
