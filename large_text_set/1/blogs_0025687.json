White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday defended President Trump’s statement, calling critics “pathetic.”\nWhile the Holocaust museum did not directly reference the White House’s defense, it took care to explain that Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically targeted Jews .\n“Nazi ideology cast the world as a racial struggle, and the singular focus on the total destruction of every Jewish person was at its racist core,” the statement said . “Millions of other innocent civilians were persecuted and murdered by the Nazis, but the elimination of Jews was central to Nazi policy. As Elie Wiesel said, “Not all victims were Jews, but all Jews were victims.”\nThe Holocaust Museum’s statement came amid anger surrounding Trump’s executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim majority countries. The museum warned that it was “critical” to understand the history of the Holocaust to adequately honor the victims.\n“The Holocaust teaches us profound truths about human societies and our capacity for evil,” the statement said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T03:00:05.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
