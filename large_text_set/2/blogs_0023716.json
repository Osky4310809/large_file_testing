Along with it, India is also experiencing a boom in wine tourism. Many Indian vineyards now have tasting rooms , so wine enthusiasts can enjoy exploring India's wine regions. It's often possible to complete the experience by staying at at the vineyards. \nIndia's main wine region is Nashik, around four hours northeast of Mumbai, in Maharashtra. However, there are also some reputable wineries scattered further south in India. \nVisit these vineyards to enjoy some of the best wine in India. Sula Vineyards 1. Sula Vineyards \nSula Vineyards is India's most popular winery. From humble beginnings in 1999, Sula Vineyards has admirably developed into a world class winery with a market share of more than 70% in India. The winery is open to visitors, who can enjoy a tour, tastings, courses, and fun events including the immensely popular SulaFest that's held in early February each year. Little Italy restaurant serves delicious Italian cuisine to complement the wine. \nSula Vineyards established India's first vineyard resort, called Beyond. It has 32 rooms with private balconies situated a short distance from the winery. There's also a restaurant, swimming pool, spa and gym, and games room. Package rates start from 5,500 rupees per night for a couple. Read reviews of Beyond on Tripadvisor . \nLocation: On the outskirts of Nashik, off Gangapur-Savargaon Road, 20 minutes from town.

Grover Zampa \nGrover Vineyards, one of India's oldest wine makers situated near Bangalore in Karnataka, merged with Maharashtra-based Vallée de Vin (producer of premium wine brand Zampa) in 2012 to better compete with Sula. Established as a family business in 1988, Grover Vineyards has expanded to over 410 acres. The winery focuses on producing premium wines, with the standout being its award winning La Reserve brand of oak matured Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz reds. There are extensive wine trails across the property, and it's also possible to visit the winery's barrel room. Three and a half hour tours followed by lunch start daily at 10.30 a.m. Read reviews of Grover Zampa Vineyards . \nShorter tours and tastings are also offered at the ambient but much smaller Maharashtra vineyard, with its attractive courtyards. You can enjoy a variety of wines there, including Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, and sparkling Rose and Brut. \nLocation: Nandi Hills, around 50 kilometers north of Bangalore in Karnataka. Sanjegaon, around halfway between Igatpuri and Nashik, just off the Mumbai-Nasik Highway in Maharashtra. More » York Winery 3. York Winery and Tasting Room \nLocated not far from Sula Vineyards, and with a view over Gangapur Dam and the hills beyond, boutique York Winery is where you should head for serene sunset tastings. The tasting room is open daily from noon until 10 p.m. Tours are also offered from 12.30 p.m. until 6 p.m. \nYork Winery has won a range of awards for its wine varieties, both red and white. However, most impressive is its new Arros reserve blend of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, released in late 2014. York also released its own sparkling wine, York Sparkling Brut, near the end of 2014. It's made from 100% Chenin Blanc grapes. \nLocation: On the outskirts of Nashik, off Gangapur-Savargaon Road, 20 minutes from town. More » Stephen Walls/Getty Images 4. Chateau d'Ori \nChateau d’Ori had its first harvest in February 2007 and is the second largest winery in the Nashik region after Sula, with 400 acres of vineyards. The winery produces some top quality red wines and has won a number of awards for them. According to some, Chateau d’Ori's Cabernet Shiraz blend matches Grover's La Reserve. Its rare straight Merlot is notable as well. Chateau d’Ori also produces Myra wines under contract with Myra Vineyards , headquartered in Bangalore, and the reserve Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz are very drinkable. \nThere's a luxury guesthouse on the property. It sits by an artificial lake in the middle of a vast expanse of grape vines, making it the perfect destination to get away from it all. Expect to pay around 6,500 rupees for a one night package for a couple. The winery's state-of-the-art technology is worth checking out too. \nLocation: At the base of the picturesque Nhera-Ori hills at Dindori, around 25 kilometers (30 minutes) north of Nashik on the Nashik-Dindori Road.

It targets the premium segment and has three different labels at various price points: Reserve, Pleasures, and Selection. \nCharosa introduced Tempranillo, a grape of Spanish origin, to the Indian market for the first time. Its Reserve Tempranillo has drawn many accolades and is perhaps the pick of the wines. However, the Sauvignon Blanc is refreshingly good for a white wine in India and Charosa produces the best Voignier too. \nIt's possible to visit the vineyard and sample the wine, although lack of decent roads from Nashik is a limiting factor. It's a narrow, winding journey to get there. \nLocation: Charosa village, around 55 kilometers (one hour) from Nashik in the Dindori district. More » Fratelli Wines 6. Fratelli Wines \nFratelli (meaning \"brothers\" in Italian) was stated in 2007 by three pairs of brothers from Italy, Delhi, and Maharashtra. This remote vineyard produces some excellent reserve wines on its 240 acre estate. The outstanding Sette reserve red is amongst the best red wine in India. Its introduction has been followed up by the launch of two reserve white wines in 2014 -- Vitae (a Chardonnay) and Vitae Tre (a blend of Muller Thurgau, Gewürztraminer and Chenin Blanc). \nA full day package costs 1,500 rupees per person, including tours and tastings. However, it's recommended that you stay at least one night in the winery's modern accommodations, as it's not easy to reach. A weekend overnight package costs 11,000 rupees for a couple, and a two night rejuvenation package costs 19,000 rupees for a couple. This is fully inclusive. It's also possible to rent the whole vineyard for groups. \nLocation: Akluj, in the Solapur district of Maharashtra. It's approximately 300 kilometers (6 hours) from Mumbai.
