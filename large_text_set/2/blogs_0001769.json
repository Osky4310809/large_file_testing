Hypoglycin \nMost of the victims were poor children in India's main lychee-producing region who ate fruit that had fallen on to the ground in orchards, the journal said. \nLychees contain toxins that inhibit the body's ability to produce glucose, which affected young children whose blood sugar levels were already low because they were not eating dinner. \nThey woke screaming in the night before suffering convulsions and losing consciousness as they suffered acute welling of the brain. \nResearchers examining sick children admitted to hospital in Muzaffarpur between May and July 2014 found a link to an outbreak of sickness that caused brain swelling and convulsions in children in the Caribbean. \nThat outbreak was caused by the ackee fruit, which contained hypoglycin, a toxin that prevents the body from making glucose. Tests then showed that lychees also contained hypoglycin. \nThis led health officials to tell parents to make sure young children got an evening meal and limit the number of lychees they were eating. \nChildren suffering symptoms associated with the outbreak should be rapidly treated for hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, officials said. \nThe number of reported cases of the sickness has since fallen from hundreds each year to about 50, the New York Times reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:27:14.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
