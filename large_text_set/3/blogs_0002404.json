Business is growing like crazy.\" \nSo effective March 8, Gigi relocates to 4371 Main St., where its menu will expand to include Mediterranean tapas such as grilled Spanish octopus with roasted garlic and Italian hots over bruschetta; spicy meatballs, lobster mac-and-cheese, grilled baby lamb chops with hot pepper pesto, and tuna crudo. (The storefront was Chabaa Thai before it, too, moved down the street.) \nGigi also will pick up a bar. Wilson, mindful of his BYO customers, is working with Frank Taormina of Majestic Wines on an affordable wine program, with the house red and white starting at $5 a glass. For the first few months, BYOB will be allowed, as well. \nGigi will be open Wednesday to Saturday for lunch, Monday to Saturday for dinner, and weekends for brunch. \nThe former Gigi space at 4357 Main will be used for private parties and catering. Wilson says he is hoping to move Maya.J into Center City.
