The snag in all of this ire is that the tribute band was booked before we knew we’d have a new Cheeto-In-Chief, but it turns out none of that outrage matters anyway because the B Street Band has officially withdrawn from the inaugural celebration “based SOLELY on the respect and gratitude we have for Bruce and the E Street Band.” Here’s their full statement (via Backstreets ): \nWith deepest apologies to our fans and the New Jersey Inaugural Ball committee, the B Street Band is withdrawing from performing at this year’s inauguration Gala. \nOur decision is based SOLELY on the respect and gratitude we have for Bruce and the E Street Band. \nBruce’s music has been the foundation of our livelihood. The B Street Band would not exist without the talents of Bruce and our E Street brothers. \nWe are most grateful to these rock legends and look forward to many more years of emulating and performing the Forever Music, of Bruce Springsteen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:43:58.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
