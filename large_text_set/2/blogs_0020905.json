Due to the clash of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shivaay at the box office, things were tense between Karan, and Kajol's husband Ajay Devgn. And when Ajay put out a tweet saying that Karan had supposedly paid Kamaal R Khan to badmouth his film, and praise Ae Dil Hai Mushkil , things went downhill. \nKajol retweeted her husband's tweet, and was \"shocked\" at the incident. But all the while, Karan had done no such thing. He was deeply hurt that one of his closest friends, Kajol, would believe something like that without even talking to him. And he even spoke openly about their fallout in his book, An Unsuitable Boy . Since then, people have been waiting for Kajol to break her silence on the situation, since Ajay too spoke about it. She finally did, but didn't say much - \"I think relationships are generally difficult, nothing to do with Bollywood, but wouldn't like to comment anything on what happened with Karan.\" Well, there definitely doesn't seem to be a reconciliaion on the cards, and our hearts will forever be broken by the loss of one of Bollywood's best friendships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:07:40.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
