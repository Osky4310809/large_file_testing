We doubt we could go more than a few days without hearing someone either gushing over someone else’s brows or lamenting their own sparse ones. So, it’s no surprise that people are turning to more drastic measures — e.g. eyebrow tattooing AKA microblading — to get more fierce brows , and at least one celebrity is giving the treatment her stamp of approval. The notoriously honest writer and actress Lena Dunham has recently discovered microblading and is opening up about how much she loves it.\nVogue Dunham explains in an essay and video for Vogue.com that, when she was younger, she didn’t quite know what to do with her brows.\n“Mine were thin and pale, roughly the color of roadkill, with random hairs sprouting where they might, creating the effect of a sparse forehead rug. But I had a totally untested plan: I’d create a super thin shape using my dad’s dull tweezers, then use a pencil of some sort (lip or eyeliner; who really knew the difference?) to fill in what God had not gifted me,” Lena writes in her Vogue.com essay.\nOh hey @sophie_hulme I know this was meant for Lamby but I'm kind of feeling the look for myself Teen queen/submissive princess vibes. Thank you ❤️ \nA post shared by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Jan 7, 2017 at 3:21pm PST \nOh no. We know how this ends. Years of over-plucking and eyebrows that won’t grow back . Sigh. Many of us have done the same as well.\nOh hooray it's #specialthingsundays! Back in 2009 Alice Wang was a tireless, intrepid and always impeccably dressed producer on Tiny Furniture.

Then, a co-worker suggested microblading . She initially said, “hell to the eff no,” because the idea of permanent make-up scared the bejeezus out of her.\n“One time somebody told me that my eyebrows were not on fleek,” Lena said. “And I thought about it for like six days.” Lol, same. She decided to try out the treatment to get brows like some of her eyebrow idols — namely Lily Collins and her sister, Grace. Lena enlisted the expertise of celebrity permanent makeup artist, Dominique Bossavy, and never looked back.\nHere are some shots from Dominique’s Insta:\nMy client can now say RIP to her Eyebrows pencil … and you? #eye #eyebrows #microlorinfusion #fashionblogger #beautyblogger #makeover #worthit #whatiwore #wiw #wiwt #photooftheday #style #summerbeauty #dominiquebossavy \nA post shared by Dominique Bossavy (@dominiquebossavy) on Aug 11, 2016 at 11:04am PDT \nFrom brow less to BROW WOW!!! http://buff.ly/2jVDv1d #microcolorinfusion #losangeles #newyork #paris #eyebrows #beauty \nA post shared by Dominique Bossavy (@dominiquebossavy) on Jan 26, 2017 at 11:04am PST \n\"Enhancement\" is one of my favorit word:) #eye #eyebrows #dominiquebossavy #microlorinfusion #fashionblogger #lookbook #blogger #blog #beautyblogger #makeover #worthit #harpersbazaar #allure #elle #wmagazine #personalstyle #whatiwore #wiw #wiwt #photooftheday #style #summerbeauty #anastasiabeverlyhills #dipbrow #kimkardashian #khloekardashian #gigihadid \nA post shared by Dominique Bossavy (@dominiquebossavy) on Sep 1, 2016 at 11:26am PDT \nSo cool.\nIn the video, Bossavy explains, it takes three sessions to get the most natural result. Lena also says it’s not very painful and feels like scratching a sunburn.\nCheck out the video here:\n\nWe love your new look, Lena!
