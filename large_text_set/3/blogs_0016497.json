He bowled with a lot of fire and bagged the prized scalps of Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane. The other Aussie bowlers fared decently but were not threatening. Their spinners were disappointing as they failed to get much purchase from the track. The morning session tomorrow will be crucial for both teams and it will decide which way this Test match will head. Do join us at 0930 local (0400 GMT) to catch all the action. Cheers! At the end of the third day of this Test match, Australia find themselves ahead of India by 91 runs. We witnessed a cracking day of Test cricket.

However, Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha steadied the ship a bit towards the end to keep the game in balance. Cheteshwar Pujara hugs his partner as he starts to walk to the pavilion. Good gesture shown by the Australian players as they go up to congratulate Pujara.
