Although the injury was thankfully not major, it is difficult to confirm whether or not all 101 contestants were present for the recorded performance. \nThe second season of Mnet’s “Produce 101” is set to air on April 7. \nMeanwhile, BTS’s Jimin and B.A.P’s Daehyun have asked fans to support their friends, who are both contestants on this season of “Produce 101.” Plus, find out more about 51 of the “Produce 101” season 2 participants!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T10:36:56.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
