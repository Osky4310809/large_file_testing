Picture this: The final aerial shot in 10 Things I Hate About You , mixed with the spunk of Veruca Salt’s “Volcano Girls” à la Jawbreaker and BAM! the band’s new single “DIY” is born. \nPONY just signed with the independent Toronto-based label Buzz Records, and while their catalogue only consists of a handful of songs, “DIY” is a promising showing of PONY’s potential. Distorted guitars meet a mellowed beach vibe at the track’s beginning, before gaining power-pop momentum when the vocals come floating in. Lead singer and guitarist Sam Bielanski delivers self-deprecating lyrics like, “nothing at all is all I really need” and the bright chorus “I do it to myself/ Just me and no one else.” According to Bielanski, the song acts as an open love letter to herself following a romantic blunder: \nOnce upon a time, I had a huge crush on a guy who did not crush back. I was feeling bummed, insecure and super crummy. Through this minor heartbreak I realized that the only thing you can really do when someone lets you down or makes you feel bad about yourself is to take matters into your own hands and practice the art of ‘self-love’. D.I.Y. till you D.I.E. \nCheck out the track below. \nTour Dates: 02/08 Kingston, ON @ The Mansion 02/09 Ottawa, ON @ House of Targ 02/10 Montreal, QC @ Turbohaus 02/12 Toronto,ON @Smiling Buddha w/ Nicole Dollanganger 04/22 Toronto, ON @ CMW w/ Weaves \nThe “DIY” lathe cut 7″ will be out 5/12 via Buzz Records.
