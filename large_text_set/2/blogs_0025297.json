News . “I have twins. I think she’s covered. She’s been in the business for so long, she’s got her own people. When she does something, she knows what she’s doing. \n“It’s going to be hectic in the house!” Celine and her twins Nelson and Eddy Jay Z, Blue Ivy Carter and Beyonce will be welcoming another two additions to their family (Photo: Getty) Celine with late husband Rene (Photo: Getty) \nEven so, Celine’s confident Beyonce will cope - and points out that the singer has good people around her and is already a great mum to Blue Ivy, five. \n“She’s fortunate enough that she can have all the people that she wants to help her, but no one will ever replace a mom and she’s a great mom. I’m pretty sure of that.” \nCeline - who's also mum to 16 year old Rene-Charles Angelil - had some other kind words for Beyonce, and praised her greatness: “She looks amazing, she makes women dream. She’s so beautiful, she’s on top of things.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:17:57.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
