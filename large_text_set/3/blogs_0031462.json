She said she will reach out to various stakeholders and legislators on how to apply new resources. \n\"I am confident that we can put aside any differences and achieve a win-win situation,\" she said. \nLam proposed to apply financial and tax measures strategically through a two-tier tax rate system on profits and tax deductions to incentivize research and development. \nShe said she would invite employers and employees in all sectors as well as experts and academics to come up with ideas. \nOn the housing issue, she said, \"I have pledged to help Hong Kong people attain homeownership and to improve living conditions. To do this, we need more usable land.\" \nLam also said large parts of her campaign platform were inspired by young people. \"In this campaign, I have felt deeply our younger people's strong desires and their passion for Hong Kong,\" she said. \nIn the chief executive's race, decided by a 1,194-member election committee, Lam garnered 777 votes to 365 for former financial secretary John Tsang Chun-Wah and 21 votes for retired judge Woo Kwok-Hing. \nLam used to be the chief secretary of administration. She now awaits appointment by the central government and will succeed incumbent Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying on July 1.
