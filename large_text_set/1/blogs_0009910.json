You are fake news.” \nAcosta, appearing on CNN after the press conference, said that Spicer threatened to throw him out of the conference if he tried to ask another question. \nCNN eventually did get a question in, via CNN Politics reporter Jeremy Diamond, who asked Trump why he refuted intelligence reports about Russian hacking and the election. And after the conference, CNN issued a statement defending its reporting and differentiating its reporting from BuzzFeed’s. \n“CNN’s decision to publish carefully sourced reporting about the operations of our government is vastly different than BuzzFeed’s decision to publish unsubstantiated claims,” the statement reads, in part. “The Trump team knows this. They are using BuzzFeed’s decision to deflect from CNN’s reporting, which has been matched by the other major news organizations. We are fully confident in our reporting … We made it clear that we were not publishing any of the details of the 35-page document because we have not corroborated the report’s allegations.” \nTrump and CNN have had a contentious history that started during the campaign but continued after the election, with Trump calling out CNN president Jeff Zucker in a meeting with TV news executives and talent. After that meeting, however, Trump did sit for a new portrait that would go on to grace the cover of CNN's book about the election. \nThe press conference, during which an attorney for the president-elect said that Trump would not give up his business ties, was held a day after BuzzFeed News published a secret dossier, which included salacious and unverified claims that a former unnamed intelligence operative said that Russian intelligence has on the president-elect. \nBuzzFeed said it published the dossier because of a report from CNN on Tuesday that said Trump and President Barack Obama received briefings on the dossier. \nTrump’s transition team has denounced the stories, calling them fake news, and Spicer slammed both news organizations at the beginning of the press conference, saying it was a “sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks” to publish the story. Spicer labeled BuzzFeed “a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to [Trump’s] campaign,” and Trump called out BuzzFeed at the conference as well, calling the news organization “a pile of garbage.” \nBuzzFeed News editor in chief Ben Smith defended the publication of the dossier Tuesday night, and noted that the story said that “there is serious reason to doubt the allegations” included in the dossier. But the organization has been criticized for running the report anyway, including from CNN’s Jake Tapper, who said the news organization was “irresponsible” after Trump's press conference Wednesday.
