Watt has spent the entire NFL season recovering from back surgery, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t been active elsewhere.\nOn New Year’s Eve, 8-year-old Noah Fulmer and three other pedestrians suffered injuries after a man driving a 2005 Toyota Tundra struck two parked vehicles, according to KPRC2 in Houston . The collision caused one of the parked vehicles to hit the pedestrians, who were hospitalized.\nSomebody tweeted Watt, saying that Noah was crying because the EMTs had to cut his jersey off of him when tending to him.\nIt’s typically a long shot when it comes to athletes online, but Watt replied to the tweet:\nThat is terrible, is he ok? \nTell him I'll bring him a new jersey tomorrow. https://t.co/jSYhbhxU1H \n— JJ Watt (@JJWatt) January 3, 2017 Sure enough, Watt visited Noah on Tuesday, and brought him several jerseys to make up for it.\n@JJWatt @HoustonTexans JJ Watt surprised Noah after surgery. Thank you Watt #Nfl #JJWATT #thankyou #teamnoah #prayfornoah #hejustwokeup pic.twitter.com/d68wMhDelT \n— Marc (@carapia116) January 3, 2017 While it appears Noah’s got some more time to recover, surely a visit from Watt and some new jerseys to wear while his Houston Texans take on the Raiders in the playoffs will make him feel even just slightly better.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:59:34.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
