The front-facing camera is listed as an 8-megapixel setup. \nThat 6.2-inch display is said to be a Quad HD+ Super AMOLED offering, while the iris scanner from the ill-fated Note 7 looks to have been moved across to the Galaxy S series this time around. \nOther specs listed include the same IP68 waterproofing as the S7, 64GB internal storage with the option of adding a Micro SD card, wireless charging, and support for Samsung Pay. \nLast on the list is a pair of earphones which have apparently been tuned by AKG , which should make for some nicely-balanced buds. \nBlass has a good track record when it comes to leaks, but regardless, you should use caution when it comes to believing this latest 'leak'. There's no way to verify the information until Samsung officially unveils the phone. \nThe company today also made official its new Exynos 9 Series 8895 chip, which will likely feature in the Galaxy S8 (some regions will probably be getting Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 835 instead). \nSamsung's latest processor chipset is the first to be built on the 10-nanometre FinFET process technology, and has been confirmed as going into mass production. \n\"In addition to being built on the most advanced 10nm FinFET process technology, the new Exynos 9 Series 8895 incorporates Samsung's cutting-edge technologies including a second-generation custom CPU, gigabit LTE modem, and more,\" said Ben Hur, Vice President of System LSI marketing at Samsung Electronics. \n\"With industry leading technologies like VPU, the Exynos 8895 will drive the innovation of next generation smartphones, VR headsets, and automotive infotainment system,\" \nUnfortunately, the South Korean firm did not confirm whether the processor will indeed be used in the upcoming Galaxy S8, which is likely to launch at the end of March or in mid-April. \nSamsung will be at MWC this year, which kicks off on February 26, and although we won't be seeing the new phone launched at the event in Barcelona, the company has promised to reveal a launch date, so stay tuned. \nWATCH: Galaxy S8 â€“ What we know \nLet us know what you think of the leak in the comments. 0 shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:20:03.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
