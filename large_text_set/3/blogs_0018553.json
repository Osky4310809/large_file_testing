And that’s a really difficult feeling.” \nEmma, who found fame when she was just 11 and is now worth an estimated £57million, was privately educated in Oxford between filming the eight Harry Potter movies. \nAnd she urges those who feel left out at school to pursue their passions and find their tribes.

They’ll be there. But don’t give up. They are there.” \nIt comes as the actress took legal action this week after photographs of her were stolen. The pictures show her trying on outfits during a fitting. But her spokesman, who could give no details on who stole the images, made it clear they did not show the actress nude. \nEarlier this month Emma was criticised for posing topless in a shoot for Vanity Fair magazine.

She’s teaching other young girls who are part of the village to read, and you know, moments like that where you could see her expanding beyond just her own little world and trying to kind of grow it, I loved that, and yeah, that was amazing to get to do.” \nEmma says the character was an inspiration to her even from a very young age.

She added: “I just called him Beastie.
