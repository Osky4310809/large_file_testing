What are the consequences of Trump's refugee policies? \nLiberal groups called for an all-out fight to reject Gorsuch, a staunch conservative who is likely to vote \"to limit gay rights, uphold restrictions on abortion and invalidate affirmative action programs,\" according to a study that analyses the ideologies of potential Supreme Court nominees. \nConservative groups and Republican senators heaped praise on him like \"outstanding,\" \"impressive\" and \"home run\". \nGorsuch is the youngest nominee to the nation's highest court in more than a quarter century, and he could influence the direction of the court for decades as its members are elected for life-long terms. \nAnnouncing the selection to a night-time crowd in the White House East Room flanked by the judge and his wife, Trump said Gorsuch's resume is \"as good as it gets\". \nTrump, who took office on January 20, said he hopes Republicans and Democrats can come together on this nomination for the good of the country. \n\"Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous disciple, and has earned bipartisan support,\" Trump told an audience that included Scalia's widow. \n\"Depending on their age, a justice can be active for 50 years. And his or her decisions can last a century or more, and can often be permanent,\" Trump added.

A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.\" Is Donald Trumpâ€™s agenda symbolic? \nA senior administration official told Reuters news agency that a screening committee helped in the selection process that included Vice President Mike Pence, White House counsel Don McGahn, chief of staff Reince Priebus and top strategist Steve Bannon. \nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer said it was up to Gorsuch to \"prove himself to be within the legal mainstream\" and \"vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the Executive branch\".\"Given his record, I have very serious doubts about Judge Gorsuch's ability to meet this standard,\" he added. \nNancy Pelosi, the House Democratic minority leader, called Gorsuch \"hostile to women's rights\" and said the consequences of confirming him \"could not be more serious or far-reaching\".\"Judge Gorsuch's record reveals he holds radical views far outside the mainstream of American legal thought,\" she said.
