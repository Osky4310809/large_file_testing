He released it on the Rachel Maddow show tonight: \nHere are Trump's major sources of income: Interest income: $9 million Miscellaneous: $2 million Total: $152 million \nAfter a writeoff of $103 million, his adjusted gross income clocked in at $49 million. His taxable income came in at $35 million and his tax bill for this was $5 million. That's a tax rate of about 3 percent. Ka-ching! \nSadly for Trump, the Alternative Minimum Tax kicked in, which meant he had to pay $38 million in taxes. That's more like it! I guess it's no wonder that Trump doesn't think very highly of the Alternative Minimum Tax. \nWithout more pages from his tax return, there's a limit to what we can learn from this. Trump's income of $150 million fits fairly well with the estimates I've seen. But I will add one thing. \nTrump's total investment income was $108 million, and Trump claims to be worth $5 billion or so, depending on what day you ask him. That means he earned a return on his assets of about 2 percent. In 2005! During the housing bubble! I'm no tax expert, and maybe there's more to this story, but if Trump really did realize a return of only 2 percent, he is by long odds the most incompetent billionaire in the country. \nAlternatively, of course, Trump is actually worth about $1-2 billion and he earned something like a 5-10 percent return. Take your pick. Get the scoop, straight from Mother Jones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T04:22:39.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
