GETTY Manchester City reportedly want to sign Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic GETTY Barcelona are supposedly close to agreeing a deal for Rakitic to leave \nHowever, Enrique insists he doesn't want the midfielder to leave. \nWhen asked about Rakitic's future, Enrique said: \"It's up to me to decide the squads and the teams. That's my job. \n\"What's been published has nothing to do with that. \n\"Only 25 per cent of things are true, be it in the Croatian, Spanish, English or Italian media.\" GETTY Rakitic (left) has started just three games for Barcelona since the end of November \nWere Rakitic to leave Barca, Enrique would likely look to bring in a new midfielder, what with Sergio Busquets also tipped to quit the club at the end of the season. \nIt is claimed the Chinese Super League are also sniffing around Rakitic, who could greatly increase his current wages by swapping the Nou Camp for the Far East. \nJurtanji report that fellow Croatia team members Marcelo Brozovic and Nikola Kalinic may also be tempted by moves to China before the transfer window closes.
