The actor? Nicholas Gonzalez. He and his wife, Kelsey, just had a baby girl , Ever Lee Wilde Gonzalez, on March 1st in Los Angeles. On Facebook, Nicholas said it was the “best day of our life.” We bet!\n“We are looking forward to sleepless nights and blissed-out days,” Nicholas and Kelsey told People. “We are so in love with our new, little person. She is the best thing — ever!” Let’s see this baby already, right?! Ever Lee Wilde Gonzalez 3-1-17 8lbs 1oz 21in. \"Your children are not your children.

And don’t you love the Kahlil Gibran quote, too?! Nice touch! A few months ago, Nicholas even posted this on IG, so you can compare and contrast with the above pic.\n'76 Vs. '83 Wonder which one the little one will favor... \nA post shared by nicholas gonzalez (@eltexmex) on Dec 22, 2016 at 4:54pm PST \nFun-ny! Any thoughts?! Overall, Nicholas seemed excited about having the baby.\n#wcw There may even be a 2 for 1 situation here... Happy 30 weeks, Lover! I am so proud of you and in awe of your strength. \nA post shared by nicholas gonzalez (@eltexmex) on Dec 14, 2016 at 1:38pm PST \nShe's a natural @joellehorowitz. #TopGolf #Vegas #GolfingForTwo #PregnantGolf \nA post shared by nicholas gonzalez (@eltexmex) on Nov 5, 2016 at 4:49pm PDT \nAnd Nicholas and Kelsey seem ~super happy~ together. imagine me and you. i do. #aintnobody \nA post shared by nicholas gonzalez (@eltexmex) on Feb 14, 2017 at 5:27pm PST \nTo the life of the party and the light of my life...#wcw : @melissacoulier \nA post shared by nicholas gonzalez (@eltexmex) on Dec 7, 2016 at 12:15pm PST \nOkay, is anyone else having #relationshipgoals rn, or is it just us?! ICYMI, the couple got married in April of 2016, and they seem like the perfect couple.\nAs far as their new baby goes, we doubt she’ll slow Nicholas and Kelsey down. He continues to act, of course, and has been in everything from the aforementioned PLL to How to Get Away with Murder. He’ll be in the third season of Narcos , too. Kelsey works as a producer and actress, starring in shows such as PLL and Scandal . In addition, she owns QuenchStaffing.com, a staffing agency.\nWe congratulate the couple on their new baby and hope they don’t have too many of those sleepless nights Nicholas mentioned!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T03:18:41.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
