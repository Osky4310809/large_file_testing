State Sen. Carla Nelson, R-Rochester, is chief author of a bill advancing many of the coalition's goals. As chairwoman of the Senate K-12 Finance Committee, she will have considerable sway over what makes the final cut in the Senate's school-finance bill. Nelson reminded colleagues recently that Minnesota has the nation's largest achievement gap. Adding teachers of color is a concrete way to narrow it, she said. Network of support A year ago, the Educator Policy Innovation Center, or EPIC, founded by Education Minnesota, released a 68-page report recommending \"grow your own\" programs for candidates of color and efforts to keep minority educators in the fold as keys to easing the state's teacher shortage. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, students who are culturally and linguistically diverse make up 45 percent of the nation's K-12 students, while teachers of color represent 17 percent of the national teacher workforce. In Minnesota, the figures are 31 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. The EPIC report cites research showing that teachers of color can produce more favorable results on standardized test scores and college-going rates for minority students than white colleagues. They can be role models and connect with students through \"insider knowledge\" of shared experiences and cultural backgrounds, research shows. Retaining teachers of color, however, is another challenge. A 2016 Education Minnesota survey showed that 22 percent of educators of color who responded said they had taken steps to leave the profession. Among the factors pushing them away were racial isolation and a dissatisfaction with administrators. Such concerns were cited, too, by minority teachers attending a State Capitol news conference last month. \"You can hire teachers of color to do that checkmark. But, actually, do administrators want teachers of color?\" said Soraya Valedón-López, of Andersen United Community School in Minneapolis. \"Do they have professional development to work with teachers of color? Are they working on their own racism?\" Teachers of color in Minneapolis and several suburban districts count on one another to talk about challenges, stay strong, tough it out. Roseville helped lead the way by giving minority teachers time to meet during the day. But the district also has budget concerns, said Roberta Hernandez Rasmussen, a Central Park Elementary teacher, and that worries her. Verna Wong, an English language teacher at Champlin Park High, considered quitting in the past. Now she draws strength from an Anoka-Hennepin Teachers of Color Coalition that she and others formed in 2014. Recently, members met to share thoughts on how changes in the national political scene affected students. \"I think mainstream 'Minnesota Nice' has a hard time speaking about conflict,\" Wong said. \"We're just trying to create space for conversations to happen.\" Last spring, Anoka-Hennepin teachers had a happy-hour gathering with their Osseo counterparts, and they hope to have another this year. Big efforts, small results Osseo Area Schools has worked aggressively to increase its percentage of teachers of color. Among other things, Osseo has hired a recruiter, hosted employee racial-affinity groups and partnered with Metropolitan State University on a program giving its high school students preference for the university's teacher preparation program — and, later, full pay and benefits while student teaching. \"Even after all of those efforts,\" Superintendent Kate Maguire told a state House panel recently, the district has increased the percentage of licensed teachers of color by just 1 percent. Districts need state help, she said. The Osseo district employs not one, but two Higueros family members. Together, Carmen and her older sister, Maria Higueros-Canny, also an English language teacher, attended the Capitol news conference and later testified before Nelson's committee. Reflecting on the experience last week, Carmen Higueros said she was out of her comfort zone but thought it essential to testify about students needing teachers who are mirrors in the classroom. She is biracial and may not know what it's like to be Hmong, or black, she said. But she is doing her best to learn. Students appreciate the effort. At Woodbury High, senior Kamal Suleiman knows two teachers of color. One, a Muslim biology teacher, exchanges greetings of \"Peace be with you\" with him. She also extended him a great courtesy, he said, by perfectly pronouncing his name in full, without hesitation, on the very first try.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T00:31:55.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
