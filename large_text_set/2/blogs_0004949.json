Charaben is a precise art that involves crafting bento box meals in the likeness of characters from television shows, particularly kids' shows. Mayo doubles as glue; seaweed makes for a good nose, if you're able to cut it into the right shape. Advertisement \nMaruo's has crafted many human faces with food, from Michael Jackson to Barack Obama to Tom Cruise. But she's in her element when making characters like Pikachu, Doraemon, and Totoro for her elementary school-aged kid. \nSome schools, Maruo explains, have started to ban charaben for fear that it'll introduce competition between mothers. But Maruo's decided to be generous about her talents, and she's started her own classes to teach other mothers the artform. Maruo insists that it's crucial for these dishes to actually taste good, though; otherwise, all these aesthetic accoutrements are meaningless. \nEver make charaben?
