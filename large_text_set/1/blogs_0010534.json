I wish I knew myself,\" he told Sky Sport Italia . \"My future is in the hands of Arsene Wenger, the man who I have I trusted since I was 16 years old. \n\"The decision is entirely up to him. There are no provisions in my contract. I'm happy to be fought over by two big clubs like Arsenal and Roma.\" \nSzczesny has kept three clean sheets in his last five Serie A appearances to help Roma stay in the hunt for the Scudetto, although December's defeat to Juventus means they are four points behind the leaders, having played a game more. \nThe 26-year-old says Luciano Spalletti has instilled huge confidence since he replaced Rudi Garcia as head coach last January and insists that Roma will not give up the title fight. \n\"It was a pleasure to work with Garcia but I immediately felt confident once Spalletti arrived,\" he said. \"I learned a lot from him, especially about playing from the back. \n\"We've got huge ambitions - we're not settling for second. We have a squad that can fight for the title with Juventus.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:54:06.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
