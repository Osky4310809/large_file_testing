(NASA Photo / Kim Shiflett) Fifty years ago today, three NASA astronauts died in a launch pad fire when they couldn’t open the hatch of their Apollo command module to escape. Remains of that module have been held in storage for decades, but never put on display. Until now.\nTo mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 1 tragedy, the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex opened an exhibit titled “Ad Astra Per Aspera: A Rough Road Leads to the Stars,” featuring the scorched hatch and other artifacts from the mission that never lifted off.\n“I think it’s about time that we paid tribute to the crew with a memorial here at the Kennedy Space Center,” center director Bob Cabana, a former shuttle astronaut, said today during the exhibit’s opening ceremonies.\nAstronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee were killed during the pre-launch test on Jan. 27, 1967, after a spark from an electrical short ignited flammable materials inside the capsule where they were sitting.\nWithin seconds, the capsule’s pure oxygen environment turned the command module into a furnace. The hatch was designed in such a way that it couldn’t be opened quickly from the inside. Rescuers scrambled to get to the crew, but it was too late.\nThe deaths of the three astronauts marked the most serious setback for the Apollo moon program, but the nation’s leaders vowed to continue the effort.\n“We in NASA know that their greatest desire was that this nation press forward with manned spaceflight exploration, despite the outcome of one flight,” NASA Administrator James Webb said at the time. “With renewed dedication and purpose, we intend to do just that.”\nDuring the months that followed, NASA and its investigators identified shortcomings, shook up Project Apollo’s management and made changes in spacecraft systems. The hatch was redesigned, flammable materials were replaced, and the oxygen in the capsule’s air supply was reduced.\nApollo 11 astronaut Mike Collins, who orbited the moon in 1969 while crewmates Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the surface below, argued that the lessons learned from the Apollo 1 fire were essential to the success of the later moonshots.\nWe lost the #Apollo1 crew but we all knew the risks.

Those artifacts were brought out and readied for display as a 50-year tribute to Apollo 1’s crew members, with the blessings of their families.\nThe exhibit features videos and memorabilia from and about the three astronauts.\nThe highlight of “Ad Astra Per Aspera” is a display case that holds the three elements of the command module’s hatch – the outer boost hatch, the heat shield and the inner structure hatch – and shows how those elements were put together. Another display explains how the flawed hatch was redesigned.\nA display case in the “Ad Astra Per Aspera” exhibit shows the three elements that made up the Apollo command module’s hatch assembly for Apollo 1.

The “Heroes’ Walk” leads to a replica white room, and then to other Apollo exhibits.\n“Ad Astra Per Aspera” isn’t the only space history exhibit to open this year: Seattle’s Museum of Flight is getting ready to unveil “Space: Exploring the New Frontier” in May.\nOne of the artifacts to be displayed in the Seattle exhibit is a production-line Apollo command module that NASA used for testing and training. The capsule was originally outfitted with a hatch like Apollo 1’s, but after the fire it was retrofitted with the redesigned “unitary” hatch.\nThe next few days will bring still more occasions for somber space memories, including the 31st anniversary of the Challenger shuttle explosion on Saturday and the 14th anniversary of the Columbia shuttle tragedy on Feb. 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:04:35.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
