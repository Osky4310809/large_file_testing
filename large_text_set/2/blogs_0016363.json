Got my birthday cake nachos, cookies n' creme tacos, chocolate chip loaded fries, + brown sugar cinnamon pizza. #nyc üéâüéÇüç∞üç´\nA post shared by THE SWEET LIFE OF LINA üéà (@thesweetlifeoflina) on Feb 21, 2017 at 10:10am PST\nBut now these things exist in the world, for better or worse.\nPop-Tart creations like the pizza and the tacos run for $8 or $9. The Pop-Tart burrito is the most expensive of the food items on the menu at $12.\nThis Pop-Tarts burrito (yes, burrito üåØ) is called the Nutty Caramel Banana. It's a chopped up Chocolatey Caramel Pop-Tarts wrapped inside a sweet cr√™pe \"tortilla\" with fresh banana, toasted pecans & salted caramel sauce. There's also \"sour cream\" frosting, kiwi salsa verde & strawberry salsa‚Äî& I'm now wondering why all burritos aren't sweet burritos. ü§î Available this week only at #PopTartsCafe in Times Square! #eatstagramnyc #crispyeats\nA post shared by Eatstagram NYC (@eatstagram.nyc) on Feb 21, 2017 at 7:23am PST\nFor those who love Pop-Tarts but want to stay as far away as possible from these weird food mashups, there are more normal items on the menu that make sense for Pop-Tarts.\nThere are six different kinds of Pop-Tart milkshakes that you can choose from for $12. There is also Pop-Tart tiramisu and cheesecake for $8.\nCheckin out the new Kellogg's pop tart cafe in NYC! #poptartscafe #nyc #yum #poptarts #breakfast #dessert #sogood #cookiedough #chocolate #shake\nA post shared by NYeaters (@nyeaters) on Feb 21, 2017 at 8:23am PST\nPOP TART POP UP CAFE.
