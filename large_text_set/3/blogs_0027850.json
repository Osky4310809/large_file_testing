If the bill fails, Trump is prepared to move on and leave Obamacare in place, Mulvaney said. \nThis makes sense on a whole bunch of levels: \nAs a threat against conservatives: Vote for the bill or else Obamacare stays around forever and it's your fault. \nAs a boredom minimizer: I doubt very much Trump himself cares one way or the other about health care, and he's probably tired of all boring technical talk that surrounds it (EHBs, continuous coverage, age bands, etc. etc.). He also instinctively understands that the whole thing is a shit show that's making him more and more unpopular. \nAs politics: The current debacle has shown that there's just no sweet spot acceptable to both moderate and conservative Republicans. Why keep beating yourself up over it? \nAs revenge against liberals: Trump has said that 2017 is the year Obamacare unravels. He will now do everything he can to make that come true, and there's a fair amount he can do. \nAs substance: It frees up time for taxes and trade, things Trump is more interested in. \nBesides, I don't think Trump wants to stay in Washington over the weekend. The Mar-a-Lago golf course beckons. So let's just put this baby to bed one way or the other, OK? Get the scoop, straight from Mother Jones. Looking for news you can trust?
