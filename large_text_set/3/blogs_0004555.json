Go on, GO ON!\nAs you may recall, mere months before his untimely passing, the celebrated director dished about how he and Anne Hathaway had an idea for a third installment of the beloved Disney franchise.\nAnne, the late filmmaker, and the Sound Of Music actress even had a Skype meeting about the project. Whoa!\nRelated: THIS Beauty And The Beast Character Is Totally Gay! \nHowever, when Garry died from pneumonia following a stroke at 81-years-old, many thought the project was kaput. Thankfully, Julie has since given fans hope once more, as she recently told Buzzfeed : \n\"There's talk about it. And [Hathaway]'s very keen to do it. I would very willingly and happily do it.\"\nIn case you forgot, in the initial film, the 81-year-old played Anne's grandmother/Queen to a fictional country called Genovia — where Hathaway's Mia unknowingly was a princess. Talk about a classic!\nAnd the onscreen grandmother-granddaughter duo might even do the film just to honor Marshall. Julie noted:\n\"I think we might do it in honor of him. Annie had an idea that she wanted to pursue about it, and I'm all for it, so if she'd like to….\"\nYas, yas, YASSSS! Sadly, the flick won't be hitting theaters anytime soon as the film legend relayed that she's \"not sure what the status is right now.\" Not to mention, Hathaway's rep said it is \"way too premature to discuss this project.\"\nNonetheless, we're holding out hope for a Princess Diaries 3 !
