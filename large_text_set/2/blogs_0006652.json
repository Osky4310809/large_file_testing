Lord Alf Dubs says he will challenge the \"bitterly disappointing\" termination of his amendment to the immigration act, which forced the UK government to accept vulnerable children. He intends to file a private notice question in the House of Lords today, and says Labour MP Yvette Cooper is to raise the \"shabby\" move to quietly scrap the scheme in the House of Commons. Hours before the final vote on the triggering of Article 50 the government announced it would allow just 350 unaccompanied asylum seeking children to come to the UK, in a statement that Lord Dubs described as \"confusing\" and \"hidden\". Read more Charities unite in anger as government quietly scraps refugee promise \n\"It’s been sandwiched between PMQs and all these votes on Brexit – what a way of hiding an announcement,\" he said, telling the Independent he had not been formally notified of the move in advance and suggesting the government had tried to sneak it through without anyone noticing. \nHe added that he had never heard the 350 children figure before. \n\"Up to lunch time [on Wednesday] I was under the impression there was no cap,\" he said. \nThe statement from Immigra tion Minister Robert Goodwill said local authorities indicated “have capacity for around 400 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children until the end of this financial year” and said the country should be “proud” of its contribution to finding homes for refugees. \nThe number is purportedly based on local council provisions, but it is thousands short of the figure suggested by government sources last year and nobody seems to have heard it before. \"We knew 200 had come because they’ve been saying so,\" Lord Dubs said. \"But the 350... the extra 150 has come from god knows where, they’ve just cooked it up... It's entirely new\". He added: \"They’ve [the government] recently said they would accept the letter and spirit of the amendment but they are manifestly not doing that. \"I think they’re using it as an excuse that local authorities don’t want to step up to the mark, and I think it is quite clear from the evidence that we have that local authorities would respond if asked\". \nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called the decision “a betrayal of British values”. \n“Last May, MPs from all parties condemned the Government’s inaction on child refugees in Europe, and voted overwhelmingly to offer help to the thousands of unaccompanied kids who were stranded without their families backed by huge public support,” Mr Farron said. \n“Instead, the Government has done the bare minimum, helping only a tiny number of youngsters and appearing to end the programme while thousands still suffer. At the end of December last year the Government had failed to bring a single child refugee to the UK under the Dubs scheme from Greece or Italy where many of these children are trapped.” \nMinisters introduced the programme last year after coming under intense pressure to give sanctuary to lone children stranded on the continent. \nCalls for the measure were spearheaded by Lord Dubs, whose amendment to the Immigration Act requires the Government to “make arrangements to relocate to the UK and support a specified number of unaccompanied refugee children from other countries in Europe”. \nThe legislation did not specify a figure but on Wednesday Mr Goodwill said 350 children will be transferred under the initiative. \nIt is the first time an official figure has been given for the number of under-18s who will be resettled in the UK under the Dubs Amendment, which is given effect by Section 67 of the Immigration Act. \nJudith Dennis, Policy Manager at the Refugee Council said: “The Government’s job is far from done; the global refugee crisis hasn’t gone away and if anything it’s getting worse. \n“The UK needs to step up rather than step back and ensure that we pull our weight by offering refuge to more vulnerable people and enabling more refugees to reunite with their families here.” \nIt was reached after consultation with councils on their capacity to care for and support asylum-seeking children, the Government said. \nIn a written ministerial statement, Mr Goodwill said more than 900 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children were transferred to the UK from Europe in total last year. \nThis included more than 750 from France as part of Britain’s support for the clearance of the Calais jungle. \nMore than 200 of those children met the criteria for the Dubs route, while the remainder were transferred under an accelerated process based on, but operated outside of, the Dublin Regulation covering family reunion cases. \nMr Goodwill said: “The UK can be proud of its record of helping refugee children and I can today announce, in accordance with Section 67 of the Immigration Act, that the Government will transfer the specified number of 350 children pursuant to that section, who reasonably meet the intention and spirit behind the provision. \n“This number includes over 200 children already transferred under Section 67 from France. It does not include children transferred to UK where they have close family here. \n“We will announce in due course the basis on which further children will be transferred from Europe to the UK under Section 67 of the Immigration Act to the specified number.” Calais Refugee Children arrive in UK Calais Refugee Children arrive in UK 1/9 \nA coach carrying the first group of unaccompanied minors from the Jungle migrant camp in Calais to be brought to Britain arrives at an immigration centre in Croydon, south London Reuters 2/9 \nA Catholic priest chats to Muslim Imans as they wait for the arrival of the coach carrying the first group of unaccompanied minors from the Jungle migrant camp in Calais to be brought to Britain arrives at an immigration centre in Croydon, south London Reuters 3/9 \nFourteen migrant children from the 'Jungle Camp' in Calais are due to arrive in the UK today to be reunited with relatives Getty \nYoung men are escorted after stepping off a coach at the Home Offices Lunar House Getty 5/9 \nA boy is escorted after stepping off a coach at the Home Offices Lunar House after arriving from the Calais 'Jungle Camp' Getty 6/9 \nUK Border Force staff escort the first group of unaccompanied minors from the Jungle migrant camp in Calais to be brought to Britain as they arrive at an immigration centre in Croydon, south London Reuters 7/9 \nA young boy arrives on a coach at the Home Offices Lunar House after leaving the Calais 'Jungle Camp.'
