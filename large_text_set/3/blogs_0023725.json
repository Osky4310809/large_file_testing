The picture was taken shortly after the incident (Photo: Twitter) \nEyewitness Ed Griffiths posted on Twitter that the \"car collided with a number of people on the pavement\". \nAnother woman, who did not want to be named, told MailOnline how she was in the queue for the pub when the driver ploughed off the road and 'knocked people over like dominoes'. \nShe said: \"There were about twenty people in the queue and I was at the back with my friends. A Peugeot car with a smashed windscreen believed to have been involved in the incident (Photo: W8) Medical equipment could be seen lying on the floor near the front of the car (Photo: W8 Media) \n\"The car came screeching round the corner at about 50mph and was coming straight for me. \n\"I pushed over the barriers and fell to the floor as the car smashed into three people in front of me. They were knocked over like dominoes. \n\"Everyone was screaming as the driver then drove off... we all thought it was a terror attack.\" \nThe vehicle involved in the incident is understood to be a Peugeot Partner which was pictured at the scene with a smashed windscreen. The police said people fled the scene by foot after the crash (Photo: W8 Media) \nEmergency services were called to the incident outside the Old Queen's Head pub on Essex Road in Islington at 10.55pm on Saturday night. \nParamedics treated victims who were lying injured on the pavement. \nOne image shared on Twitter claimed to show a knife abandoned at the scene. \nIt lay near to the silver car with a badly-damaged front windscreen. \nIt comes just days after four people were killed and dozens more injured when terrorist Khalid Masood drove a car at pedestrians then stabbed a policeman in Westminster. \nBritain remains in a state of high alert and police had promised extra patrols in the wake of the atrocity. Police rushed to the scene to reports that a car had 'mounted the pavement' (Photo: @NewsThisSecond/Twitter) \nIn a statement, Scotland Yard said: \"Police were called at approximately 22:55hrs on Saturday, 25 March to reports of a car in collision with a number of people in Essex Road, N1. \n\"Officers and London Ambulance Service attended the scene. \n\"Three people - two males and one female - were taken to hospital for treatment to their injuries. At this stage their injuries are not being treated as life threatening.
