Samsung initially thought the battery was at fault, which is why it recalled the initial batch of Note 7 units and restarted sales with batteries from another supplier. When those phones also started to explode, the company had to discontinue the device altogether.\nAccording to South Korean daily JoongAng Ilbo , Samsung has concluded its investigation, and will reveal the results of the probe by mid-January. A combination of factors is said to have contributed to the failure of the phone, and Samsung will be looking to share the findings as a way to regain much-need consumer trust and ensure it doesn't do the same mistakes again.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 7 Galaxy Note 7 fires, recall and cancellation: Everything you need to know Survey results: Samsung users stay loyal after Note 7 recall Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review The latest Galaxy Note 7 news Join the Note 7 discussion in the forums!
