Applications are due by Jan. 31 for the first two teams, which will be announced later this year and start play by 2020. \nThe club was founded in 2014 as Arizona United SC and was rebranded in November after being sold in August to a group led by businessman Berke Bakay. With the sale came plans for a new soccer-specific stadium, a key factor in MLS's decisions. \n\"MLS has considered Phoenix to be an attractive soccer market for many years,\" MLS deputy commissioner Mark Abbott said in a statement. \"In fact, we visited Phoenix and toured potential stadium sites 13 years ago, including the site recently secured by Phoenix Rising FC within the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community in south Scottsdale.\" \nThe other 10 markets hoping to join MLS are Charlotte, Cincinnati, Detroit, Nashville, Raleigh/Durham, Sacramento, St. Louis, San Antonio, San Diego and Tampa/St. Petersburg. \n\"Being invited to submit an MLS expansion team application is an honor,\" Bakay said. \"It has always been our intention to bring Division 1 professional soccer to Arizona. But, we will need every soccer fan, business and community leader to quickly come together and support our application effort in order to achieve this incredible goal for our state.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T02:44:52.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
