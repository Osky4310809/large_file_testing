We would like to do it and be part of it because Europe is the next step. \n\"Some players were interested, but ok, maybe also some like to see how we progressed in Everton for the future. You will always fight against big clubs with more reputation and with more Champions League competition. But I think we are in a good way to get what we want in the team and for next season.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:46:10.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
