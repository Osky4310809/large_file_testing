Labour's Meg Hillier (Photo: Getty) \nDavid Cameron then ordered an independent commission to consider the issue led by the economist Sir Andrew Dilnot, who proposed a new cap on people’s social care costs of £35,000. \nBut the shameless Tory PM then simply kicked the whole report into the long grass.

Dr Mark Porter (Photo: Handout) \n“Now is the time to put politics to one side and reach a cross-party consensus on how to tackle this crisis.” \nRehana Azam, national secretary of the GMB union, added: “Health and social care funding is arguably the most pressing issue facing our country - with a crisis of epic proportions looming in the very near future. \n“GMB welcomes this new pressure on Theresa May to confront the problem rather than burying her head in the sand - or passing the buck onto local authorities.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:21:48.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
