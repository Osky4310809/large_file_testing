Tom Hiddleton’s Loki character has got to be one of our favorite villains in the entire Marvel Universe. Though he’s usually seeking world domination, he can sometimes be willing to help out the good guys (if it serves him). And it’s that kind of unpredictability that makes him so much fun to watch. Not to mention his mischievous grin makes us totally melt.\nAnd, luckily for all of us, Tom Hiddleston recently confirmed that Loki would be as sly as we hoped in the upcoming Thor: Ragnarok movie. And that’s exactly what we wanted to hear.\nWhile promoting his upcoming film Kong: Skull Island , Hiddleston happily talked about his anti-hero alter ego. Though the new Thor movie isn’t coming out until November 3, there’s already a ton of interest in what Loki might be up to.\nHe told Fandango , “At the end of ‘ The Dark World ,’ Loki is on the throne. At the beginning of ‘ Ragnarok ,’ Thor has a few questions and Loki is endearingly enigmatic about providing answers.” Leave it to Hiddleston to coin the absolutely perfect description of “ endearingly enigmatic ” for Loki.\nComing off his Golden Globe win for The Night Manager , Hiddleston is already having a spectacular year. \nBut even before the award accolades, we knew he was an extremely talented actor. So it’s no huge surprise that his popular character is teaming up again with his Avenger brother for yet another delightful film. And it’s nice to hear they’ll be picking up right where they left off.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:17:45.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
