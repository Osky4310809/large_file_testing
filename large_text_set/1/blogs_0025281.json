Can he revive the dormant offense? We’ll find out. There are plenty of questions about Morton and his hiring. Here are a few that we are curious to find out the answers to whenever the hire becomes official:\nWhat type of offense will he run? Morton has never called plays before, so this is a bit of a mystery. He comes from the Saints, where they like to throw the ball … a lot. New Orleans had the No. 1 total offense in football this season (426 yards per game) and the No. 1 passing offense (317.1 yards per game). One problem Morton faces, though, in leaving New Orleans is he can’t bring quarterback Drew Brees with him. The other major influence on Morton other than Sean Payton is Jim Harbaugh, whom he coached under with the 49ers and at the University of San Diego. Harbaugh is more run-heavy than Payton, so maybe Morton will bring a blend of their philosophies.\nWhat does this mean for Christian Hackenberg? The second-year quarterback now has to learn another offensive system. This probably won’t be as much of a problem for Hackenberg as other quarterbacks. His strength is the mental side of the game. Where he has had issues is with accuracy. The Jets surprisingly did not hire an offensive coordinator with experience coaching quarterbacks. That makes the new quarterbacks coach a crucial hire. Todd Bowles is going to have to find one with a proven track record in order to get the best out of Hackenberg.\nThere is also the question of whom the Jets will bring in to either hold down the quarterback position until Hackenberg or Bryce Petty is ready, or at least compete for the job with them. Morton has ties to Colin Kaepernick from San Francisco, which will fuel speculation, but it is doubtful the Jets will have interest in Kaepernick, who brings along political baggage.\nTight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins can’t come up with a catch. Charles Wenzelberg Does Morton know the tight end position exists? Under Chan Gailey, the tight end was just a rumor. The Jets only completed 26 passes to tight ends in Gailey’s two years combined. By comparison, Coby Fleener caught 50 passes for 631 yards and three touchdowns for the Saints in 2016. Bowles surely wants to use the tight end more. The team needs to find a playmaker at this position.\nWill Bowles be involved? Bowles was hands-off with Gailey: Bowles ran the defense and pretty much left the offense to Gailey. I would imagine that would be different with Morton, who has never been an offensive coordinator before. Gailey was a veteran coach who did not need much guidance. As a first-time coordinator, Bowles can help Morton shape this offense more to be what he wants.\nWho should be the happiest about this hire? The Jets’ young receivers should be thrilled. The Saints had an outstanding young trio of Brandin Cooks, Willie Snead and Michael Thomas, who combined for 242 catches and 3,205 yards – the highest total among three receivers in the league. Quincy Enunwa, Robby Anderson, Charone Peake and Jalin Marshall should all be excited about what Morton can do to help them along with wide receivers coach Karl Dorrell, who did a great job in his own right in 2016.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:09:24.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
