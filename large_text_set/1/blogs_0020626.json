The last time these two Eastern Conference foes played one another, John Wall slapped Jae Crowder in the face after Crowder poked Wall’s nose. Two weeks after that incident there are still some hard feelings lingering between these two teams. \nPrior to their matchup on Tuesday, the Wizards decided to send a message to the Celtics by having every player wear all-black as they entered the arena. Why? Well, because they view the game as a funeral, of course. \nMe to John Wall: \"All black everything?\"\nWall: \"A black everything. A fun-er-ral!\"\nBeal in background: \"Yaa.\"\n— Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) January 24, 2017 \n\nWall especially seemed to have fun with this, as he smiled and raised his eyebrows to the media as he made it to the game.\n\nJohn Wall and Kief Morris arrive in all black for Wizards-Celtics. pic.twitter.com/LMEoRulMKA \n— Chase Hughes (@chasehughesCSN) January 24, 2017 \n\nWord of this must have gotten back to the Celtics, because Crowder and Isaiah Thomas both viewed the Wizards’ wardrobe choices as “cute.” \nJae Crowder on the Wizards wearing all black: \"That's cute. … We're just gonna play basketball, get a win, man. Nothing else to it.\"\n— Jay King (@ByJayKing) January 24, 2017 \n\nThomas also commented that he thinks this means Washington is approaching this game with a Game 7 mentality.\n\n\"That's cute.\" WATCH: https://t.co/Dkh4fY735E \nGAME. ON. #WizCeltics pic.twitter.com/1vKe3CGYcU \n— CSN Mid-Atlantic (@CSNMA) January 24, 2017 \n\nIs this silly and kind of petty? Absolutely. But the NBA is always better when there are legitimate beefs between teams – it makes random Tuesday night games in January fun when you know there’s bad blood between the two teams taking the floor. Never stop going in, Wizards. As for the Celtics, well, we have a feeling that they’ll be just as fired up for this one as the team that referred to this game as a “funeral.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T02:27:25.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
