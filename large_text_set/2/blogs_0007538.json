By AJ Bolando   4:06pm Philippine National Police Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa. PNP-PIO \nMANILA, Philippines — After receiving criticisms for his “push up” punishment, Philippine National Police Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa is on another round of disciplinary action for a new set of rogue cops. \nDela Rosa ignored his detractors who are accusing him of another publicity stunt with President Rodrigo Duterte's order that erring cops clean Pasig River instead of undergoing retraining. \n“So what? Ano ang gusto nilang palabasin? So what kung makita ang mga mukha nila, mahiya sila?” the PNP chief said. \nREAD: Bato berates Pampanga cops in alleged Korean extortion \nSome 228 erring cops from National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO), who are facing “light” offenses, were in Malacañan on Tuesday and got a scolding from the president . \nThe officers from NCRPO were tasked to clear the Pasig River of water lilies clogging the pathway from Malacañan Palace to Bahay Pangarap.   \nHowever, 48 other cops did not show up and will face charges, according to Dela Rosa. \nMeanwhile, the PNP chief insisted that all cops present have committed offenses or are engaging in illegal activities. He said the offenses are properly documented despite some cops denying the allegations. \nREAD: 387 erring cops to face Duterte, clean Pasig River \n“’Yung nagsasabi na wala silang kaso, kumpleto ‘yan, may mga kaso ‘yan. Hindi naman lahat pero ‘yung iba based on counter-intelligence reports na meron silang mga involvement na illegal na trabaho,” Dela Rosa said. \nLast week, Dela Rosa was criticized by some senators for ordering seven Angeles City rogue cops to do pushups while he berates them. \nFormer PNP chief and now Sen. Panfilo “Ping” Lacson said Dela Rosa should go beyond pushups, while Sen. Francis “Chiz” Escudero said it was just for publicity. \nREAD: PNP chief Dela Rosa: Bring it on, I’m willing to die every time \n“Gusto ko nga i-firing squad ‘yung mga kaso di ko pwede gawin dahil iligal, ngayon sabi nila pushup lang, ngayon gusto nila bugbugin ko, kapag binugbog ko naman sabihin nila chief PNP number one human rights violator. So saan ako pupunta?” Dela Rosa said in a separate interview on Monday. \n“Kung wala akong ginawa, sabihin nila wala akong ginawa, kapag may ginawa ako sabihin naman nila na kulang, ‘pag sumobra, sasabihin sobra ginawa naman. I cannot understand bakit ganyan sila,” he added.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:54:28.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
