The FAI Twitter feed confirmed the serious nature of the problem, which Coleman suffered after a reckless challenge from Welsh left-back Neil Taylor, who was subsequently sent off: FAIreland @FAIreland Red card for Neil Taylor following a lunge on Seamus Coleman. Serious injury for the Ireland captain.. #COYBIG FAIreland @FAIreland Seamus Coleman is stretched off following that tackle.. Cyrus Christie comes on to replace the captain. #COYBIG As noted by Sport Witness, broadcasters opted not to show replays of the incident, such was the severity of the 28-year-old’s injury: Sport Witness @Sport_Witness Sky not replaying Coleman injury on 'grounds of decency'. Which they say gives an indication of how bad it looks. 3/24/2017, 9:18:18 PM The incident happened in the second period of the game, with the two players chasing down the ball on the flank. As the duo converged Taylor leapt off the ground and planted his foot onto the Everton man’s leg. The Irish players rushed to Coleman’s aid following the collision, before he was administered oxygen on the field and carried off. Coleman was carried off on a stretcher. Ian Walton/Getty Images The injury is a massive blow for the Republic of Ireland skipper, who is surely set for a long spell on the sidelines. Coleman has been a crucial cog in the Everton side of late under manager Ronald Koeman, offering a thrust going forward, chipping in with crucial goals and defending tenaciously. Finding someone who offers so much from that position will be difficult for the Toffees. WBC cruiserweight champion and Everton supporter Tony Bellew was one of the first to wish the Irishman well on social media: Tony Bellew @TonyBellew 3/24/2017, 9:40:11 PM Youngster Mason Holgate filled in in the position earlier in the campaign when Coleman was injured and you suspect he’ll be tasked with doing so again. The injury comes at the worst possible time for Everton, with the Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Anfield and a trip to Manchester United to come after the international break. But for now, the thoughts of all those tied to the Toffees will be with their stricken right-back.
