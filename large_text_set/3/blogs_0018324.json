The technologies included an OLED display without a polarizer, VR headsets with high resolution, blue-less OLED as well as technologies for implementing force touch in smartphones. These technologies are under development and are expected to be launched within a year or two.\nThe force touch technology was reported to be part of the Samsung Galaxy S8, but sources mentioned that the technology showcased was not complete enough to be unveiled soon. Force touch would enable the touchscreen to distinguish different levels of force applied to the surface, thereby creating another medium of user input and interaction.\nThe other interesting technology for regular smartphone usage is the OLED panel without polarizer. A polarizer is an optical filter which lets light waves of specific polarization pass and blocks light waves of other polarizations. Removing the polarizer from the OLED panel will allow the panel to be brighter and consume less power.\nBlue-less OLED are also being developed to aid people with color blindness. High resolution VR headsets with PPI of 1,200 was also showcased at the private event. A headset with 1,500 PPI is expected to be unveiled soon as well, which will significantly solve virtual reality sicknesses like discomfort, headache and stomach awareness.\nSamsung is considered a leader in terms of technology development with significant budget allocation towards R&D of new technologies. We look forward to see what technologies make it through to consumer-ready products in the future.\nWhat are your thoughts on Samsung and its technology investments?
