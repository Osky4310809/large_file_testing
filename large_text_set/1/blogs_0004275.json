Now we need others to help us come up with the $300 to $400 million we need to build it.”\nThe 20-mile I-25 link between Castle Rock and the Douglas County-El Paso County line carries up to a daily average of 68,000 vehicles and has become a focus of local officials in the past several years. Those efforts were accelerated by the deaths of two Colorado State Patrol troopers along the stretch over a roughly year-long span.\nRelated Articles January 4, 2017 Colorado to test self-driving vehicles on 90 miles of Interstate 70 January 4, 2017 Slow-moving arctic storm could dump 4 feet of snow — or just an inch — depending where you are in Colorado January 4, 2017 CES 2017: Galvanize to train Colorado’s transportation employees in data science December 29, 2016 Video shows multi-vehicle pileup on Interstate 70 December 28, 2016 Colorado’s new HOV 3 lane requirements drawing criticism from 2-seaters CDOT says it can speed up the funding of the environmental planning thanks to the financing of the C-470 Express Lanes project and plans to tap funds that otherwise were allocated to serve as a backstop for loans that will be financing the project.\n“As the details of the loans have been finalized in the last two weeks, it became clear that fewer of those funds would be necessary, allowing CDOT to redirect $15 million of those funds to I-25 environmental and preconstruction work,” the agency said in a news release. “Those funds, along with the $6 million that is already programmed for the current Planning & Environmental Linkages study, will allow the department to prepare for a construction project, should construction funds become available.”\nCDOT has called the corridor a “clear priority,” but has had its hands full on I-25, including a $237 million expansion of the highway between Fort Collins and Johnstown and plans to add express lanes to I-25 between 120th Avenue and the Northwest Parkway in Denver’s northern suburbs.\nCDOT also just finished a $67 million expansion of the interstate in Colorado Springs.\nLocal officials say Friday’s announcement amounts to a clear state investment in the region. The El Paso County and Douglas County commissions, along with Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers, lauded CDOT’s move.\n@ColoradoDOT press briefing today @douglascountyco @epcpio commissioners-commissioners elect look to partner on Interstate 25 widening pic.twitter.com/DeBdtSsEUy \n— Sallie Clark (@SallieClark) January 6, 2017 \n\n“Douglas County obviously shares CDOT’s prioritization of this project and has demonstrated our support as a funding partner, committing $250,000 to the early study and associated process,” Douglas County Commissioner Roger Partridge said in a statement.\nSuthers said he urges the state to make the widening project a vital and immediate priority to help address the region’s record growth.\n“We simply can’t afford to wait the previously proposed 10 years, dragging out the impacts of congestion restricting commerce and travel between Colorado Springs and Denver,” he said. “This is an improvement that will have immediate positive impact on safety and the economy, and we commend CDOT and our neighboring governments for their support.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T07:29:50.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
