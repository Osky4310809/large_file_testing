Drax the Destroyer had seemingly avenged his family when Ronan was killed but he quickly realized his new objective was to kill the Mad Titan because he was the one telling Ronan what to do, in the first place. \nWith Thanos' sure-to-be explosive and deadly feature coming in Avengers: Infinity War in 2018, the cosmic adventures of Guardians of the Galaxy are expected by many fans to tie directly into the beginning of the upcoming ensemble film. Unfortunately for thsoe hoping to see the first glimmers of Infinity War in Guardians Vol. 2 , that won't be the case according to Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige . \nFeige took questions from press on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in Atlanta, Georgia, going to on to reveals the cosmic adventure's ties to the upcoming Avengers ensemble. \n\"I always say, all the movies, Civil War is a standalone s tory about that, but that fit into it,\" Feige said. \"This is even more of a st andalone story than that. This is about the characters. This is about their evolution as heroes, as their own internal family, as the group, a group of characters known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. You know, the way this film ends, and the team at the end, will inform future things, but thereâ€™s nothing that nods directly towards it.\" \nIt is already known that Thanos will not be featured in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 . His next possible appearance can come in any of the three other Marvel Studios films set to release ahead of the big 2018 villain role: Spider-Man: Homecoming , Thor: Ragnarok , and Black Panthe r. None of this necessarily means the Guardians won't be setting a course for Earth by the time Vol. 2 rolls its credits, where we expect them to cross paths with the likes of Iron Man and Captain America in 2018. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hits theaters May 5, 2017.
