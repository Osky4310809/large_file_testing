If you’re a fan of the show, there’s no doubt you’ve seen them and wanted to make one your very own. Who hasn’t?\nWell, now you can…sort of. You can play with one at the very least, with the half-size interactive Tachikoma robot in the I.G. Store Tour Shop in Osaka’s Asia and Pacific Trade Center. If you download the special app by Karakuri Products that goes with it, the Virtual Agent Tachikoma app, you can interact with the adorable robot as you can see in the video below. Just look at its little arms!\nThe robot can give items to people who have reserved them through the very app, and its personality will be different depending on how you interact with it through the app. It’s adorable, so you should treat it with kindness and respect. And just think of how awesome it is to know that you’re actually interfacing with a real, honest-to-goodness Tachikoma! Or at least a simulation of one.\nThis very special Tachikoma debuted on December 23 and made a brief appearance on the seventh floor of Tokyo’s Shibuya Marui department store all the way through January 15. It’s all in a bid to take certain aspects of the world of Ghost in the Shell and bring them to life, and the Tachikoma is one of the biggest parts of the project, which is slated to be completed in March 2018. Hopefully, the next project is bringing Major Motoko Kusanagi to life in all her glory. Don’t lie, you know you’d all stand in line for hours and hours if that were to happen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:39:15.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
