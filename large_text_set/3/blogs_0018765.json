She wanted to create an experience that brought together entrepreneurs to have this opportunity to connect and learn from one another. \nSo, she picked six entrepreneurs from different industries and with different backgrounds to break free from their day-to-day and retreat to Hawaii for one weekend together. The goal was simple: for everyone to be open and honest about their experiences, challenges and advice. Her hope? That every entrepreneur leave feeling they'd gained valuable connections with others who know what they are going through and more confidence in the journey that lay before them. \nThe name #JustMore came from the idea that we can all do more: Offer more, help more, receive more, laugh more, drink more, give more, be more as an individual, a brand, a company. Because there is more to be done and we can do it better with the one another. \nRelated: Entrepreneur Startup Stories: Jennifer Hyman, Rent the Runway \nEntrepreneur Network< is a premium video network providing entertainment, education and inspiration from successful entrepreneurs and thought leaders.
