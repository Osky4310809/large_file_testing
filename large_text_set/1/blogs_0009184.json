Elevens soon.. Quick Recap: \nThere are so many players to watch out for in this not-just-practice game and we have our man, Prakash Govindasreenivasan posted at the ground. Here's what he wrote in his build-up to the game. Read here. Build Up: \nThe discussion around MS Dhoni's decision to step down as India's limited-overs captain must have settled down by now, but a good game as captain in today's clash against England might bring back a lot of memories for all Dhoni fans. \nAll of a sudden, the fans would be busy noticing that left hand a little more, which goes up to make field adjustments, that quick jog to one of the bowlers, the gloves hiding the mouth when there's a misfield, and all other idiosyncrasies that you associate with your favourite India captain. \nThis aside, a lot of focus would be on Yuvraj Singh too, who earned a surprise call to the Indian squad. There's Dhawan, there's Pandya, both of who would need to prove their fitness. There's a lot on our plates today and this should be more than just a practice game. \nFor England, the Christmas break must have served as a good time away from the Test drubbing and they would be keen to leave all of that behind to begin afresh for their limited-overs leg. How well does Morgan inspire his boys would be an important thing to watch out for. \nToss and elevens in a bit.. © Cricbuzz TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T09:43:07.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
