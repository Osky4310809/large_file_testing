Long Story \nGetting a tattoo is a big decision and there are many factors to take into account before you commit to ink, but let’s face it the main one is: will it help you get laid or prevent you getting laid? \nThat Maori sleeve design may have had something to do with a lifelong admiration of native New Zealand culture, but it probably had a lot more to do with looking like a badass whenever you get your guns out. \nBut do tatts actually convert into action? \nLuckily scientists have finally explored this under-researched area and come up with some unexpected results, as reported by Playboy . \nResearchers at Jagiellonian University Medical College in Poland showed 2369 women and 215 men pictures of tattooed and non-tattooed men and asked them to judge them in various categories. \nAs well as rating their hotness, participants were also asked to assess their masculinity, dominance, aggression and whether they are healthy, plus deciding if they would make a good partner and father. \nIt turned out that women didn’t find men with tattoos any more attractive, but they did believe them to be more masculine and dominant, which adds up to more or less the same thing. \nInterestingly, the men surveyed found men with tattoos more attractive, which researchers believe creates a knock-on effect; because other men perceive men with ink to be more of a threat to their chances of luring women, women start to find the tattooed men hotter. A double whammy of sexual attraction. \nBut before you go out to get that tattoo you’ve always pondered, it may not be a great idea if you’re looking for more than casual sex. \nWomen responded that they felt men with tattoos would be worse partners and fathers than men without tattoos. Isn't it great to see that old-school stereotypes are still alive into the 21st century? \nMen with tattoos seem to still have the traditional bad boy image — good for one night stands, bad for long-term relationships — which is either good news or bad news, depending on what your intentions are. Own The Conversation \nWhy do we react the way we do to tattoos? Drop This Fact \nA recent study in the American Journal of Human Biology found that tattooing strengthens the immune system and can actually make people healthier in the long term.
