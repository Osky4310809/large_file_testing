The company’s latest project involves the hybrid supercar, which will get the “LB Works” treatment, and these renders are a good representation of what to expect. \nAs you’d expect, the makeover for the NSX involves a wide bodykit, side skirts, wheel arch extensions, front lip spoiler and a new rear diffuser. That last bit looks to include a revision of the car’s exhaust piping as well. \nAnother staple of Liberty Walk’s work is a large rear wing that appears ready for racing duty, plus a lowered suspension and large rims. The company says that the NSX styling kit is currently under development, with most of the body components likely to be made from fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) or carbon-fibre. \nAs with all of Liberty Walk’s creations, the changes are purely cosmetic, so there’s no change under the bonnet. The mid-mounted 3.5 litre DOHC twin-turbo petrol V6 engine with with three electric motors join forces to provide a total system output of 573 hp and 646 Nm of torque. Like what you see? \nGALLERY: Honda NSX (Europe-spec)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T12:20:26.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
