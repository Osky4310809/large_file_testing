Some actors are prettier than others (Photo: Rex) \nBecause the man who in 11 days will be inaugurated as President of the USA - bar a meteor strike, evidence of treason or the direct intervention of a Satan for whom it's all a step too far - is like many actors a thin-skinned narcissist with the stability of a crackhead on a Segway. \nBut actors are usually intelligent, sane, and capable of showing more than one emotion. Trump displays only the sort of chippy anger at the world you'd associate with a socially-awkward racist with a barely-watched YouTube channel, which just goes to show that being a billionaire doesn't solve much. \nFor all their right-on views and basketball games with presidents, actors generally pass wind more than they do legislation. Trump is different. Trump is about to be put in charge of the free world, and Trump is little more than a series of childish whims on a spin cycle. \nThe 82% of Americans who did not vote for him, the 99% of the world who had no say in choosing him at all, think there's nothing they can do about him. But there is. And Meryl Streep just showed you what.

But there was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart, not because it was good, it was – there’s nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth. \n\"It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter, someone he outranked in privilege and power and the capacity to fight back...this instinct to humiliate when it’s modeled by someone on a public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing.\" \nTrump, speaking last night without seeing her speech, said he wasn't surprised to be attacked by a Hillary Clinton supporter. When he woke up this morning having had the opportunity - had he wished to take it - to view the video going viral online he said the same thing, tossing in some insults about Streep being \"over-rated\" and claiming he never mocked the reporter. \nAnd who won that fight? The one who had rehearsed. \"i'd like to thank my tiny fingers for typing things on Twitter that had nothing to do with my brain...\" (Photo: Getty) \nBecause every time Trump wakes up, checks Twitter like an addict sucking on a early-morning meth pipe and tappity-taps some nonsense he is painting himself yet further into the dark little corner he deserves to be made to sit in. \nStreep was brought up in New Jersey, graduated from Yale, and has been nominated for an Oscar a record-breaking 19 times. Whether you like actors or not, that places her at the top of her game and means she got there on her own merits. \nTrump, by contrast, inherited millions from his father who was reportedly arrested at a Ku Klux Klan riot in Queens, and in turn inherited money from Grandad Trump who allegedly ran a chain of brothels and had emigrated illegally in the first place from Germany. \nTrump himself dodged the Vietnam draft five times and then attacked the war record of former tortured PoW John McCain, and whether you like it or not that all makes Trump the genetic depository of racism, cowardice and dodgy cash. Just because your ancestors did it doesn't mean you have to do the same \nStreep is, despite her millions, fairly balanced and ordinary. Because of her job she also has the ability to deliver memorable and accurate lines. \nShe did not accuse Trump of \"mocking\" the reporter. She did not talk about Hillary Clinton. She did not attack Trump's history, family or lack of achievements. \nShe said he \"imitated\" the reporter, which Trump admitted in his own denial this morning. She said such behaviour trickled down from Trump to the rest of the world, which it does. And she said her job was about showing what it's like to live in another's skin, while Trump's actions merely humiliated them for being in the wrong one. \nTrump, under such gracious and accurate attack, flailed wildly. He defended himself against something she didn't say, he admitted the worst bit of what she did, and blamed the media that reported it accurately of \"dishonesty\". \nThat is his schtick. It has worked in the past. But each time he reacts without thinking the more he shows the world what he is: a fool.
