A circuit judge must still approve putting the issue on the ballot because the city missed a deadline. \nThe investor group SC STL last year announced plans for the stadium and on Tuesday put in a bid for an MLS expansion team. \nThe league said it will award two expansion teams this fall to begin play by 2020. \nSC STL called approval of the bill a \"major milestone\" in the effort to bring MLS to St. Louis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:13:21.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
