Trump has already patterned his behavior after the classic abuser in his demands of broad, unconstitutional executive actions that are intended to intimidate — and are presented as unassailable, and above jurisprudence. Stalking and surveillance Trump signed a sweeping order prioritizing undocumented immigrants for deportation, while foreign visa holders arriving to the U.S. are requested access to their social media accounts. Add the looming threat of a Muslim registry, and Trump has made it clear that, just as a man tracking his “cheating” wife, he possesses an obsessive interest in knowing where his people are and who they’ve been talking to. Isolating the partner from her/his friends Utilizing the very same tactic of separating a lover from her friends, Trump has isolated the United States from our geopolitical allies with inflammatory rhetoric and toxic policy positions toward the United Nations and NATO. Alienating us from our allies bolsters the narrative of a myopic world in which there is “nowhere left to go” because “no one else will love you.” Demands and threats of negative consequences and economic control for noncompliance Trump undoubtedly seeks to hold the marketplace hostage with the threat of disparaging tweets — and, just as an abuser withholds financial resources from his victim as leverage, Trump consistently bandies the threat of denying funds for programs and so-called “sanctuary cities” as punishment for perceived disloyalty. Rationalizations and blame Trump both minimizes reports of problems within his administration by claiming an “inherited mess,” while fully discrediting them as baseless assertions manufactured by critics. Trump and his supporters bear no blame in the rise in anti-Semitic threats — they are instead ascribed to faceless, liberal foes. And, most troublingly, he continues to lay foundation for the rationalizing of future power grabs with the citing of non-existent terrorist attacks. Extreme jealousy, possessiveness and accusations of infidelity Trump exploits every opportunity, including in his Black History Month remarks, to express anger over the “illegitimate president” label — proclamations that manifest themselves in the citing of false electoral college numbers and the seemingly covetous name-dropping of Hillary Clinton. And, where a domestic abuse victim may be named a “slut” for perceived infidelity, American citizens are branded “enemies” for faithlessness. Controlling access to information and services Trump has launched a sweeping campaign to control the electorate through a methodical, calculated assault on reliable sources of information. He has sought to delegitimize and discredit the press with brandings of “fake media” and “enemy of the American people” — and, much like the archetypal abuser, any information not coming from he himself is not to be trusted. Identity abuse Abusers seek to manipulate and destroy a sense of self (who one believes oneself to be and the self-image developed over time) as a means of control. Our very identity as a nation — as the “good guys,” as a beacon for immigrants, as a worldwide champion for democracy — has been usurped by the frenetic rally cry of “Make America Great Again,” fueled by hyper-patriotism.
