Iran similarly responded to the sanctions saying it “will take action against a number of American individuals and companies that have played a role in generating and supporting extremist terrorist groups.” \nTrump issued a cryptic missive to Iran on Twitter before the sanctions were imposed saying: \nTrump and his team have repeatedly blamed the Obama administration for encouraging Iran’s behavior, by signing the 2015 nuclear deal. “The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Iran’s provocations that threaten our interests,” adding “the days of turning a blind eye to Iran’s hostile and belligerent actions toward the United States and the world community are over,” said National Security Advisor Michael Flynn in a statement Friday. Flynn also appeared at the White House podium Wednesday to “put Iran on notice” for its actions. Iran’s ballistic missile test is in violation of U.N. resolution 2231, and that its actions would not be tolerated under the new administration, Flynn noted. \nA top adviser to Iranian Ayatollah Khamenei responded to the declaration saying, “This is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened Iran … the American government will understand that threatening Iran is useless,” reports the Associated Press. “Iran does not need permission from any country to defend itself.” \nFollow Saagar Enjeti on Twitter \nSend tips to Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
