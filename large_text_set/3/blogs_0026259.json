The attorney stated that “These claims are without merit and have previously been dismissed by the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission].” \nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission “is responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person’s race, color, religion, sex.” \nCharlamagne Tha God wants fans to know that “The Breakfast Club” and Power 105 are not named as defendants in the lawsuit as he shared his thoughts on the “fake news” on Instagram.

The publication’s headline for the article has since been changed with Power 105’s name removed. \n“There’s nothing educational about this clickbait, trash-ass article that he wrote in the New York Daily News about us,” Charlamagne says. \nThe discussion continues around the lawsuits claims that the white employees felt “reverse racism” while working for Revolt TV. \n“I’m calling racism on their reverse racism,” Yee adds.
