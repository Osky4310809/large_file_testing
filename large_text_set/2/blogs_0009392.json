New Scientist reports each dog owner would try to open a container, then present it to one of two actors. \nOne of the actors would then help or refuse to help, while the other actor remained passive. The actors then presented the dog a reward and it would choose between the three. \nResearchers say the dog had no preference when the first actor helped the owner, but were more likely to choose the passive actor over the actor who had refused to help. \nAnderson says the study shows that monkeys and dogs make social evaluations in a similar way to human infants, according to New Scientist. \n“If somebody is behaving antisocially, they probably end up with some sort of emotional reaction to it.” \nThe study found dogs’ long relationship with humans means they have evolved to be extremely sensitive to behavior, not just to the dog, but also to other humans.
