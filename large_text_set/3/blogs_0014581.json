Tran of Milpitas, California, to wander through the highly-secured area last week, although he never gained entry to the White House building.\nStill, Secret Service agents were “extremely disappointed” in how the incident was handled, and are looking at making security changes, the agency said in a statement.\nTran breached the outer perimeter of the White House at 11:21 p.m. March 10 after climbing a 5-foot fence near the Treasury Department. He then scaled another 8-foot vehicle gate and another 3.5-foot fence in the southeast corner of the East Wing of the White House, according to the Secret Service.\nTran was reportedly carrying two canisters of mace in a backpack and, although he trigged several alarms, was able to avoid some sensors on the ground. During his time on the ground, Rep. Jason Chaffetz told CNN Friday that Tran was at one point able to rattle a door handle.\nTran was taken into custody by agents at 11:38 p.m., according to the Secret Service.\n\nPresident Trump, who was at the White House at the time of the breach, applauded the Secret Service’s arrest of Tran as a “fantastic job.” However, Chaffetz sent a letter to agency asking that the agency’s acting director, William Callahan, brief members of Congress on the incident.\nThe Secret Service said it has conducted more than 50 interviews, reviewed radio transmissions and video footage as part of the investigation into the breach.\nTran, meanwhile, faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if convicted of entering the White House grounds without permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:32:52.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
