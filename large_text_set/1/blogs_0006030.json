Sounds like a long term inury for Seb Ryall. — Ray Gatt (@Gatty54) January 8, 2017 Early diagnosis of Seb Ryall's injury is a hamstring for @SydneyFC defender - assume he's definitely out of the derby at least, prob longer — Tom Smithies (@SmithiesTele) January 8, 2017 \nSure enough, in the 65th minute, Brillante was cautioned, meaning Sydney will have to make massive adjustments before facing Western Sydney Wanderers.

Then just two minutes into the second half, Milos Ninkovic was the provider, calmly finding the Brazilian to tap home and make it 2-0. Tony Popovic watches on ahead of the Sydney Derby.

However he quickly turned provider for Scott Galloway in the 76th minute. Ferreira's penalty flop 1:03 \nCARNEY SPARKS LATE DRAMA \nWithin a minute, David Carney sealed another win for Sydney FC, in dramatic circumstances. After good lead up work from Michael Zullo, the substitute smashed home the ball, from an off-side position — a call which infuriated Mariners boss Paul Okon.
