I heard ‘valley’ and ‘pass’ and got excited. If I’d known what this route even looked like, I would have actually said, \"Thanks, but I’ll pass!\" But I like surprises, and here was an experienced rider, so I thought let’s do it. \nI’m not a biker really. I don’t like groups. I don’t like following others’ plans. I don’t even like bikers much. They talk about pistons and cranks and engines and rods and shafts, and I’m already half in la-la-land. But since good friends were involved, I thought this could be fun. And this was a small group. Four people aside of me. Godwin, his wife Snehal, Bhuwan and Digvijay. \nSo I booked myself a nice 500cc classic. A tad expensive, as is the norm renting bikes in Manali (Rs.1,200 – 1,500 a day). The rule was Godwin and Snehal rode up front, me second, then Digvijay, and finally Bhuwan – the most experienced one to keep a watch on us. \nThis should be fun , I thought. \nIt actually was, for the first 2 hours. \nDay 1 brought that ‘easy ride’ to a shattering demise. It took us 9 hours to get across 190 km, from Manali to Tindi. In my head, before we started, I was all ‘hmmm--that’s about the distance from Mumbai to Pune--should take us about 5 hours…’ \nNot when there’s NO ROAD. No kidding. Then there was only gravel and rocks. Boulders and water crossings from glaciers melting above, foxes, and roads that you shouldn’t look over if you have a fear of heights. Up until Rohtang Pass (50 km from Manali), everything was nice and reminiscent of a romantic scene in a Ryan Gosling movie. \nAfter that it was all downhill, literally and figuratively. Your ass hurts from the constant bump and grind on hard rocks. I didn’t look like Dennis Hopper on the poster of Easy Rider . \nI looked more like an orangutan being bounced around by an elephant’s trunk. Also readjusting your b*lls every 10 minutes inside the boxer shorts, while using the other hand to balance a 200 kilo-bike on rocks and boulders. Life lesson: never wear boxers to a long and treacherous bike ride. But nobody told me that. \nAround 5 pm, after I bounced over some 200 rocks and boulders, I turned to Godwin and asked him with a corked-up face, \"How much longer is the road like this?\" \n\"Why do you ask so many questions…\" he said with a poker face. \nOh, so now I cant even whine. Great. Just great. \nAt night, after Bhuwan had hustled our stay at the forest department’s guest house (which he did at every rest stop), we rested our respective arses. This was always my favourite bit, snuggling into those Himachali blankets while it was about 2-3 degrees outside. \nNext morning we were up, post some chai and parathas , on our way again. If day 1 was hard, day 2 was US army torture in Iraq. It took us 11 hours to cross 137 km. \nLet that settle in. Add to that, the cold. Early October, the season’s almost dead because of snow. It’s freezing cold. By the time you end the day, your wrists, fingers, ankles, legs, face, everything’s numb. Even with gloves and warmers and jacket and woollies on. \nIn case I forgot to mention, Pangi Valley features under some videos titled ‘The world’s most dangerous roads.' \nLandslides are common. You have to ride across freezing glacial rivers, no matter how deep. And the only thing you get to eat is dal -rice or Maggi. It’s worse than jail. But the food tastes delicious when you’ve cheated death a few times a day. \nIt was almost 9 pm when we reached Satrundi checkpost – a heavily guarded point, given its proximity to the Pakistan border, and history of militants coming in from there. Shortly after that, we were at Bairagad –and cozily settled into Mannat Guest House. There’s nothing more rewarding than a pillow for the bum after 2 days of riding on rocks. These guesthouses we lived in were all in the range of Rs. 200-400 a night. And the forest department houses are pretty cute too. \nDay 3 was the calm after the storm. Also the easiest day for my bum to handle. Flat roads again, and despite another 11 hours, we managed 255 km. Not bad at all! \nWe halted in Chamba for lunch at Zaika Dhaba, and bike corrections for Digvijay. The ride from Bairagad to Chamba was a beautiful one through the forest. Our boys from Rajasthan split at Chamba, so it was eventually Godwin, Snehal and me heading back to Manali. \nThere were still 2 more days to complete the ride though. Chamba to Dharamshala and eventually Bhagsu was our final stint for day 3. Bhagsu is right below Dharamkot, one of my most favourite villages in the mountains. \nDay 4 finally got me, riding alone from Dharamkot to Manali again, where I was most grateful to hand the bike keys over to the rental shop. Pinching myself about this completely unexpected survival game I had put myself through. \nCommon sense tells me if I had to do this trip again, I’d go for a lighter, smarter bike. But you never know until you've done it once, right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:46:21.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
