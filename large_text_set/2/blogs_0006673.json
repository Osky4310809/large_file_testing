I don’t know what technical fix I’m asking for, but I think the companies need to take it seriously,” Podesta continued, reports Business Insider. \nComet Pizza, a restaurant in Washington D.C., for example, was erroneously linked to Podesta and Clinton’s campaign late last year. The story was swiftly and collectively debunked by several new outlets across the political spectrum. Nevertheless, a gunman decided to find out for himself , and was ultimately arrested. \nAs for false stories and its relation to the 2016 presidential election, a study conducted by researchers at New York University and Stanford shows that it had virtually no effect on the outcome.
