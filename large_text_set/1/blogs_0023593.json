More than 1m people have signed the petition \nA statement on the petition's website reads: \"Donald Trump should be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as head of the US Government, but he should not be invited to make an official State Visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.\" \nMr Trump accepted an invitation to visit Britain later this year, where he is due to be hosted by the Queen and would be treated to all the pomp and ceremony accorded to a state visit.

Donald Trump and Theresa May walk hand in hand (EPA) \n\"An invitation has been extended and accepted,\" a Number 10 spokesman said, stressing the position had not changed. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and SNP foreign affairs spokesman Alex Salmond have all called for the trip to be axed. \nIt is the second most popular government petition in history. A petition demanding a second EU referendum signed by more than four million people is currently the largest. \nMr Trump's travel ban has been condemned around the globe. One million people call for Trump's state visit to the UK to be axed \nProtests have been planned around the world, including in major UK cities on Monday evening, while Hollywood stars hit out at the policy at the Screen Actors Guild in Los Angeles on Sunday. \nUp to 18,000 Londoners have pledged to attend an “emergency demo” and march to Downing Street from 6pm on Monday evening in protest at the policy. \nThe executive order, signed on Friday, put a temporary stop to the US's refugee programme, indefinitely banned Syrian refugees, and suspended all nationals from six other Muslim-majority countries - Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. \nThe US president's team told Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson that Britons who have shared nationality with one of the seven mainly-Muslim countries covered by the restrictions would not be stopped from entering America. \nBut UK dual citizens travelling to the United States directly from one of the banned countries will face extra checks. \nMr Johnson spent Sunday speaking to the president's senior adviser Jared Kushner and chief strategist Stephen Bannon about the implications of immigration curbs.
