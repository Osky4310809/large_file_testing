We have a right to speak up.” \nOnly one resident spoke out against the resolution, claiming the council doesn’t “have a voice,” but he was thrown out of the meeting after swearing at the council members. \n“Actually you don’t have a voice because the GOP controls Congress and you people are stupid enough to think Congress will impeach Trump,” said Richmond resident Mark Wassberg. \nWhile he may be right, Congress is unlikely to impeach Trump while the GOP holds control, he is clearly wrong that the American people don’t have a voice. \nI personally find it refreshing that politicians are willing to take a stand like this.
