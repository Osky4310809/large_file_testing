The March was sort of a great equalizer — people from all walks of life attended, including celebrities. And in case you missed it, Drew Barrymore’s adorable daughter attended the Women’s March , carrying a sign that read,\n“I like unicorns — and reproductive health care for all.” We’re right there with you, you adorable little thing. Too bad all grown-up men don’t agree with you — and too bad America got a D on its reproductive health report card. That’s because the government wants to defund important programs like Planned Parenthood, our teen pregnancy rate is higher than in other developed countries, and we don’t generally make it easy for people learn about reproductive health or their rights.\nProud of my daughter and her dad. \nA photo posted by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Jan 21, 2017 at 11:53pm PST \nDrew Barrymore marched, alongside millions of others throughout the world , in New York City with her lovely daughter Olive and Olive’s father, her ex-husband, Will Kopelman. In Drew’s post, she wrote, “Proud of my daughter and her dad.” And we are, too.\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of the Women’s March was the number of men who showed up as allies and supporters. And, of course, the adorable kids who took part in making history, as well.\nThis is my family. Grammy @cocokopelman and Aunty @jillkargman cousins Fletch and @ivykargman. But most of all, the fact that Ivy made a sign with something I said, well, I might be the most proud I have ever been. My life has been a straight line to learn from women. Follow them. And celebrate them. Tell stories for them. And above all, be inspired by them. Let's let this fire burn brighter every day and do not let it fade. Let's take it all the way! We owe it to everyone who has already fought for dignity and freedom. Let's show all the girls that to become a women is the most powerful thing! But I also thank all the men who stood with us. This was about equal rights after all and for all. \nA photo posted by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Jan 21, 2017 at 11:50pm PST \nBarrymore has always been supportive of women — like when she posted Instagram photos of her and her friends hiking, make-up free , when she proved that age is but a number , or when she openly discussed the realities of post-partum depression. As she watches her children grow older, it must be so empowering for her to stand up to the problems that future generations will inevitably face if we don’t speak out now.\nHer Instagram caption says it all:\n“My life has been a straight line to learn from women. Follow them. And celebrate them. Tell stories for them. And above all, be inspired by them. Let’s let this fire burn brighter every day and do not let it fade. Let’s take it all the way! We owe it to everyone who has already fought for dignity and freedom. Let’s show all the girls that to become a women is the most powerful thing! But I also thank all the men who stood with us. This was about equal rights after all and for all.” I love women. I live for my two daughters. And I am full of pride and unity with all women today. \nA photo posted by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Jan 21, 2017 at 4:40am PST \nDrew, you’re amazing — and your daughter is clearly following in your footsteps!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:54:22.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
