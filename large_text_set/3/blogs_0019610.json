When we came outside, we noticed that the children had been electrocuted while grabbing the burglar proof of the house. \n“From our findings, we noticed that the wire connecting electricity to the house which passed through the burglar proof, had been burnt making it exposed to the protector. The children whom were by the balcony, unknowingly touched the protector and were electrocuted.” \nMother of the children, Elohor, who is in her late 30s, confirmed the ugly incident when contacted on Tuesday, adding that she was yet to come to terms with the fact that her three children had gone. \nThe mother of the deceased who wept profusely when contacted said she was not at home when the incident happened and before she could rush to the hospital where neighbours had taken them, they were already gone. \nShe told journalists, “I went out to buy them bread but when I returned, I saw people by my apartment and they told me what happened, I immediately rushed to the hospital where my children were taken to only to see their lifeless bodies.” \nWhen contacted on the incident, the State’s Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Andrew Aniamaka said he had not been briefed and promised to investigate and get back to our correspondent. \nHe had yet to call back at the time of filing this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:59:52.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
