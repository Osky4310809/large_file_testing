Tom Emmer distributed a cautionary news release warning that he would leave if the event gets raucous. “Behavior that goes beyond the bounds of civil discourse is threatening to drive into extinction the civic institution known as a town-hall meeting,” read the missive from Emmer’s office. Typically low-key, often held in community ­centers or church meeting rooms, they rarely attract major attention. But recent weeks have seen opponents of President Donald Trump pack town hall meetings hosted by Republican members of Congress, and publicly call out lawmakers with no ­public events scheduled. by Colleen Kelly 2/22/2017 10:37:31 PM Food lined up by volunteers for people waiting outside Emmer town hall. http://pbs.twimg.com/media/C5TaaaaVYAASCBL.jpg by Erin Golden via twitter 2/22/2017 10:35:20 PM Signs in the line growing outside Congressman Emmer town hall in Sartell. http://pbs.twimg.com/media/C5TaB2EVMAEyWaV.jpg by Erin Golden via twitter 2/22/2017 10:33:38 PM Three hours to Congressman Tom Emmer's town hall in Sartell and there's already a line out the door. http://pbs.twimg.com/media/C5TTwemVYAEjfT9.jpg by Erin Golden via twitter 2/22/2017 10:25:13 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:27:42.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
