Tom Hiddleston once played the elephant in a school play with Eddie Redmayne Today in “Kind of random, but I totally support that bromance” news, two of our favorite British dream boyfriends actors Tom Hiddleston and Eddie Redmayne once acted in a school production of A Passage to India together.\nWhat’s even better? Hiddleston played the part of an elephant — one that the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them star literally rode on. \n“In the Passage to India , there’s an expedition by elephant to this cultural landmark called the Marabar Caves. I’m delighted to reveal that I played the front right leg of the elephant that Eddie was riding on,” Hiddleston said on The Graham Norton Show Friday. We. CANNOT. I mean, we can and we will, but we cannot imagine a baby Tom Hiddleston playing one-quarter of an elephant while Eddie Redmayne rides on top, and is there video evidence of this?\n“We’re holding a table with a cushion on top of it and also a tablecloth to cover our faces because our bodies are the elephant,” he adds. This makes it even better (slash worse that we don’t have video evidence).\nThe internet tells us that the guys, who are a few years apart in age, both went to Eton College , an all-male boarding school that Prince William also went to.\n“He was a great talent even then,” Hiddleston says of his friend Redmayne, who played the female lead in the production . \nWe’re glad there are ~before they were famous~ anecdotes like this one from Hiddleston — and we can only hope Redmayne tells his side of the story one of these days. Like who were the other elephant legs, and where are they now!?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:39:16.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
