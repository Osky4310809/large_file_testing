Travion King, described by authorities as a homeless person, will also face five years of probation once he’s set free. \nThe District Attorney’s Office for Maricopa County in Arizona spoke exclusively with TMZ and told them that King, who was 21 when he was initially booked, will be on supervised probation. \nKing committed his theft on September 6 during a Pheonix stop for Drake’s Summer Sixteen Tour. King lifted jewelry that reportedly belonged to Drake’s tour DJ, Future The Prince, and the briefcase carrying the items was discovered after King was arrested for trespassing and breaking into the aforementioned dorm. \nDrake was caught on video in a heated exchange with people in his entourage, although he later claimed to have no knowledge of the incident when paparazzi cornered him in West Hollywood and told him that the suspect in the theft had been arrested. \nDrake nor his team have publicly responded to the latest developments in the case.
