Sidebottom has been a member of five County Championship-winning teams \n\"But it's the right time and I want to go out on a high, rather than fade away, as that's just not the sort of guy I am. \n\"I've always tried to play with a smile on my face and give 110 per cent, because I absolutely love this sport. \n\"It's been an honour to represent my home county, Yorkshire, play for my country and help make history at Nottinghamshire. \n\"I couldn't have asked for better team-mates and they've helped me become the cricketer I am today. \n\"I'm hoping that attitude will help me in the next stage of my career, as I focus on the academy and bringing through amazing new young talent, as well as helping reach kids who might not ever have the chance to play cricket due tocircumstances beyond their control. \n\"Not everyone has been as lucky as me and that's something I never forget, so if we can make a difference to a few lives, then it's all worth it.\" \nSidebottom made his England Test debut against Pakistan in 2001 and went on to play 22 matches, taking 79 wickets at an average of 28.24. \nIn 25 one-day internationals, he took 29 wickets at 35.82, and his 23 wickets in 18 T20 internationals came at 19.00. \nAnd Sidebottom took two key early wickets during the 2010 World T20 final against Australia in Barbados, finishing with 2-26 in four overs and helping England to a seven-wicket win. Sidebottom celebrates the dismissal of Shane Watson in the 2010 World T20 final \nMartyn Moxon, director of cricket at Yorkshire, was full of praise for Sidebottom. \n\"He's been a fantastic servant to Yorkshire, Notts and England over the years - 20 years as a fast bowler is a remarkable achievement,\" said Moxon. \n\"He's a winner, we've all seen that, and he can be very proud of what he has achieved in cricket, an unprecedented level of success. \n\"It has been a fantastic career and he will be going out at the top. \n\"I hope we can keep him involved in a mentoring capacity going forward, as he has a lot to offer to the young fast bowlers in particular. \n\"There's no doubt that Ryan is highly motivated to finish on a high. \n\"He'll want to have a good season and will want the team to have a good season, so that should really put fear into batsmen rather than them think he will be a bit easier to face.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:55:43.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
