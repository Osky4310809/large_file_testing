No doubt he’d like to thank his right hand man in that game — the Pune pitch. \nThere’s been much said and written about the 22 yards of grass (well, dirt) the Pune curator dished up in the middle of the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium. Shane Warne described it as looking like “an eighth day pitch” before play had even started and the ball spun prodigiously from the opening overs. \nThe ICC officially reported the “poor” Pune pitch as being unacceptable for Test cricket . Hardly surprising given the match didn’t even last a full three days. \nDesigned to help India’s spinners, the move backfired when left-arm finger spinner O’Keefe proved too tough to handle for the hosts’ batsmen and he ended up with 12 wickets for the match. Australia’s willow wielders surprised the hosts with their ability to handle to foreign conditions, in particular Matt Renshaw (68) in the first innings and Steve Smith (109) in the second. \nReports out of India suggest BCCI management strongarmed the curator into preparing a rank turner for the series opener after he initially refused the same request from Indian team management . \nPart of Test cricket is adapting to different conditions and home sides taking advantage of pitches they’ve grown up playing on, but for most, the Pune pitch went too far. So far in fact former Australian fast bowler Merv Hughes believes it’s time neutral curators became the norm to stop such incidents from re-occurring in the future. \n“What they (India) normally do, they prepare a pretty good pitch and then two days out they get the wire brushes out and take all the grass off it so it’s virtually a dust bowl,” Hughes told Sportsday SA. \n“That didn’t work for them in the first Test, will they be game enough to do that in the second Test and rely on winning the toss? I’m not sure. \n“Hopefully we get a decent cricket wicket, and as we’ve got neutral umpires now, I reckon the ICC are going to have to move towards neutral curators so we get even wickets and it’s not relying on the toss of the coin to win the game.” Is that a cricket pitch or the surface of Mars? Source: AFP \nIt’s not a new theory, but it’s one you rarely hear. Often talk revolves around changes made to the toss (last year English County cricket got rid of the toss, giving the away captain the option of bowling first without flipping the coin), but rarely is bringing in neutral curators brought up. \nLogistically this would be difficult to implement. Imported curators wouldn’t know the conditions (the weather, the outfield and the wicket square) as well as locals so you’d expect teething problems to be significant. There’s also the issue of whether people would be prepared to relocate for such work (would a Sydneysider want to move to Karachi or Dubai?). \nPreference might then be given to those willing to move rather than to the best possible candidate, which is problematic. \nBut perhaps there wouldn’t be a problem with alleged pitch doctoring if curators were left to their own devices, free of the pressures of answering to the home side. \nIn 2014 former Australian captain Ian Chappell penned a column titled “The pitch belongs to the curator” . In it he insisted curators should have full control over what surface to prepare while players concentrated on what they get paid to do — play. \n“I’ve always believed that there should be a divide between players and groundsmen. Let the experts prepare the best pitch possible and then it’s up to the players to perform on that surface,” Chappell wrote. \n“In an ideal world that is how it should be throughout the cricket world. And the administrators should also keep their nose out of the pitch preparation process. However, that doesn’t always happen.” Steve O'Keefe certainly enjoyed what Pune had to offer. Source: AP \nNo, it doesn’t always happen. Pune showed us that. \nSo what can we expect to see in the second Test in Bangalore? The pitch looks much greener than what welcomed the teams in Pune, but the game doesn’t start until Saturday afternoon (AEDT) so there’s plenty of time for that to change. \nThe smart money is on India still relying on a dry track, but one that doesn’t deteriorate as much until much later in the match. \n“They roll out a wicket they think is going to suit them with Ashwin and Jadeja. They didn’t expect O’Keefe to have that big of an impact so they certainly can’t go to Bangalore in the next Test and roll out the same wicket,” Hughes said. \n“Here’s the quandary for them. If they roll out a greenish wicket and it’s a little bit hard, (Josh) Hazlewood and (Mitchell) Starc will take full toll of that. It’s going to be interesting to see what the wicket in the next Test match is.” What’s in store in Bangalore?
