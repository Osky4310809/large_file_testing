The group also included deans, senior faculty members, alumni and students who work at the residences.\n“I think it was important for us to say to students we may seem far away, but we deeply care,” Yates said.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Hannah Yoon Manali Kolekar, 2nd year biological sciences student, left, Brian Ingoldsby, Residence Program Coordinator, Ryan Medhurst, 4th year biomedical science student, and Jasmin Dalton, Residence Life Manager, pose for a photo at the University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario on Friday March 24, 2017. “I was just really trying to make sure they stay healthy — get enough sleep, go to the gym, eat well, that kind of thing. It was about their overall health, but we also want make sure they are keeping track of their mental health too, because it’s all tied together.”\nThe university had come under fire from students in wake of the suicides. A petition demanded the school do more to support the mental health of students — and saw nearly 3,000 people sign it.\nThe latest effort, however, appears to have been received positively.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Hannah Yoon Students walk on campus at the University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario on Friday March 24, 2017. Meghan Wing, who graduated from the school last year and now works with the university’s student association, said students appreciated the recent visits.\n“It’s proof that the university is trying and really wants to improve in any way they can and this is an example of that,” she said.\nIt was important for the university to actively try to reach students, especially after a recent town hall on mental health hosted by the school only attracted about 75 students, Wing said.\nThat event didn’t go over that well, Wing said.\nRelated Miami girl’s suicide on Facebook Live watched by mother who said it was fake, report says: ‘U keep crying wolf’ Close to 600 police respond but migrant attempting ‘suicide by cop’ taken alive after wielding axe B.C. firefighter responded to an accident and never recovered; his suicide has been ruled death in the line of duty “I wish there was more opportunity for students to voice their opinion — it was a lot of the university saying what they’re doing and more of a one-way talk,” she said, adding she wished students could provide more input on the mental health initiatives.\nKelly said the Residence Life team is working on various ideas on how to best support students and plans to roll out the house call program once again shortly after the new academic year begins in the fall.\n“Research shows that’s an important time for students to make connections, to have a relationship with a professional staff member,” he said. “It leads to engagement, retention and a feeling of support.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T17:36:46.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
