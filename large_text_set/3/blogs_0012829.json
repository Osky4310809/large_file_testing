The melodramatic build-up to the reveal, though, earned Maddow and company some Twitter-based outrage , a long-form bit of mockery from Stephen Colbert —and her highest ratings ever. \nDeadline reports that 4.3 million people tuned into the Tuesday broadcast of The Rachel Maddow Show , lured in by the imagined scent of a smoking gun that she and her crew were delicately wafting around. But Maddow fired back at disappointed critics in an interview with The Associated Press today, saying, “Because I have information about the President doesn’t mean that it’s necessarily a scandal. It doesn’t mean that it’s damning information. If other people leaped to that conclusion without me indicating that it was, that hype is external to what we did.” \nJust for reminders, here’s the initial, hype-free tweet that the entire internet leaped to its totally baseless conclusions about; it took Maddow’s Twitter account 50 minutes to elaborate on the actual content of the returns: BREAKING: We’ve got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC.(Seriously). — Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 14, 2017 \nMaddow’s broadcast was reportedly the second-highest-rated program in MSNBC history. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:31:07.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
