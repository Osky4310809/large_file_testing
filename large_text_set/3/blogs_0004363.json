Whether you want to drench your home in sun or add a few task-lighting fixtures, you can transform your space with these simple tips. Courtesy of Zillow Digs . Nordic know-how \nThere’s a reason the Scandinavian interior design trend is so prominent. The all-white style has become increasingly popular thanks to a growing desire for light and bright spaces that are equal parts clutter-free and totally cozy. \nSprinkle in some Scandinavian elements with a single piece of bright white furniture, like a sofa or arm chair, and complement it with gray, navy, or black throw pillows.

The white-on-white look is inviting, and visually expands your home for a little extra breathing room. Mirror, mirror on the wall \nIf you have a smaller space to work with, mirrors are a terrific solution. Because they reflect light so perfectly, mirrors are ideal for rooms that only have a small window, or little to no natural lighting. \nPlace one directly across from a window to bounce light all over the room. Hang a few small ones on the wall perpendicular to the window to reflect light in a more subtle way. \nAdd visual effects by hanging mirrors that have interesting frames, placing a cluster of mirrors together to form a design, or simply propping a tall framed mirror against the wall for extra impact.

This key design concept applies to every room, but is especially effective in rooms that lack natural light. \nStart by making sure you have appropriate ceiling lights with bright bulbs. Ceiling light will create the foundation for your layered lighting effect. \nNext, choose accent lighting, like mini pendants or a table or floor lamp. Pendants in groups of three create beautiful flow, and table lights in pairs beside couches or beds add symmetry for a balanced aesthetic. \nFinally, use task lighting. Task lighting is very important in areas like the bathroom and kitchen, because it’s the light you will use to get ready in the morning and to chop food — two tasks that require expert lighting. \nTask lighting can be sconces on the sides of a mirror, or recessed lighting perched underneath cabinetry. Courtesy of Zillow Digs . Fabric swap \nLast but certainly not least, swap out your dark, heavy fabrics for light and airy styles instead. If you normally have heavy insulated curtains, change up your look with a few panels of sheer drapes for an instantly ethereal space. \nIf you have a dark or heavily patterned duvet, try out a light scallop design in white or French gray to freshen up your bedroom. Other items that can be swapped are lamp shades, pillows, throw blankets, area rugs, and upholstery covers. \nWhat are some of your favorite ways to banish gloom from your rooms? \nRelated :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:37:51.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
