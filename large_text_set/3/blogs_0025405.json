It is a story that demands our attention, but unfortunately many mainstream news outlets did not consider it worth their airtime. \nYou better believe that Bill O'Reilly, who has long been a proponent of seeking justice for victims of violent illegal immigrants, (i.e. his work on behalf of Kate's Law) noticed the slight on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" Wednesday night. ABC, NBC and CBS did not cover the story on their nightly or morning newscasts, he noted, nor did CNN or MSNBC. \n\"That is beyond anything I've ever seen in my 40 plus years of journalism,\" he said. \"A story of that magnitude was ignored by the national media.\" \nHe knew why the networks avoided the subject, however - because immigration is a political issue and a top priority for President Trump. \nNewsbusters' Curtis Houck made another frustrating observation. The mainstream media, Houck recalled, could not wait to report on the University of Virginia fraternity rape case three years ago, which we now know was a fabricated tale. The facts didn't matter - it was a politically convenient narrative for their networks. \nThere's worse news in the Rockville case. Four days after the 14-year-old victim was raped, Maryland's state legislature voted to make the state a \" sanctuary .\" Gov. Larry Hogan is vowing to fight that status.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:23:16.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
