They smell like a piece of heaven was sliced away and presented to us on a cotton candy platter, and they‚Äôre the most relaxing way to spend a lazy afternoon. The newest bath bomb from Lush is the Ectoplasm Jelly Bomb (which sounds like a long lost Power Ranger), and it functions in a similar capacity to a classic bath bomb.\nUpon first glance, the Ectoplasm Jelly Bomb might remind you of every other Lush bomb, but you‚Äôll notice the difference when you put it into the water. Rather than dissolving completely in the bathtub, the Ectoplasm leaves behind a pleasantly gooey residue that feels soft and weirdly luscious. See for yourself.\nFreshly made exclusive Lush Ectoplasm Bath Bomb in action #üõÅ #bath #bathtime #bathtimefun #slimeasmr #slimetutorial #lush #lushie #lushexclusive #lushbathbomb #bathbomb #slimebubbles #slimevid #slimefloam #gooey #slimey #asmrslime #asmr #lushcosmetics #asmrslimes #ectoplasm #ghostbusters #gross \nA post shared by Jack Constantine (@doubtfulsound) on Feb 5, 2017 at 12:41pm PST \nThe bubbles appear to be slimy and gel-like, and you can squash them with your hands, making bath time nearly as fun as it was when you were a kid. These jelly bombs are made with carrageenan seaweed and grapefruit oil, so you can rest assured that the jelly goodness in your bathtub isn‚Äôt going to harm your body in any way. In fact, your skin will rejoice in the nourishment of it.\nSneak peek of Ectoplasm - rewatch the livestream on Lush UK with Jack Constantine, inventor! #LushSummit pic.twitter.com/dGJKg3kWuU \n‚Äî Lush Kitchen (@LushKitchen) February 9, 2017 We have to get our hands on one of these Ectoplasm bombs ‚Äî stat. Look at that slimy goodness, like it was made for the Ghostbusters movie. Plus, it apparently makes your whole bathroom smell like a fresh grapefruit.\nUnfortunately, these magical Ectoplasm Jelly Bombs are not available for sale yet in the U.S. They‚Äôre still being developed in the U.K., so we‚Äôre waiting with bated breath until they‚Äôre finally sold in America and we can make all our slimy bathtub dreams come true.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:12:17.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
