The Majora’s Mask replica stands 25 inches tall and rests upon a replica tree stump. First 4 Figures notes that the mask isn’t meant to be worn, and with a $354.99 starting price, it’s hard to imagine many Zelda fans will want to risk customizing the replica to make it wearable. But it does make a nice display piece. First 4 Figures will release its Majora’s Mask replica in two forms: a regular edition and a limited, exclusive edition that features LEDs that light up the mask’s eyes. The exclusive edition, which will be available for pre-order only through Jan. 24, costs $384.99. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask replica will be released in Q3 2017.
