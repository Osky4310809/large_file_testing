We learned that this season and the next would be the final chapters. On top of that, we learned that it would really just be one chapter split in twain, with fewer episodes spread over two seasons to accommodate location needs and CGI budgets. As excited as you may be about it, there's no fun in learning that your favorite show will end by limping across the finish line. \nBut kind of like how even Cleveland Browns fans are optimistic at the start of the season, it's impossible not to get hyped when HBO sprinkles a few breadcrumbs for us. Just two days ago the internet obsessively freaked out over a mere poster , which means it's going to go apoplectic over this teaser video they just dropped. \nA release date! It's in the summer, as the show's producers hinted at, but at least now we know to clear our schedules on July 16. We don't know yet exactly how many episodes there will be, or if they'll be longer than usual (as was rumored earlier), but the sigils in the video are a strong indication that dragons will play a large role. \nOther than that, there's nothing really new — just some audio clips of past events to kind of catch you up to where we are now. But that's kind of how fandom works, isn't it? Hey, the Browns might trot RG3 out there again this season. Maybe this is their year! Drop This Fact \nIn the books, Daenerys Targaryen was 13 years old and had silver hair and purple eyes. Emilia Clarke wore purple contact lenses in a few takes, but it was decided by the producers that Emilia Clarke was not to wear the purple contact lenses because they hid the emotions from her eyes.
