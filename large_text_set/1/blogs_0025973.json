But in Washington, Barack Obama -- the first president to call out mass incarceration as a significant issue -- has been replaced with the \"law-and-order\" POTUS in Trump. taking justice reform off that table. \nI got them from the website of the Commonwealth Foundation, the state's leading conservative think tank . Because if any issue can bridge the great political divide in 2017 America, it should be mass incarceration. To be sure, the debate has largely been driven by liberals questioning the social injustice of long sentences for offenders who are too often non-violent and disproportionately non-white. But a growing number of thoughtful conservatives are also worried about the massive power of the state to deprive individuals of their liberty, and to expropriate massive amounts of dollars in doing so. \nthe Wolf administration proposed shutting down two state prisons -- from a list of five -- in a move estimated to save $80 million in the first fiscal year. \nLawmakers from both parties, backed by correctional workers, cried foul -- citing safety concerns but mainly the potential loss of jobs that would hurt rural counties that are already struggling economically. Already, Wolf has partly backed away -- proposing instead that just one prison, in Pittsburgh, close . That's because the city's economy can better absorb the job loss. \nin rural counties where prisons have become the No. 1 employer has become much too deeply ingrained in the lifeblood of the Pennsylvania economy. \nthe feds used a base-closing commission to reduce the size of the military and bypass a lot of the inevitable politics. Maybe it's time for Pennsylvania to launch a prison-closing commission -- one that will also work with local police and prosecutors to steadily bring prison populations back toward saner, pre-1980s levels. And work with those rural counties to develop real, sustainable jobs that aren't dependent on a phony \"war on drugs\" and mandatory minimum sentences. \na schools-to-prison pipeline , in a state that has steadily cut its spending on classrooms but lacks the political will to take the budget axe to incarceration -- is not sustainable. It's not fiscally sustainable. Much more importantly, it's not morally sustainable. At this point, the only debate our politicians -- liberal or conservative -- should be having about mass incarceration is how quickly we can abolish it. | Updated: our guidelines | Comments FAQ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T06:33:42.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
