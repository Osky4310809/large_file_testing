Trump's proposal to end arts endowment is latest chapter in a fraught history Read more \nBut the NEA has remained a source of controversy almost since its inception, and Kushner has had a front-row seat to much of the debate, notably when Robert S Martin, acting chairman of the endowment under George W Bush, suddenly called for a review of a grant that had been awarded to Kushner’s play Homebody/Kabul in 2001. \nAmbitious political works like Angels, which is being staged next month at the National Theatre in London, are a small part of the NEA’s mission, which funds symphonies, theaters and libraries across the US (the institute of museum and library services, which is the main source of federal support for libraries, is also proposed for elimination). With the entire endowment in jeopardy, and Kushner has come out swinging in its defense. \nWhat’s your perspective on the Trump administration’s decision to propose total funding cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts? \nWell, like absolutely everything that this guy has done since getting into office, I think it’s an appalling idea. I hope it’s noise. I really hope that the Republican Congress doesn’t go along with it. We spend $400m on military marching bands and $145m on the NEA, in a country of 319 million. They’re woefully under funded. It’s a completely empty gesture: we’re talking about a $1.1tn budget, and a savings of a few hundred million dollars – a negligible amount. \nThey think the NEA is going to be an easy win for them – an easy thing where they can say to their base, “Look, we got rid of these wasteful programs”. But the programs are of value, even if they’re woefully underfunded. They’re digitizing information that’s of immense value to scholars. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting produces invaluable news programs, which I suppose are among the “ enemies of the people ”. \nIt’s never about the NEA. The barbarians who go after it are usually after something bigger than that. In the 90s, when Republicans went after it, it was to stop the LGBT movement and feminism and multiculturalism. The NEA was a handy way of going after that. Now, I think, this is only comprehensible as an expression of the president’s priorities: Congress has to pass the budget but what he’s saying is “let’s start dismantling the federal government”. The vision that is more and more clearly looming is that we’re not looking at an attempt to set up a fascist state. We’re looking at a decisive victory, in a battle that’s been going on since before the civil war – really since the founding of this country – for the states rightists. \nYour first play, A Bright Room Called Day, explicitly drew parallels between Ronald Reagan’s America in the 1980s and the rise of Adolf Hitler at the end of Weimar Germany. \nI’m getting a lot of requests [to revive] that. I got a lot of requests when [Trump] was first being considered a serious candidate. I didn’t want to do it then and I don’t know that I want to do it now, because Weimar democracy was 12 years old when Hitler was made chancellor by Hindenburg. This is a 270-year-old democracy and I really think that what’s enormously encouraging is the intense passion with which the American people have gone to war against this grotesque figure and the unqualified, delusional, self-serving plutocrats and their minions who have essentially taken over Washington. The press has essentially declared war on these guys, which is not to say that they’re not being objective, they’re reporting the truth, that this guy as a complete disaster. \nI don’t think we need to go thinking about what happened with Germany right now because one of the hallmarks of 20th-century fascism in Italy and Spain, and in Germany certainly, was the speed with which they moved. Within a few months of taking over, the chancellorship Hitler had essentially set up almost all of the machinery of the fascist state with Goebbels and within six months the job was done. These boobs can’t get Steve Miller to shut his mouth long enough to not give away the game and stop their Muslim ban. That doesn’t make them not dangerous. They’re hugely dangerous. \nThere’s a sense that the NEA represents something unimportant to them. \nI do think that it’s always the case that they think that everybody’s going to look at the NEA and think, ‘Oh what a silly thing.’ It’s what, $3m per weekend at Mar-a-Lago and $150m to keep Mrs Trump and Barron Trump in that penthouse in New York per year? I think most Americans would rather have their local orchestra or theater group or dance company get an NEA grant than have Melania Trump hanging out on Fifth Avenue. \nYou make a really astute point about incompetence, but at some point we’re going to stop being grateful for that quality, aren’t we? \nThat point has probably come. There are Mexican nationals who are in the country without documentation who’ve been ripped out of jobs they were performing beautifully , pulled out of hospitals , families that have been torn apart , even without the travel ban going into effect, already, because they’re bullies and thugs and heartless sociopaths they’re already using the muscle that they have, which is considerable. \nThe continued presence of a serial sexual predator in the White House, and a con artist and a fraud who crows about having never read a book ... There is a figurehead value to the presidency that everyone since George Washington has understood. It’s more than a figurehead, but it is that as well. Beyond Hamilton: five shows Pence and Trump should see together Read more \nThe one thing we did get right through hundreds of years of struggle is there’s very little tolerance for corruption. We don’t have bagmen and second-story men filling their pockets; this deal with the Chinese and Jared Kushner’s family for this skyscraper sale is outrageous. They’ve taken the entire notion of disinterested representative notion and thrown it in the trash bin, and that’s a heritage worth saving. I’m sorry, I can barely speak about this. \nI didn’t expect moderation. \nI mean everybody I know sounds like this. You’ll be dog-walking in the park in silence for 10 minutes and then someone will say “And did you see” and then everybody’s off frothing at the mouth, because it’s just ... \nThe tyranny of the minority is really disturbing. \nWell, yes. There is a tyranny of the minority and we do need to move towards an elimination of certain anti-democratic institutions like the electoral college, which is clearly, in an age of gerrymandering, destructive to the nature of democracy. \nBut we have a democracy and we’re seeing it in action now. Those protests were on the front page of every newspaper in the country, and by the way, the judiciary – the German judiciary collapsed which is why the Nuremberg trials were such a big deal prosecuting Nazi judges. Look at what our judiciary is doing! \nThey’ve taken Muslim ban 2.0 and thrown it back in his face and taught him a lesson that you can’t make jokes about banning a religion if you’re president of the United States and then be surprised when you try to effect that in a sort-of neutrally phrased executive order. You don’t have to have it in print if you’ve already gone around saying “I wanna ban Muslims” with your idiot cronies like Giuliani and Steve Miller. You’ve busted yourself.
