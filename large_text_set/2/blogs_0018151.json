The two have been equally celebrated and vilified by media, peers, and listeners for their off-kilter ways of presenting themselves and their music. In 2013, the two released an unexpected collaboration \"Fancy Bitch (Pussy Wet)\" which was featured on Gucci's Trap God project. In their latest coming together, Manson sat down with Guwop to interview him for CR Fashion Book. \nThe interview starts with Manson referencing their collaboration saying, \"I've played at strip clubs and, guaranteed, it makes it rain.\" The two touch on Gucci's time in prison, writing his autobiography, America's political climate, and more. On the 2016 Presidential Election, Gucci said, \"If Hillary won, if Jeb Bush won, if Ben Carson won, I got the same plan: get me some money, keep putting out my music, keep just trying to be a better person than what I was.\" Touching on his forthcoming unnamed memoir being published by Simon & Schuster, he spoke on the motivation to speak on facing murder charges in 2005, \"I felt like people always wanted to know, not necessarily what happened, since it was all over the news, but how I felt, what was going through my mind.\" \nThe most unexpected bit came when the two discussed the difficulties of being on tour and Gucci's rock star aspirations. Gucci admitted that he'd like to take some pages out of the Flaming Lips' book for his live show: I've been looking at Flaming Lips concerts and, I'm not saying I want to do it just like they did it, but I want people to feel like that when they come to my show. I just want it to be like a big party. I want people to sweat. I don't want people to come trying to look all pretty. No, I want you to leave the concert wet as hell, like you've been working out for damn near an hour and a half. \nIt would be mind blowing to see a Gucci show lit up with trippy visuals of igloos opening up to enchanted forests, diamonds literally dancing around the stage, and ice cream cones coming alive to eat crowd members. Hopefully Guwop is in the process of making these things happen. \nPhoto: Taken from Gucci Mane's Instagram \nFollow Noisey on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:18:27.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
