Donald Trump and the art of the super-awkward handshake https://t.co/g6i1Lrec9H pic.twitter.com/GLAgVW4joO \n— Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) February 10, 2017 What the fuck kind of handshake is this? pic.twitter.com/SaRwz5o445 \n— Dom Joly (@domjoly) February 1, 2017 Fortunately, for the sake of US-Japanese relations, it seems the rest of the meeting went well. \nThe president is not known for being the most diplomatic figure in the world, but he was very friendly with Prime Minister Abe. \nThe two leaders, who previously met in New York in November after Trump won the election, seem to be getting along fairly well. Trump talks about his hug with Abe: \"We have a very, very good bond. Very, very good chemistry.\" https://t.co/2kl3hxhpF0 pic.twitter.com/tVjb7EeY1E \n— POLITICO (@politico) February 10, 2017 Trump said the partnership between the US and Japan is the “cornerstone of peace” in the Pacific, stating the US is committed to Japan’s security. Joint statement from Pres. Trump and Prime Minister: Leaders affirmed \"strong determination to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan Alliance.\" pic.twitter.com/UIDN8eevrP \n— ABC News (@ABC) February 10, 2017 Pres. Trump: \"We're going to have a tremendous relationship, long term relationship, of mutual benefit with Japan.\" pic.twitter.com/4rsfEQkY8u \n— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) February 10, 2017 \nAbe is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming president. \nHe recently met with British Prime Minister Theresa May, who came to the White House in late January . \nOn Monday, February 13, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to meet with the president. \nLet’s hope the handshake lasts for a significantly shorter period of time. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
