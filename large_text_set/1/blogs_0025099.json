The White House notes where Theresa May's name is spelt wrong (Photo: PA) \nUnderstandably her Twitter biog at the time was: \"I am a UK model, not the Home Secretary.\" \nAt the time the actress was advertising worn underwear for sale - and signed topless photos in her tweets.

(Photo: Rex) \nShe has appeared in magazines like Hustler, Men Only and Razzle. \nShe appeared in the Prodigy's infamous single in 1997 and then went into B movies with titles like Nude & Naughty, Petticoat Passions Vol 1 and Lesbian Studen Nurses.

They're OK, nothing special. The 2nd scene is the best, but the last scene (bondage scenario) is amateurish at best.\" \nAnother says: \"This DVD is ok if you're a big fan of Teresa May, but there's not a lot to get excited about. Just her, with a couple of female friends stripping and wiggling for the camera. Not very erotica at all.\" \nAnother DVD product description says: \"Teresa May has sex with her man in various positions, for the enjoyment of the viewing millions. Although one would hope that she enjoys it, too.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T11:12:28.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
