He did not. Shares \nYesterday, Destiny 2 was finally confirmed . And in two days, Bungie will unveil the official \"Worldwide Reveal Trailer.\" In between, we get... The Teaser. \"Last Call\" features Nathan Fillion as Hunter Vanguard mentor Cayde-6, reminiscing about the good old days, and an \"ugly contest where everyone was a winner.\" \nIt's all flavor, of course, but it's a good flavorâ€”one that drops Fillion in the sweet spot between stone-cold killer Mal Reynolds and warm-hearted dork Rick Castle. It's a role he fills very effectively, and one we'll no doubt be seeing (or hearing) a lot more: Cayde-6 took on a more prominent role in Destiny with the launch of the Taken King expansion, and the word on the street (via Gamerant ) is that the Destiny 2 preorder bonus will be a Cayde-6 figurine. \nThe tone of the trailer also represents quite a change from the grim, somber mood of the original Destiny, although how deeply that will run through the actual game is impossible to say. \nI'm beholden to mention that Destiny 2 hasn't been confirmed for the PC yet (the original was a console exclusive, remember), but it's not not been confirmed, either, and it looks like a very good bet . So for now, we're sticking with it, and hopefully we'll find out for sure on the 30th.
