We all know celebrities love to pose. But they love posing arm-in-arm in a pair even more. Just look at these Bollywood beauties looking sensational in two really cool Amit Aggarwal ensembles. Tamannaah wore (what-we-would-like-to-call) a modified LBD with a metallic flared hemline, red lips, strappy heels and tousled hair. Fashion darling and actress, Kajal-who wore an AM.IT by Amit Aggarwal top with skinny pants and strappy heels-went for a more dressed-down version. We love it ALL.
