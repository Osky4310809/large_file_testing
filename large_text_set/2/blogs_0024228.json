Photo: Buster Hein/Cult of Mac \nOne day after Apple stock set a new all-time high mark, the company’s shares have done it again, closing today with a new record. \nAt the end of trading today AAPL was up 0.37% with a price of $137.7 per share, beating yesterday’s high of $136.68 . \nApple stock has been a great investment the last few weeks. The company’s shares have experienced a steady rise since mid-November. Prices started booming after Apple posted its historic Q1 2017 earnings that saw record-breaking iPhone sales. \nWall Street analysts have been raising their target prices on Apple over the last few weeks too. Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty issued a note to clients raising her target price for Apple from $150 to $154. Analysts at Goldman Sachs also set a target price of $150. \nInvestors are also getting excited for the iPhone 8 that will launch this fall. The handset is Apple’s most anticipated device ever with rumors swirling that it could pack a ton of new features that will trigger an avalanche of upgrades when it comes out later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:13:10.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
