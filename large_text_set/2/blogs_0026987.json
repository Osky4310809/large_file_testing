Of those laid off, four are union officers and 98 are union members,” NUJP said in a statement. \nAround 100 employees from the news and operations of TV5 Manila were let go, consisting of camera and field crews, drivers as well as production personnel.

He also said that it is “the last of the cost-cutting situation.” \nREAD: No more job cuts at TV5, says MVP \nThe group said that the TV company has not shown any documents to the union to prove its claim that it is losing money. \nIt added that the network has ”trampled on the dignity of its long-time employees as workers,” many of whom had been working for the company for more than 10 years already. \n“A perfunctory call from TV5’s HR Department, a severance check, and the way out the door were how the workers learned of the news of their sacking. They were then barred from entering the state of the art broadcast center building they helped build with their blood, sweat and tears,” the NUJP said. \nUnfortunately, the trouble of TV5 workers is not isolated. \n“The entire media industry is full of un-unionized workers who suffer long working hours without security of tenure, just pay and benefits,” the group said. \n“As we pledge our solidarity and support to our ABCEU colleagues, we also call on all journalists to unite and unionize for media workers’ rights and welfare,” it added.
