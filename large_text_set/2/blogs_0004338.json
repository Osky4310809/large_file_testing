Since Trump was elected, the sketch comedy mainstay has fired weekly assaults at his tumultuous presidency with the help of almost weekly cameos from Alec Baldwin . In the latest episode, Melissa McCarthy blindsided us all with her perfect impression of White House press secretary Sean Spicer and his combative relationship with the press. In honor of McCarthy’s fearless gum chewing, let’s look back at Superfan’s Favorite Surprise Cameos on SNL : Donald Trump wasn’t the only presidential candidate to drop in at 30 Rockefeller Plaza during this race. Hillary Clinton went head-to-head with her own impersonator, Kate McKinnon, in a 2015 sketch. We’ve also seen other celebrities duke it out with parodies of themselves, like when the real Jennifer Aniston met her character, Rachel, from Friends . Musical guest Mick Jagger took up a wig and cigarette to play fellow Rolling Stone Keith Richards, while Mike Myers did a killer impression of the man himself. Speaking of Mike Myers, we must bring up the sheer delight we all experienced when Barbra Streisand made Linda Richman’s dreams come true on “Coffee Talk.” The whole thing was like buttah, I tell ya, like buttah! And Bryan Cranston revived his beloved Walter White character from Breaking Bad to throw his signature porkpie hat into the ring for head of the DEA. Saturday Night Live airs Saturdays at 11:35 p.m. on NBC. Watch clips and full episodes of SNL for free on Yahoo View .
