Seating options include booths on one side of the double storefront. The bar's brick rear wall and marble top are accented by pipe shelving. An enlargement of a 50-year-old black-and-white image by photographer John Mosley jazzes the rear seating area. \nTedla said she had considered naming the restaurant after her children but was moved by the story of Booker Wright, a Mississippi waiter murdered in 1965 after speaking out in a news documentary about racial tensions. \nIt opens daily at 5 p.m. with a menu of small and large plates, and a children's menu. Brunch is due to begin in April.
