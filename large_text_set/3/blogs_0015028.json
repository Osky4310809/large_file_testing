He used me.”\nSanchez added that when she found out she was pregnant, “I felt confused and scared. He was angry and told me I had to keep our daughter secret, he didn’t want his wife to find out. I was brainwashed, but went along with it because I just wanted to keep my daughter’s father in her life.”\nReyes initially made small support payments, and bought Christina and Liyah a small house in South Jersey. But, Sanchez claims, Katherine discovered his secret child in 2015 when someone sent her a message over social media.\nChristina Sanchez Sanchez claimed, “José was furious and blamed me for it, but I would have never done that. He changed overnight, he stopped seeing Liyah and completely, cruelly abandoned her. He cut her already small support payments in half, and stopped calling on birthdays or Christmas. It was a very hard year. Sanchez said she finally gave in and hired attorney Steven Gildin to sue Reyes in Nassau Family Court for child support.\nShe added, “I don’t want him back — what is done is done. I just want Liyah to be close to her father, and to be able to spend time with her sisters and her step-mother.”\nAn attorney for Reyes didn’t immediately comment.\n  WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:58:32.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
