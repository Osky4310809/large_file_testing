John Stones has been left out on a few occasions but would most likely partner the German if City can steal ahead of Schalke. \nThe fact he can play centre-back and left-back is important, as it was a key consideration in the Blues’ ultimately failed attempts to bring Aymeric Laporte to the Etihad Stadium last summer. \nMourinho proving he's still the 'Special One' \nIt has been reported that City could go back in for Athletic defender Laporte at the end of the season, but Guardiola has identified the need for reinforcements this month and Badstuber fits the bill. The arrival of a new defender would not merely provide extra cover, but allow Guardiola to do things his own way during his time in the Premier League. As I've been calling it recently: a step forward, but not necessarily in the right direction https://t.co/UWuDqzTEnX — Sam Lee (@Sammy_Goal) December 26, 2016 \nThe Catalan decided to shift to a more traditional back four in the wake of the heavy defeat at Leicester a month ago after experimenting with a fluid defensive system which would change between a three-, four- or five-man back-line, depending on the opposition and the circumstances of any given match. \nThose plans were abandoned after consecutive heavy defeats to Chelsea and Leicester, and City have conceded just three times in six games since the move to a stable back four. \nBut while that change has undeniably brought about defensive improvements, it is doubtful Guardiola will stick with the comparatively basic system for the rest of his time in Manchester. \nHe has merely realised that his current options cannot play the complex game he wanted to implement, and once he gets his own players he will return to the original blueprint. \nCity lost to Spurs in early October but things really started to get difficult after the international break that month, when Guardiola tried to evolve the team that had won their first 10 games by playing more complex systems. \nHe wants to get back to that as soon as possible, which is why he is not so keen to dwell on City’s defensive record in recent weeks. \n\"Hopefully, yeah,” he said on Thursday when asked if his side are now defending better. “Sometimes, when you make these kind of statements, when you say now we are better, better better, you arrive the next day and you concede four goals. \nMessi statue cut in half by vandals \n“From my point of view, I think we concede a lot of goals, but we conceded few, few chances. I'm happy for that, but we have to work more on our games, so what I would like to see from my team in the future is - because still the ball is up and down, up and down - to try to put it on the floor and play more. So the only way you have success this year is to play more with the ball. We know it's not easy here, but we have to insist that is the only way. But we are happy we concede few goals, yes, of course.” \nGuardiola was speaking ahead of City’s FA Cup game at West Ham but returned to the subject after City ran out 5-0 winners at the London Stadium. \n“The last one and a half, two months we were not able to make passes in a row,” he explained. “Our game was unpredictable in the sense that the ball was always up and down, up and down and today [Friday] we controlled it a bit more through the passes. \n“The [big] pitch helped us in that sense and before the penalty we created four chances to score. After half-time the game was almost over. When we play [like that] finally we could recover what we tried at the beginning of the season and what we did in many games. But in the last month or two months, for different circumstances, we could not do that. Hopefully we can start to play again in that sense.” \nBadstuber would be a step towards that. The German, when at his best, uses the ball brilliantly and is rarely caught out in one-on-one situations - which has been a problem for City’s current defenders in Guardiola’s more adventurous systems. \nSalon d'Or 2017 - cast your vote now! \nSchalke general manager Christian Heidel is clearly looking for the same characteristics, as he has said: \"Badstuber is one of the best players I know regarding his quality to open the game [with his passing].\" Switching to a more basic back four gave City a solid base and allowed them to arrest a run of alarming results, but it was never going to be a long-term solution for Guardiola. \nThe arrival of Badstuber, if they can persuade Bayern to let him join, and if he stays fit, would allow City’s perfectionist manager to do things his own way again.
