The Football Whispers Index takes the latest transfer rumours and gives them a score out of five; the higher the score, the more realistic and reliable the whisper. \nHere are today's top five emerging whispers. And keep an eye on Transfer Talk for all the latest gossip. \nPatrick van Aanholt to Crystal Palace \nSunderland are set to sell Dutch defender Patrick van Aanholt to Crystal Palace for an initial £9 million, according to the Evening Standard. The transfer, which could rise to £12m with add-ons, would see Van Aanholt link up again with former Black Cats manager Sam Allardyce. The former Chelsea man has appeared in all but one of David Moyes' Premier League games this season, but it is reported that the club need the cash to reinvest into the squad to help fight against relegation. \nAndros Townsend to Newcastle United \nCrystal Palace became the 12th club Andros Townsend has represented in eight years when he signed for them in the summer, but it appears he's already looking at moving on once again, this time back to Newcastle United. Palace activated the winger's buy-out clause following the Magpies' relegation but, having failed to impress new boss Allardyce, it looks as though the former Spurs winger is set for a return to St. James' Park. \nNelson Semedo to Chelsea \nAntonio Conte is considering a £34.5m offer for Benfica right-back Nelson 'Nelsinho' Semedo to bolster his wing-back options, according to The Sun. The Portuguese, who has also been linked with Manchester United, has made 26 appearances for the Primeira Liga side this season, would provide another option in a position where currently only Victor Moses is a natural fit. \nDani Alves to Shanghai SIPG \nJuventus defender Dani Alves is the latest big name player to be linked with a move to China, with Shanghai SIPG reportedly interested in acquiring the Brazilian's services on a £160,000-a-week deal. Alves only joined the Italian giants in the summer but, having not appeared in Serie A since November, it has been reported that that Juve are prepared to listen to offers for the 33-year old. If the transfer does happen, the former Barcelona player will link up with compatriots Oscar and Hulk. \nCharlie Adam to Fenerbahce \nThe Sun are reporting that Stoke City midfielder Charlie Adam could be about to rejoin former manager Dick Advocaat at Fenerbahce. The 31-year old played under the Dutch manager when he was in charge of Rangers, and is apparently a long-time admirer of the Scot. The former Liverpool and Blackpool man has featured rarely for the Potters in the first few months of the season, but has re-established himself in recent weeks, starting in 11 of the previous 13 games. Adam's contract expires this summer, and Stoke have the option to extend it for another year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T13:51:28.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
