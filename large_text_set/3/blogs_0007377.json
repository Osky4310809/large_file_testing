Williams has re-signed with the team on a 5-year deal after establishing himself as one of the most dominant run-stuffing defensive linemen in the NFL.\nWe have reached an agreement in principle on a 5-year deal with DT Brandon Williams.\n— Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) March 10, 2017 It’s apparently a rather lucrative deal as well: \nBrandon Williams wanted to beat the 5-year $46.5m deal Damon Harrison got from the Giants last year. I'm told he did. Waiting on numbers.\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) March 10, 2017 Williams , a 28-year-old nose tackle who spent four years with the Ravens , has quietly established himself as one of the NFL’s premiere run-stuffing interior linemen, tallying 157 tackles and 15 run stuffs over the first four years of his career.\nThe nose tackle’s talent often doesn’t appear on the box score, as Williams ’ dominance has allowed teammates like Terrell Suggs and Elvis Dumervil to rush from the edge while Williams at times has occupied multiple offensive linemen on certain plays.\nThough he’s not a dominant pass-rusher, Williams ’ run-stopping ability is still a highly coveted trait in today’s NFL. Damon Harrison signed a lucrative contract with the New York Giants last year after demonstrating an impressive ability as an enforcer in the Jets ’ run defense.\nSigning a deal in Baltimore, Williams is no different. The defensive tackle is a dominant player and, if used in the right role, will be able to shore up the Ravens’ run defense in a major way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:50:17.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
