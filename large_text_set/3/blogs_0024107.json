Well, it happened to Britney Spears, so she decided to do a fashion show to celebrate!\nHaving just returned to Las Vegas for her wildly successful “Britney: Piece of Me” residency following a family trip to Orlando (which, tbh, looked like the MOST FUN EVER), it seems that Britney found some dresses she hadn’t worn for a while.\nIn typical fun Britney style, the signer decided that the only thing for it was to host a mini-fashion show, because what else would you do? Sharing a video of her walking down a corridor in her rented Vegas home (set to “Change Your Mind (No Seas Cortes)” from her ninth album Glory) , Brit showcased three dresses, writing:\n“Back in Vegas! Found these dresses today and just had to play ” Back in Vegas! Found these dresses today and just had to play 🦋🦋🦋 \nA post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Mar 22, 2017 at 4:51pm PDT \nSeriously, we love that Britney manages to have the most fun, and is sharing these cute moments with us.\nIn fact, this isn’t the first time that Britney Spears has shared her mini-fashion shows with us. The star has walked the runway a few times recently, werking it, and rocking some pretty cute outfits, too.\nOption 1 or option 2? #ootd \nA post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Mar 17, 2017 at 5:35pm PDT \nWALK WALK FASHION BABY!\nShe even showcased her love for Beyoncé , soundtracking one of the videos to “Hold Up” from Bey’s Lemonade .\nAnother day, another runway \nA post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Mar 5, 2017 at 2:54pm PST \nIndeed, the runway videos all kicked off two weeks ago, when Brit shared the following.\nJust doing my own runway show \nA post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Mar 2, 2017 at 10:36pm PST \nWhile Britney might be really into putting on fashion shows at the moment, the star hasn’t stopped her usual dedication to posting yoga memes, and funny pictures to Instagram. Following her most recent runway walk, Brit also shared a picture that said “I may love to shop but I’m not buying your bullshit.” \nA post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Mar 22, 2017 at 7:18pm PDT \nLOL!\nIt’s so great to see Britney Spears just having fun and being playful, and tbh we think we could all take a leaf out of her book.
