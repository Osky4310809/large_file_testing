Media caption Healthcare battle in rural America \nWhite House officials told the representatives at a meeting earlier that day that Mr Trump had finished negotiating and would move on with the rest of his agenda if the bill failed. \nA debate on the American Health Care Act is taking place in the House of Representatives, with the crucial vote due later on Friday. \nMr Trump needs a minimum of 216 Republicans to vote for the bill. If 22 join the Democrats, the bill will fail. \nBut US media tallies suggest between 28 and 35 Republicans still remain opposed. Woefully unpopular - Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Image copyright EPA \nThe moment Republicans have been anticipating for seven years has almost arrived. They will have the chance to take a major first step toward rolling back the healthcare reform passed by Barack Obama and Democrats. \nSo why is it that almost no Republicans seem happy? \nModerates are upset that the proposed legislation cuts health coverage too much. Hard-liners are angry the changes don't go far enough. Donald Trump is warning that if things don't go his way, he'll abandon the whole effort. \nThe president's move effectively forces the hand of recalcitrant members of Congress. The moderates seem unlikely to budge, so it all comes down to the libertarian-leaning Freedom Caucus conservatives. Is a half a repeal loaf better than no loaf at all? \nLooming over all of this is the stark reality that the proposed legislation is woefully unpopular with the public at large - garnering just 17% approval in one recent poll. Conservative interest groups are sharply divided over whether to support the bill or not. \nWhat should have been a moment of triumph for Republicans in Congress has turned into an exercise in political pain minimalisation. \nMr Trump suffered a setback on Thursday when Republican leaders delayed the vote, despite White House insistence that they could win. \nThe president kept up the pressure on Friday morning, tweeting \"this is finally your chance for a great plan!\" \nAnother tweet targeted the conservative Freedom Caucus, many of whose members have opposed the bill. \nThough Mr Trump gave little away when asked about the vote on Friday, he did say House Speaker Paul Ryan should stay on even if the measure collapsed. Media caption Republican Obamacare repeal will lead to \"very bad place\" \nRepealing Obamacare was a major plank of Mr Trump's election campaign, but its replacement has stalled amid Republican infighting, with the current reforms going too far for some and not far enough for others. \nWhite House budget director Mick Mulvaney told ABC News on Friday: \"Lawmakers will have to be accountable as to why they didn't vote to get rid of Obamacare when they had the chance, and that chance is today.\" \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi reflected the emotion behind the bill, saying it included \"higher premiums, less coverage, essential benefits gutted, aged tax, veteran's tax, steals from Medicare - off of this to give a tax break to the richest people in America\".
