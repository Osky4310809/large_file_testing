So with that in mind, enjoy a look at the Predators travels across the continent as seen from the eyes of someone who is lucky enough to ride in tow. \n\nAfter flying to Colorado the morning of their game that afternoon against the Avalanche, the Predators touched down in Denver approximately four hours ahead of their 1 p.m. MT contest. From the runway, it was straight to Pepsi Center in downtown Denver for the third and final time this season. \nWith tallies from newcomer Cody McLeod , Mike Fisher and Filip Forsberg , the Preds ultimately scored three unanswered goals to come back and defeat the Avalanche by a 3-2 final. And just as soon as they landed in Colorado, it was back to the Denver International Airport to head to Canada, with Vancouver, British Columbia, first on the list. \nIt's rare to get a day off on a road trip, and when you're in a city as beautiful as Vancouver, you take advantage. Sometimes the best way to explore a new city - it was my first visit in three seasons with the Preds - is to simply start walking. And that's exactly what I did. \nIt was a gorgeous day considering the season - 40 degrees and sunny - so a stroll on the seawall along Vancouver Harbour was the perfect way to take in what are breathtaking views of the mountains on one side of the harbour and the skyline of Vancouver on the other. \nStanley Park, which covers almost 1,000 acres just to the northwest of downtown Vancouver, was a must see, and the seawall continues right into the park, with magnificent views of the city. \nAfter encountering some historic house posts, also known as totem poles… \n…my walk continued through the park and to the Vancouver Aquarium, where I touched sting rays and imagined the clown fish were all named Nemo. The aquarium was an enjoyable time and was a relaxing break from the exercise, very helpful once realizing there was only one way to get back to where I had come from that morning. \nBut the views of the city and the mountains were more than enough to make the walk back to the team's downtown hotel just as enjoyable as it had been a few hours earlier. Vancouver is a gorgeous city - the photos really don't do it justice - and if you have the means, it would make a great road trip stop to see the Preds.
