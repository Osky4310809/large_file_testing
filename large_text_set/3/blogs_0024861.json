It is the fourth installment in a series of songs that frames his career and gives a clear sense of his artistic progression over the course of the last seven years. \nLet's revisit \"The Heart\" parts one through four. *** \nThe Heart Part 1 | April 2010 \n\"The Heart Part 1\" music video gives an idea of what Kendrick's life was like in early 2010, a few months before he released Overly Dedicated : waiting around in the rain, frequenting CD stores with Ab-Soul and TDE. He raps for the camera inside the store as Ab-Soul holds up Sade , Curtis Mayfield, and Gladys Knight CDs. He introduces himself humbly as a \"lil Compton nigga,\" and chills backstage at a festival with Jay Rock , J. Cole, and Nipsey Hussle . \nThe Heart Part 2 | September 2010 \n\"The Heart Part 2.\" is the only installment of the series to appear on a project, ( Overly Dedicated ) and it represents a significant upgrade in quality from \"Part 1.\" \nThe beat is borrowed from The Roots ' \"A Piece Of Light.\" Kendrick offers a dim view of life in Compton. His humanity shines bright: \"My uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight. He told me rap about life, not rat niggas.\" \nThe Heart Pt. 3 (Will You Let It Die?) feat. Ab-Soul & Jay Rock | October 2012 \nKendrick Lamar put out \"Part 3\" one day after he recorded it in Vegas and two days before the release of good kid, m.A.A.d. city . Tae Beast lays down a nostalgic Willie Hutch flip and Ab-Soul and Jay Rock take verse two and four respectively as the track winds inevitably towards this stunning conclusion: \n\"I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songsThe fight to ignite any wrong or right that I prolongThe story was short film, the glory of him and themThe worry of mothers that don't recover when baby's killedThe trial and the tribulations, the newer MiseducationThe view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who ain't make itThe angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this questionWill you let hip hop die on October 22nd?\" \nThe Heart Part 4 | March 2017 \nThe initial portion of \"Part 4\" recalls the rich sonic tapestries of To Pimp a Butterfly . Syk Sense and Axlfolie manipulate Khalid's sweet vocal harmonies, and Kendrick is cocky but civil. Then his mood turns foul. The Alchemist and DJ Dahi's spare production lets the 808s do the talking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:45:01.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
