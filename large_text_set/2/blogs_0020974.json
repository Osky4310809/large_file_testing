In three seasons with the Yankees, Ellsbury has hit .264, which is 22 points below his career mark.\n“As far as being where he is at, we will watch him the next few days,’’ Girardi said of the 33-year-old center fielder. “Obviously he is a couple of days behind. His wife is great, the baby is great, and that is what I talked about [Tuesday]. Physically he looked good.’’\nSenior vice president of MLB’s baseball operations Peter Woodfork met with Girardi. Girardi and Cashman also met with Rich Rieker, the director of umpiring development for MLB.\nWith talk of rule changes regarding pace of game, Girardi was asked if that subject was discussed.\n“Because of the Collective Bargaining Agreement taking so long, there is nothing instituted, but it’s possible some of these things could be instituted before the season starts,’’ Girardi said. “I don’t think it’s fair that I share because I don’t know what is going to happen. All of them don’t get passed.’’\nSEE ALSO \nMasahiro Tanaka starts his poker face on biggest Yankees call 0:0 TAMPA — Among the biggest storylines on any team in...

His first spring start will be next Tuesday.\nPitchers Ronald Herrera and James Reeves are shelved with injuries. Herrera has inflammation in the right shoulder and will be out two weeks. Reeves has a mild sprain of the ligament in his left elbow. He is expected to be out three-to-four weeks.\nThe Yankees dealt lefty reliever Richard Bleier to the Orioles for a player to be named or cash.
