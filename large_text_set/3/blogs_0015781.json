As PCs become more powerful we've seen the emulators improve for older systems. But the Dolphin emulator is achieving an impressive level of emulation now on a fairly recent system in the form of the Wii. \nDolphin is an open source emulator for the GameCube and Wii, which runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. The latest version (5.0-2874), achieves what the Dolphin development team state is \"the unthinkable.\" So good is the emulator, it can access the Wii Shop Channel. In other words, Dolphin is so good even Nintendo believes it's the real hardware. \nThe video below demonstrates how using Dolphin the Wii Shop is accessed and one of the free demos available is downloaded and run. And you can go further, with the ability to purchase Wii Points and buy games from the Shop using them.

We've all experienced loading a game into the disc tray only to find a system update is required to play it. Because Dolphin is good enough to be viewed as real hardware those same system updates are required. While that's annoying on one level, it's impressive on another. \nIn order for Wii Shop access to work you're going to need to jump through a few hoops beyond running the latest version of Dolphin. But they are all covered in the Dolphin blog post announcing Wii Shop Channel support. \nWith the emulator in such an advanced state for the Wii, you have to wonder how long it will be before the Wii U becomes a target.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:51:02.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
