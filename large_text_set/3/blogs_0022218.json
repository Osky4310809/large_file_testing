He's lovely. I remember a conversation we had when we were standing outside. Zac said \"man it's cold.\" I said \"Maybe you could zip your jacket up if you want?\" Then he said \"Oh wow, I hadn't thought of that.\" Now he's The Bachelor. supplied \nAlice Brine: mourning the transience of oranges. \nThis year's catch phrase is 'not all roses are created equal'. I think that ties in really well with the overall feminist vibe of this show. \nI'm loving these opening shots of Zac. Nothing makes my ovaries twitch more than a man who knows how to spin a Gilbert with one hand, whilst throwing a baby up in the air and catching it with the other. Supplied \nSkateboard girl has got it in the bag. \nZac says, \"I feel I finally have more energy and more time to commit to a relationship\". This can be translated into: \"I don't have a real job right now and I really wanna become an Instagram-famous personal trainer after this show.\" \nShout out to Zac's mum for knowing how to wear the hell out of a dark plum lipstick. Yes gurl. Live your best life. \nWe're being introduced to the bachelorettes now. I'm a huge fan of the chick skateboarding while throwing shakas at the same time. She is what I thought I looked like when I went through my Avril Lavigne phase at high school. I didn't look like that though. I looked like an actual sausage roll, wearing a tie. Supplied \nThis is literally a show about being in large groups of people all the time. \nI checked the licence plate of the Suzuki 4WD that everyone is rolling up to meet Zac in. It's the same Suzuki every time. Pretty sure it's just Zac's dad driving. Ad Feedback \nZac describes himself as being \"half-Australian\". That's like saying \"I'm white on my dad's side, but actually Caucasian on my mum's side.\" \nZac is from Red Beach. I know a guy from there. He smoked like six bongs a day and had an actual anxiety attack when he had to get a $10 haircut. So, maybe that's something to keep in mind. Supplied \nZac says, \"I feel I finally have more energy and more time to commit to a relationship\". This can be translated into: \"I don't have a real job right now and I really wanna become an Instagram-famous personal trainer after this show.\" \nI'm friends with Molly in real life. Her first interaction with Zac is very similar to how my interaction with Zac went down. Awkward and very overwhelming for him. Molly you're a flippin' mental and I love you. \nIt's obvious that the skateboarding chick has this in the bag. You can tell if a Kiwi guy is keen on you by how many times he says \"Oh ae!?\" in a sentence. \nZac: So where were you born? Supplied \nSkateboard girl: The Hospital \nZac: oh ae!? Me too! \nThis chick rapping is covered in mom's spaghetti already. I once tried to impress a boy by rapping Eminem lyrics. I was 14 years old and at the school pool. Half way through the opening verse I realised it was not going well for me, so I just pretended to drown instead. Supplied \nZac is clearly very startled when in big groups. \nI like how they played darker music when Rosie walked out, so that we all know that she's the bitch one. \nWhen trying to guess what the white rose means, one of the women actually says \"maybe it could be for the most pure girl?\". Is that grounds for a full background investigation on her? I'm confident she's grown up in some kind of cult. \nWe're now on to episode two. I'm eating an orange as I watch this. I'm willing to place a bet that I'm going to be more disappointed when this orange is finished, than I will be when this episode is. Supplied \nThe only reason I'm watching the next episode is because there was a shot of Zac leaning against an actual plane. He's hot. I'll watch it because he's hot. \nClaudia has the best boobs I've ever seen. I relate to her a lot because of that. \n\"I just want that f rose.\"- Has to be the most New Zealand quote in all of history. \nZac is clearly very startled when in big groups. Maybe that is something that one of the producers, perhaps, should have considered, before casting him on a show that is literally just all about being in big groups all the time. SUPPLIED \nThe 'wifey' Viarni, sharing some quality time with the Bachelor Zac. \nI'm checking over my notes for this episode and an entire page just has \"I'M SO BORED\" written over and over again, in all caps. \nThis show actually makes me want to move to the bush and build a castle and just live in it with heaps of dogs for the rest of my days. \nI'll be honest, I just fast forwarded to the end. I do not care who left and who stayed. I still can't tell any of these women apart. Supplied \n\"I just want that f rose.\"- Has to be the most New Zealand quote in all of history. \nMy orange finished a long time ago and I'm only feeling brave enough to talk about it now. Never have I felt such great sense of loss. \nThe only reason I'm watching the next episode is because there was a shot of Zac leaning against an actual plane. He's hot. I'll watch it because he's hot. \nBrine is performing at the 2017 International Comedy Festival show: No One Puts Briney In The Corner. Tickets available at comedyfestival.co.nz . Supplied \nHaha haha hahah haha! A mirthful Zac with Claudia. \n\nConfused in crowds: Zac Franich. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:06:12.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
