Superman : Dawn of Justice, but thanks to Justice League director Zack Snyder , those same fans should still hold out hope to see their favorite character in Snyder's upcoming film. \nIn scans released today from an upcoming issue of Empire, Snyder sat down with the magazine to give a preview of the upcoming Justice League movie. The feature also included a new picture of Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, and Cyborg, which we covered here . \n“Superman does play a big part in this movie,” Snyder told Empire. “His presence and lack of presence, are big story points…” \nIf you recall, Superman and Doomsday seemingly killed each other at the end of Batman v. Superman in an ending that mirrored “The Death of Superman,” a big DC Comics storyline in 1992. While we didn’t see a full-on resurrection, we did see the dirt rise off of Clark Kent’s grave hinting that we haven’t seen the end of the Man of Steel. \nWhile we don't know the way in which Superman will return or his exact role in Justice League , we know the group will be facing Steppenwolf and Parademons as the primary antagonists. \nJustice League is directed by Zack Snyder, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio, and features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill , Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Ciarán Hinds, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Jeremy Irons and Jesse Eisenberg. \nJustice League is slated for release on November 11, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:44:15.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
