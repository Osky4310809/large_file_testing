The Commission was legally bound to propose by last April that visas be reintroduced for U.S. citizens for 12 months but the 28-nation bloc’s member countries preferred to take no action. \nThe Commission has cautioned that suspending the visa waiver for Americans would also hurt trade, tourism and the European economy. \n“As you know, our approach brought results with Canada. We will continue our engagement with the United States on this matter as well our broader cooperation on migration and security,” European Home-affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos told the Journal . \nAvramopoulos was referring to Canada, which in October agreed to lift its visa requirement for citizens from Romania and Bulgaria by December 1, 2017. The two countries made visa-free travel a key condition for their support of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T04:26:34.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
