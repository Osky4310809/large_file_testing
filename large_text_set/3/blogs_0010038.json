I don’t think it’s the job of Westminster or the Labour Party to prevent people holding referenda.” \nBut speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, Corbyn claimed: \n“There was a bit of mischievous misreporting there. I was asked if in Westminster we would block the holding of a referendum. I said ‘no’, if the Scottish parliament wanted to have a referendum then it would be wrong for Westminster to block it.” \nFollowing his interview on Today, PA hit back at Corbyn for suggesting it had inaccurately reported what he said. \nPeter Clifton, PA’s Editor-in-Chief, said: “The only mischievous thing about this episode is the suggestion that PA has done anything beyond what it always does – accurately report what politicians say to us in an entirely impartial way.” \nIt is extremely unusual for PA, an impartial news service which works for media outlets including The Huffington Post UK, to publicly disagree with a politician. \nCorbyn subsequently insisted he was not referring to PA, but instead to other publications which used its reporting. \nAnd video of the interview added weight to PA’s insistence it reported Corbyn’s words fairly and accurately. Watch the clip, below . \nAnd journalists were quick to rubbish Corbyn’s claim, especially the assertion that PA’s report was in turn misrepresented by other outlets. From Fox to Leadsom to Corbyn, it's always the journalist's fault if you realise you've said the wrong thing https://t.co/J05u81essm — Jessica Elgot (@jessicaelgot) March 13, 2017 . @KatrineBussey and every other journalist did not ''misreport\" Mr Corbyn's words. To suggest so is a falsehood. https://t.co/pVLQaFSj8x — Aidan Kerr (@Aidan___Kerr) March 13, 2017 Team Corbyn's adoption of the Trump playbook on how to deal with bad press is one of the more stupid things it has done. — Jonathan Haynes (@JonathanHaynes) March 13, 2017 \nA spokesperson for Jeremy Corbyn said: “Jeremy was not referring to the Press Association, which provides a good service, in his Today interview. He was talking about other outlets, which presented what he said out of context. \n“Labour and Jeremy’s position is clear; we oppose a second referendum, and will do so in the proper place, the Scottish Parliament. \n“The ‘absolutely fine’ comment referred to a referendum agreed by the Scottish parliament. Jeremy and Labour do not want a second referendum but believe it would wrong for Westminster to block it.” READ MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T17:01:25.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
