I would be very critical of this. \n\"Of course football is at risk of becoming broken; we have to take care that this does not escalate even further up and the bubble bursts. There can be no question of that. \nSergio Ramos furious at Sevilla fans \n\"There used to be only three or four leagues who could bid such high sums. Globalisation has made it so that even China or Qatar can compete financially. Everything has changed... [but] at some point madness will calm down again.\" \nWatzke, who has been Dortmund CEO for 12 years since being appointed to turn around a financial crisis, stopped short of criticising the salaries earned by the world's best players, though, whom he believes deserve their lucrative wages. \n\"I only get a headache over wages when I feel that the money is not justified,\" he said, \"but I also have the feeling that with the football quite money is earned.\" \nInsinuating that British clubs pay over the odds for players, he added: \"There is no reason for US investors to invest in the Premier League. The shareholders of Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund do not have the feeling that no money can be earned here. \n\"If there were losses, that would be different but the Bundesliga is an economic success story. Football fans must feel that their team's players are earning their money; that's the most important thing.\" \nDortmund are currently on their winter break and recommence the 2016-17 campaign on January 21. \nThomas Tuchel's side are placed sixth in the Bundesliga, 12 points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich and nine points off newly promoted RB Leipzig.
