Shares \nMass Effect: Andromeda is just around the corner, but that doesn't mean the original trilogy is floating lifeless like an abandoned Normandy. Sob. It's still one of the most beloved RPG series of all time ( we love to argue about its best and worst characters ), and its vast universe has spawned some excellent pieces of merch. \nBelow, we've curated some of the best collectibles on the Internet. Just try not to spend all your credits at once. Remote-controlled Nomad ND1 replica \nPrice: $200 \nLet's start out with something that should get you in the mood for Andromeda.
