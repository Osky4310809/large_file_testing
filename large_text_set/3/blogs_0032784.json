Eduardo A. Encina , who signed a minor league deal with the club to play the outfield, will start the season in Triple-A Norfolk and continue his transition there. Non-roster second baseman Johnny Giavotella will also report to Norfolk.\nThe Orioles will carry just three starting pitchers to open the season, a benefit of two days off in the seasonâ€™s first four days, and left-hander Wade Miley will open the season on the disabled list after the effects of an upper respiratory infection from earlier this month forced him to miss two starts. Because of the new 10-day DL, Miley can return April 9 to start. \nThat means the Orioles will carry an eight-man bullpen, with right-hander Tyler Wilson and left-hander Vidal Nuno likely earning long relief spots. \nThat leaves one spot on the 25-man roster. The team left for Norfolk with right-hander Gabriel Ynoa and left-hander Jayson Aquino as the two remaining starters on the roster. They are the frontrunners to start April 15 in the rotation hole created by right-hander Chris Tillman opening the season on the DL.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:30:29.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
