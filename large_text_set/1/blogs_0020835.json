Floridians wanted them all — and got them by voting for them at the polls.\nAnd boy, did it tick off your legislators.\nSee, politicians don't like it when you take control of your own government. They want to be the ones pulling the strings ... well, they and their lobbyist pals.\nSo now there's a move afoot to make it harder for you to get the government you want by increasing the number of votes it would take for any future Constitutional amendment to pass.\nFlorida already did this once. About a decade ago, at the Legislature's urging, voters agreed to raise an amendment's passing bar from a simple majority to 60 percent.\nCaption Scott Maxwell is told to be civil to our new president - Maxwell's Hate Mail In this edition of Maxwell's Hate Mail, Scott is called various names, a reader questions the value of his column, and one person not-so civily admonishes Scott to be civil to our new president.\nIn this edition of Maxwell's Hate Mail, Scott is called various names, a reader questions the value of his column, and one person not-so civily admonishes Scott to be civil to our new president.\nCaption Scott Maxwell is told to be civil to our new president - Maxwell's Hate Mail In this edition of Maxwell's Hate Mail, Scott is called various names, a reader questions the value of his column, and one person not-so civily admonishes Scott to be civil to our new president.\nIn this edition of Maxwell's Hate Mail, Scott is called various names, a reader questions the value of his column, and one person not-so civily admonishes Scott to be civil to our new president.\nCaption Trump's pick for education secretary Betsy DeVos - Orlando News Now DeVos wants school \"reform\" even as Florida reformers now push for repeals.\nDeVos wants school \"reform\" even as Florida reformers now push for repeals.\nCaption Florida's death-penalty system is ruled unconstitutional - Orlando News Now In 2016, only five states in America continued to execute people.

But it didn't.\nYou went right ahead and passed the Fair Districts amendment, to make legislators stop gerrymandering, with 63 percent of the vote.\nSo now they want to raise it even higher — to 67 percent.\nIt appears that as long as you have a voice, legislators want to muffle it.\nThe latest bill was filed by Rep. Rick Roth, a Palm Beach Republican who is so focused on this issue, his only other bill calls for the creation of a Ronald Reagan license plate.\nRoth (who, by the way, fetched only 58 percent of the vote himself in his last election) has said he is sick of citizens trying to change the Constitution.\nIf that's true, Roth should be even more sick of the very Legislature in which he serves, because legislators — not citizens — are the ones who try to change it most.\nIn Florida's history, citizens have managed to get a grand total of 36 amendment measures onto the ballot, according to Ballotpedia.\nLegislators, on the other hand, proposed 329. Yes, 10 times as many.\nAnd they are still going. In 2012, there were a whopping 11 amendments on the ballot — every one of them placed there by legislators.\nYet Roth parrots a popular legislative talking point that claims you , the citizens who fund this government, are the problem.\nOnly if you ignore the facts.\nNow there's a reason citizens don't try to change the Constitution very often. Because it's incredibly difficult.\n\"It is time-consuming, complicated and extremely expensive,\" said Pamela Goodman, president of the Florida League of Women Voters, which championed Fair Districts. \"It's already hard. And this tries to make it practically impossible.\"\nGoodman described citizen initiatives as \"a last resort\" — something citizens usually only try after legislators ignore them. And she's right.\nWith both Fair Districts and the class-size amendment, citizens first begged lawmakers to do the right things — to stop gerrymandering and to raise Florida's basement-level funding for schools to a place where we didn't have to cram 40 kids in a single math class.\nBut the politicians ignored them. Again and again.\nSo, with nowhere else to turn, residents launched massive efforts to canvas the state, gather signatures, fight legal challenges and finally get their issues on the ballot.\nThen — after all that — legislators trotted out their standard absurdist objections: Issues like this shouldn't be in the Constitution. They should be handled the Legislature … where we refuse to handle them.\nIt's like taking logic lessons from the Jabberwocky.\nAnd spare me the pearl-clutching about how the state Constitution being a supposedly \"sacred\" document. Hogwash. The United States Constitution is a sacred document. The Ten Commandments are a sacred document.\nThe current Florida Constitution was ratified less than 50 years ago. And lawmakers themselves have tried to amend it hundreds of times with everything from super-targeted tax breaks to political posturing against Obamacare. Sacred, indeed.\nI have no problem with citizens availing themselves of one of the few remaining pipelines to Democracy — especially when legislators aren't doing their jobs.\nIf Roth and his Republican buddies are worried about too many amendments, they should simply stop proposing them.\nBut the citizens of this state and the current process are not the problem.\nsmaxwell@orlandosentinel.com\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Elections", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5824b504/turbine/os-election-take-aways-by-columnist-scott-maxwell-orlando-news-now-20161110", "https://api.nlr.tronc.com/v3/newsletters/subscriptions&newsletterApiKey=t2RIwsHk5p8RFZ0sPKLEr2M0Rh64DNz69BDRyGQa&grecaptchaSiteKey=6Le1uQoUAAAAAJlmu5Oue58PyhPzc_ZLYtR7AzKt&aid=2089072590&allurl=http://membership.orlandosentinel.com/newsletters", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58371fa8/turbine/os-scott-maxwell-is-told-to-be-civil-to-our-new-president-maxwell-s-hate-mail-20161124", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5835e478/turbine/os-scott-maxwell-101-things-we-love-about-central-florida-20161123", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-586be859/turbine/os-florida-s-death-penalty-system-is-ruled-unconstitutional-orlando-news-now-20170103", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5887e13c/turbine/os-florida-constitution-amendment-scott-maxwell-20170125", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-587e5caf/turbine/os-trump-s-pick-for-education-secretary-betsy-devos-orlando-news-now-20170117"], "published": "2017-01-25T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:27:52.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
