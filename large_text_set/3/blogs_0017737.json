Now we’ve come to learn that the lucky owner of the 1958-built house is none other than Jack White, rock musician extraordinaire, formerly of the White Stripes, and a native of Detroit. According to an article in this week’s issue of The New Yorker , Whitebought the home above asking for $510,000—sight-unseen. (We like to think he first peeped the photos on Curbed.) He currently lives in Nashville, where his label Third Man Records is based, and plans to use the 3,500-square-foot Kirkpatrick House as an occasional writing retreat. As a former upholsterer’s apprentice, White is something of a furniture and design enthusiast and sees himself as a “custodian” of the property rather than its owner, according to the article. “I’m a believer in nobody owns anything,” he said. “If you could take care of it and pass it along, it’s good.” The sale of the home included most of the original Herman Miller furniture, which presumably White is going to preserve. The rocker recently opened Third Man’s first physical location in Detroit, a vinyl pressing plant .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:52:35.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
