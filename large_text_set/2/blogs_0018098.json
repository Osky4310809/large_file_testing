Its data is drawn from \"official air quality sensors\" placed across cities that monitor airborne particles and combined with information on wind, weather and traffic conditions.\nBy simply searching a location, users will be shown a color-coded map of the pollution level in the surrounding area. They'll also receive useful information such as carbon monoxide and ozone levels, weather forecast updates, and heath, sports and child care-related suggestions.\nYou can use the map to choose the cleanest park for a picnic, a running route for your next jog or even review pollen levels to help keep your allergies in check.\nImage: breezometer\n\"Today’s traditional air pollution monitoring methods include only annual traffic data, which doesn’t reflect the day-to-day changes residents see and breathe on their local streets,\" BreezoMeter's CTO Emil Fisher said in a press release.\n\"BreezoMeter’s newest algorithm serves as a massive research and development breakthrough, bringing air pollution data accuracy to a new and precise level, monitored worldwide.\" he said.\nImage: breezometer\nThe company's CEO Ran Korber insists that BreezoMeter's map is changing the game. \"Businesses and consumers previously had to rely on inaccurate and generic point data regarding pollution, a truly global health crisis,\" he said in a press release.\nSo far, major brands like Dyson, Dermalogica, AccuWeather and Cisco integrate BreezoMeter's air quality data in their products, and the company hopes its map will help people better understand their surroundings.\nBONUS: The first manned hoverbike could finally fulfill your 'Star Wars' dreams", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/9E2Zt4AM.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Qe5JfoifQAYgmUmEgjwaBTAU_y4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390528%2Fc205c516-7cde-4728-9afd-ff43f1077d6b.png", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/On21zfxA6vA?enablejsapi=1&", "https://breezometer.com/#air-quality-map", "https://breezometer.com/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/u75jbo6D8cK_o5gszfXAqrrNlHw=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390526%2F1442f78b-ac01-4d46-9caa-db82e18494d4.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/K_5MKJSeWkXvEX4H3NcUgHILxmQ=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390526%2F1442f78b-ac01-4d46-9caa-db82e18494d4.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/9E2Zt4AM.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lzaM6qSOXl9utrAbK9t_6kaZFPA=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390528%2Fc205c516-7cde-4728-9afd-ff43f1077d6b.png", "http://a.amz.mshcdn.com/assets/lib/aab-3e4af80fa7eef43b2c82c5f3e3a386e50b041bb6ee6b415a5a69b0c863479851.js"], "published": "2017-02-22T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:58:45.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
