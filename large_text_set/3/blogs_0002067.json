Yes, words out that David Harbour, who plays Jim Hopper, could be the newest actor to appear in the upcoming Deadpool film.\nAccording to The Wrap , Harbour is being eyed to star in the next Marvel film, and we think he’d be perfect.\nWhile the 41-year-old actor is currently all about Stranger Things and filming Season 2 — it premieres on Halloween — his name is definitely in the mix for Deadpool 2 .\nAn individual told The Wrap that Harbour is being eyed to play Cable in the 20th Century Fox film, but nothing has officially been announced.\nHarbour currently plays Chief Jim Hopper on the Netflix series , which has a huge following. Joining the Marvel world — which also has a cult following — could be a great fit. \nNetflix The source revealed that Fox has already screen-tested the actor for the role of Cable aka the alter ego of Nathan Summers. Summers is the son of Scott Summers aka Cyclops from the X-Men world.\nCable made his first appearance in the Marvel comics back in 1990 and is known for his iconic look.\nHe has a bionic arm, cybernetic eye, and technology within his body that helps him hack into computers. Marvel Currently, there is no word from Harbour’s reps or Fox about this possible casting news, but we’re very excited about the potential match.\nCouldn’t you just imagine Harbour with Ryan Reynolds teaming up in Deadpool ? Both actors are very lovable, naturally funny, and great at their jobs, so we are all in on this idea.\nWhat are your thoughts on the New York native starring in the upcoming Marvel superhero flick?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:19:23.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
