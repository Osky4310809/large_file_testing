The outdoor celebration looked fairly similar to last year's event â€”acts like Saint Motel and Sir the Baptist performed on a small stage while crowds gathered to watch a gigantic star rise up the side of the Hyatt Regency Chicago at midnight. The biggest difference was that this year's festivities were actually free and open to the public, as long as you remembered to register for a ticket prior to New Year's Eve. If you were at another party or decided to welcome 2017 on your couch, we've gathered some of our favorite Instagram photos from Chi-Town Rising, including shots of the star, the attendees and plenty of fireworks.
