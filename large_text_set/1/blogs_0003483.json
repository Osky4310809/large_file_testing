And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, 'the seed is strong.' He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale. \" ― Lysa Arryn fawns over Robin. [src] \nLord Robin Arryn , commonly called \" Sweetrobin \" by his mother, is a recurring character in the first , fourth , fifth and sixth seasons. [1] He is played by guest star Lino Facioli and debuts in \" The Wolf and the Lion \". Lord Robin Arryn is the only surviving child and heir of Lord Jon Arryn by his wife, Lysa of House Tully . He is the Lord of the Eyrie , the head of House Arryn , the Warden of the East and Lord Paramount of the Vale of Arryn . His mother was killed by Petyr Baelish in \" Mockingbird \" when he unexpectedly pushed her out of the Moon Door , falling hundreds of feet to her death. Petyr is left the acting Lord Paramount of the Vale as Robin's stepfather. Contents Biography Background \nRobin was born in King's Landing where his father was serving as the Hand of the King for Robert Baratheon . Jon begins an investigation into Robert's legitimate and bastard children and then takes a fever and dies suddenly. Robin then inherits Jon's position. Lysa rushes Robin back to the Eyrie following Jon's death. [2] She writes to her sister to accuse House Lannister of poisoning Jon. [3] Lysa was fiercely protective of Robin hence he has led an extremely sheltered life. [4] Season 1 Lysa dotes over her son. \nCatelyn Stark brings the captive Tyrion Lannister to the Eyrie . Catelyn has arrested him on suspicion of involvement in the attempted assassination of her son Bran and expects Lysa's support given her earlier accusation. She is shocked to see that Lysa still breastfeeds Robin, despite him being so old. Robin is prone to fits of histrionics, demanding to see \"the bad man fly\". Lysa calls him a strong and mighty ruler, worthy of the Vale 's leadership, but Catelyn appears skeptical. [5] \nTyrion agrees to confess to his crimes and is brought before the High Seat. He presents a list of minor misdemeanors from childhood, though Robin is particularly intrigued by some of them. Tyrion demands a trial by combat to prove his innocence and calls upon his brother Jaime Lannister to be his champion, even though getting word to Jaime and his arrival would take many days. When his request is refused, the mercenary Bronn agrees to be his champion, much to Tyrion's surprise and relief. Bronn triumphs against Lysa's champion, Ser Vardis Egen , and he and Tyrion are allowed to go free. Robin is disappointed at being deprived of an execution by Moon Door. [6] \nCatelyn visits Robin and Lysa before leaving the Vale to join her son Robb 's army. She asks Lysa to commit the Vale to the war on the side of the Starks and Tullys , but Lysa refuses, saying the Vale's knights are needed at home to defend Robin. [7] Season 4 Robin throws his gift through the Moon Door. \nRobin receives his new stepfather, Petyr Baelish , and his cousin Sansa Stark at the Eyrie. Robin takes temporary delight in the gift Petyr brings him - a falcon, finely carved from crystal - before throwing it out the Moon Door to demonstrate the Door's nature to Sansa. Lysa seems to have allowed him some freedom since Littlefinger's arrival, as she allowed him out of her sight to show Sansa around. [8] \nLater, he visits Sansa in the courtyard of the Eyrie while she is building a snow castle of Winterfell . When he suggests they add a Moon Door to it, he accidentally knocks over one of the towers that Sansa has built. At first, she gently scolds him, but as he grows petulant, insisting that he didn't ruin it, Sansa is driven to slap him across the face. He then runs back into the castle. Later on, his mother is killed when she's pushed out of Robin's favorite plaything, the Moon Door , by Petyr Baelish . [9] \nLittlefinger urges two Lords of the Vale, Lord Yohn Royce and Lady Anya Waynwood , to back Lord Robin Arryn against the Lannisters, and makes an arrangement with them so that Robin finally leaves the Eyrie and conducts an official tour of the his lands. Later, Robin prepares to depart, but admits that he is afraid to abandon the safety of the Eyrie. However, Petyr urges him not to worry about his death but about his life. He tells Robin that taking charge of his own life is what being the Lord of the Vale really means. [10] Season 5 Robin training at Runestone. \nRobin begins sparring lessons, under the supervision of Lord Yohn Royce. Due to his frail condition and sheltered childhood, Robin's attempts at swordsmanship are quite pitiful for a boy of his age. Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark leave Robin behind to be fostered at Runestone under Royce's tutelage, who assures them of their Lord's safety, though he makes no promises that Robin will become a swordsman. [11] Season 6 \nRobin is practicing archery at Runestone under the tutelage of Lord Yohn Royce, although he seems to have as much success with the bow as he does with the sword. He is excited upon the arrival of Petyr Baelish, whom he refers to as Uncle Petyr, and is captivated by his present of a falcon. He offers to send Lord Yohn flying for treason when Petyr casts aspersions on Yohn's loyalty, but allows him leniency upon Petyr's recommendation. He decides that the Vale armies should go north to defend his cousin, Sansa Stark , from House Bolton . [12] Personality \nFor the bulk of his life, Robin was shamelessly spoiled by his delusional, paranoid mother, and this resulted in him possessing few of the traits expected of the heir to a powerful noble house; aside from showing precious little tact or resolve, Robin became extremely temperamental, prone to hysterical fits and violent tempers. He also appears hugely entertained by the prospect of throwing prisoners and enemies through the Moon Door, giggling and clapping excitedly when it was opened for Tyrion Lannister. In that same vein, he appeared disappointed when robbed of the opportunity to see Tyrion executed. These traits do not make Robin psychopathic or sadistic to the standards of Joffrey Baratheon, Ramsay Bolton, or the Sand Snakes; he simply felt safe knowing that he could just send any problem that came his way plummeting to its death. Lysa's unnatural doting over her son did not go unnoticed by the boy’s father Jon Arryn, who was only obstructed from doing anything about it by Lysa's extreme overprotectiveness. \nBy the time he meets Sansa Stark, Robin appears to have improved very minutely, but still maintains his capacity for tantrums, throwing an impractical temper when Sansa accused him of ruining her snow-built Winterfell (he believed it had already been ruined simply on the basis that it didn't have a Moon Door), not accounting for the fact that Winterfell was her home and the one place she yearned to be. Petyr Baelish observed that the strike she dealt him during the argument was something his mother should have administered a long time ago. \nRobin seems have a limited vocabulary – he refers to executions as ' seeing people fly ' – and appears to be intellectually stunted, incapable of long-term logical thinking because he never truly had to face difficult decisions in his life. He is often easily distracted, and in struggles to come to conclusions that were logically and ethically obvious to everyone else (such as helping Sansa during the impeding battle with Ramsay Bolton). \nBecause of Lysa's prolonged, unnatural doting, Robin is also weak, sickly, and overall physically unsatisfactory for a boy his age. While training under Lord Royce at Runestone, Robin was shown to be hopeless with a sword, and even after prolonged training he can't even strike the widest ring on an archery target, struggling to hold a bow stably in his hands. By contrast, even Joffrey could handle a sword better than Robin could (which is saying a great deal).
