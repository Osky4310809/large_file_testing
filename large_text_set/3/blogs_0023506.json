Despite the significant leap in screen sizes, especially for the base model, handling them shouldn’t be as horrific as it would generally be with such large displays, thanks to the minimal bezel on the Galaxy S8. \nBut no matter how ergonomic you make a smartphone, big screens will present problems. There is just no way you can reach the top of a 5.8-inch display in one-handed usage unless you have really big hands, and it will be even more challenging on the Galaxy S8+. It’s unclear why Samsung has decided to make the displays on both variants of its upcoming flagships so huge. The company even risks affecting sales of the Galaxy S8+ given the regular model will also have a screen that’s equivalent in size to devices in the Galaxy Note lineup and be available for a lower price . \nIn fact, it might just be the battery life that makes the S8+ more attractive, especially since rumors say the 5.8-inch S8 could have just a teeny 3,000 mAh battery. But things will only be clear once the Galaxy S8 makes its official appearance later this month . While we will have a similar poll up once the phone is unveiled, we thought we would ask you the question a little early: What Galaxy S8 variant are you planning on picking up? \nLet us know through the poll below, and get a conversation going in the comments section! Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+: What device are you thinking of getting? The 5.8-inch model S8+.
