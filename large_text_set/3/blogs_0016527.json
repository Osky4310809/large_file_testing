It further uses a pyramid to depict its claim that nine-out-of-ten individuals in the top 1 percent of earners in America are Jewish. \n“Today, anti-Semitic posters were found on campus that defame, insult and negatively portray Jewish members of our campus community,” said UIC in a statement to students, faculty, and staff regarding the latter poster. “Such actions do not reflect the values we hold as a community. Acts that invoke hatred or violence toward members of our community will not be tolerated on our campus.” \nTwo more posters lamented that Holocaust denial is punishable by prison in various countries and displayed the disproportionate percentage of Jewish students at prestigious universities. \n“You are allowed to believe we never went to the moon, the queen is a shape shifting reptilian, and ‘the Globalists’ put chemicals in the water to make the frogs gay … but when you question the 6 million they put you in jail in 17 countries,” claimed the former poster. \n“If Jewish Americans make up 2% of the population,” began the poster, “Why do they get a special Privilege when it comes to top universities?” it concluded. \nThis second poster featured the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter, #WeAreAllMuslim and #WhitePrivilege.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:10:37.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
