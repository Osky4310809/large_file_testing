Chilly: Passengers grinned as they took the Tube wearing no trousers.

(AFP/Getty Images) \nOn Sunday hoards of people were spotted in stations across London embracing the phenomenon – although many made sure they were off the London Underground by 6pm because of the planned Tube strike. Bemused: Men in their pants sitting on a Circle Line train. (AFP/Getty Images) \nThe Central Line responded to passengers’ queries on Twitter after one woman said she spotted lots of men “randomly wearing underpants and no trousers”. Straight face: Participants were told to try and keep a straight face during the special event. (AFP/Getty Images) \nThe spokesperson for the Central Line’s twitter account said it was not a Transport for London endorsed event. @elenajtweets apparently is the 8th annual 'No Trousers Tube Ride' in London, it's not a TfL endorsed event — Central line (@centralline) January 8, 2017 \nOthers remarked on social media about the bizarre sight. \nAdam Gatto said: “I’ve just witnessed a load of people get off the Tube at Oxford Circus with no trousers on. I know the Bakerloo line is hot but still…” So there's a huge, huge group of people outside Kings Cross with no trousers on and I'm at a complete loss as to why", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T19:55:28.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
