File photo ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — Three more Abu Sayyaf bandits have been killed in a continuous assault that the Marines launched Tuesday in an island village off Sulu. Capt. Jo-Ann Pentinglay, spokesperson of Western Mindanao Command, eight Abu Sayyaf members have been killed since. Pentinglay said the three who were most recently killed died in a pursuit operation launched by the Marines after attacking the Abu Sayyaf group under Alhabsy Misaya in Capual Island off Omar town. “The pursuit resulted in an armed confrontation and increased the number of enemy casualties to eight killed,” Pentinglay said. She said the latest casualties—Karra Kinod, Asbiali Ijiram, Bari Rabah and Hassan Angkong—all had standing warrants of arrest. The Marines recovered ammunition for M14 and M16 rifles, two rifle grenades from the dead Abu Sayyaf. She said the Marine pursuit operation is ongoing while the Navy has been maintaining its blockade of the coastal area to keep the bandits from escaping to mainland Sulu. Maj. Gen. Carlito Galvez, Westmincom chief, said the operations were being intensified to contain the Abu Sayyaf group. “The intensified military operations are also aimed to facilitate the possible rescue of the hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf group in the hinterlands of Sulu,” Galvez said. The military said around 27 hostages—Filipinos and foreigners—are in the hands of several factions of the Abu Sayyaf group in Sulu.
