He said he wanted to set a good example for his children, and thanked their mother, actress Jennifer Garner. \n“I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I’ve dealt with in the past and will continue to confront,” Affleck said . “I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be. I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step.” Also Read: Matt Reeves to Direct and Produce 'The Batman' for Warner Bros \nHe added: “I’m lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I’ve done the work I set out to do. This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery.” \nAffleck previously went to rehab for alcohol in 2001, when he was 28. Last June, a rambling appearance on Bill Simmons’ HBO series “Any Given Wednesday” led many online to speculate — and worry — that he might be drinking again . \nAffleck won the Oscar for Best Picture for “Argo” in 2013 and for co-writing 1997’s “Good Will Hunting.” Also Read: Brie Larson Says Her Non-Reaction to Casey Affleck Oscar Win 'Spoke for Itself' \nHe most recently starred in and directed “Live By Night,” and starred in last summer’s blockbuster “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.” \nAffleck’s brother, Casey, won a Best Actor Oscar last month for his role in “Manchester by the Sea.” In an interview with NPR’s “Fresh Air” leading up to the win, he recounted how his and Ben Affleck’s father battled alcoholism when they were growing up in Massachusetts. Every Batman Movie Ranked, Worst to Best (Photos) \n\"The LEGO Batman Movie\" is here, and everyone loves it. But where does it stand in the annals of theatrically released Batman movies? We have the answer. \n14. \"Batman and Robin\" (1949) is just an abysmal experience, with a bad lead actor wearing a floppy-eared Batsuit. Though The Wizard, a villain original to this serial, is admittedly cool looking, it's not enough to stem the boredom in this four-hour slog. \n13. \"Batman\" (1943) gets points for novelty thanks to its hilariously over-the-top old fashioned World War II racism. But Batman's first onscreen appearance lacks pretty much everything that would mark it as an engaging filmgoing experience today. It's cool that a grandfather clock provides the entrance to the Batcave, though. \n12. \"Batman and Robin\" (1997) is rightly hated, but it's tremendously entertaining here and there. Uma Thurman and Arnold Schwarzeneggar are going so far over the top I can't help but admire them. \n11. \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012) probably wasn't intended to be a grim and gritty Shumacher Batmovie, but that is indeed what it is. This is Nolan going full Hollywood, smashing plot points into place by sheer force of will rather than because they make sense. An extremely theatrical Tom Hardy as Bane is amusing front to back, and a nuke with a countdown clock on it will never get old. \n10. \"Batman v Superman: The Dawn of Justice\" (2016) is nearly saved by Ben Affleck going all-out as Bruce Wayne, but director Zack Snyder just couldn't keep his plot on track. There's too much ground to cover, and the movie is too unfocused to ever really cover any of it. \n9. \"Batman\" (1989) is fondly remembered mostly because it was the first Batmovie in a couple decades. It isn't actually very good, though. The reveal that a younger version of the Joker killed Bruce Wayne's parents is as hamfistedly dumb as it gets in a \"Batman\" movie. \n8. \"Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition\" does so much to improve the experience of watching it that it warrants its own entry -- it's basically a completely different move with all the important story beats and character moments it adds. \n7. \"Batman Forever\" (1995) hits just the right tone for what Joel Shumacher was trying to do with the two films he directed. Tommy Lee Jones , as Two Face, is doing stuff in this movie that is hard to believe even today, given his perpetual sour face in nearly every other movie he's been in. \n6. \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" (1993) Remember that time they released a \"Batman\" cartoon theatrically? It gets lost amongst all the live-action ones, but \"Mask of the Phantasm\" is better than most of them. \n5. \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) should be way shorter, but Heath Ledger 's Joker is far and away the best villain in any of these movies. Ledger elevates what would otherwise be just another self-indulgent Christopher Nolan exercise into an endlessly watchable picture. \n4. \"The LEGO Batman Movie\" (2017) is funny, sweet and self-deprecating -- exactly what we needed in the wake of the disaster that was \"Batman v Superman.\" \n3. \"Batman Begins\" (2005) is the most complete film, on its own, in the entire franchise. It's just, like, a regular movie except it's about Batman. It has actual characters and everything, and Christian Bale 's Bruce Wayne even has emotions. It's weird. \n2. \"Batman Returns\" (1992) is one of the best of the franchise because it's really just a political thriller. The Penguin emerges from the sewer and runs for mayor of Gotham! It's great stuff, especially now that Donald Trump is president. \n1. \"Batman: The Movie\" (1966) has a timelessness that none of the other films do, and it's just a delight from beginning to end thanks to Adam West 's winking Batman and the coalition of villains who can't stop cackling maniacally. Watching it again recently, I found it functions almost perfectly as a parody of the super-serious Christopher Nolan Batfilms, which is incredible.
