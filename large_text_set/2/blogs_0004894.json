But there’s a way to use it on pizza that doesn’t involve a truckload of calories. Dubost suggests a homemade, thin crust, veggie pizza—easily done with pre-baked crusts at most grocery stores. (If you must order out, thin crust pizzas from chains can save you some calories, too.) \nFrom there, use low-fat mozzarella and crumble the bacon on lightly once it’s done. That way, you get the flavor without the calorie overload. Also, keep in mind how much those sodas can spike your calorie count. Sparkling water can take the boredom out of regular old bottles. \nYour New Plate: 4 slices homemade veggie pizza (540 calories) + La Croix sparkling water (zero calories) \nYour New Total: 540 calories 2/4 Shutterstock Super Bowl Gut Buster #2 \nGut-Busting Plate: 12 Buffalo Wild Wings traditional wings (864 calories) + 3 servings of bleu cheese crumbles (400 calories) + 2, 12-oz. margaritas (1,360 calories) \nThe Damage: 2,624 calories \nThe Smarter Choice : Fire up your own oven and bake or roast your wings instead—skipping the fryer can cut hundreds of calories. Choosing vodka sodas is also smarter than sugary margaritas because both the alcohol and the mixer are much lower in total calories. \nYour New Plate: Dozen baked or roasted wings (432 calories) + 4 tablespoons light bleu cheese dressing (148 calories) + two vodka sodas (192 calories) \nYour New Total: 772 calories 3/4 Shutterstock Super Bowl Gut Buster #3 \nGut-Busting Plate: 4 Sam Adams Boston lagers (720 calories) + 5 oz. yellow tortilla chips (705 calories) + 1 cup of nacho cheese dip (400 calories) + 1 cup of guacamole (400 calories) + 1/2 cup sour cream (246 calories) \nThe Damage: 2,471 calories \nThe Smarter Choice : The higher the alcohol percentage in beer, the higher the calorie total, says Dobst. So that craft beer could have double the amount as something lighter. Using salsa and sour cream to dip your chips in further slashes your total—without making you feel like you’re chewing on plain cardboard. \nYour New Plate: 4 Budweiser Select (220 calories) + 5 oz. baked tortilla chips (450 calories) + cup of salsa (108 calories) + 1/2 cup Greek yogurt (100 calories) \nYour New Total: 878 calories 4/4 Shutterstock Bottom Line \nOverindulging for one day won’t cause irreparable harm, Dubost notes. But eat too much, and you’ll likely chew yourself into a bloated food coma. And how can you enjoy the game like that? \nThe best thing you can do is simply be mindful when you’re eating, Dubost suggests. Grabbing some snacks during a break—when you can focus on how food tastes and on eating more slowly—will help you realize when you’re full. And remember to stay safe: If you’re drinking with your snacks, make sure you’re not driving home afterwards.
