The TS-4900 is a high-performance Computer on Module (CoM) based on the NXP i.MX6 CPU which implements the ARM® CortexTM A9 architecture clocked at 1 GHz. \nThe TS-4900 is ideal for embedded systems applications, especially those needing wireless connections like industrial IoT gateways. Ubuntu Core is ideal for this environment because of its rich networking and protocol support. In addition, Ubuntu Core offers a secure, reliable, and remotely upgradeable platform to easily update and maintain IoT devices making for a more secure and cost-effective deployment. \nThe TS-4900 is available in either single or quad core configurations with up to 2 GB DDR3 RAM. It is designed with connectivity in mind with WiFi 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0 onboard. Several standard interfaces are supported including Gigabit Ethernet, USB, SATA II, and PCIe Express. The TS-4900 is fanless, although a heat sink is recommended for the quad core configuration, and it is rated at an industrial temperature range (-40 oC to 85 oC). In addition, new applications can be simply developed and rolled out across the deployment via snap packages, increasing the utility and value of any IoT deployment. \nBob Miller, founder of Technologic Systems said, “With the functionality of our TS-4900 and the flexibility of Ubuntu Core, I can see these powering virtually anything from industrial IoT gateways, plant automation, network equipment, high definition digital signage, to remote monitoring stations.” \nMike Bell, EVP IoT and Devices of Canonical said, “The TS-4900 Compute Module brings Ubuntu Core to the popular i.MX6 platform, delivering a new level of life-cycle management, monetisation and security to a whole range of IoT applications. Ubuntu Core delivers groundbreaking security, management, operations, and upgradability in a compact developer-friendly platform, underpinned by the open “snap” packaging technology.” \nFor more information on Ubuntu Core please visit: www.ubuntu.com/core \nFor more information on TS-4900 powered by Ubuntu Core please visit: www.embeddedarm.com/software/ubuntu-core \nMobile World Congress 2017 location: To find out Ubuntu Core and the TS-4900 visit the Ubuntu Booth in Hall P3 – 3K31 at Mobile World Congress 2017. \n-ends- \nAbout Technologic Systems, Inc.
