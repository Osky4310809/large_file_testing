Despite the fact that the company itself stated that the robots would rely on plant matter, Wiles remains convinced that they will in fact fuel themselves by feasting on human flesh. \nOn the program Wiles warned : \nOur military is developing an army of human flesh-eating robots. If you do not conform to the requirements of this new society, they’re going to send a robot to your house to eat you for lunch. That may sound extremely radical, but that’s where they’re taking it. They will reduce the human population. You will conform! \nAt one point in the program Wiles declared: \nThe hatred of Christians will become so great in the Last Days that people will be encouraged to kill and eat them. \nWiles is no stranger to crazy Christian conspiracy theories from the lunatic fringe. Last year Wiles argued that Justice Antonin Scalia was murdered by President Barack Obama as a human sacrifice to mark the pagan festival of Lupercalia. \nAlso last year, Wiles went on his radio program to lament the Obama administration’s directive telling every public school district in the country to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity. \nWiles even went so far as to claim that Obama’s humane decision concerning transgender students would lead to civil war, making the outrageous claim that President Obama (and Satan) intend to “rape your children.” \nReferring to the Obama administration as “the command center of the Obama homosexual revolution,” Wiles predicted that most parents and school officials would “cave” and “sacrifice their children at the altar of sexual perversion,” while those good Christians who protested would be “beaten in the streets with batons” and “hosed down with firehoses.” \nNo word on when the army will be rolling out those Christian eating robots. \nListen to the discussion below – Rick Wiles warns of “flesh-eating robots” (Image via YouTube) Stay in touch with Progressive Secular Humanist on Facebook:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:25:45.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
