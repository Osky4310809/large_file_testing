The trailer for Matt Reeves's War For the Planet of the Apes is here, and things are about to get intense between the apes and humans. As Harrelson's character, Colonel, takes one last stand for humanity, the apes' leader Caesar, (Andy Serkis), does everything he can to stop him. Following 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes and 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , the upcoming film stars also Judy Greer, Steve Zahn, and Karin Konoval as the apes and Gabriel Chavarria and Chad Rook as the rest of the humans.
