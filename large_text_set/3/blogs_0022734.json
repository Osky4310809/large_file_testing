Do you sometimes feel like you hit a creative wall with your ads? \nYou're in luck - I have a great way to spy on your competitors’ Facebook Ads and ways to get different ideas for future campaigns. This tactic was shown to me by an amazing colleague of mine and I just had to share. \nFirst, navigate to your home News Feed and take a peek at the second post from the top of the feed - its most likely an ad. Click the down arrow on the upper right corner of the ad and select 'Why am I seeing this?' \nThe next screen provides an explanation as to why you're seeing the ad, as well as some targeting parameters that the advertiser used to target you. If you see an ad from your competitor, definitely find out why you are seeing it. \nNext, click the 'Manage Your Ad Preferences' link. \nThis will bring you to your Facebook Ad Preferences - this screen show you what influences the ads you see, as well as how Facebook is categorizing you as a user based on your interests. \nFrom here, you can click on a specific category and choose an interest. If I click BMW, for example, it'll show me example ads that were created by advertisers trying to reach people with interests related to BMW. It’s a pretty cool way to see how other people are going after a specific audience. \nThere you have it - a covert way to spy on your competitors’ Facebook ads. Use this tactic to get more out of your social advertising campaigns.
