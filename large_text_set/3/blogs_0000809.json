She later repeated the phrase in a tweet. \nTuesday’s statements contrasted with Ms. DeVos’s comments on Monday in a news release that read, in part: “HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality.” \nThose comments drew widespread criticism, including from leaders of historically black colleges who were in Washington this week to meet with President Trump and members of Congress. The president of Dillard University, Walter M. Kimbrough, said Ms. DeVos made the school-choice analogy in an earlier meeting with HBCU presidents. \n“I think she was honestly trying to find a way to connect her experience with HBCUs,” he said. \nTuesday’s luncheon occurred ahead of a planned executive order on HBCUs, expected for release Tuesday afternoon.
