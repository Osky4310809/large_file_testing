So let sunny lemon take a starring role in baked goods when there aren't many other fruit options available. The classic combination of tart lemon and crunchy poppy seeds come together in this quick bread that requires just two bowls and some elbow grease. Fresh lemon juice and powdered sugar are turned into a pretty glaze to drizzle over the finished quick bread for an extra layer of sweet-sour magic. (Image credit: Jenny Huang ) The Magic of Zest \nI love the outside of the lemon as much as the inside. There's so much pure lemon flavor to be found in the zest that I try to use it in any recipes that use lemon juice, whether it's a cake or salad dressings — and this quick bread is no exception. Use a Microplane to finely grate the zest before you juice the lemons, and you'll add a punch of bright citrus flavor to the finished product. \nThis bread keeps quite well for a few days since it has yogurt and butter to keep it flavorful and moist. Toast up slices if you like crispy edges, or break out some lemon curd for a double dose of lemon tastiness to go with your afternoon tea. Lemon Poppy Seed Quick Bread Makes 1 (9x5-inch) loaf, about 8 servings \nFor the bread: Cooking spray or vegetable oil, for coating the pan 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons poppy seeds", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:05:20.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
