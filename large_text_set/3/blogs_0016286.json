He worked with the smartwatch team to help create a version of the Fossil Q with a design that’s similar to the Fossil Blue watch that Richards owned while he was in his 20s.\nIn addition to all of the Android Wear features, the limited edition Fossil Q x Cory Richards smartwatch will include a number of customizable faces, including light silver, blue and black dials. They will also have orange colors on the second-hand and sub-eyes that can also be customized. The case of the watch will include a rugged topring, along with a silver-tone case and bracelet. Finally, the watch will come with another strap that’s made of leather, and it comes with Richards’ signature.\nBased on the press release, it sounds like this may be the first of a series of limited edition Fossil Q smartwatches, so it’s possible we will see more of these kind of collaborations in the near future. The Fossil Q x Cory Richards smartwatch will go on sale on Monday, March 27, but pricing has yet to be revealed.\nThis news comes only a few days after Fossil released the big Android Wear 2.0 update to its current line of Q series smartwatches .
