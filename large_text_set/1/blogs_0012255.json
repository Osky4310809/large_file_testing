This is not true. \nConsequently, Nigerian Army wishes to disassociate itself from such false information that exists only in the figment of the imagination of the medium. \nThere was no time or place Nigerian Army disclosed such information to the medium. If there is any, we challenge them to name the officer or soldier that gave them such information and when. \nFor the avoidance of doubt, Nigerian Army is not planning to attack any country. \nIt should be noted that such reckless and unprofessional reports is not expected of any reputable and responsible news medium as it is inimical to national security. \nThe publication apart from being false in its entirety, it is unethical and capable of endangering the lives of Nigerians in diaspora. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:42:01.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
