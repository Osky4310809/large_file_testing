The hospital in the Kurdish capital has two surgical suites and provides medical care for trauma patients who have suffered catastrophic injuries on the battlefield.\nBecause of “lessons learned” in Afghanistan, Canadian medical personnel were used to dealing with “multiple gunshot wounds and explosions,” said Morin, who also served in Kandahar.\n“A lot of Afghanistan is still something that is in our heads. That was the pinnacle of our careers,” said a surgeon who served three tours for Canada in Kandahar and one tour in Kabul. “This kind of work is what makes a career interesting. You can only do so many gall bladders.”\nOne of the appeals of battlefield medicine was that “keeping alive a 20 year old who wants to live is easier than treating an 89 year old who is trying to die,” the colonel said.\nOp IMPACT/Canadian Forces Canadian Armed Forces medical personnel prepare to X-ray a simulated patient during an exercise at the Role 2 medical facility in northern Iraq on Nov. 7, 2016.

The young core is dedicated and driven. We are an effective extension of Canadian values and on top of that we do damn good medicine.”\n“We get trauma patients with injuries not typically seen in Canada,” said an operating room nurse who served two tours in Afghanistan. “We saw more blast injuries in Afghanistan but the medicine and the population are very similar. We are very focused in our approach to trauma medicine.”\nOne of the differences with Afghanistan was that in Iraq the physicians also had “to be aware of chemical warfare — the possible use of mustard gas and chlorine gas, ”said the surgeon. “We are being told by forward teams that the enemy is far more cruel than in Afghanistan.”\nRelated The economic war against ISIL: Airstrikes and financial measures aim to deplete militants’ funding Matthew Fisher: Fearing the enemy within at Iraq ’s refugee camps Matthew Fisher: Battle for Mosul becomes savage war of attrition as Iraqis, allies tighten noose around ISIL But the cruelty of the jihadists — ISIL has circulated videos showing prisoners being beheaded, shot in the back of the head, drowned or burned alive — does not mean they are denied treatment if they arrive at the hospital.\nThe Canadian Armed Forces “respects and abides by the Geneva Conventions, the Hippocratic Oath and basic human decency of morals and ethics to treat another human who is in medical distress. This means that the CAF would not deny medical support to any casualty requiring treatment,” said  Maj. Paul Doucette, spokesman for Task Force-Iraq.\nAs of Jan. 4, Canada’s hospital, which opened six weeks ago, had treated 120 patients, according to statistics provided by Task Force-Iraq. Seven of those patients were Canadian soldiers. Seventeen of them were Iraqi civilians and three were listed as “other,” which is how enemy combatants who have been detained are described. The bulk of those treated have been American and other western advisers and Iraqi and Kurdish troops who are collectively described as “coalition forces.”\nOp IMPACT/Canadian Forces A Canadian Armed Forces X-ray technician prepares the machine while Norwegian Army medical personnel attend to a simulated patient during an exercise at the Role 2 medical facility in northern Iraq on Nov. 7, 2016. The photo has been digitally altered to protect operational security. The coalition had captured the ISIL fighters, Doucette said. However, exactly which coalition forces had detained the wounded prisoners and who has responsible for the chain of custody before during and after the prisoners received medical care in the Canadian hospital was not clear.\n“They are in the custody of coalition forces,” Doucette said, without elaborating.\nThe Canadian medical team, which numbers about 50 people, includes an orthopedic surgeon, a general surgeon, an anesthesiologist and two emergency medicine specialists as well as surgical nurses. A Norwegian military surgical team also uses the Canadian facility which can care for as many as 8 patients at a time.\n“We do damage control, we resuscitate and we do surgery. We keep them alive,” Morin said. After receiving emergency care patients are moved within 48 to 72 hours to other hospitals for additional surgeries or to recuperate.\nThe government has announced that the Canadian hospital in Erbil is a fixed duration mission of six to 12 months,  Lt. Col. Morin, said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T01:13:03.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
