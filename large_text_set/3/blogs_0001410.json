I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just. Therefore, I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign,\" Sessions said during a Thursday press conference> \n\"Russia is Trump's herpes,\" Trevor Noah said. \"What makes it worse is that he lied under oath while interviewing to be the guy who prosecutes people for lying under oath.\" \nTake a look at what else \"The Daily Show\" host and others had to say about Trump in the videos below. \nSee more: Late-Night Hosts Slam Media for Gushing Over Trump Acting 'Presidential' (Video) \"The Daily Show With Trevor Noah\" \nReserving judgment, the \"Daily Show\" host tried to give Sessions an honest shake before jumping to conclusions during his show on Thursday night, but it didn't last long. \n\"I'm sorry, that is not a decent excuse,\" Noah said, referring to Sessions' claim that he \"wasn't aware\" that he'd met with Russian officials during or after the Trump campaign. \"How do Trump's people keep forgetting that they've met with Russians? Let me tell you something, if you meet a Russian, you will remember that shit. The moment they say, 'Hello,' it's an immediate fight-or-flight response.

Totally different.'\" \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" \nFallon outright suggested that Sessions resign and seek other employment. \n\"'The World's Oldest Living Boy' at a traveling carnival or starring in the live Broadway version of 'The Elf on the Shelf,'\" were some of the late-night host's suggestions. \nFallon said: \"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that when Sessions denied having contact with Russia, he was being 100 percent straight.
