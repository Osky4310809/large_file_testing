The animal fell to its side, and was visibly ill and fatigued.\nAlmost immediately, NYCLASS -- an animal rights organization whose aim is to ban horse drawn carriages in NYC -- demanded an investigation.\nRelated: Former Disney Horse Slowly DYING! \nAccording to spokesperson John Collins : \n\" Horses don't just collapse. Something happened, and the city should get to the bottom of it and make sure it never happens again.\"\nHowever, Chris Emanus -- Max's driver -- claims the animal tripped because of its new horseshoes.\n\"He tripped. His foot got stuck on a little crack on the pavement. He went down... That happens all the time with horses. With new shoes, sometimes they're not comfortable.\"\nUhhh... \"this happens all the time with horses\"???? Then at least TRY to get comfortable shoes! C'mon, people.\nUnfortunately, this isn't the first time a carriage horse has collapsed nor is it the first time to garner the public's attention. Celebrities like Lea Michele have spoken out against the practice in the past , noting the inhumane treatment of the animals.\nWe're relieved to report that Max was reportedly not injured after the fall, but the larger point here seems to regard their quality of life.\nSo, what do U think?\n[ Image via NYCLASS .] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:58:09.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
