The sleek estate will make its debut at next month’s Geneva Motor Show. \nAlthough the exterior dimensions have grown slightly to 4,986 mm, the Insignia Sports Tourer looks more athletic. The prominent front grille and Monza Concept -inspired headlights all add to this perception, even if the end result is very Mazda-like. The stance is emphasised by the extended wheelbase, now 2,829 mm, and a front overhang that has been reduced by 30 mm. \nThe revised proportions result in more luggage capacity, up by over 100 litres to 1,640 litres. The length of the boot has grown by 97 mm to 2,005 mm, and 40/20/40 foldable seats are available along with a kick-to-open tailgate. \nPassengers enjoy more space than before; headroom has increased by 31 mm, shoulder room by 25 mm and space for the hips by 27 mm. The optional panoramic sunroof that stretches back over the heads of rear-seat passengers add to the feeling of space and increases natural light. Despite the added size, the Insignia Sports Tourer is up to 200 kg lighter than before. \nThere will be an all-wheel drive system with torque vectoring. Two electrically controlled multi-plate clutches replace the usual rear axle differential, providing a more precise power transmission to each wheel individually. The FlexRide chassis has been further improved, adapting the dampers, steering, throttle response and shift points (on automatics) independently or based on the selectable Standard, Sport or Tour modes. \nThe new Insignia will be available with a range of turbocharged petrol and diesel engines, and a new eight-speed automatic gearbox. No specifics yet, though. \nNew kit include IntelliLux LED matrix lighting, Lane Keep Assist, Head-up Display and unique AGR-certified premium seats, front- and rear-seat heating and a heated windscreen. The brand’s IntelliLink systems and OnStar are also onboard. The Insignia is also the first Opel/Vauxhall with an active aluminium bonnet, improving pedestrian protection considerably. \nNo trophy this year, but at least Jürgen Klopp will have something to look forward to. \nGALLERY: Opel/Vauxhall Insignia Sports Tourer GALLERY: Opel/Vauxhall Insignia Grand Sport Related Cars for Sale on RM 14,800 Danny Tan loves driving as much as he loves a certain herbal meat soup, and sweet engine music as much as drum beats.
