I know the problem with Jack Wilshere was just the injuries. Jack Wilshere is on loan at Bournemouth from Arsenal for the season. \n\"He's lucky to play regularly for one season and he is going to be back to being one of the best midfield players in England by far. He's quality, he's smart and has the quality on the ball. He has a special quality with the ball, dribbling as a holding-midfielder to attack central defenders -- it's not easy to do that. \n\"He's a little bit like [Mousa] Dembele at Tottenham. They have quality to pass, pass, pass and then immediately destroy the defensive structures. I'm so happy he's back and he's playing regularly. Hopefully on Monday he can play.\" \nWilshere left Arsenal to join Bournemouth for the season on loan last summer in attempt to build up his fitness and gain regular game time. \nThere have been some suggestions that Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger made a mistake in letting him go given his side have been light on central-midfielders in recent weeks. \n\"That's a good question,\" Guardiola said when asked why Wilshere made the move. \"He would still be playing for Arsenal if he was fit [before]. But I think it was so important for him to be able to play week after week.\" \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:05:55.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
