The way to build a successful franchise was not to sign “big names” and hope that the crowds would show up. The way to build a successful franchise was to win. \nIf you haven’t checked in on this league in a while, you should know that MLS has changed. Teams are getting younger. Designated player spots are not being used on the superstars of years past and instead are going to promising international players entering their primes. Creative, attacking sides are springing up around the league. Goals are up. The quality of soccer is improving. \nAnd on Monday night it was reported that Chicago Fire had acquired Manchester United’s Bastian Schweinsteiger, the 32-year-old German midfielder who hasn’t played for Manchester United with any regularity in two years and has retired from the German national team. A player who plays the same position as the two best Fire players – Dax McCarty and Juninho – who are three and four years younger than he is, respectively. \nThe question is clear: What are the Fire doing? media_camera Bastian Schweinsteiger. \nBefore I delve too deeply into this, let me just say that I think Schweinsteiger will be fine for the team. He’s a good, at times great, player who can do a job. Still. This isn’t a catastrophe. \nThis isn’t the Fire signing a 39-year-old has-been to try and grab a few headlines. He might be good for the team, even. He’ll score some goals. He’ll have some nice moments. \nBut at the cost, and for what the team needs, the signing just doesn’t make any sense. \nSchweinsteiger could be a good player for an MLS side. He will have a very hard time being one for this MLS side. Why? He plays the same position as McCarty and Juninho. Not kind of the same position. The exact same position. He’s either been a 6 or an 8 throughout his entire career, the same as those two (very, very good) MLS players, who are both younger than he is. \nThe idea that Schweinsteiger will be able to transform himself into a 10 for the team is naive. He’s never been that player. He’s a hardworking box-to-box midfielder who can put in a good tackle and hit a good long ball. He’s not Kaká. Heck, he’s not Sacha Kljestan. media_camera Schweinsteiger (L) heading the ball. \nAnd yes, the downturn for Schweinsteiger is real. He has had just 13 assists in four years of club soccer. He scored one goal and had zero assists for Manchester United in 18 appearances for the club in Premier League play. He tacked on another goal in the FA Cup. These aren’t eye-popping numbers. \nJamming him into a midfield with McCarty and Juninho will be fine. They’ll win a lot of balls. Teams will have to play around or over the top. But going forward? I’m not sure Schweinsteiger can provide much that isn’t already being provided. \n(The Fire could of course sell McCarty or Juninho, two younger players who have proven to be stars in MLS, but they can’t possibly be that stupid.) \n(Right?) \nAnd that’s the thing: It’s about resource allocation. The best MLS sides use their resources intelligently. The Fire finally looked like they were heading in that direction, building a solid centre of the park that could hold down a midfield. All they needed to do was shore up the defence, bring in some creative attacking players, and they would be off building something. media_camera McCarty (L). \nThey brought in a centre midfielder, the exact thing they already had, and if the reported price is correct, they did so at a great cost. That’s not smart resource allocation. That’s signing a big name so you can say you did. \nSome Fire fans will say the club needed to do this to show other international players that it’s a team worth coming to, a team that can support a big name. To which I respond: I mean, I guess? But know what else would do that? Winning a ton of games. media_camera Schweinsteiger. \nIt’s also moving in the exact opposite direction of every smart team in the league right now. Look at ambitious expansion side Atlanta United FC: They targeted young, exciting South American players entering their prime as opposed to ageing European names. \nTwo months ago, I doubt many American fans had ever heard of Miguel Almiron or Josef Martinez. After the club scored 11 goals in three games and are selling out every home match, with season tickets already exceeding 30,000, MLS fans know those names now. \nFC Dallas have built the most exciting side in MLS over the last few years with a bevy of young, free-flowing attacking players who love taking people on and scoring goals. \nThe lessons have been learned, or so we thought. This is the future. The thing that gets people excited is winning. Play fun soccer, win games, the fans will turn up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:48:16.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
