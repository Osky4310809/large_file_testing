One of our favorite designers Oh Joy launched her furniture line with Target , and it’s just as colorful and otherworldly as we were hoping.\nWhen we first caught wind of the fact that Oh Joy was releasing a furniture line , we had a feeling we’d be pleasantly transported to a psychedelic universe full of well-curated furniture. After all, we’ve been longtime fans of the bright and lavish Oh Joy! home decor collection , so it only makes sense that the blogger and designer Joy Cho’s taste in furniture would be a home run.\nThe colors feel like a spring daydream. Oh Joy The full Oh Joy furniture set is now available for perusing on the Target website and includes everything from kids chairs to daybeds! Oh Joy Now all of your rooms can be full of vibrant patterns. Oh Joy Your bedroom (or living room) can become its own Jackson Pollock painting.
