Shockingly, the company that employed Emma Hulse, UNIT TV, admitted her claim is true. It has since dismissed the manager who made inappropriate comments to the 24-year-old. Yep, this still happens in 2017, people. Instagram Hulse told the London Evening Standard the man told her she “should be on a catwalk” and asked for her number, suggesting they go for a drink. She was only five minutes into her shift at UNIT TV, where she worked as a freelance runner, when she received a text asking her to speak to a manager. She said, \nThey sent me on a run. Then my agent text me that I’m no longer required. I got there and spoke to the line manager and he asked me, ‘Are you a model? Are you not doing catwalks? Why are you not at the front of house?’ I was wearing a lipstick, but from my perspective, I was not inappropriate. I was wearing a shirt and trousers. I really didn’t think I looked inappropriate. Instagram Apparently not realizing she was disappointed by being fired for no good reason, the manager then asked for her phone number. Hulse continued, I do camera operating [and] I work for many different companies and no one has sent me home because of the way I look. Especially within a creative agency, you should be free to wear what you want. Instagram UNIT TV accepted the incident happened and said the dismissed manager had only been working with the company for three months. Adam Luckwell, the owner of UNIT TV, told the Evening Standard “there were a number of things” the company was unhappy with in regards to the manager. Luckwell added, Some of the things he was doing was not in line with the company’s policy.
