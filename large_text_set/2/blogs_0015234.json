In fact they are amongst the only two teams in the ISL to have never made the cut for the semis alongside big spenders FC Pune City. \nOf the 14 matches last season, The Highlanders registered five victories, three draws and suffered six defeats. Interestingly, their form away from home was disastrous as they could only manage to win once. \nOwner John Abraham would hope that his team can get their act together in the fourth season of the ISL as he looks set to confirm the presence of Vingada at the helm of affairs.
