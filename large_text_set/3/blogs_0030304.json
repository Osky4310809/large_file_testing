He's accused of ducking sanctions by moving hundreds of millions of dollars for the Iranian government and Iranian firms via offshore entities and bank accounts.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst / Reuters \nThe order comes on the heels of multiple letters filed by the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in the case. \nProsecutor Joon Kim sent a letter Monday morning notifying the judge in Zarrab's case that Giuliani had joined the defense, and that Zarrab had also hired Mukasey. Kim said he was \"advis[ing] the Court of potential conflicts of interest,\" since Giuliani and Mukasey's firms also represent some banks Zarrab used in transactions. \nZarrab's lead attorney, Ben Brafman, told the court and NBC News in a statement that he would remain as lead counsel, and that neither Giuliani, Mukasey nor their firms would appear in court. \nKim sent a follow-up letter Monday night suggesting that Giuliani and Mukasey had joined the defense to \"explore a potential disposition of the criminal charges in the matter.\" Kim further argued for a hearing on the matter before the judge by raising his concerns that \"Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey's involvement in this case is intended to occur entirely outside of the Court's purview and knowledge.\" Play", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:10:02.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
