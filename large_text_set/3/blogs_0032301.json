Karim Benzema continues to be important in Madrid's attack (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nThe striker has been in talks over a new deal at the Santiago Bernabeu, with his current deal set to expire in 2019. \nAnd at a time when Madrid are being linked with adding another forward to their ranks - amid suggestions Alvaro Morata wants to leave for more regular action - Perez has heaped praise on Benzema. \n“He's a mix of Zidane and Ronaldo, so for me he is the world's best number nine,” he told RMC. \n“He plays very well and it is very difficult to find a striker like him. If it depends on me, he will stay in Madrid forever, but that is not something we are discussing right now. \n“But again, if it depends on me, he will stay here.” Benzema is Real's eighth all-time top scorer (Photo: REUTERS) The most powerful man in Madrid (except maybe the King) (Photo: Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno) \nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang has publicly admitted his desire to join Real Madrid - though that hasn’t quite been reciprocated - while the Spanish giants also have a long-standing interest in Sergio Aguero. \nBut with Benzema’s place seemingly secure alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, Real’s focus is increasingly on a young, versatile forward to lighten the load on the fabled BBC, capable of filling in for all three. \nJuventus’ Argentine star Paulo Dybala had emerged as the No.1 choice last month, but the stunning rise of Monaco’s Kylian Mbappe has seen him emerge as a potential option. Mbappe has made a major impression with Monaco (Photo: AFP) Mbappe then made his France debut at the weekend (Photo: REUTERS) \nThe 18-year-old made his France debut over the weekend, having enjoyed a stunning breakthrough campaign at the Stade Louis II. He’s scored 19 goals in 32 games so far and has wowed teammates with both club and country. \nMonaco have insisted that Mbappe isn’t one of the players they’re willing to part with this summer, but the Principality club’s awareness of where they are in European football’s food chain means that is subject to change, depending on any offers forthcoming. \nWhen asked about Mbappe, Perez responded: “Anything is possible, but we will not talk about players who don't belong to Real Madrid. \n\"He's a great player but we're only thinking about La Liga and the Champions League right now.” poll loading Will Real Madrid still win La Liga? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T17:03:06.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
