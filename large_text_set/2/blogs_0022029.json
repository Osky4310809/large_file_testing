Musicians, professional athletes, and a fleet of celebrities set up base at the World of Golf Hall of Fame – the golf comes a distant second to the parties. \nThe Murray Bros. Charity Golf Tournament is one of the most exclusive celebrity golf tournaments in the land. Over the past 16 years, very few spots for new teams have opened up. Attendance has been capped and the players are fun-seekers only. Straight-laced CEOs looking to hob nob with celebrities so they can gloat on Facebook don’t play this tournament. Murray Bros. Caddyshack is for the colorful personalities, a true family of misfits. \nAs William Murray Golf and theCHIVE have continued to enhance the tournament, Bill and his brothers have allowed theCHIVE to give out four foursomes a year. The benefits of this are more far-reaching than you might think. Those who score invites basically become lifetime season ticket holders to the best celebrity golf tournament in the world. You are grandfathered into the tournament and allowed to play as many years (consecutively) as you like. \nWe are opening those 4 foursomes right now in this gallery. First, call three of your best friends and make sure they are free March 23-24th. Foursomes are $5,000 and all proceeds go to charity. The Murray Bros. tournament has donated over $6 Million to educational and medical charities in its 16 year existence. Then email Chris Seeley at info@murraybrosgolf.com. The first 4 teams to email today will be inducted into the tournament. \nBut there’s another way to make this year’s tournament which only costs $10! \nWelcome to the Cinderella Story Caddyshack Experience . \nThe Murray’s have teamed up with Prizeo and are offering you and THREE of your best friends the vacation of a lifetime. \nThis makes last year’s giveaway look like an East Coast clambake. Just go here and click on the ‘Donate $10’ button on the right hand side. Every $10 increment enters you in the online lottery. The more you donate the better you chances but $10 gets you in the mix . All proceeds go to charity. The winner gets airfare, hotels, everything covered for you and your 3 best mates. \nCan you imagine calling your THREE best friends and telling them you’re all headed to join Bill Murray, his brothers, and theCHIVE for an extended weekend of debauchery? Hero status is an understatement. Your chance right here . \nLet’s start with last years winners…. 2 \nMeet Josh and David, They won last year. Bill basically taught David how to swing a golf club and putt… and drink warm tequila. Which brings me to the disclaimers on the tournament. 3 \nPranks, pranks, and more pranks : \nFor all you new teams, it’s your freshman year at the event. You will be hazed, probably badly. Wake up calls at 6am, followed by white-glove delivery of really bad, warm tequila at 6:30 am. So don’t be too flattered when you see the Murray’s and celebs know who you are ahead of time – They just wanted to know who the newbies are so you get yours proper. 4 \nBut don’t worry, the next year, you get to dish it out. I faked that Bailey and I were pregnant together last year, for example, announced it to a couple thousand people. Revenge is a dish best served sophomore year. Enter to win here ! 5 \nEven worse for everybody, Mac is going this year. Advertisement Advertisement 6 \nWe all know how unpredictable Mac can be. But you’ve never seen him achieve his planar form like he does at Caddyshack. Just don’t let him off the World of Golf complex or feed him after midnight. 7 \nWhen you arrive, you will get all next season’s William Murray Golf gear in a gift bag when you arrive. Which is pretty damn cool. 8 \nThen there’s the golf. You and your friends will play the tournament together. If you can’t play golf very well, it doesn’t matter. Having as much fun as possible is preferred to posting a respectable score. 9 \nJust enjoy the view…. 10 \nAnd of course the parties and live bands every night – everybody from Darius Rucker to Stained, even Bill Murray himself will play. Each night, everybody gets together under the warm Florida sunset to raise as much money for charity as we can and raise a glass with friends.
