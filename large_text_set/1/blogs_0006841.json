While much is happening inside, plenty of construction work is happening to buildings around the arena district. Where to start? Perhaps most exciting to hockey fans is that the ice excavation has started. They’re keeping temporary heaters going inside to keep the construction site warm during the very cold winter. Courtesy of The District Detroit Courtesy of The District Detroit Courtesy of The District Detroit Courtesy of The District Detroit Outside the arena, even more is happening. First, progress is being made a few blocks away on the Little Caesars Headquarters , which will have giant glass slices on the facade facing Woodward. This will be located at Woodward and Columbia and should be completed in 2018. Olympia Development Courtesy of the District Detroit Also to note, there’s a new parking garage near Comerica Park that should be ready by Opening Day. Foundation and structural steel are ready for two new retail and office buildings near Woodward and Henry. Foundation work continues for this mixed-use building on Henry. And the jewel skin surface for the Via is underway. This is where games, concerts, whatever’s happening in the LCA will be projected outside the arena. According to the District Detroit, “this dramatic exterior component is a complex system of radial metal panels that will also provide a unique feature to the interior.” Courtesy of the District Detroit Courtesy of the District Detroit Courtesy of the District Detroit Courtesy of the District Detroit The Little Caesars Arena will be ready for the Red Wings and Pistons 2017-18 seasons this fall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T04:00:04.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
