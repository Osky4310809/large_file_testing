According to a Bloomberg report, Daimler and BMW made around US$5k on every vehicle they sold in 2016. That works out to be quite a tidy sum, given the number of cars shifted by the two German automakers. \nStill, the profit per car earned by the duo pales in comparison to that raked in by Porsche. The Volkswagen-owned brand delivered 238,000 vehicles last year and recorded an operating profit of 3.9 billion euros (US$4.1 billion), an increase of 14% from 2015. The media company says those numbers are good enough to net Porsche a profit of US$17,250 per car, up nine percent from the previous year. \nMuch of the increase for Porsche has come from a significant increase in its production volume. The Stuttgart firm has upped its annual output by 47% over the past three years, making it currently about a tenth of the size of BMW. \nCustomisation has undoubtedly helped things along, as it pitches the cost per vehicle up. The Macan , which now accounts for 40% of the company’s total sales volume, starts with a base price of US$47,500, but plonking on the inevitable options adds up. On the average, it breaks down to around US$99k a vehicle in terms of revenue. \nIf Porsche’s numbers are gleaming, then Ferrari ‘s are positively glowing, working on that same applied formula. The report stated that the Italian automaker’s operating profit adds up to around US$90k per vehicle, though it adds that the automaker sells just around 8,000 units a year and that around 30% of Ferrari’s earnings comes from other areas such as amusement parks, accessories and engines. Still, profit is profit, no matter where you earn it from. Anthony Lim believes that nothing is better than a good smoke and a car with character, with good handling aspects being top of the prize heap.
