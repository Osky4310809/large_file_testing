He had an innate understanding of our patrimony - what we inherit from our ancestors - our ingenuity, our elegance, our intellect, our artistry, industry and kindness, and how we could put this to work for our country and our people. \n\"TK Whitaker changed life, lives and generations in Ireland. In the last decades, he more than any other person was responsible for transforming our economy and public life. \n\"He had a rare vision for our country and its future. He was a gentleman and patriot. Today, as a nation, we mourn the passing of this outstanding man. We celebrate and give thanks for his exemplary achievements on behalf of Ireland.\" DR. TK Whitaker, Ireland's 'greatest economic thinker'. \nMr Kenny concluded: \"In modern Irish history, TK Whitaker is both incomparable and irreplaceable.\" \nOfficials at the Department of Finance, where he worked in its most senior role, have also paid tribute to Mr Whitaker. \n\"During his 30 years in the Department of Finance ,13 of which he spent in its most senior role, he demonstrated his skill and positive influence in both managing the Department itself, and strategically guiding national economic policies,\" the department said in a statement. \n\"His appointment to the most senior role within the Department of Finance came during a period of economic stagnation. Together with a small team of officials, Whitaker prepared his ground-breaking report, Economic Development, in 1958...It provided a framework that would influence Irish economic policy for decades to come,\" the statement added. \n\"We remember the man and his family at this time, we also recall the great achievements he has had in public policy and thank him for his contribution to public life in Ireland.\" \nForeign Affairs minister Charlie Flanagan said on Twitter: \"Saddened at the passing of TK Whitaker after a century. As the Father of modern Ireland we acknowledge his vision with appreciation.\" \nFianna Fáil TD Seán Haughey posted a tribute on Twitter describing Mr Whittaker as \"an outstanding public servant who played a pivotal role in the creation of modern Ireland. \"May he rest in peace,\" he added. \nIn 1956, aged 39, Mr Whitaker became secretary of the Department of Finance. Against a background of economic stagnation, rampant emigration and an atmosphere of national despondency, in 1958 he devised Economic Development, a blueprint for the economic regeneration of the country. \nWhitaker’s later achievements, included his Governorship of the Central Bank, his service as head of the ESRI and the National University of Ireland, his appointment to both Seanad Éireann and the Council of State, as well as his contribution to improving relations with Northern Ireland. \nDetailed, meticulous and practical, written in a style and language aimed at the ordinary citizen as much as at politicians, he offered a radical remedy: the replacement of non-productive by productive capital expenditure, the introduction of free trade and an end to the isolation and protectionism of the previous era.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:50:05.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
