In a new video, drag queens test the Urban Decay Meltdown Makeup Removers. Skin care is brand-new territory for the cosmetics company. What better demographic to enlist to prove the efficacy of the makeup removing products than a group of the fiercest drag queens in the business. In a new YouTube video, you can see some Drag Race winners, as well as a couple popular former contestants, give the new products the ultimate road test. Before hitting the stage for a performance at Hamburger Mary's in West Hollywood, Alaska, Katya, Jiggly Caliente and Raja prepped with their skin with the Hot Springs Hydrating Gel, the Pore Refining Peel, and the Lip Love from the new Rehab Makeup Prep collection . (The latter definitely comes in handy if you're wearing drying, long-wearing, matte lipsticks all day, everyday.) We couldn't help but crack up when Jiggly, who appeared on season four of Drag Race , says the moisturizer made her feel like she was soaking in a Japanese hot spring or in a tub of miso soup.

In the video, you can catch Alaska, who won the most recent season of All Stars , brushing the new Vice Special Effects Lip Topcoat onto her brow bones as a sparkly highlighter. We're living for that hack. After lip syncing for their lives, the drag queen stepped off stage and started to remove their makeup with the Dissolving Spray ($24), the Cleansing Oil Stick ($26), and the Lip Oil Stick. Not only were we surprised to see how easily their foundation and glittery eye shadow melted away with the new skin-care products in seconds, Alaska and Katya were too. \"[The Dissolving Spray] really does cut through everything,\" Alaska says in the video. These queens aren't exaggerating. The Dissolving Spray uses just three ingredient (a few silicones and vitamin E) to break down even the most long-wearing formulas without too much scrubbing, rubbing, or swiping. It's also the first spray-on makeup remover we've ever seen â€” although correct us if we're wrong. The Cleansing Oil Stick, on the other hand, isn't just a remover. As you rub it in, the solid balm transforms into an oil and then a foam to both remove makeup, hydrate, and nourish with turmeric root extract and sunflower seed oil. And that Cleansing Oil Stick? It's the first product we've ever seen to remove all the stubborn lip paints and lacquers and tars we're all obsessed with.
