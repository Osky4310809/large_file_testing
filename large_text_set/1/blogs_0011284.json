For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially,” Trump said to the two media outlets . \nAt the same time, sanctions aren’t affecting Russia well, [and] “something can happen that a lot of people are going to benefit,” he added. Read more \nMoving on to other topical issues, Trump slammed Angela Merkel’s migrant policy as “a catastrophic mistake,” saying that Germany shouldn’t have taken “all these illegals.” \n“Nobody even knows where they come from,” Trump added. \nTrump wasn’t optimistic about the fate of the EU, either, saying that there is basically one country that benefits from staying in the bloc. \n“You look at the European Union and it’s Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That’s why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out.” \nTrump thinks it was the refugee influx that was “the final straw that broke the camel’s back” for the EU. \n“I believe others will leave. I do think keeping it together is not going to be as easy as a lot of people think. And I think that if refugees keep pouring into different parts of Europe, it’s going to be very hard to keep it together because people are angry about it,” he said. \nAnother block that, according to Trump, has long outlived its usefulness, is NATO, as it is “obsolete,” “was designed many years ago” and some of its members aren’t paying in enough. \n“The countries aren’t paying their fair share so we’re supposed to protect countries. There’s five countries that are paying what they’re supposed to. Five. It’s not much,” Trump said. \nUS policies came under fire afterward, with Trump branding the US-Iran nuclear agreement “one of the dumbest deals” he’s ever seen, and then calling the invasion of Iraq “possibly the worst decision, ever made in the history of our country. It’s like throwing rocks into a beehive.” Read more Fake news, Trump, & hacking: Reuters report predicts digital media trends in 2017 \nHowever, there was at least one thing Trump was very enthusiastic about – and that’s Brexit. \nCiting the fall in the British pound, Trump said “business is unbelievable in a lot of parts of the UK, as you know. I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing.” \nAlso, the president-elect said he was planning to make a trade deal with the UK “very quickly.” \n“I’m a big fan of the UK, we’re going to work very hard to get it done properly.” \nLast but not least, Trump was asked about his social media presence and whether he would tune it down after the inauguration. In short, the answer is no. \n“@realDonaldTrump I think, I’ll keep it. I’ve got 46 million people right now — [on] including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, so I’d rather just let that build up.” \nAnd the tweeting is here to stay, the president-elect said. \n“I thought I’d do less of it, but I’m covered so dishonestly by the press that I can put out Twitter – and it’s not 140, it’s now 280 – and as soon as I tweet it out — this morning on television, Fox —‘Donald Trump, we have breaking news.’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T02:19:24.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
