He was going through a divorce with the children's mother but was also watching the kids while she was out of town on business.\nFriends and family say no one could have seen this coming.\n\"I've known Tate a long time because he's been a stepdad a long time and I've never seen any problem with him this is completely unexpected,\" said Goodsell.\nMany of those at the vigil were Corbin's classmates.\nCorbin's girlfriend says the entire school lost someone special, there will never be another Corbin.\n\"He always knew how to make someone laugh, he made everybody laugh, he had a big heart, everybody loved him,\" said girlfriend Hannah Fearbanks.\nTo help with the family funeral expenses, Parish set up a donation page.
