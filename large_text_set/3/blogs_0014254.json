All of this mess, every last bit of it, is because the media, left and right wantonly smeared and slandered this lifelong public servant. pic.twitter.com/0MtmOvx5l4 \n— Peter Daou (@peterdaou) March 13, 2017 \nActually of this mess is because Obama ran the Democratic party into the ground over the last eight years and Hillary was an awful, horrible, no good very bad candidate. \nSorry not sorry, Peter. @peterdaou Yes, it had nothing to do with the fact she didn't even bother campaigning in Wisconsin or release her Goldman Sachs speeches. \n— G.E. Anderson (@g_e_anderson) March 14, 2017 \nIt’s like her diehard cult can’t accept she is to blame for her loss. It’s always someone else’s fault. @peterdaou hows it feel to be delusional? \n— Kris Williams (@KrisWilliams) March 14, 2017 Good Lord Peter see a psychiatrist.
