A widely viewed Instagram page belongs to 24-year-old avid traveler and adventure seeker Johan Aguilar (@johansenaguilar), who has over 12,000 followers. \nHis travel photos grab your attention—each shot makes his adventures all the more dreamy. Talk about serious #instagramgoals. ADVERTISEMENT \nRecently, we had a chance to chat online with Johan when he was in New York. Times Square, New York City \nWhen and how did you start travel blogging? \nI started writing about my travels two years ago, after a trip to Spain and Portugal. It was also around that time when I decided to bring with me a mirrorless camera to document my travels. It’s been a joy and hobby ever since, being able to capture moments differently and come up with my own perspectives. I think this helps show my creative side. \nDo you travel because of work, or is it wholly related to blogging? \nIt depends; there are times I travel for work, and then I extend to explore more of the place. Other times I travel with family and friends just to explore a new place and experience a new culture. It’s really a hobby. I enjoy sharing travel and cost-saving tips with my readers. The famous Seljalandsfoss in southern Iceland \nWhat’s your most memorable trip so far? \nThe trip I took to Iceland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. It was my first time to drive around in those foreign countries, and the scenery was jaw-dropping, heaven for avid photographers, a close encounter with Mother Nature, really something else. In Norway I saw the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis. I actually prefer nature landscapes as opposed to city scenes. \nWhat’s your absolute favorite country to visit? \nIceland! I have a photoset on my Instagram @johansenaguilar. Simply amazing! The majestic Oxararfoss at Thingvellir National Park, Iceland \nWhat are your travel necessities? Who is your favorite travel buddy? \nMy travel necessities are fashionable clothes and my camera, GoPro and backpack. My favorite travel buddy is, of course, my camera J. \nIf you were to plan a road trip in the Philippines, where would you go? \nProbably up north—Ilocos, Baguio, La Union and Batanes! Empty road in Iceland \nIf travel broadens one’s perspective, what have you learned so far? Travel has made me more independent, and I realized that life shouldn’t be taken for granted. Take advantage of the opportunities today because you’ll never know what the future holds. Seeing new places has enabled me to treasure what I have and challenge myself every day. \nWhat is your dream destination? \nTo explore Croatia and go on a road trip to the remote parts of Norway.
