I know I can bowl anywhere: up front, in the middle overs and at death. I can also share the experience I have with the other young fast bowlers,\" he added. \nNehra, who has been an integral feature of the Twenty20 set-up for the men-in-blue, wants to test his fitness in the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy, the domestic 50-over tournament, where the 37-year-old intends to play at least half of Delhi's six fixtures. \n\"I aim to play at least three matches to build up my match-fitness. Fifty overs is a different challenge and Vijay Hazare is a good platform to test myself,\" he said. \n\"I bowl about eight overs even in the nets while preparing for a T20 match. It is not about fitness. It is about the feel of playing in a 50-over match.\" \n\"Once I play these matches I will be fit enough to play and good to go for the Champions Trophy,\" he added. \n(WIth inputs from IANS)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:06:14.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
