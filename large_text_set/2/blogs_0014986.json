Come on, Reggie.\nNo, Reggie Miller. That is not his name:\nHe is Nikola Jokic , the Denver Nuggets center that’s rapidly becoming one of the league’s most delightful young big men. He’s one of the many giants changing the game. \nHe is not Novak Djokovic, the tennis star. Although maybe Novak Djokovic could hit a forehand into the Skills Challenge net.\nThis isn’t the first time TNT has messed up a Nuggets player this weekend. This was supposed to be a picture of Jamal Murray , the Rising Stars Challenge MVP. It’s not.\nHey @NBAonTNT -- that's @thats_G_ aka Gary Harris. pic.twitter.com/Oq6w4vvOBm \n— Nate Timmons (@NateTimmonsCSG) February 18, 2017 No pun intended, Reggie Miller.
