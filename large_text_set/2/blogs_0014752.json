SpaceX resumed testing with a successful launch and landing from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Jan. 14. \nThe Dragon cargo capsule is expected to reach the ISS on Wednesday. \nCheck out Musk’s Instagram video of the rocket landing below. \nA post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Feb 19, 2017 at 12:20pm PST Nina Zipkin Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.
