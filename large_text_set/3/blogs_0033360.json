The SC also extended the date to fill exam forms to 5th April. The decision comes in the hearing of two writ petitions regarding removal of age criteria introduced earlier this year. The next hearing in the case will come on July 10. “The judge recorded the submissions of all parties including MCI and petitioners and allowed the NEET aspirant to sit for the exam this year,” said advocate Vaibhav Srivastava was quoted as saying by the Indian Express. Noted lawyers Indu Malhotra and Amarendra Sharan also represented the students. \nThe bench headed by Justice Deepak Misra said that the age limit can be fixed from the next academic year.
