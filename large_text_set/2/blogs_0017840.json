But the wind was knocked out of his sails due to his controversial remarks on pedophilia . \nAfter an old interview surfaced featuring the provocateur condoning sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men, Milo lost his book deal with Simon & Schuster and even resigned as editor of conservative news outlet Breitbart . \nBut because the conservative isn't used to facing repercussions for talking out of his ass just to get a rise out of everyone, he decided to put on a little pity party press conference to set the record straight. \nOn Tuesday in New York City, the 33-year-old started off by revealing he was abused between the ages of 13-16. And apparently, that psychological blender was nothing compared to the past 48 hours, which he noted had been a \"horrible and degrading experience.\" \n(That makes sense considering his logic — Milo later said other things, like going bankrupt, are worse than getting sexually abused as a child.) \nThe internet supervillain apologized for \"saying things he did not mean\" on The Drunken Peasants podcast, noting that he should have not used the word \"boy\" when describing a 13-year-old that would benefit from a healthy sexual relationship with an older man. \nVideo: Milo Goes Off On Campus Rape Statistics! \nMaking it clear he did not advocate for illegal behavior, Milo said: \n\"I don't believe that sex with 13-year-olds is OK. I'm certainly guilty of imprecise language, which I regret. I didn't even remember that I made them… For those statements i made where I misspoke, I apologize.\" \nThough the conservative agitator didn't take much more blame either, insisting that the videos were deceptively edited, because… you know, fake news. \nMilo also referred to himself as a free speech warrior in a time where America \"is crying out for someone who will say the unsayable.\" Gee, is that why Donald Trump won the election? We're learning so much! \nAs for his resignation with Breitbart , Milo said the news outlet always stayed by his side but decided to resign effective immediately. When asked if Breitbart EIC asked for his resignation, Milo said: \n\"As for the specifics, I'll keep that confidential.\" \nOh, so for THAT he keeps his mouth shut? \nThe British buffoon also revealed his book has garnered interest from other publishers and he plans to donate 10% of royalties to child abuse charities. But just because he encountered some setbacks, don't expect him to go soft! He added: \n\"Don't think for a moment that anything that happened will stop me from being provocative.\" \nWe didn't, but we sure hope you learn to stop talking out of your ass !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:33:13.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
