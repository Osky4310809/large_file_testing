The women did not enter a plea.\nIf convicted, they could face the death penalty.\nAt least one of the women previously said she thought they were performing a prank, and that she had been paid in the past to pull pranks.\nPeople were shocked that one of the women wore a shirt that said “LOL” when surveillance footage of the attack first circulated.\nPolice also arrested a North Korean man, Ri Jong Chol, who has not been charged yet. Authorities are also seeking seven other people as they continue to investigate the death, the New York Times reported.\nOther suspects include a senior official at the North Korean embassy in Malaysia’s capitol city and a person who works for the state airline, BBC News reported.\nSouth Korean officials have accused Pyongyang of carrying out the attack and have said four of the suspects are spies for the North.\nView this image ›\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left, and exiled half brother of Kim Jong Un.

He told immigration authorities at the time he had wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.\nThe incident is believed to have caused him to be cut off from the rest of the Kim dynasty, and to have ruined any chance he had of succeeding his father, the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. After, he reportedly spent much of his life abroad and criticized dynastic succession in North Korea.\nAs the women were charged Wednesday, North Korea appeared to be working to repair diplomatic relations with Malaysia, which has had a friendly relationship with the country in the past, by sending a delegate to Kuala Lumpur.\nThe former deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Ri Dong Il, arrived in the Malaysian capital to discuss bringing the body of Kim Jong Nam back to North Korea, the New York Times reported. He also said he would demand the release of Ri Jong Chol.\n4.\nKim Jong Un Would Have To Be Mad To Use His Nuclear Weapons — But Nerve Agents Are Different\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10616615", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39124439", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/world/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-nam-death.html"], "published": "2017-03-01T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T07:29:06.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
