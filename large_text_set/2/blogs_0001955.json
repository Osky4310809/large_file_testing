Each base contains four fans that work to suck in air from your bedroom. \nThese fans have built-in copper plates that either warm or cool the air depending on the temperature set by the sleeper. There is also a base unit which plugs into the fans and collects the temperature commands – which can be programmed using a wireless remote or iOS app. The whole setup is powered by one power cord, which the company says uses about the same amount of electricity as a table lamp. \nThis warm or cool air is then propelled up to the top of the mattress to change the temperature of the bed’s surface. The fans and temperature control can work together or separately, so one side of the bed could receive cool air while the other side receives warm. product-shot-10", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:06:06.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
