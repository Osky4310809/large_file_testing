Videgaray is rumored to have a good personal relationship with Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as others close to his transition team. Ahora, supongo, Jared Kushner, embajador de EPN en Washington. \n— Jesús Silva-Herzog M (@jshm00) January 4, 2017 \n“Now I guess Peña Nieto will appoint Jared Kushner as his ambassador to Washington.” \nVidegaray reportedly established contact with Kushner through a mutual friend last year to help broker the meeting between Peña Nieto and Trump. \nBut it backfired on him when Mexican intellectuals, political pundits, and society at large blasted the president for inviting “the enemy” to their home. During the press conference following the Mexico City meet, Trump appeared mild-mannered and even complimented Mexico. But hours later during a campaign rally in Arizona the old Trump came out as he bashed Mexican immigrants and repeated his pledge to make Mexico pay for his border wall. \nPeña Nieto turned to Twitter in an effort to assure Mexicans he had held his own against Trump and told the candidate that Mexico wouldn’t pay for the wall. But the PR damage was done, and Videgaray took the fall—something Trump lamented publicly on Twitter. Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto. \n— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 8, 2016 \nNow Videgaray is back to his familiar role as Peña Nieto’s right hand man. He will replace outgoing Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu, who failed to devise a clear strategy to counter the new challenges posed by the Trump administration. \nCritics of the president are upset with Videgaray’s appointment because they think it’s another example of Peña Nieto kowtowing to Trump. But many are praising Videgaray’s return to service. \n“He’s extraordinary,” says Eduardo Bravo, a Mexican businessman who sits on the board of the American-Mexico Public Affairs Committee (AMxPAC), a registered lobby in the U.S. created to counter Trump’s rhetoric against Mexico. “We’ve worked closely with him and are very happy. He’s a man who will inspire a lot of confidence.” \nBravo tells me Videgaray is a man who has plenty of influence within Peña Nieto’s government, and his return is viewed as a pragmatic move by an administration that has to play ball with Trump, like it or not. He says that Videgaray can get the job done without being obsequious. \n“We shouldn’t allow [Trump] to twist our arm,” Bravo said. “We need to work and negotiate. I hope [Videgaray] keeps Ambassador Carlos Sada who has a lot of experience.” \nEven some opposition lawmakers appear to welcome the shift inside Mexico’s Foreign Ministry, but warn that Videgaray will have his work cut out for him. \n“He needs to come up with a clear and concise strategy that addresses the renegotiation of NAFTA, the wall, remittances and deportations,” Armando Ríos Piter, a senator from the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), told me. “He’s got a lot on his plate.” Story Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T23:10:53.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
