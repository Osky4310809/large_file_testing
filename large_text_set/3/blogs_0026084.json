Her personal life,  specifically her family and relationship with her now estranged husband Daniel “Boobie” Gibson leave people talking. So it makes sense that she would head back to television.\n\nShe initially claimed in an interview with  The Breakfast Club   that she wasn’t interested in doing  Love and Hip Hop Hollywood , even saying that she “didn’t like the energy of it all,” especially the energy from people once they heard rumblings of her joining the cast.\n“Mona reached out to me a few times and was just asking if I would be willing to do it,” she said. “I think it’s a great platform for artists if you do it right, I wouldn’t want to be in all the crazy stuff.”\nWell, the star has had a change of heart (and obviously been offered more change to do it). Cole confirmed on Twitter early this week that she will indeed star on Mona Scott Young’s hit show.\nContractually got what we wanted to move and I want to touch bases with the essence of my fans again. Wanted to do something different https://t.co/3J73AjE8U7 \n— Keyshia Cole (@KeyshiaCole) March 19, 2017 \n\nYes. https://t.co/C096DXFiMU \n— Keyshia Cole (@KeyshiaCole) March 19, 2017 \n\nI’ll add to it, don’t worry https://t.co/CIIUMebAVn \n— Keyshia Cole (@KeyshiaCole) March 19, 2017 \n\nAccording to Cole, filming begins next week and the season will premiere in June. Aside from the money and the possible platform to share new music, we’re wondering if her BFF, Remy Ma, had something to do with her choice to associate with the controversial series. Remy is the star of the New York installment and, for the most part, has managed to avoid petty drama while sharing the ins and outs of her family life. Cole isn’t new to the reality rodeo though. This will be her third time doing a reality series and will likely have more control than people think of her image on the show. At least, we hope that will be the case. Either way though, according to The Jasmine Brand , Cole will be bringing Gibson along for the ride, as well as her stylist. She’s also started hanging out with cast members Nia Riley and Moniece Slaughter, so things should be interesting…\nWhat do you think of Cole’s decision to join the cast of the Hollywood spinoff of  Love and Hip Hop ?   \n \nImage via WENN \nThe post Keyshia Cole Is Heading To “Love And Hip Hop Hollywood” And Bringing Daniel Gibson With Her appeared first on MadameNoire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:32:15.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
