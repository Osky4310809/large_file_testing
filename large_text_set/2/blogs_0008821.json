Or at least he thought he had. \nRaheem Sterling, who had scored City’s first goal, beat his defender and played a low cross to Aguero at the near post.

Even in my career I didn’t know what would happen at the end of the season.” \nHargreaves added after City’s win: “Hopefully he can stay at City and those players can form a partnership but it doesn’t look certain.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:16:46.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
