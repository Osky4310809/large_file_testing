As of Saturday the account has reached over $92,000. \nFour black suspects are facing charges of battery, kidnapping and hate crimes in connection with the attack on the 18-year-old victim. The suspects — two men and two women — are black and the victim is white. \nAuthorities say the victim was tied up for several hours. Video footage shows the assailants taunting him with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump . \nA GoFundMe spokesman confirmed the victim’s family is working with the company on the campaign. \nThe family, through a spokesman, has declined to comment on the attack. \nAs Montel Williams noted , throw the book at ’em! \nThese youths don’t want to be productive members of society. \nThey want whites to suffer because of how the media perceives Republicans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T09:29:19.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
