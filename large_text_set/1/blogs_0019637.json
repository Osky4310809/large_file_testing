The team's season ended two days ago, and we're already headed toward 2015 49ers territory . \nLet's recap that last few days in Pittsburgh… \nBen Roethlisberger kicked things off by calling out his younger teammates after the Steelers' loss in New England in the AFC title game. \nVia the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette : \n\"There were missed opportunities whether we didn't execute well enough, whether plays weren't made by me or other guys. At times it felt like maybe it was too big for some of the young guys.\" \nI can't imagine that going over too well in Pittsburgh's locker room. Maybe Mike Tomlin gets away with saying it, but you don't want your quarterback, the leader of the locker room, criticizing a specific group of players. And, don't forget, there was a time when Roethlisberger, himself, was a young player struggling in an AFC Championship Game against the Patriots . Just saying. \nRoethlisberger wasn't the only Steelers player talking after the game. Bud Dupree had some pretty shocking comments that reflect poorly on Tomlin's coaching staff and the job it did preparing the team for Sunday's game. \nVia the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette : \n\"The first drive hit us by surprise,\" Dupree said. \"They came out firing and they caught us off guard. We were checking and they were checking at the same time. Hats off to that team. They had a great preparation… \n\"We didn't really anticipate it like that. It was more in their approach to the no huddle, the checks they made right away. It was a great job by Tom Brady.\" \nDupree didn't come out and say it, but these comments suggest the Steelers were out-coached in the AFC title game. And the truth is, they were. Pittsburgh has repeatedly used the same defensive game plan against Tom Brady, and it repeatedly fails . The players didn't play well, but the coaches did not put them in a position to succeed. \nNo matter how that info got out to the press or how accurate it is, it's out there now, and Brown's relationship with the team may never be the same. Some outlets are even interpreting the possible leak as a sign that the Steelers may be willing to deal Brown . \nThis report comes a week after Brown's Facebook Live incident , which led Tomlin to say this… \nVia ProFootballTalk.com : \n\"That's often why you see great players move from team to team,\" Tomlin said in the wake of Brown's Facebook Live fiasco. \"Don't want that to happen to Antonio Brown.\" \nAnd it's not just Brown's future in Pittsburgh that is now in doubt. Not long after that report leaked, Roethlisberger went on 93.7 The Fan and hinted at retirement. \n\"I'm going to take this offseason to evaluate, to consider all options. To consider health, and family and things like that and just kind of take some time away to evaluate next season, if there's going to be a next season.\" \nNow, the chances of Big Ben actually hanging it up are miniscule. He's still playing at a high level, and it doesn't make a whole lot of financial sense for him to walk away from the game. Unless there is language to prevent forfeiture, Roethlisberger would owe the Steelers $18.6M if he walked away, — Jason_OTC (@Jason_OTC) January 24, 2017 \nStill, that Roethlsberger is even thinking about retirement now shows that the Steelers may be looking for a quarterback in the very near future. \nOn top of all that, the team's star running back, Le'Veon Bell, is an unrestricted free agent this offseason. Although it's unlikely to happen, there is a doomsday scenario in which the Steelers trade away Brown, lose Bell in free agency and Roethlisberger retires - all in one offseason. That would easily go down as the worst offseason in team (and probably league) history. \nThese kinds of things aren't supposed to happen in Pittsburgh. In Cleveland and San Francisco? Sure. But not in Pittsburgh. These are the Steelers we're talking about. The best-run organization in the league. Six Super Bowl trophies. Only three head coaches since 1969. \nStability, professionalism and excellence are expected. So you'll excuse any Steelers fans who may be losing their minds right now. They've already had a rough offseason, and we haven't even played the Super Bowl yet.
