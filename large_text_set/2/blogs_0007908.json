Parise, while facing away from the Blackhawks ’ goal, redirected the puck into Corey Crawford’s pads. He then turned around while Crawford was down and went top shelf to tie the game 2-2 in the second period. \nAwesome effort by Parise on the redirect and then the rebound pic.twitter.com/RJrVtZ1Dbf \n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) February 9, 2017 What a goal, right? Well, the Blackhawks challenged the goal for offside on the zone entry that occurred approximately 15 seconds before Parise’s goal.\nOn first glance, the entry looked harmless with the original angles seen on TV.\nHowever, the longer the review dragged on, the more apparent it became the officials were unsure. \nThen, about eight minutes into the review, the television angles showed this. \nThis was “inconclusive\" pic.twitter.com/058KFMp8ro \n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) February 9, 2017 The officials ruled “inconclusive” on the offside, which sparked ire from Chicago fans and elation from the Wild. \nHere’s video of the biggest highlights of the review, which included the officials using an iPhone to call up the war room in Toronto for reasons unspecified. \nYour browser does not support iframes. Wait a second, since when do refs use iPhones on the ice??? pic.twitter.com/5wRvKl3niF \n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) February 9, 2017 The Blackhawks have serious reason to be frustrated at the call, as Parise himself wasn’t across the blue line to touch up before Charlie Coyle went back into the zone. If anything, there’s doubt that the puck touched Coyle’s stick while Parise was still in the zone, as the angle shown doesn’t make it 100 percent certain.\nThat's not offside. Puck has to touch stick. Parise can clear zone, delayed offside. That said, I'm still waiting for the other angle. https://t.co/cJ0XrR4euE \n— Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) February 9, 2017 Yet, it may not matter. The Blackhawks took the lead again 3-2 moments after Parise’s goal with one more period to play.\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:20:44.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
