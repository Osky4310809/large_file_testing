Thx Wendi\n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) November 20, 2009 China's laws and regulations permit businesses to use foreign names or the Chinese translations of such names as trademarks, leading to many transnational disputes and controversies.\nA Chinese shoemaker, for example, used US basketball star Michael Jordan's image and Chinese name as a trademark for years. Only in December did China's highest court ruled that the shoemaker must stop using Jordan's Chinese moniker, ending a four-year dispute.\nA Chinese court last year ruled against US computer giant Apple in a case over the use of its iPhone trademark, which was awarded to a small manufacturer of leather wallets and handbags.\nTrump himself has had trademark disputes in China for years and it was only after he won the election last year that he won a favorable ruling from the Chinese authority.\nTrump applied for the rights to use his namesake trademark for construction projects in China in December 2006, but his application was rejected in favour of man named Dong Wei, who filed a similar application two weeks earlier than Trump.\nMy first jewelry boutique in China is opening next week in Beijing and looks great!\nA post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Oct 14, 2012 at 1:41pm PDT on Oct 14, 2012 at 1:41pm PDT\n@ivankatrump, 10/14/2012: \"My first jewelry boutique in China is opening next week in Beijing and looks great!\" The US computer giant was unable to stop a small leather goods manufacturer from using the iPhone trademark in China.\nThe American property tycoon appealed the decision which was overturned multiple times until September, when China's trademark regulator ruled that Dong's trademark was invalid.\nMeanwhile, Ivanka Trump's popularity has risen in China since she and her daughter visited the Chinese embassy in Washington during the lunar New Year.\nArabella singing a song she learned for #ChineseNewYear.

Most of these companies are involved in cosmetics, clothing and underwear.\nNew York-based Ivanka Trump Marks LCC filed applications to use the name Ivanka for shoes and clothing in China in 2010 and was approved in 2012. In May last year, the company filed another seven applications for jewelry, bags and other products, according to the trademark office website.\nAccording to a recent judicial interpretation by China's supreme court last month, companies are forbidden from using the names of public figures in their trademarks, which the top court says could \"cause negative influence.\"\nRead the original article on South China Morning Post .
