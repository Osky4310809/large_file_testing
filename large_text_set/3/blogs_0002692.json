We’re only fooling ourselves when we wait for those who don’t even try. \nMaybe you need to take a few steps back instead of taking a huge leap of faith. Maybe you need to stop chasing people and let them chase you instead. Let them find you. Let them choose you. Let them get your attention first instead of giving them yours right away.\nMaybe we are just living in the wrong generation because we don’t know how to cage our emotions, how to pretend like we don’t feel but we’re also killing ourselves when we live this way. Things die inside us when we’re always faced with rejection and heartbreak.\nWe live in a world that doesn’t appreciate people like us, we live in a world that doesn’t understand people like us. \nAnd maybe we shouldn’t change who we are completely, but let’s hide it, let’s keep it for a few special ones who prove they’re worth it, let’s be selective in who we choose to love and who we choose to build up.\nBecause we keep building up people who destroy us and we keep loving people who don’t love us back. And maybe we need to stop falling for those who don’t want to catch us, maybe we should wait for those who fall for us first so we can fall together and maybe we should fall only when we know it’s safe, only when we know it’s not going to break us and only when we know that we’re not going to drown. \nRania Naim is a poet and author of the new book All The Words I Should Have Said , available here . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:12:59.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
