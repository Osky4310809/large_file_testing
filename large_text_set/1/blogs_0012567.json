backed by his fellow Council member Ultear Milkovich , disagrees with the rest of the Council by showing leniency toward Fairy Tail , much to the annoyance of the other Council members present. [4] Lullaby arc Edit Siegrain reminds Erza to keep a secret between them \nSiegrain and Ultear discuss, with the Council, how Fairy Tail—the one guild the Council is annoyed with—manages to show up and save everyone from Lullaby 's terror. Despite Siegrain's arguments that the Council should appreciate Fairy Tail's actions, they continue to be frustrated by Fairy Tail's reckless behavior. [42] [43] Meanwhile, Erza and Natsu's fight is interrupted due to Erza being arrested by the Council for the destruction caused by her, Natsu and Gray's battle against Lullaby. [44] Before she is brought before the Council, she meets Siegrain outside the court, where he reminds her not to mention \" that \". [45] [46] He then joins the others Council members in prosecuting her, however, the trial is revealed to be a farce, and is instead just a formality to remind the world of the Council's power. [47] When Natsu interrupts the proceedings by \"impersonating\" as Erza, Siegrain smiles at his actions. Following this incident, Siegrain begins to take interest in Natsu's abilities. [48] Galuna Island arc Edit \nJellal (as Siegrain) is revealed to have been the one who set the events on Galuna Island in motion by sending Ultear, under the disguise of \"Zalty\", to use Lyon Vastia to revive the Demon Deliora so that he can control it. However, Deliora is found out to have been long-since dead, causing the mission to be a failure. [49] Phantom Lord arc \nJellal (as Siegrain) is present along with the other council members during Makarov's trial after the Phantom Lord war. He is seen smiling when Makarov was sleeping during the trial. [50] Tower of Heaven arc Edit \nJellal, in the Tower of Heaven , is being attended to by his intermediate with the Trinity Raven Guild, Vidaldus Taka and sends Shô, Simon, Wally and Millianna to capture Erza in order to use her as a sacrifice for Zeref's resurrection. The group accomplishes this, however, Erza manages to break free of her restraints and starts fighting with Jellal's underlings. [7] [51] Siegrain attends the meeting regarding the usage of the Etherion \nIn the meantime, Siegrain is seen with the other Council members at a Council meeting, discussing the Tower of Heaven. The Council knows that a mysterious man, Jellal, is the builder of the forbidden tower, however, they are unaware of any other significant information about him. [52] Siegrain, having called his fellow Councilors weaklings, tells them that the tower is too dangerous, and proposes that the Council use Etherion to destroy Jellal's creation. [53] [54] With the help of Ultear, Siegrain manages to get most of the Councilors on his side, resulting in his need of only one final vote to ensure the firing of Etherion. [55] Jellal's board for his \"game\" \nAt the tower, after Natsu defeats Wally and Millianna, Jellal goes to his chessboard (adorned with pieces that represent all the people in his \"game\") and knocks the two underlings' pieces over, symbolizing their defeat. [56] He is aware that Simon and Shô have betrayed him, however, Jellal is untroubled, and instead orders the impatient Vidaldus and the rest of Trinity Raven to make their move in his \"game\". [57] \nJellal then uses Magic to communicate with everyone in the tower, telling them it’s time to begin the \"Heaven's Game\", stating that the objective of said \"game\" is to prevent him from using Erza as a sacrifice for Zeref's revival by defeating the Trinity Raven. He then informs everyone that Etherion will soon strike, and destroy, the tower, giving them an unspecified time limit to reach the top of the tower. [58] \nBack at the Council's meeting, as a final push to get the last vote he needs, Siegrain tells the Council that Jellal is trying to use the tower to bring back the Dark Mage Zeref, stunning the Council, [59] and causing Siegrain's proposition to win, with Yajima remaining the only one against firing Etherion. [60] When asked if he is ready to accept all of the consequences that go with the firing of Etherion, Siegrain replies for Yajima to \"wait and see\". [61] Jellal being confronted and pinned down by Erza \nJellal continues to knock down pieces on his chess board as the battles in the tower come to an end, until Erza defeats Ikaruga and reaches him. As Erza prepares to fight him, Jellal states that, regardless of his own loss or victory, she will be a sacrifice for Zeref. [62] Jellal then announces that there is seven minutes left until Etherion hits, and invites Erza to take full advantage of said minutes, attacking her with his Darkness Magic upon finishing his thought. Erza manages to overpower all of Jellal's attacks and slice him with her sword, bringing him to the ground; Erza then gets on top of Jellal and points her sword at his throat. She tells her former friend that he has failed at completing the R-System, as the tower does not have the Magic Power required to perform the resurrection: at least 2.7 Billion Edeas. Jellal and Erza hugging each other \nAs Erza claims she'll just force Jellal to wait for Etherion's fall to destroy them both, Jellal claims that that isn't such a bad idea, as his body is possessed by Zeref , and he is nothing more than Zeref's tool, unable to be saved by anyone. Erza refuses his invitation to kill him, and the two hug each other, waiting for the satellite beam to help them atone for both of their \"sins\". Etherion hits the tower, completely destroying the outer structure, but leaving everyone inside it unharmed. [63] Surprised to be alive after the blast, Erza looks around and notices that the true inner structure of the tower is, in fact, a gigantic absorption Lacrima. Jellal laughs maniacally, claiming to have succeeded in his goal, and explains that Etherion provided the tower with the required 2.7 Billion Edeas necessary to bring Zeref back to life. [64] [65] \nIn Era , everyone is stunned to see the tower still standing, and an angry Yajima questions Siegrain, who, without answering, immediately disappears. He soon reappears in the Tower Of Heaven, where Erza and Jellal are. The both of them then proceed to say that Siegrain and Jellal are one and the same. [66] Jellal and Siegrain merge \nAfter the two merge back together, Jellal's Magic Power is fully restored. [67] Jellal and Erza start fighting again, this time with Erza being dominated by Jellal's restored power. Jellal's Bind Snake Spell spreads on Erza's body, restraining her and preventing her from moving. Erza is then forced into the R-System crystal to be sacrificed, however, Natsu suddenly appears and pulls her out. Erza warns Natsu to leave her, as Jellal is too strong, but he refuses and knocks her out. He then prepares to fight Jellal, who gladly accepts the challenge. [68] Jellal while fighting Natsu \nDespite being repeatedly struck by Natsu's Fire Dragon Slayer Magic Spells, Jellal remains unharmed and belittles Natsu's abilities. He then proceeds to utilize his Heavenly Body Magic , delivering blows unto Natsu with remarkable speed. However, Natsu rises, having heard Jellal comment on the leakage of Magic Power wrought from damage done to the tower. [69] Jellal launches Altairis \nNatsu's arrogance and further damage done to the tower greatly infuriates Jellal, who, in his fury, prepares to cast one of his strongest spells. Erza, awake and aware of the spell's power, defends Natsu with her body. Paying Erza no mind, Jellal launches his Altairis towards them, however, Simon appears and shields the two with his body, much like Erza had intended for herself, and dies as a result. Jellal then proceeds to berate Simon for his action, calling it foolish and useless. Such an action prompts Natsu to angrily hit Jellal; Natsu walks over and eats some of the broken pieces of Etherion-infused Lacrima. [70] Natsu eventually, much to Jellal's disbelief, manages to resonate with the Etherion, and enters Dragon Force , resulting in Jellal being on the receiving end of a brutal counterattack. [71] Jellal is finally defeated \nJellal briefly escapes him with Meteor , but continues to be outclassed by Natsu's newfound strength. He refuses to be defeated and, as they keep exchanging words, Jellal begins to cast Abyss Break , a spell that can destroy the tower. Before he can launch the spell though, he feels the aftershock of the wound dealt by Erza, and his Magic fails. This gives Natsu an opening, and, covered in a draconic aura, Natsu punches Jellal into the Tower, destroying much of it, which simultaneously leaves it unable to contain the 2.7 billion Edeas of Magic Power stored within. [72] \nUnable to contain the Magic Power, the Tower of Heaven vanishes into thin air. On the beach, after Erza is rescued by Natsu, Erza looks out at the sea and hears Jellal's voice, which says that she has become strong. [73] [74] Erza is surprised and claims it to be impossible; however, a slight smile can be seen on her face. It is revealed that Jellal, freed from the control of Zeref, is most likely the one who saved Erza and Natsu by fusing with the Etherion and guiding its Magic up in the sky. [75] He is later seen floating, unconscious, in a massive river of Lacrima , which appear to be the remains of Tower of Heaven after the explosion, and his presumed sacrifice to save Erza and Natsu's lives. [76] Oración Seis arc Edit Jellal in a coffin \nLater, Jellal, now in a comatose state due to absorbing the effects of the Etherion, ends up, through unknown means, in the hands of the Dark Guild and one-third of the Balam Alliance , the Oración Seis , whose leader, Brain , is an old acquaintance of his. Jellal is first seen again in a cross-shaped coffin, wrapped up in chains, as Brain makes Racer bring him to Wendy Marvell . Wendy mistakes Jellal for his Edolas counterpart, Mystogan , who once saved her life. [77] [78] \nBecause of this — and having witnessed Brain wound Jellal's unconscious body — Wendy submits to Brain's thought of restoring Jellal, as Brain believes Jellal can lead the Oración Seis to the Magic they're after: Nirvana . Having been given five minutes to think it over, Wendy decides to do so, and Natsu arrives just in time to see Jellal restored and fully awakened. [79] [80] As soon as he sees Jellal, Natsu goes on the offensive, but is easily, and instantaneously, blown away by one of Jellal's spells. When Brain compliments Jellal on his power, Jellal turns around and causes the ground underneath Brain to collapse, sending him plummeting to the lower levels of the Oración Seis' base, before walking away. [81] Now in the forest, having moved away from the Oración Seis' hideout, and having taken some clothes from a defeated Naked Mummy member, Jellal mutters Erza's name. [10] Jellal's reaction after knowing who he was \nHe is later stalked by Cobra , who has been given orders by Brain to follow him, as he might be heading for Nirvana. Cobra ends up at a large tree, and when Jellal touches it, it causes a large pillar of black light to appear and a large tower to sprout from the ground; this being Nirvana's true form. [82] [83] Later, Erza manages to reach Jellal's position, and it is revealed that, due to the effects of Etherion, Jellal now suffers from amnesia; the only thing he outright remembers is Erza's name, and he pleads with her to tell him who that person is. [84] [85] Erza tells Jellal that she is Erza, and proceeds to explain who he is, and what he had done to his comrades. Angered, Erza declares that if Jellal can't remember such horrific deeds, then she'll strike her sword into his heart in an effort to force him to, causing Jellal to break down in tears, disgusted by the kind of person he is. [86] [87] Jellal casts the Square of Self-Destruction on himself \nSuddenly, Cobra appears, demanding to know how Jellal came to know about Nirvana. Jellal replies that he only activated Nirvana in order to destroy it, stating that such dangerous Magic can not fall into the hands of anyone, revealing that he cast the Square of Self-Destruction on the great Magic. Ignoring Cobra's cries of shock, Jellal tells Erza that he'll take away her possible hatred towards him by ending his life, revealing to have also put said Square of Self-Destruction on himself to free Erza from the pain he has caused her and her comrades. [88] \nJust then, Brain appears, and, having been informed of the situation by Cobra, calmly tells Jellal that it was he who invented the Square of Self-Destruction and taught it to him, subsequently nullifying the Magic without the need for the cancellation code. He mocks Jellal and unleashes Nirvana in all of its power, revealing its true form of a gargantuan, eight-legged, walking city. [89] Jellal receives a scolding from Erza \nJellal and Erza manage to grab onto one of Nirvana's legs and stand on it. There, Erza persuades Jellal to nullify the Square of Self-Destruction and to live, despite Jellal saying that he failed to destroy Nirvana and that everything is over. She points at the remaining members of the Allied Forces , who are struggling to reach the top of the moving Nirvana, and claims that everything is not over, encouraging, with a smile on her face, Jellal to live on. [90] Jellal smiles in return, taking Erza's hand as the two prepare to climb up one of Nirvana's gigantic stone legs. [91] Jellal battling Midnight \nOn Nirvana, Midnight appears before the two; Jellal battles Midnight first, however, he is easily defeated, as the Square of Self-Destruction he had cast prior leaves him severely drained. Midnight then proceeds to mock him, before preparing to fight Erza. [92] [93] [94] \nImmobilized, Jellal can only watch Erza and Midnight's battle , in which Erza fails to land a single hit on the Dark Mage. [95] [96] When Erza is struck (again), and seemingly defeated, he comments on Midnight's incredible strength and hears about the Oración Seis' first initiative: to annihilate the Nirvit in Cait Shelter , thus preventing the sealing of Nirvana once more. [97] Jellal expresses disgust at their goal, but is fiercely reminded by Midnight that he himself is an evil man. Midnight then holds out his hand to Jellal, inviting him to be a member of the Oración Seis, however, Erza rises and expresses her belief in Jellal's light. [98] Resuming her fight with Midnight, Erza begins to pressure the Dark Mage, gaining the upper hand. [99] [100] Jellal in Midnight's illusion \nAs clocks strike midnight, an injured Midnight transforms into a massive dark monster before Jellal and Erza's eyes, subsequently attacking Erza with a powerful blast before stabbing both her and Jellal; Jellal cries out Erza's name, seeing her on the verge of death. However, an unharmed Erza is then seen slashing Midnight before an unharmed Jellal's astonished eyes, revealing the previous events to be a mere visual illusion created by Midnight's Magic , which were unable to affect Erza due to her artificial eye. [101] \nLater, Nirvana's blast on Cait Shelter fails due to Christina — manned by the Blue Pegasus and Lamia Scale delegates — attacking one of its legs. [102] Jellal and the others are then informed, by Hibiki Lates , that a way to destroy Nirvana exists: simultaneously destroy the Lacrima in each of Nirvana's now-six legs. [103] Hibiki uses his Archive Magic to communicate with them, inviting them to each choose one of the crystals to destroy, with Jellal being assigned the sixth crystal. [104] \nAs they prepare to destroy the Lacrima, Erza mentions that Natsu probably chose the first Lacrima intentionally, knowing that Brain's alternate personality, Zero, is most likely waiting there. Hearing Natsu's name, Jellal becomes shocked, and utters the Fire Dragon Slayer's name to himself with a cold, dispassionate look on his face. [105] Jellal gives Natsu the Flame of Rebuke \nJellal leaves the task of destroying the sixth Lacrima to Wendy, and proceeds to head to the location of the first Lacrima, where Natsu is struggling in his fight against Zero , interrupting the battle by blasting Natsu with fire . [106] Zero, with a pleased look on his face, asks Jellal whether he has regained his memories, to which Jellal nods. However, it turns out that Jellal only remembers Natsu, and that he is their only hope at stopping Zero from destroying Cait Shelter; the fire he attacked Natsu with is his way of helping, as he has remembered that Natsu receives strength upon consuming flames. An enraged Natsu runs up to Jellal and punches him in the face, claiming that he's lying. Annoyed, Zero sends Dark Capriccio flying at the both of them. [107] Jellal, however, steps in front of Natsu and takes all the damage meant for the two of them, subsequently causing him to fall to the ground. Jellal then creates golden flames on his hand and asks Natsu to accept the Flame of Rebuke : the power required to defeat Zero. [108] \nNatsu finally accepts Jellal as his ally, taking Jellal's outstretched hand and absorbing the flames, entering Dragon Force upon doing so. [109] Thanks to Jellal's boost, Natsu manages to defeat Zero, smashing him into the Lacrima, destroying it at the very same moment his friends destroy theirs, thus destroying Nirvana itself. [110] Jellal surprised when Erza said \"I'm with you\" \nAs Nirvana falls to pieces, the two are saved by Hoteye , who uses his Liquid Ground to carry them to the safety of the forest, where, it so happens, the other Mages who destroyed the Lacrima reside. [111] Jellal turns down a thanks from Erza, and is then seen sitting with her, not far from the rest of the Allied Forces. When asked by Erza what he plans to do next, Jellal admits that he's afraid of regaining his memories. Erza comforts him by saying that she's there for him, stating that, even if they were to start hating each other again, she won't abandon the \" him \" sitting there with her. [112] Jellal arrested by Magic Council's new Rune Knights \nAs she's about to say more, the whole group realizes that they have been surrounded by a rune . The glade is then stormed by the 4th Custody Enforcement Unit of the new Magic Council, led by Lahar , who claims to be there to arrest the Oración Seis members and Jellal himself. [113] Jellal is then put under arrest for federal treason, with all of the others protesting his capture. However, an upset Erza then cries out for the others to stop, taking responsibility for the commotion caused as an apology and telling Lahar that he may take Jellal away. [114] Jellal remembers Erza's last name: Scarlet \nAs he leaves, Jellal suddenly remembers Erza's last name, \"Scarlet\", and bids her farewell, being locked in the containment carriage. Later, Erza tearfully mourns Jellal's loss as she remembers that as children, it was Jellal himself who chose her last name, due to the color of her hair, stating that he chose it as it was something he would never forget. [115] Tenrou Island arc Edit Jellal being tortured by Nadal \nJellal is later seen in one of the Council's prison cells. When Erza is nearly defeated by Azuma on Tenrou Island , he whispers Erza's name to himself, seemingly aware of the transpiring battle . [116] When Serena , watching his cell, wonders whether Jellal is casting a spell, the other guard, Nadal , replies that using Magic within the prison is impossible, and starts to torture Jellal with his Magic staff. He wonders aloud if Jellal is hungry, and states that he'll only give him food if he begs, otherwise, he'll leave Jellal without food for an entire week. Jellal ignores him, and instead asks Erza not to lose, something which shocks both of the guards. Erza is somehow able to hear Jellal's plea, and this grants her enough strength to stand back on her feet and continue the fight. [117] [118] When Erza finally manages to defeat Azuma, Jellal is seen sensing this, and smiles as a result. [119] Grand Magic Games arc Edit \nOne year after the disappearance of Tenrou Island and the Team Tenrou , Jellal, while in jail, regains his memories and is saved from his impending execution by Meredy and Ultear. The three fugitive Mages form their own Independent Guild: Crime Sorcière , which is dedicated to driving away the evil in the world caused by Dark Guilds and Zeref. Over the years, the three manage to destroy multiple Dark Guilds. [120] Crime Sorcière appears \nIn the year X791, five days before the start of the Grand Magic Games , Jellal, Ultear and Meredy send an anonymous message to the members of Team Natsu via pigeon, inviting them to go to a suspension bridge in the West Woods. When the group arrives at the other end of the bridge, Ultear uses her Arc of Time to rebuild the bridge, making it possible for the group to cross it. Once the group crosses, the three members of Crime Sorcière reveal themselves, and they have a brief reunion before they ask the Fairy Tail Mages to investigate a strange Magic Power surrounding the Grand Magic Games . In return, Ultear offers to enhance their own Magic Power by using her Arc of Time to evolve their magical containers, allowing them to tap into their Second Origin . [121] Erza slaps Jellal \nWhilst Ultear works on the others, Jellal and Erza go off to talk privately, where Jellal confirms that he has regained all his memories. Jellal tells Erza that he's prepared to die if she wants to seek revenge for him killing their friend, Simon . However, Erza refuses, as she thinks he has already atoned through Crime Sorcière. Jellal replies that he thinks death is the only way to truly redeem his sins, and Erza slaps him for thinking so negatively. She then gives him words of encouragement by telling him that being alive is a sign of strength. When Jellal says that she may be right, Erza angrily pulls on his collar and the two fall backwards off the rocks Jellal was sitting on. The two roll down the embankment behind the rocks and land together at the bottom, with Jellal landing on top of her. Erza and Jellal kiss \nWhile she is under him, Erza tells Jellal that she didn't think she would ever see him again. She then begins to cry and the two kiss. However, Jellal pushes her away and tells her that they can't be together, as he has a fiancée. When Jellal, Ultear, and Meredy take their leave, Erza sees them off. [122] \nWhen he, Ultear, and Meredy sit at their camp later, Meredy asks Jellal why he lied to Erza about having a fiancée. Ultear adds that it would be better for him to be honest with himself rather than continue to punish himself. Shocked, Jellal replies that punishment is the rule of their guild, and that he can't fall in love with people who walk in the light. Ultear and Meredy then both tease him about his poor skill in lying. [123] Jellal, disguised as Mystogan, with Fairy Tail's B-Team \nMuch to Team Natsu's surprise, Jellal enters the Grand Magic Games as a representative of Fairy Tail; disguised as Mystogan [124] — with Makarov 's permission — Jellal becomes a member of Team Fairy Tail B , all in order to get closer to the grounds. [2] \nWhen the town suddenly appears in the Hidden event, Jellal states that it would take a powerful type of Magic to create such a thing. [125] \nAs the First Day's battles begin to draw to an end, Jellal is chosen by fans to battle against Lamia Scale's Jura Neekis . When they meet in the center of the Domus Flau , Jura says that he won't hold back just because \"Mystogan\" is a Fairy Tail member, to which Jellal replies that he won't hold back either, happy that he has a chance to fight on behalf of Fairy Tail. [126] Jellal hits Jura with Meteor \nThe battle begins with Jura using his Earth Magic , but Jellal is able to dodge it and fights back using Mystogan's previous techniques, to go with his guise. Eventually though, Jellal starts using his Heavenly Body Magic after he realizes he can't win without it. Eventually, Jellal disregards his undercover mission and prepares to use Sema , a spell that will expose his true identity. Ultear, who is watching from afar, sabotages the battle by, through the extortion of Meredy's Sensory Link , making Meredy eat chili peppers and tickling her, thus wearing Jellal down and giving Jura the victory. Mortified by the result of the battle, Jellal walks back to his teammates in shame, where he is scolded by all (except Mirajane ); Jellal exclaims that he doesn't know how to respond to this embarrassment. [127] After the First Day's events, Jellal stands outside the bar that Fairy Tail is celebrating in. \nDuring the Second Day's events, Jellal stays relatively silent only piping up to acknowledge Laxus' warning about angering Mirajane. [128] He remains silent for the rest of the day, wondering why he hasn't sensed the suspicious Magic he felt during previous the Games, even after the Second Day's battles have ended. [129] After the Second Day of the Grand Magic Games ends, Jellal and Erza meet under a bridge in Crocus . The two talk about the absence of the strange Magic Power that's been felt every year. Jellal decides to inspect the organizers and starts to leave, and Erza tells him not to overdo it. The two smile, and Jellal departs, glad that Erza and he can finally have a normal conversation. [130] Jellal runs to the Domus Flau \nOn the Third Day of the Grand Magic Games, Jellal is replaced, in the Team Fairy Tail B lineup, by Cana Alberona , as the Third Day's guest judge is Lahar of the Magic Council, and watches Erza, from afar, as she competes in Pandemonium . [131] Just as the final battle of Third Day is beginning, Jellal, while walking through the streets of Crocus , suddenly detects the Magic Power Crime Sorcière has felt every year. Calling for Ultear and Meredy to stay put, Jellal runs straight for the source. [132] \nShortly thereafter, Jellal returns to the stadium, coincidentally, right in the middle of Sherria Blendy and Wendy's fight , where he witnesses Sherria gain the upper hand, and begins scouring the crowd for the source of the foul Magic Power. As he passes from person to person, he accidentally bumps into Doranbolt , who seems confused at his presence. Jellal then glances downward, into the Domus Flau, and wonders if Sherria is the source of the Magic Power he is feeling, concluding that Wendy is in grave danger. [133] Jellal is intercepted by Doranbolt \nAs Jellal watches the two girls fight, he wonders if he should intervene. [134] He watches as Wendy decides to keep fighting and is shocked when Sherria uses one of her strongest spells . [135] He finally decides that he shouldn't intervene and sits down, watching the rest of the match unfold. [136] However, Jellal is worried, as he is being eyed by Doranbolt, and is afraid of the complications that a member of the Magic Council may bring to the situation. When he realizes that the Magic Power hasn't vanished, even after Sherria stopped fighting, Jellal senses that the source is heading towards the stadium's exit, and uses his Magic to chase after the person in question. Finding the source of the Magic Power, Jellal reaches out to grab the person, only for Doranbolt to block his path. Jellal argues with himself about whether he should knock Doranbolt out, but he then thinks of himself as a Fairy Tail Mage and finds it wrong to fight the Magic Council . Before he can do anything, Lahar finds them together just as Doranbolt accuses Jellal of not being Mystogan, much to his and Lahar's surprise. [137] Jellal cornered by the Rune Knights \nJellal tries to escape his cornering by claiming to be in a hurry and stepping around Doranbolt, but the Council Mage refuses to let him leave, once again asking for confirmation of Jellal's identity. As Jellal states that he is none other than Mystogan, Doranbolt lashes out and rips Jellal's cap and mask off, revealing his face to everyone. The Rune Knight members are shocked, but before anyone can react, Yajima appears, calling Jellal Mystogan and sneakily weaving a story to explain to the Rune Knights that \"Mystogan\" is not Jellal, but a member of Fairy Tail. [138] After Jellal plays along with the ruse, the Council men apologize and let him continue on his way, though Lahar whispers to Doranbolt that he knows the true Jellal is before them. As he leaves, Jellal telepathically thanks Yajima, who merely replies that Jellal shouldn't get Makarov into further trouble. Though Jellal continues to follow the path towards the mysterious person, because of Doranbolt's intervention, the person escapes. [139] Jellal appears at Ryuzetsu Land \nLater in the day, Jellal makes his way to Ryuzetsu Land arriving after the rest of the Fairy Tail members and the other competing teams. When Erza sees him, she asks what he's doing there, to which Jellal replies he was chasing the source of the Magic Power, however, Erza berates Jellal for his poor disguise: Mystogan's mask and cap, and a pair of swim trunks. [140] The two begin to talk, though in the midst of their conversation, Ichiya, who is running dangerously beside the pool, trips over and flies in their direction. In a split second attempt to stop Ichiya from hitting Erza, Jellal forces the two of them down into the water, and though Erza is saved, she becomes embarrassed to see that he grabbed her chest in the process, much to his embarrassment, prompting him to repeatedly apologize to her, though she bashfully states that it's fine. [141] When Lyon and Gray later fight and freeze the pool, Natsu uses his Magic to melt the ice, causing a large explosion. Erza and Jellal are both sent flying, and she lands atop him in the ruins of the resort. Jellal senses the evil force once more \nJellal keeps away from his team on the Fourth Day as well, hidden in the crowd. After the day's event, Naval Battle , is concluded, Jellal watches as the battle portions of the day are set to start. [142] During Natsu and Gajeel's match against the Twin Dragons of Sabertooth , Jellal is shocked to see Rogue and Sting enter Dragon Force of their own free will. [143] Upon looking back on Natsu's uses of Dragon Force, Jellal makes note that on both occasions, Natsu had some form of assistance: the first through eating Etherion , and the second from consuming the Flame of Rebuke . Thinking this over, Jellal is further surprised that both Sting and Rogue are able to enter the state of their own accord. [144] Whilst the fight pans out below, Jellal continues to walk around the arena, monitoring the crowd and participants. Suddenly, he once again picks up the presence of the Dark Magic Power coming from somewhere within the arena. As he runs to find the person, Ultear and Meredy telepathically tell him not to let the person escape again, with him curtly replying that he knows. [145] Jellal follows and confronts the mysterious Mage \nJellal locates and follows the hooded figure from the Domus Flau, wondering the entire time who they could possibly be. [146] After trailing the person through town, Jellal finally approaches them in an empty street, removing his cap and mask to reveal his face, asking the mysterious person to do the same. The figure freezes and doesn't respond, and Jellal notes that the person appears to be female. The hooded figure then turns, showing her face to Jellal, who can do nothing but splutter a firm denial as he stares at the mysterious person in absolute shock and horror. [147] After talking with the mysterious woman, the two part ways and Jellal regroups with Meredy and Ultear. As he relates to them what he knows, the two declare their disbelief. Jellal continues to state that there has been a huge misunderstanding, and that they are all locked in a destiny that they cannot avoid. [148] Jellal staring out \nOn the Fifth and final Day of the Grand Magic Games, Jellal sits with Ultear and Meredy, listening to the two as they question what Future Lucy said and wonder if they should evacuate the citizens after learning what she told them. Jellal, however, interrupts them, stating that they shouldn't get ahead of themselves, as he is not sure whether he completely believes what Future Lucy told him. When asked, he states that something seems off. [149] A while later, Jellal stares out over Crocus as Kagura and Erza fight, a sad expression etched onto his face. [150] \nLater, as Ultear comments that they don't know whether what Jellal heard was true, Jellal thinks about the Dragons, the Magic and the Eclipse , and states that something doesn't feel right and that either what he was told was not true, or the Lucy he spoke to was a fake. [151] Suddenly, Jellal, Ultear, and Meredy all sense the same Dark Magic. As Ultear notes that it's coming from the town, Jellal tells them to stay calm, stating that if Future Lucy is with Natsu, then there is no need to worry. [152] Whilst the Games continue below in Crocus, Jellal sits, pondering the current predicament. [153] \nSuddenly, Jellal seems to finally piece together and realize all of his doubts about the Lucy from the future, and why he seems to be so unsure of her. When asked by Meredy and Ultear, Jellal recalls how in previous years the malicious Magic Power came straight from the Eclipse Gate, and how this year the source seemed to move, as it attached itself to anyone who used the Gate. Continuing, Jellal notes how Lucy stated she arrived in Crocus on the fourth of July, but remembers the day he almost got caught by Doranbolt chasing after a person, this having occurred on the third of July. Looking at these points from a different angle, Jellal realizes that Lucy was not in fact lying about her arrival time, rather, the person he was chasing on the third of July was another person entirely, who had also used the Eclipse Gate to travel back from the future. [154] The idea of a second future visitor now clear, Jellal rushes his guild towards Mercurius , desperate to discover the purpose the other person has for returning to the past. [155] As the guild runs through the streets of Crocus, Jellal questions what the individual could be after, and, moreover, whose side they are on. [156] Jellal saves Erza \nAs Lahar and Doranbolt discuss contacting the Magic Council about Eclipse, Jellal suddenly appears from behind them, seeking their aid. [157] After finishing his business with Doranbolt and Lahar, Jellal moves about the city helping to defend it from the Dragon's attacks. Along the way, he spots Erza being surrounded by a group of Motherglare 's minions, and, seeing Erza fall due to her previous injuries from her fight with Minerva, quickly rushes to her aid, destroying the beasts around her. Asking Erza if she needs a hand, he reaches down to help her up, though as he does, Millianna appears before the duo, spotting him and becoming wrought with rage. [158] \nApproaching the duo, Millianna is interrupted by Erza, who shakily stands and tells her that she has already forgiven Jellal for all that he has done. As Jellal stares on sadly, Millianna screams out all of his sins and vows to kill him, though Erza replies that doing that will gain her nothing. Before anyone in the group can speak, they are approached by Ultear, who, despite Jellal's protests, confesses to have been the one controlling Jellal all along, hence being the one responsible for the Tower of Heaven and Simon's death. Seeing Ultear act in such a way, Jellal asks his guild mate if something is wrong, though Ultear brushes off his question and tells them all to stop standing around wasting time. As the Time Mage walks off, Jellal looks to the sky, openly questioning what's wrong with the twisted world they live in. [159] \nSoon after, Erza is unable to walk due to her injuries from battle, so Jellal helps her up and attempts to walk away with her. [160] As they walk through Crocus, the two realize that the Eclipse Gate at Mercurius has been destroyed, subsequently returning the Dragons and those from the future to their proper time. Aware that they have both survived defending Crocus from the attack, the two smile at each other. [161] Jellal and Meredy search for Ultear \nIn the aftermath of the Dragon attack, Jellal walks with Meredy through the wrecked city, the two both searching for Ultear and marveling at the fact that though the future visitors have left they still have intact memories of the events that unfolded. As Jellal worries that the royal family's use of black Magic may cause an uproar if the Council finds out, the two are approached by Doranbolt, who asks to speak to them privately. [162] Moving away from prying ears, Doranbolt reveals that he has wiped clean the memories of the Council members, replacing them with fake ones for the night of July 7. When Jellal questions why he would go so far, Doranbolt replies that sometimes the best course of action is to turn a blind eye. Demanding the two keep quiet themselves, Doranbolt moves to leave, though not before Jellal asks what became of Cobra. Revealing that Cobra has been taken back to prison, Doranbolt continues to state that the Poison Dragon Slayer said some puzzling things about the \"gates to the netherworld\" opening. [163] Jellal comforts Meredy \nContemplating what Cobra said as he and Meredy continue their search, Jellal wonders if Tartaros , the final corner of the Balam Alliance, is on the move. Before they can speak further, both he and Meredy are suddenly approached by an old woman, who somehow knows them by name and offers them a letter from Ultear. Reading, the two realize that the letter contains Ultear's final farewell to them, the Time Mage writing that she incorrectly cast a spell during the Dragon fight and as such has barely any time to live. Wishing them all the best for their future, reminding them of Crime Sorcière's main values and hoping for them to catch Zeref, Ultear signs off. Finishing, Meredy begins to cry whilst Jellal turns to question where the old lady got the letter, only to find she has vanished. [164] Saddened by the loss of his close friend and guild mate, Jellal turns to comfort Meredy, holding her as she sobs and muttering that Ultear used Magic that steals the user's time. [165] Tartaros arc Edit Jellal blocks a punch from Cobra \nAt the request of Doranbolt, Jellal and Meredy meet up with the Oración Seis after the Council worker releases them from prison. Promising to take care of everything, Jellal begins a job set for him by Doranbolt. [166] Staring down the Oración Seis and seeing them prepare to attack, Jellal tells Meredy to stand back, convincing her that he is more than enough to handle the Mages. When Midnight asks if Jellal was sent by Doranbolt to return them to prison, Jellal reminds them that he himself is a prison-break, and therefore finds that whole idea amusing. Vowing to fight for their freedom, the Oración Seis -minus Hoteye, who states he no longer wishes to fight- approach Jellal, with Racer rushing in first to try and catch the man off guard from behind. However, Jellal manages to dodge his subsequent punches and kicks, calling Racer by his real name: Sawyer. As Racer yells for him not to call him as such, Cobra tries to punch Jellal from his other side, only for Jellal to grab his wrist and send him flying into Racer, all the while using Cobra's true name, Erik, as well. Seeing her guild mates fall, Angel moves forward to attack too, sending a flurry of sharp-toothed creatures swarming at Jellal. As the little monsters move to surround him, Jellal asks Sorano if she has picked up a new Magic, before he uses his own to completely obliterate the creatures around him. The Oración Seis on the defensive, Midnight suddenly steps forward, promising to have more fun with Jellal than he did seven years ago. [167] Jellal harshly punches Racer \nWhen the Oración Seis charges once more, Jellal takes some harsh blows trying to defend against them all at the same time, glaring up at the group as they state they are finally warmed up. [168] Struggling to take on all of the members of the Oración Seis when they work together, Jellal tells Meredy to stand back when she asks to assist, telling her the task is something he must do himself. Continuing, Jellal listens as Midnight states that they are fighting at their best because they have recently become free, the man's words prompting him to angrily surge forward and punch Racer harshly in the face, screaming that he shall set them free, as their current \"freedom\" is a lie. Rounding out to hit Cobra as the guild stand shocked into silence, Jellal continues that they will never be truly free if they remained consumed by darkness, the man and his enemies so caught up that they all fail to notice Brain - recently attacked by his own guild and assumed down - awaken as Zero. [169] \nMidnight then questions Jellal, wondering what he can possibly do to free them. Jellal replies that he will defeat all of them, telling them to disappear just as the rest of the Oración Seis watch in awe. However, at that moment, Zero gets up, claiming that Jellal is the one who is going to disappear and attacks him with Dark Capriccio . Having no time to react, Jellal is hit by the spell, falling down with a hole in his chest. Meredy rushes to his side in spite of him telling her to run, but before she can reach him, Zero hits Jellal with yet another destructive attack, crushing the ground around him. While Zero expresses his joy, Meredy watches, shocked and teary-eyed. [170] Jellal prepares to cast Sema \nHowever, as Zero laughs at his seeming victory, he suddenly smashes like a mirror, revealing a perfectly intact Jellal behind him as Midnight stands shocked that Jellal managed to see through his illusion. When Jellal looks up, the Oración Seis see that he has purposely maimed his eyes to see through Midnight's Magic: not only has he broken free of the spell, but he has also prepared to cast Grand Chariot. With his eyes still closed, Jellal finishes casting the spell, downing Angel, Cobra, Racer and Midnight. Before they can move to respond, the blunette slips into a stance, moving to cast Sema, which hits the group and completely defeats them. Relaxing after his victory, Jellal hears Midnight accepting defeat and asking to be killed, though he responds by saying he wishes to hurt them no further. When Angel asks if he will return them to prison, he shocks the group by stating that he would like them to join Crime Sorcière and help him find and kill Zeref. [171] \nNote: His appearance in following occurs only in the anime and does not constitute canon material. Click \"show\" to read the plot arc. \nIn a slippery mountainous trail, Jellal is seen being guided by Meredy while the members of the Oración Seis are following them. Later by a waterfall, Jellal recoups with Meredy while asking of her condition; Hoteye goes on to comment on their relationship, causing Jellal to chuckle. [172] Jellal decides to travel to Tartaros \nAfter being badly wounded during his battle with the members of the Oración Seis, Jellal and Meredy take refuge at a deserted village. Meredy worries about the former, who gets clarity on why his body is so damaged from Richard, being that he fought against four-fifths of the Oración Seis. After Rustyrose appears Jellal listens from afar on his diatribe from the events that occurred at Tartaros. As Rustyrose departs, Jellal makes his way to the others, pondering if the Nine Demon Gates are trying to reach Zeref and declaring that they are going to travel to Tartaros. Midnight declines his declaration, saying that cannot break the pact formed between the Balam Alliance . Regardless, Jellal journeys to the Dark Guild, promising that he will find the Mages again another day. [173] Jellal and Meredy invite Rustyrose to Crime Sorcière \nLater in a damp forest, Jellal gets asked by Meredy why he is so attached to the Dark Mages, with him stating that they have similar upbringings and all have been influenced by Zeref's evil. Suddenly, a wave of Magic heads for them, with Meredy pushing him out the way, which reveals to be the Tower of Dingir , created by Rustyrose's magic. Rustyrose then explains his reasons to revive Grimoire Heart to Meredy, with Azuma and Zancrow pinning Jellal down. Jellal tries to defend Meredy, who braces an attack from Rustyrose, but is saved by the Oración Seis, with Erik remomving his bandages. Healed, Meredy expresses her happiness that he is okay, with the former Dark Mages chiming in on their satisfaction. Jellal then tells Rustyrose that it isn't too late to change, extending an invitation to join Crime Sorcière before departing. [173] Along their journey to Magnolia , Jellal spots out that are Dragons in the skyline destroying the Faces , telling the others to hurry as he is doesn't know what is going on. [174] \nAfter Tartaros is dealt with, Jellal along with the new members of Crime Sorcière, cross paths with Erza who has begun to doubt herself. Jellal tells her she will be okay and that she should continue on her path of light and they will walk the path of darkness. He says their paths will cross again one day and by then, he hopes she will shine bright enough to erase their existence. With his last words before walking away, he tells Erza to move forward. [175] Avatar arc \nHe's mentioned by Erza. He helped her find out about Avatar . [176] Alvarez Empire arc Edit \nJellal appears in Hargeon to assist Fairy Tail and Fiore's other guilds in defending the country from the Alvarez Empire invasion. He attacks two enemies attempting to harm Erza and Kagura, and tells a worried Erza that he will not hide his face, as his guild has come to take out Zeref. [177] Jellal glares at Neinhart \nThe group of three soon makes their way to the port and boards one of the Alvarez ships, but are quickly submerged in darkness . Jellal recognizes the Magic, and after he, Erza and Kagura are hit away, the Magic disappears and he finds himself face-to-face with Simon , who he is astounded to see is alive. However, after a moment, Jellal deduces that the Simon before them isn't real, which greatly angers Kagura until above them, Neinhart reveals that they are seeing their own Historias. [178] Jellal then receives praise from Neinhart for his quick thinking, and watches as Neinhart explodes Simon. Jellal tells a tearful Kagura to calm herself as it was only an illusion, and an insulted Neinhart tries to attack, forcing Jellal to save Kagura as they are blasted into the sea. The ship's anchor falls on Jellal, knocking him unconscious. [179] Afterwards, Jellal is carried out of the water by Kagura, who preforms CPR to revive him in spite of her initial intention to let the man responsible for her brother's death die. [180] When Jellal wakes up, the two rush to Erza, only to find that she has been severely injured. Jellal, furious at Neinhart for his misdeed, glares at the Spriggan 12 and prepares to battle him. [181] \nJellal starts casting Grand Chariot [182] , but is left in doubts once Neinharts blackmails him by summoning Simon's entity. However, it is not long until Kagura destroys Neinhart's creation, allowing Jellal to freely complete casting his spell, ultimately defeating Neinhart as he falls into the sea nearby. [183] Immediately afterwards, with Fiore's victory assured, he lends Meredy a hand in disposing of the remaining enemy soldiers. [184] Crime Sorcière vs. August \nJellal, after being caught in Universe One , eventually makes his way to the Fairy Tail Guild's new location and engages in battle with August of the Spriggan 12 , alongside the other members of Crime Sorcière, bar Meredy and Sorano. August easily overpowers the group of five, with Jellal wondering where his strength is coming from; after Erik and Sawyer are swept aside, Macbeth tries to attack August with Spiral Pain , but August reveals that he too can use Reflector , and counters Spiral Pain with his own Reflector spell. With the group completely overwhelmed, Jellal furiously tries to think of ways to retaliate, [185] however, he and the others are then ultimately defeated. [186] \nAs he lies on the ground, Jellal expresses shock that his guild was defeated by a single person; Jellal is questioned by August as to why he stopped being a follower of Zeref and chose a path against him, which Jellal responds is so he can protect the light that illuminated his dark heart. August finds this notion foolish, and tells a flabbergasted Jellal that Zeref had a single son with the power of light , and then explains that his mind is unstable because he wavers between the paths of light and darkness. The Magic King walks away, explaining to Jellal that good and evil in light and darkness is naught but a fable, and that true justice lies in love, all as he continues to lay, frustrated and hellbent on getting up to protect Erza. [187] Magic and Abilities Edit \nHeavenly Body Magic (天体魔法 Tentai Mahō ): It is a powerful Magic based around astronomical objects, such as meteors, stars and black holes. Jellal generates and manipulates the energy of stars from his body and uses it against his enemy. Jellal has shown tremendous mastery over this particular form of Magic.
