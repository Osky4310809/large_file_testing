State police say affected residents can go to the New Stanton Station at 2200 North Center Ave. for emergency water. \nState police say the public water system does not appear to be affected. \nAnyone who has information regarding this incident is asked to call state police in Greensburg at (724) 832-3288 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T02:46:16.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
