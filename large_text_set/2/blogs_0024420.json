DAVID BANKS/AP Feb 25, 2017 at 8:35p ET 0Shares \nJUPITER, Fla. — Kolten Wong is still bothered by a right shoulder injury from a tumble he took while playing left field last September at Wrigley Field. \nThe St. Louis Cardinals second baseman said Saturday he’s been dealing with “tenderness” in the shoulder. He received a cortisone shot at the end of the season, and the right-handed thrower didn’t toss a baseball until January. \n“As soon as I started throwing, I could feel the pain right away,” Wong said. \nThe shoulder still hurts when he throws. He has had an MRI but said he does “not yet” need surgery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:09:26.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
