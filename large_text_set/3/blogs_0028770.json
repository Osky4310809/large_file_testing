They argued statements Van Dyke made to investigators were improperly used against him. \nDaniel Herbert told Judge Vincent Gaughan that the new motion focused on a “whole different set of irregularities that were done” before the grand jury. Herbert entered a “not guilty” plea for Van Dyke on the new battery charges. \nAttorneys for the police officer filed a second motion on Feb. 3 seeking to dismiss the murder charges.
