This was President Obama's broad-based strategy to cut carbon emissions. \nThe brief White House document now contains a further indication of the green priorities of the new administration. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), should focus on its \"essential mission of protecting our air and water\". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Twitter account of Badlands National Park has seen a number of tweets relating to climate change deleted \nWhile the administration figures out how to achieve that re-focus, staff at the EPA have been told to freeze all grant making, and to be quiet about it. This means that no external press releases will be issued and no social media posts will be permitted. It is unclear when these restrictions will be lifted. \nReports from news agencies indicate that the roll-back will not stop there, with climate information pages hosted by the EPA expected to be shut down. \n\"My guess is the web pages will be taken down, but the links and information will be available,\" the prominent climate sceptic and adviser to the Trump transition team, Myron Ebell, told Reuters. \n\"If the website goes dark, years of work we have done on climate change will disappear,\" said an anonymous EPA staff member, according to reports . \nThe Trump team has also taken immediate steps to push forward with two controversial oil pipelines. \nSo are all these moves evidence of a malevolent mindset, determined to crush all this snowflake climate change chatter? \nDefinitely, according to Alden Meyer, a veteran climate campaigner with the Union of Concerned Scientists. \n\"President Trump and his team are pursuing what I call a 'control-alt-delete' strategy: control the scientists in the federal agencies, alter science-based policies to fit their narrow ideological agenda, and delete scientific information from government websites,\" told BBC News. \n\"This is an across-the-board strategy that we are seeing at multiple federal agencies on a range of issues, though climate denialism is clearly the point of the spear.\" \nNot according to White House spokesman Sean Spicer. \n\"I don't think it's any surprise that when there's an administration turnover, that we're going to review the policy,\" he said. \nHowever the disappearance of tweets of basic climate change information from the Badlands National Park Twitter account has raised serious concerns that the Trump team is not just seeking to roll back regulation, but is also taking an ideological stand against what they might see as \"warmist\" propaganda.
