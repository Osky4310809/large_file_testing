O ver 6 billion pounds of fresh produce are left unharvested or unsold every year, and much of it is wasted for a ridiculous reason: the produce is blemished. \nIn this case, \"blemished\" does not mean bruised or otherwise unfit for eating. It's just a word for fruits and vegetables that are a little to small, big, curvy, or funny-looking. As a result, they're kept out of grocery stores and food service deliveries — and tossed in the landfill. \nA startup called Imperfect is trying to change the common perception of ugly produce by delivering it to your door. The service, which launched in the Bay Area in 2015 and just set up shop in Los Angeles, charges about half of what you'd pay for comparable produce at the grocery store. \nAs you can see from these photos of Imperfect's \"too ugly\" for stores produce, these fruits and veggies aren't even that bad looking — they're just being held up to unreasonable beauty standards. This is my personal box of Imperfect produce. As you can see, nothing looks immediately \"off\" about the items.

Imperfect Too scarred, too curvy, too plump, too small, say retailers. Imperfect The pears are a little too pointy for retail's liking. Imperfect Vibrant as they are, these carrots were deemed too crooked for grocery stores. Imperfect It's hard to find fault with these gala apples, but they lean just a little too far off-center for stores. Imperfect These nectarines have minor surface scarring (so minor you can barely see it) that prevented them from going to retail. Imperfect These poor plums were deemed too misshapen to go on grocery store shelves. Imperfect Sorry, eggplant. You're too curvy for the general public. Imperfect These heads of cauliflower were rejected because of ever-so-slight splitting between the knobs on the head.
