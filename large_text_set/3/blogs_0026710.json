The in-house tuner has released a new line of exterior upgrades for the Japanese luxury coupé, and they look surprisingly subtle and refined compared to their other offerings . \nAt the front, there are small spoilers at each corner that help clean up the flow of air, while a rubber lip spoiler under the grille adds a minimal amount of downforce. There are also additional side skirts that improve straight line stability. \nMoving to the rear, a bootlid lip spoiler provides aerodynamic balance to aid stability, while the rear side spoilers and diffuser also increase downforce. The front and rear side spoilers, side skirts and bootlid lip spoiler come in black, and on cars painted in White Nova, Black and Graphite Black are also available in body colour, painted at the dealer. \nLast but not least is a set of 21-inch lightweight forged aluminium alloy wheels measuring 21×8.5J at the front and 21×9.5J at the rear, requiring the use of 245/40RF21 front and 275/35RF21 rear run-flat tyres. The wheels also come with locking nuts. \nThe parts are compatible with both the LC 500 and LC 500h. The former is powered by a 5.0 naturally-aspirated, direct-injected Atkinson-cycle VVT-i V8 that produces 471 hp at 7,100 rpm and 540 Nm at 4,800 rpm, sent to the rear wheels via a Direct Shift 10-speed automatic transmission. \nMeanwhile, the LC 500h hybrid uses a 299 PS/356 Nm 3.5 litre direct-injected Dual VVT-i V6 coupled with a 180 PS/300 Nm electric motor, a lithium-ion battery and a four-speed automatic transmission that works with the electric motor to simulate a 10-speed auto . Total system output stands at 354 hp. Research Lexus Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T08:50:50.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
