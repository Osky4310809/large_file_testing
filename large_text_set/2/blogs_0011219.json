It offers a bunch of interesting and useful features as well as a great user interface heavily inspired by Material Design.\nOne of the key features of the app is speed. Well, at least according to the developer — EasilyDo — which claims that Email is the “fastest mail app available for Android.” Email also allows you to unsubscribe from the junk mail we all receive with just one tap and access all your attachments in one place, thanks to the built-in intelligent assistant.\nAdditionally, it can provide you with real-time travel notifications. The app will let you know if your flight is delayed or if your gate has changed, which really is a great feature to have. You can also easily track the location of packages you’re expecting, as you’re able to check the status of all your packages in one folder.\nSee also: 10 best email apps for Android October 4, 2016 Other features worth mentioning are interactive push notifications, swipe to view the next email, and the option of canceling an email that you have already sent.
