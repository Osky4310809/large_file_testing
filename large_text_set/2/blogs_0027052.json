There was an especially excited Celtics fan in front of him, which he pretended to hand the jersey to, before giving it to another fan.\nThe game was pretty chippy between the two teams. Howard had pushed former Hawk Al Horford earlier in the game after a hard foul, so he was already frustrated. Not to mention the Hawks and Celtics played a rough 5-game series last postseason.\nThough that was before Dwight’s tenure, the two teams definitely don’t like each other.\nThere was no way he was about to give up his jersey to a Celtics fan, but that was cold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:41:30.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
