News Group Newspapers Ltd 6 Arsene Wenger …’victim of his own success’ \nPressure on Wenger to quit has increased after the 5-1 defeat Champions League loss to Bayern Munich that virtually ended their interest in the competition at the first knockout round stage. \nIt looks as though the Gunners will fail to get through the round of 16 for the seventh consecutive year. \nWenger himself has revealed insisted he will be managing next season – but not necessarily at Arsenal.

Brady, 61, who directed the Arsenal’s youth set up between 1996 and 2014, says \"to sack a manager with a record like [Wenger’s] would seem unfair\" and warned the Frenchman’s detractors to remember what life was like before he arrived.

Liverpool have invested a lot of money. Man United are a money machine. \n“To keep the team consistently in the last 10 years in the top four, without having the money to spend… I know he’s spent money, but nothing compared to the likes of Chelsea, Man City and Man United have been able to afford, I think you have to take all that into consideration.” News Group Newspapers Ltd Some fans are in no doubt as to what should happen...
