It has hundreds of millions of daily users and many rely on it to get the latest news and trends. The site has its controversy from time to time. However, there’s no other social network that shows you things in chronological order so you can see the latest stuff happening now. If you’re looking for a great Twitter experience, look no further because we have the best Twitter apps for Android right here!\nHere are some other social media apps for you to look at!   10 best Reddit apps for Android December 5, 2016   10 best Facebook apps for Android June 18, 2016 Fenix Price: $3.49 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Fenix for Twitter is a newer Twitter app (comparatively speaking) with a solid set of features and a gorgeous Material Design look and feel. It comes with the basic features, such as multi-account support and real-time updates so you can see the latest every time you open the app. You can also swipe between categories, mute users and conversations, and you have access to three themes (light, dark, true black). It’s a bit expensive so you should make sure you really like it before the refund time expires, but this is one of the better Twitter apps. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Flamingo Price: $2.49 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Flamingo is a beautiful Twitter app. It features a Material Design interface that can be themed in a variety of ways. Additionally, it comes with other customizations, multi-account support, and some unique features. It also has advanced muting features if you need that. You can even schedule tweets if you want to. Aside from the fun stuff, the app is rock solid. The only downside is that the app doesn't have a demo version. You'll have to buy it, try it, and refund it if you don't like it. Still, it's one of the best Twitter apps out there. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Hootsuite Price: Free with in-app purchases DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Hootsuite is one of the original apps that tracks multiple social networks at once. With this one, you can check your Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and various other accounts all from one central hub. It’s a little confusing to get into at first but it’s a breeze to use once you learn your way around. You can post to multiple networks at once, get notifications for Facebook and Twitter when people mention you (or a specific hashtag), and there’s a lot more here. If you go pro, you can get all kinds of stuff like analytics but that’s mostly for business users. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Plume Price: Free / $4.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Plume for Twitter has been around for a long, long time and was one of the first really good Twitter apps for Android. It has been updated over the years and now sports a UI that’s based on Material Design which looks quite good. Other features include multiple account support, customization options, integration with Facebook, bit.ly support for shorter URLs, and more. It has its fair share of bugs. It's also one of the more bloated options. The pro version works exactly like the free version just without the advertising. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Talon Price: $2.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Talon for Twitter got its first big influx of popularity when it was among the first apps to fully embrace the Material Design premise. Since then, it’s settled in as being one of the best Twitter apps available right now. It has a fantastic user interface, support for two accounts, Android Wear support, night mode, and even a native YouTube player so you don’t have to leave the app. There’s no free version of this app so do be sure to test it out inside of the refund time to make sure you like it! It's definitely one of the best Twitter apps. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Here are some more app lists for your consideration!   15 best Android apps of 2017 4 days ago   10 best news apps for Android June 15, 2016 Twidere Price: Free / $3.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Twidere for Twitter is one of the relatively newer Twitter apps that tries to keep things secure, lightweight, and simple. It uses Material Design which looks pretty good and it has your usual features such as tweet expansion (larger than 140 characters) via t.co, and more. It’s free, open source, and comes with about as many security procedures in place as you can possibly have with a Twitter app. There are also several configuration and customization options to make it act how you want. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY TweetCaster Price: Free / $4.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY TweetCaster is one of the most popular Twitter apps on the list and also one of the original alternative Twitter apps to hit the Play Store. It has been updated frequently over the last several years and includes one of the longest lists of features available today. You can manage multiple accounts, post to Facebook, mute posts, add photo effects to shared content, check out your Twitter stats, apply themes, and a lot more. It really can do quite a bit but that means it also falls into the territory of being bloated so beware of that. The paid version remove advertising. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY TwitPane Price: Free / $4.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY TwitPane is one of the more lightweight and customizable Twitter apps. Its claim to fame is the ability to only show the tabs that you want to see. That way, you can remove the stuff you don't want and keep only the stuff you do. Additionally, the free version of the app (ad supported) gives you support for three accounts while the paid version does five. It doesn't look overly special, but the design is simple and solid. The free version is ad supported. The paid version removes the ads and adds a few additional feature. It's surprisingly good. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Twitter Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Of course, we will give the obligatory nod to the official Twitter application. Hilariously, the official Twitter app is one of the less bloated options on the list. It does what you need it to do and that’s about it. It'll be the first to support new Twitter features. That includes things like Twitter Moments, live footage, and the newer mute features (when they become available). It's completely free, will never run out of tokens, and it even has decent syncing settings. It's worth a second chance if you haven't used it in a while. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY UberSocial Price: Free / $4.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Ubersocial is actually produced by the same developers who brought us Plume for Twitter so if you’ve used one, you kind of know what to expect from the other. It has deeper than usual Facebook integration and you can post to Facebook using the app. It also has some of the more basic features of a third party Twitter app such as multiple account support, post muting, live view, conversation views, etc. There is also theming along with some quirky features like shake-to-refresh. It’s a fun app to try out although it is starting to lose its appeal when compared to more freshly designed, modern Twitter apps. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Thank you for reading!
