For those on Big Red’s network, there are quite a few options to choose from, including major flagships that are universally available on all carriers, as well as handsets specific to Verizon only.\nRelated: Best Verizon prepaid phones \nWe’ve rounded up the best devices you can get on Verizon’s network. When you make your purchase, keep in mind that Verizon has done away with contract pricing. It’s also worth noting that some of these phones are even cheaper from Amazon, so we’ll try to include the relevant Amazon links if we can find cheaper prices for you. Without any further ado, here are the best Android phones available on Verizon’s network!\nEditor’s note – We will be updating this list as more devices hit the market. \nGoogle Pixel and Pixel XL \nSee more Google Pixel and Pixel XL photos \nGoogle’s Pixel and Pixel XL are here, and they truly are some amazing smartphones. \nNot only are they the first phones to ship with the Google Assistant on board, they also come with plenty of exclusive software features and some of the best smartphone cameras in existence . \nUnder the hood, they sport some killer specs, too. Both devices have an AMOLED display, a Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM, plenty of on-board storage and long-lasting batteries. The overall design of these phones may not be the most unique, but they do feel like premium phones through and through. \nThere are a few things about these phones that will turn some people away, though. For starters, they only sport an IP53 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning they’re not nearly as waterproof as the Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge. There are ways around that , but none that will make the devices truly waterproof. Plus, since this is a Verizon model, you’ll have to deal with a small amount of bloatware (though you will be able to uninstall it), you won’t be able to unlock the bootloader , and Verizon will be handling all Pixel and Pixel XL software updates (though the company swears it won’t delay them ). \nOf course, you’ll be able to buy these devices through the Google Store and activate them on Verizon’s network. Doing so will allow you to take advantage of an unlockable bootloader , software updates from Google, and access to Verizon’s HD Voice and Wi-Fi Calling . \nIf you’re in the market for a new flagship Android phone and don’t mind spending over $650, you should buy the Pixel or Pixel XL… these are two of the best Android phones out there. \nSpecs Google Pixel \n5.0-inch AMOLED display with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 441ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor 4GB of RAM 32/128GB of on-board storage, no microSD expansion 12.3MP rear camera, 8MP front camera Non-removable 2,770mAh battery Android 7.1 Nougat 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.6mm, 143g Google Pixel XL \n5.5-inch AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 534ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor 4GB of RAM 32/128GB of on-board storage, no microSD expansion 12.3MP rear camera, 8MP front camera Non-removable 3,450mAh battery Android 7.1 Nougat 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.6mm, 168g Read more Google Pixel XL review: a Pixel’s perspective Best Google Pixel and Pixel XL cases Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Gaalxy S7 Edge Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on Google Pixel XL vs Nexus 6P first look Google Pixel and Pixel XL vs the competition Google Pixel and Pixel XL specs, price, release date and everything else you should know Buy the Google Pixel from Verizon Buy the Google Pixel XL from Verizon Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge \nSee more Galaxy S7 photos | See more Galaxy S7 Edge photos \nSamsung did a killer job with their 2015 flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Design-wise, many would say those two phones were close to perfect. The company forwent a plastic design and instead included glass front and back panels with an aluminum frame. They weren’t without their flaws, though. The S6 and S6 Edge didn’t offer expandable storage or removable batteries — two features Samsung has been known to include in all its smartphones for years.\nNow the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have made their way to the masses, and they fix many of the problems the S6 line introduced last year. While they don’t offer removable batteries, Samsung included expandable storage on both handsets in case the 32GB of on-board storage isn’t enough. Samsung mostly stuck to the same design this time around, though they did shrink down the camera bumps on the back and made the devices a little thicker to make room for larger batteries.\nIn terms of specs, these are top-of-the-line smartphones. They come with Quad HD Super AMOLED displays, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processors, 4GB of RAM, great 12MP rear-facing cameras and run the latest version of Android. Instead of featuring the same screen sizes this time around though, Samsung kept the S7 at a smaller 5.1 inches, while the S7 Edge has been bumped up to a larger 5.5-inch panel.\nSeriously, these are some incredible smartphones. They are a little pricey, but all in all, we think the high asking price is worth it.\nSpecs Samsung Galaxy S7 \n5.1-inch Super AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 577ppi Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4GB of RAM 32GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 200GB 12MP rear camera, 5MP front camera Non-removable 3000mAh battery Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9mm, 152g Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge \n5.5-inch Super AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 534ppi Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4GB of RAM 32GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 200GB 12MP rear camera, 5MP front camera Non-removable 3600mAh battery Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7mm, 157g Read more Samsung Galaxy S7 review Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review Samsung Galaxy S7 unboxing and first 48 hours Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge unboxing and first 48 hours Samsung Galaxy S7 camera: feature focus Best Galaxy S7 cases Best Galaxy S7 Edge cases HTC 10 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 / Edge vs LG G5 Buy the Galaxy S7 from Verizon Buy the Galaxy S7 Edge from Verizon \nLG V20 \nSee more LG V20 photos \nThe V20 is basically the phone for power users. It has a a big Quad HD display, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 processor, plenty of RAM and on-board storage, dual 16MP rear-facing cameras, and a removable 3,200mAh battery. Of course, the unique Second Screen makes a return this year, along with the addition of Quad DAC, military standard durability, and it’s already running Android 7.0 Nougat.\nIf top-of-the-line specs and an impressive feature set is what you’re looking for, you can’t go wrong with the V20.\nSpecs 5.7-inch IPS LCD display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 513ppi Secondary display: 2.1-inch IPS LCD display with 160 x 1040 resolution, 513ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4GB of RAM 32/64GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 256GB Dual 16 and 8MP rear cameras, 5MP front camera Removable 3,200mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 159.7 x 78.1 x 7.6mm, 174g Read more LG V20 review LG V20 tips and tricks LG V20 drop test LG V20 Feature Focus: software LG V20 specs, price, release date and everything else you should know LG V20 vs LG V10 LG V20, G5, Note 7, S7 Edge: display showdown LG V20 vs Galaxy Note 7: camera comparison Buy now from Verizon Motorola Moto Z / Moto Z Force (Droid Editions) \nSee more Moto Z and Moto Z Force photos \nMotorola (well, Lenovo actually) is doing something different with their flagship phones this year. Instead of releasing just one flagship under the Moto X moniker, they’ve decided to release two new smartphones that do things a bit out of the ordinary. The Moto Z and Moto Z Force not only bring flagship-level specs, but also support for modules.\nThese modules, called Moto Mods, attach to the back of both phones via magnets. There are only a few available right now, but they actually bring some handy features to the phones. You can purchase an external battery module, a powerful speaker, and even a projector!\nThey both have killer specs, too. Both devices come with a 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display, a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, plenty of on-board storage, expandable memory, and run Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. You might be wondering – what’s the difference between these two phones? The standard Moto Z is super thin at only 5.2mm in thickness, but it only comes with a 2600mAh battery. The Moto Z Force is thicker, has a 3500mAh battery, and also has a shatterproof display.\nThese aren’t the cheapest phones on the market, but they’re certainly some of the best.\nSpecs Moto Z \n5.5-inch AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 535ppi Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4GB of RAM 32/64GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 256GB 13MP rear camera, 5MP front camera Non-removable 2600mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 153.3 x 75.3 x 5.2mm, 136g Moto Z Force \n5.5-inch AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 535ppi Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4GB of RAM 32/64GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 256GB 21MP rear camera, 5MP front camera Non-removable 3500mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 155.9 x 75.8 x 7mm, 163g Read more Moto Z and Moto Z Force (Droid) review Moto Mods review: blast, power and project in a snap Just add Mods: Moto Z and Z Force (Droid Edition) unboxing Moto Z and Moto Z Force hands-on Buy the Moto Z from Verizon Buy the Moto Z Force from Verizon HTC 10 \nSee more HTC 10 photos \nHTC needed a saving grace this year, and the 10 just may be it. The Taiwanese company finally designed a phone that’s different enough from its predecessor yet still sports a familiar design language. With an all-metal chassis, front-mounted fingerprint sensor and a new-and-improved speaker setup, the HTC 10 easily made its way to our best Android phones list.\nUnder the hood, the 10 comes with some killer specs. A 5.2-inch Quad HD display, Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM are in line with most other flagships this year, and it also comes with expandable storage up to 200GB and a 3000mAh battery that will have no problems lasting an entire day on a single charge. HTC also improved the camera this time around, which was a big flaw in last year’s One M9 flagship.\nAll in all, the HTC 10 is an awesome device. Great specs and a solid build quality are what you’ll get here… what more could you ask for?\nSpecs 5.2-inch Super LCD5 display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 565ppi 2.15GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4GB of RAM 32/64GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 200GB 12MP rear camera, 5MP front camera Non-removable 3000mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 145.9 x 71.9 x 9mm, 161g Read more HTC 10 review Best HTC 10 cases HTC 10 vs HTC One M9 HTC 10 vs Nexus 6P HTC 10 – The Beginner’s Guide A closer look at the HTC 10’s powerful theme engine HTC 10 officially announced Problems with the HTC 10 and how to fix them Buy now from Verizon LG G5 \nSee more LG G5 photos \nWhile the Galaxy S7 series is a minor refresh in terms of design, the LG G5 sees a massive departure from the design language used in the G series, ditching the rear volume/power setup that first debuted with the LG G2. The G5 also adopts a unibody metallic design that has a removable cap for access to the removable battery and a port for modules that allow users to expand the phone’s capabilities by adding a camera grip and other special accessories.\nThe distinctly different design of the LG G5 may not be for everyone, but there’s little denying that LG has went out of its way to try and innovate in a market where big changes like this aren’t all that common.\nSpec wise, we’re looking at a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 with 4GB RAM, a 5.3-inch display, and 32 GB storage with microSD for expansion. The specs here are certainly impressive all across the board. It’s also worth mentioning that LG has revamped its software, making it faster and less bloated. One controversial move with the software, however, is the removal of the app drawer in favor of what LG says is a “simplified experience.”\nSpecs 5.3-inch IPS LCD display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 554ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4GB of RAM 32GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 200GB 16 and 8MP dual rear cameras, 8MP front camera Removable 2800mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7mm, 159g Read more LG G5 review Best LG G5 cases LG G5: specs, features, price and availability LG G5 vs iPhone 6s Moto Z Force vs LG G5 LG G5 vs LG V10 LG G5 vs LG G4 Buy now from Verizon How did you like our list?
