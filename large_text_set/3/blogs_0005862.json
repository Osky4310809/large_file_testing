Lords defeat May over EU nationals' rights after Brexit \n“Obviously the Tory whips in the Commons are going to work extremely hard with all sorts of bribes to get these people to vote with the Government. \n“I believe it can be won in the Commons on the basis of morality and principle - and Tories are principled people in general.” \nJust three Tory MPs broke ranks when, last month, the Government blocked a bid to unilaterally protect EU nationals’ rights with a comfortable majority of 42 \nThat suggests around 25 rebels will be needed when the Commons votes again, probably the week after next – and some Remain-supporting Conservatives have already said they will not step out of line. \nMany trust the Prime Minister after she vowed to ensure the issue is top of her wish-list when the two-year Brexit negotiations get underway, after Article 50 is triggered. \nMs May will not act until she receives “the same reassurance for UK citizens living in the EU” – with German Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed for refusing to start early talks. \nBut Baroness Meacher warned EU citizens – and British ex-pats – could be “left in a state of limbo at the end of the two year period”, adding: “We know it is perfectly possible there will be no deal.” \nAlthough the Prime Minister wants to reach a deal straightaway, the EU Commission’s negotiators have insisted the UK’s hefty ‘divorce bill’ must be settled first. \nFurthermore, with French and German election over the next six months, it is possible that the fate of EU citizens will not be discussed until after then. \nThe Polish Social and Cultural Association has described the Prime Minister’s stance as “immoral”, warning nationals are too scared to report hate crimes because of confusion about whether they will be able to remain. \nAnd peers warned of the “devastating consequences” facing public services and the economy without EU workers – as well as the fear many feel about their future. \nBut the pressure on Tory backbenchers not to rebel was underlined by fierce criticism of the Lords vote by leading Leave-backer Iain Duncan Smith.
