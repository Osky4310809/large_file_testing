But the footage shows them accusing her of being one of Ahok’s pawns. They then pressured her to show them her KTP (ID card) and mocked her after finding out it identified her as a Christian. \nAfter the woman pleaded, “Any religion is allowed, sir,” one of the FPI members pushed her head and uttered a profane word about her before the video ended. \nThe particular incident shown in the video seems to have slipped under the radar of the Indonesian media, but Kompas did write a news report involving the woman in the video. Polisi: 3 Orang yang Diamankan Saat Sidang Ahok adalah Wartawan. https://t.co/sKXodQFPuo — Kompas.com (@kompascom) January 31, 2017 \nAs reported in Kompas , the woman was one of three people who were “questioned” by the anti-Ahok protesters, which largely consisted of members of various hardline Islamic groups under the umbrella group GNPF-MUI (National Movement to Safeguard the MUI’s Fatwa), outside of Ahok’s blasphemy trial in South Jakarta on Tuesday. \n“We took three people to safety, two men and one woman,” said South Jakarta Police’s head of Operations, AKBP Donny Alexander. \nDonny said that the three people got close to the protesters and took photos of them. This supposedly angered the protesters who went on to interrogate the three. \nBut, as it turns out, the people who were interrogated were just doing their jobs. \n“After we questioned them, it turns out that they are journalists. They even showed their KTP and Press IDs,” Donny said. \nThe three journalists were then released by the police after questioning. There are no reports of criminal charges being filed against the protesters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:11:34.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
