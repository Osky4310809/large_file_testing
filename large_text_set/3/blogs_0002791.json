But we know that I'm 71 now, Gillan is 71, we're all about late 60s, early 70s, and bodies have a way of not keeping up with your brain or your career. \n\"We're all sort of approaching that point where I can't imagine another eight years to do an album. \n\"The time is approaching when it will end, but we don't want to face that. We don't actually want to make a date or a final tour or anything. We just want to carry on as long as nature allows or is kind of dignified. \n\"If we can't do what we do anymore, then yes, it's time to stop. But we're still doing it, and we're still enjoying it very much. So all we're saying is the door is closing, but it's not closed yet.\" \nDuring a separate chat with Rock Antenne , drummer Ian Paice noted: \"There's going to be a day in the not-so-far future when it is going to be 'the last.' That's an emotional strain that I don't think any one of us are brave enough to say 'This is the date.' But we are thinking... not thinking, we are realizing that time is creeping up every day that goes on, those numbers mount up. \n\"It's inevitable. I know we feel differently about this, but this will be the last big major world tour. Not that it's physically demanding; we tour very easily, but it could take two or three years. \n\"In two or three years, who knows what the state of the world or us are going to be in. We just have to accept the reality that the decision will have to be made some time in the future, and if we can play everywhere that wants to see us and make sure we covered as many territories as we can. That could take two-and-a-half and three years. That could be the long goodbye.\" \nDeep Purple are set to release their 20th studio album \"Infinite\" on April 7, you can check out the lead single \"Time for Bedlam\" below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:43:53.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
