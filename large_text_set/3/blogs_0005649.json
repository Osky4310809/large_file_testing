Levine 7.5k Share Tweet Follow Olivia De Havilland, one of the last remaining stars from Hollywood's Golden Age, turns 100 on July 1. De Havilland, who now lives in Paris, is also the last surviving major cast member of Gone with the Wind , in which she played Melanie. Her career was much more than that one movie. It included two Oscar-winning performances, an unparalleled pairing with Errol Flynn, a law named after her and a sometimes frosty relationship with her sister, the late Joan Fontaine. Fontaine also lived a long life, dying in 2013 at age 96.De Havilland was born on July 1, 1916 in Tokyo, 15 months before Fontaine, and three years before her parents decided to move to Los Angeles. De Havilland made her film debut when she was just 19, appearing in Warner Bros.' A Midsummer Night's Dream after starring in a now-legendary production of the Shakespeare play at the Hollywood Bowl. She was then signed to a seven-year contract with Warner Bros., which was common at the time. When Warner Bros. tried to extend it, claiming that the years she didn't work did not count towards the contract, she sued and won , with a California court ruling that a seven-year contract meant seven calendar years, not seven years of service. It helped put negotiating power in the hands of talent , not the studio and remains an important decision today. With De Havilland reaching 100, here's a look at her career in pictures.
