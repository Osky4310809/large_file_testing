Bush, said scientific studies were reviewed usually at lower levels and even when they were reviewed at higher levels, it was to give officials notice about the studies â€” not for editing of content. \n\"Scientific studies would be reviewed at the level of a branch or a division or laboratory,\" said Gray, now professor of public health at George Washington University. \"Occasionally things that were known to be controversial would come up to me as assistant administrator and I was a political appointee. Nothing in my experience would go further than that.\" \n\"There's no way to win if you try to change things,\" Gray said. Trump comments on Paris Climate deal \nThe EPA's 14-page scientific integrity document, enacted during the Obama administration, describes how scientific studies were to be conducted and reviewed in the agency. It said scientific studies should eventually be communicated to the public, the media and Congress \"uncompromised by political or other interference.\" \nThe scientific integrity document expressly \"prohibits managers and other Agency leadership from intimidating or coercing scientists to alter scientific data, findings or professional opinions or inappropriately influencing scientific advisory boards.\" It provides ways for employees who know the science to disagree with scientific reports and policies and offers them some whistleblower protection. Trump to order billions of funding cuts to UN agencies \nThe AP and other media outlets reported earlier this week that emails sent internally to EPA staff mandated a temporary blackout on media releases and social media activity, as well as a freeze on contract approvals and grant awards. \nMr Ericksen said onTuesday that the agency was preparing to greenlight nearly all of the $3.9 billion in pending contracts that were under review. He said he could not immediately provide details about roughly $100 million in distributions that will remain frozen. \nThe uncertainty about the contract and grant freeze coupled with the lack of information flowing from the agency since Trump took office have raised fears that states and other recipients could lose essential funding for drinking water protection, hazardous waste oversight and a host of other programs. \nThe agency also took a potential first step Tuesday toward killing environmental rules completed as President Barack Obama's term wound down. At least 30 were targeted in the Federal Register for delayed implementation, including updated pollution rulings for several states, renewable fuel standards and limits on the amount of formaldehyde that can leach from wood products. \nAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:17:21.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
