(Plus, colon cancer rates are rising sharply in young people .) \nSkip Energy Drinks With Your Booze Mixing highly-caffeinated drinks like energy drinks with booze is a recipe for injury, a new review in Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs concludes. Ten of the 13 studies the researchers analyzed show the combination led to an increased risk of injury, such as falls or car accidents, compared to simply drinking alcohol alone. Energy drinks mask the sedating effects of alcohol, so you can’t gauge how drunk you are. So you may end up drinking more or engaging in riskier behavior. (Here are 6 surprising things that get you drunker, quicker .) \nExamine Your Eyes It’s the worst part of your regular eye exam: the pupil-dilating eye drops that burn, sting, and make going outside into the sunlight a nightmare. Now, researchers University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine have developed a cheap, portable camera that can photograph the retina without the need for pupil-dilating drops. Currently it’s only a prototype, but the researchers hope it opens the door for clinical implications down the line. \nDiscover Your Type Yes, people really do have a “type” when dating: Researchers from the University of California at Davis discovered that people tend to date people that are very similar— both physically and personality-wise, as well as in variables like education, religiosity, and intelligence.
