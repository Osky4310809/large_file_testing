The Liverpool boss told reporters that clubs are reluctant to sell mid-season. Key player Sadio Mane is unavailable to play as he’s representing Senegal at AFCON and Liverpool could use defensive reinforcements. \nKlopp explained why it was so hard to recruit : “I understand it is absolutely normal that people ask whether we should have brought players in. The situation is yes, on the one side pretty simple, but on the other hand, it is pretty difficult. It is not that we don’t want to bring players in. We do. \n“But the thing is, the players we want because we think they help us, the clubs don’t sell. It is not about money in this situation, it is the winter transfer window. Clubs are saying ‘No, we have half a year to go, we cannot find another player like this, we prefer to take money in the summer than a few pounds more in the winter than whatever.” Elite recruitment policy \nKlopp also spoke about the scarcity of top quality players available who can improve his squad. He continued: “You see the situation. It’s tight, it’s close, we know that, but if the right decision is not possible in signing the right player then you cannot make the wrong transfer. It’s not as if there are 20 players out there who could make this team stronger, who are running around and are available. That is the situation. \n“That is why I say we know the situation, we are prepared to move, but for the right player.” Loading tags...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:23:51.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
