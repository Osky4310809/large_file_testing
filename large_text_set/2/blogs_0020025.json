While the new update is not bringing any major change or a visual refresh to the app, it does add support for a much-awaited feature: Adaptable Storage. Previously, users running Android 6.0 and above were having issues while backing up apps and their data stored on their Adoptable Storage as the app was lacking native support for the feature.\nLast week, we reported that the developer behind the app was working on adding support for Adoptable Storage functionality. Now, with this update, the feature has finally been added to the app. After updating the app, you should be able to backup and restore apps stored on your Adoptable Storage without any issue. Also, you will be able to “force move” apps between Adoptable Storage and device’s internal storage, just in case.\nApart from the support for Adoptable Storage, the app has also been updated with Dropbox API v2, a feature available in the paid version of the app which allows users to upload their backups on their Dropbox account.\nHere is the full change log for the v8.0.0 update:\nAdded support for Adoptable storage (Android 6.0+) including Backup/Restore, Free space gauge, Restore destination override, Data profiles. Added the ability to “force move” apps to/from Adoptable storage. [PRO] Upgraded to Dropbox API v2 (needs re-authentication). Updated translations.
