So, if you're alone this Valentine's Day, don't let it get you down. The main idea of V-Day is to celebrate love, and that doesn't necessarily have to be with a partner. It can be with your family, your pets, your friends, but most importantly, this day is also about loving yourself. So, if you're spending V-Day alone, don't wallow in sadness. Make it a day about you, and shower yourself with some much-needed love. Treat yo'self \nWho better to buy you a present that you'll really adore, than yourself? So, if there's something you've been eyeing for a while and were hesitant to buy, or even if it's a spontaneous splurge, treat yourself. It's completely okay, and even necessary sometimes, to gift yourself something. Indulge in some binge-watching \nWhatever your streaming platform of choice, you know nothing is more fun than binge-watching an entire series or some movies back-to-back. So get yourself some movie theatre-esque snacks, and get watching. We suggest Riverdale on Netflix, catching up on some Koffee With Karan on Hotstar (if you haven't already watched all of it), or even Footloose on Amazon Prime. Do something new \nIs there something that you've wanted to try for a long time but have been too afraid to go with? Now's the time. Whether it's trying out a new cuisine, getting an experimental haircut, or trying out an adventure sport, just go for it. Cook something for yourself \nSo, we're assuming you share our fondness (read: obsession) for food, and if you haven't cooked yourself a meal, you're missing out. While actually eating the khaana without cooking it is the best part, getting your hands dirty, and preparing or baking one of your favourite dishes is a super fun experience. Plus, the feeling of eating something you've made yourself, no matter how good or bad it turns out, is awesome. Avoid social media \nSo this one is more of a self-help situation, seeing how wired we all are to our various social media feeds. Like we said earlier, there is literally no reason for you to feel upset about not having a valentine, and we're hoping you make a conscious effort to be happy and concentrate on yourself. But one thing that could slightly throw you off, is being bombarded with happy couples flaunting their love all over your feeds. So, take a little break from being online that day, and continue giving yourself all the TLC that is due.
