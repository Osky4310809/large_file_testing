Debut. #BMGS04 — OptaFranz (@OptaFranz) March 16, 2017 \nGuido Burgstaller - scorer of Schalke's equaliser in the first leg - steered an early header just wide of the target before Gladbach lost Fabian Johnson through injury. \nThe home side should have taken the lead in the 18th minute when Raffael's run and cross down the left found Josip Drmic unmarked eight yards out but, in attempting to put the ball out of goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann's reach, the Swiss forward directed his header the wrong side of the post. \nDrmic made amends for that poor miss with a cushioned nod-down from a free-kick that teed up Christensen's opener. \nThe on-loan Chelsea defender had enough time to take a touch inside the area before aiming a shot at goal, albeit his attempt needed a deflection off Benedikt Howedes to find the net. \nIn contrast, Dahoud did not need any assistance to get Gladbach's second on the stroke of half-time. \nWith Schalke backing off, the midfielder let fly with a right-footed rocket that flashed beyond the rooted Fahrmann. \nIn a deep hole heading into the second half, Schalke's recovery mission was kick-started by Goretzka's lucky goal in the 54th minute. \nA poor clearance from Jannik Vestergaard allowed the midfielder to take aim with his left foot, although his low drive needed a horrible bobble to get beyond goalkeeper Yann Sommer's dive. \nDahoud presented the visitors the chance to draw level when he needlessly thrust an arm out inside his area, giving referee Mark Clattenburg little option but to award a penalty. \nBentaleb punished the error by scoring from the spot - just as he had done in his side's 4-2 Bundesliga loss at the same venue on March 4 - and suddenly Schalke were in the driving seat with just over 20 minutes remaining. 15 – The last 15 penalties against Gladbach in competitive matches were converted. Weakness. #BMGS04 \nAnd Schalke stood firm under a late onslaught to progress, meaning they are the last German team left standing in the competition Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:02:49.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
