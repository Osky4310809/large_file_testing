AR Rahman recently revisited another hit track from Kadalan, Urvasi Urvasi and the video went viral. However you'd be shocked to know that the composer was against remix of OK Jaanu song Humma Humma. Read on... By Rashma Shetty Bali | Published: January 13, 2017 6:42 pm Shraddha Kapoor finally opens up about her relationship with Farhan Akhtar \nShraddha Kapoor and Aditya Roy Kapur’s Humma Humma song from OK Jaanu might be the most popular track from the film, however, when the song was first unveiled it was met with mixed reactions. While some loved the new Badshah version of AR Rahman song, there were others who went on to troll the makers for daring to touch a classic. Humma Humma was originally created by Rahman for 1995 Mani Ratnam film Bombay . AR along with Remo Fernandes and Swarnalatha had crooned this number, which was one of the highlights of the film. The Mozart of Madras was recently quizzed about Badshah’s rendition of Humma Humma song and his response was shocking. \nRahman was quizzed by a journo on what were his thoughts about the new remixed version of his song. The Oscar winning singer/composer very candidly said, “I had a complete block. I categorically said ‘No’ when Karan Johar (producer, ‘ OK Jaanu ‘) and Shaad Ali (director) came to me with it. I said I don’t think this is a good idea. Let’s not do it. But they were convinced that Badshah could spin his magic and make it work for the younger audience. They wanted to go ahead with it.” ( OK Jaanu movie review: Shraddha Kapoor and Aditya Roy Kapur’s aashiqui gets a Mani Ratnam twist ) \nThe music magician went in to add, “Now that the song has released, it’s apparently a big hit, so I guess they were probably right.” \nWell when OK jaanu’s this song was first out here’s what some people om Twitter had to say… \nOn the one hand, it’s just a song, on the other YOU DON”T MESS WITH HUMMA HUMMA. \n— Sruthi Radhakrishnan (@sruthirk) December 15, 2016 \nBadshah is the new Himesh Reshammiya -_- \n— Sapan Verma (@sapanv) December 15, 2016 \nBadshah puts the NO in Nostalgia. #thehummasong \n— Sahil Shah (@SahilBulla) December 15, 2016 IN THE NEW HUMMA HUMMA….WHERE IS REMO FERNANDES SAYING ‘BAGDABAGDABEYO ’? \n— Sahil Shah (@SahilBulla) December 15, 2016 \nThe new Humma Humma autotuned AR Rehman’s voice in case you wanted to know how bad Bollywood music can get. \n— Sahil Shah (@SahilBulla) December 15, 2016 AR Rahman took his own motherfucking awesome song, involved Badshah, and remixed it. Sanctity dead. Humanity dead. 2016 couldn’t get worse! \n— Perpetual Loser (@KeepsItRustic) December 15, 2016 \nI am feeling whatever my dad went through when he heard the Kaanta Laga remix. Fuck you Badshah! \n— Perpetual Loser (@KeepsItRustic) December 15, 2016 Also, can we please stop putting Badshah into everything. He is a rapper, not Garam masala, bloody! \n— Vishwanath Nair (@visshy_it) December 15, 2016 \nCan’t wait for Mika’s rendition of Roja Jaaneman. \n— adrak (@ubercoolosis) December 15, 2016 \nOf course the makers must have been happy despite the uproar over another remix. But going by Rahman’s recent quote looks like he’d never want Humma Humma to be touched. \nIn the same Huffington Post interview Rahman also commented on critics who claimed that the maverick had lost his midas touch. He said, “People evolve and that affects their music. So perhaps my music has changed from what it used to be. But my passion hasn’t. I love making music and that’s what I will be doing for the rest of my life. I am quite proud of the work that I do and if some critics feel the way they do, they are free to have that opinion. For me, my work is everything. And I am not going to defend it to anyone.” \nRahman recently revisited another hit track from Kadalan, Urvasi Urvasi and the video went viral. The singer had tweaked the original to give us a upgraded version that took on Donald Trump and even made a comment about the demonetisation policy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T15:42:32.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
