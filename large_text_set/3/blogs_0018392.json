Take a look through our earlier coverage if you’re out of the loop. After playing with the update for a few hours, we’ve come across an interesting new suite of options tucked in Developer Options: Bluetooth Audio Codec options.\nOnce you’ve enabled Developer Options (if you’ll recall, simply go to Settings –> About Phone and tap on the Build number 7 times), you’ll be able to access these options. You can select the Audio Codec (including the new high quality LDAC and aptX codecs which were developed by Sony and Qualcomm respectively), change the sample rate, bits per sample, channel mode, and playback quality.\nWe’re no audiophiles, but perhaps some of you may find these settings to fine grain your Bluetooth audio playback experience somewhat useful. I myself would opt to just let the system decide what’s best, given my limited understanding of audio codecs, but more available controls that power users can take advantage of are always welcome in our view, so kudos to Google for including this feature.\nIf we come across any other interesting features, you’ll be the first to know on the XDA Portal. Stay tuned!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:24:16.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
