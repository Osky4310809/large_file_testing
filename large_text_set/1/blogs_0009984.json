He does not just score, but also works incredibly hard. \n\"Mauro is the captain and trying to give the right example. The team is following him and I see great commitment from everyone, both in matches and on the training pitch. \n\"We are very pleased with the win, but the season is still long and we have to continue on this path.\" #InterChievo 3-1: @MauroIcardi , #Perisic and @Edercitadin7 get the goals as Inter come from behind Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:26:46.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
