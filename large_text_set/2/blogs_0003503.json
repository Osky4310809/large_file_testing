He said there was no clear consensus on establishing a new voting system.\n“There is no consensus on how, or even whether, to reform our electoral system,” he said in the House of Commons during Question Period, the Toronto Star reported .\nTrudeau in 2015 vowed to change the current first-past-the-post voting system, which generally benefits conservatives who vote in a block for the Conservative Party of Canada, and leaves out smaller and more liberal parties. Trudeau himself is the leader of the Liberal Party.\nThe opposition New Democrats said Trudeau lied to progressive voters when he made the promise during his campaign.\n“What Mr. Trudeau proved himself today was to be a liar,” New Democratic party member of parliament Nathan Cullen told reporters, according to Reuters.\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:18:04.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
