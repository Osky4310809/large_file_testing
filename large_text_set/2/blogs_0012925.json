On the surface, Eggs in Pokémon Go appear to simply be another way of randomly acquiring a few new Pokes.\nBut just like the mighty Magikarp, we shouldn't judge Eggs by their seemingly ineffectual appearances. Eggs and hatching can still be an extremely useful tool for expanding your collection - or indeed powering up the Pokémon you already have - and as such we've compiled a guide containing everything we know on the topic, and that now includes the new egg charts for Gen 2 Pokémon as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:39:26.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
