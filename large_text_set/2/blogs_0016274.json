Sgt Cam Donnison says that often a missing gnome is the result of \"drunken high jinx\" or youngsters pulling a prank, but that this was an organised operation. \n\"It seems to be the fashion at the moment. They are taking these items to hock off for methamphetamine - it's all meth driven,\" he tells the site. Such items can be easily sold on to raise quick cash, he says - as much as NZ$300 ($215; Â£170) for a big plant pot. Meth is a highly addictive stimulant and a class A drug in New Zealand, with stiff penalties for anyone manufacturing or supplying it. \nAs well as the gnomes, police found pots, garden statues and some ornamental pink flamingos. Some of the items had already been reported missing, and police say they will now try to reunite them with their owners. \nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter .
