US President \nThe order sparked large protests across the United States and in other countries. In Rome, a few dozen protesters waved signs reading “No Ban, No Walls’’ and “Trump, ban torture not Muslims’’ in English. A candlelit protest was due to be held later in front of the embassy by a group of Americans who live in Italy. \n“If discriminatory policies take hold, it’s a danger for everyone everywhere,’’ said Michael Stiefel, 50, a lawyer and a U.S. citizen. Antonella Napolitano, 35, who works for an Italian rights group that helped organize the protest, said: “One hundred years ago Italian immigrants in America were treated badly, there can be change, and history does not have to repeat.’’ adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:38:19.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
