Chaffetz said he doesn’t want to get into a “fishing expedition” because Democrats think he should. \nBlitzer brought that interview up later in the hour and recalled Chaffetz’s answer about how it wouldn’t be appropriate to subpoena Trump’s tax returns. \nToobin said this in response: \n“Do you think there were enough investigations of Benghazi by the Republican House?… Jason Chaffetz is only interested in investigating Democrats. Period. That’s the reason why Jason Chaffetz is in Congress, which is to investigate Democrats. He has no interest in making trouble for Donald Trump and he’s not going to make trouble for Donald Trump.” \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:08:43.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
