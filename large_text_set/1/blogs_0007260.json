It’s every man for himself. I’m considering ringing my boss asking if he really wants me to come in and run a team today. \n\"It’s chaos.” Cyclist Simon Quantrill, who lives in Clapham, said: “It is really scary out there. Cyclists are taking huge chances. The traffic is mad, the whole way up — especially around London Bridge and onwards.” \nLabour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan condemned the 24-hour strike , called by the RMT and TSSA unions, branding it “completely unnecessary”. \nMore than four million Tube users were left struggling to get to work and school as the Left-wing unions combined forces to bring the network to a halt, costing the capital millions in lost trade. \nPublishing editor Catherine Allison, 25, was trying to reach Shepherd’s Bush station when she was caught up in crowds at Clapham Junction, the capital’s biggest interchange. \n“There was complete gridlock in the station as they weren’t letting passengers enter platforms from the underpass,” said Miss Allison, who said it took 15 minutes just to get out. \n“There was a huge queue in the overhead walkway. I was queuing for 40 minutes to get to my platform, then they announced the entire station was being evacuated ‘for passenger safety due to overcrowding’.” \nToday’s misery was at the start of a week of strikes, with three days of walkouts set to halt all Southern rail services tomorrow, Wednesday and Friday and a 48-hour strike by British Airways cabin crew cancelling some flights from Heathrow tomorrow and Wednesday. Evening Standard comment: Damaging, pointless and vicious strikes \nRMT union leader Mick Cash said the Tube strike was justified because so many jobs had been axed that it had been reduced to an “understaffed-death trap”. \nBut London Underground said it had responded to the union concerns by offering new jobs. Steve Griffiths, chief operating officer, maintained there was “no need to strike” because he had agreed with the unions that more staff were needed on stations. \nHe said: “We had always intended to review staffing levels and have had constructive discussions with the unions. \n\"We agree that we need more staff in our stations and have already started to recruit 200 extra staff and this is likely to increase further as we work through the other areas that need to be addressed. \n“Taking into account existing vacancies and natural turnover this means that over 600 staff will be recruited for stations this year. There will also be increased opportunities for promotion.” \nTory MP Chris Philp said the Clapham Junction incident showed the unions’ own actions were putting people in danger and discomfort. “This makes a mockery of union claims to be concerned about safety. \n\"Their own actions have caused a safety concern this morning. They have endangered the lives of Londoners doing nothing more than trying to get to work.” \nThe chaos was far more severe than originally predicted by LU as up to 4,000 station and ticket staff took part in the walkout. \nThe Mayor urged the unions to get back round the table to resolve the dispute “amicably”. He said that all sides were “at fault” and apologised to Londoners for the disruption they had suffered as a result. \nMr Khan travelled to work by Southern Rail and ended up running late for a series of interviews. \n“As Mayor of London I ultimately take responsibility for the running of our city so I apologise to businesses inconvenienced by today’s industrial action, to commuters suffering misery as a consequence of their journeys,” he told the Standard. \nHe added: “This strike is completely unnecessary. I condemn this strike.” \nRMT and TSSA ordered the strike in protest over the axing of 900 jobs and the closing of all ticket offices under former Mayor Boris Johnson’s regime to save cash. The unions claim the system is now at “breaking point” and unable to operate safely. \nAt 7am, 10 of the Tube’s 11 lines were shut with only a handful of trains running a shuttle service on the Bakerloo line between Queen’s Park and Harrow and Wealdstone. \nBy 8am, eight of the 11 lines were running “limited” services. LU said it hoped to open 60 per cent of its 260 stations and nine lines. \nMr Cash said: “Our members are out in force across LU this morning in the fight for jobs and safety... This action has been forced on us by savage cuts to jobs that have reduced LU to an under-staffed death trap at a time of heightened security and safety alert.” \nThe unions said only 200 of the 600 jobs are “new”. TSSA General Secretary Manuel Cortes attacked “devastating Tory attacks on TfL’s budget”.
