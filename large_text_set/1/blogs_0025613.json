I hope that this period will be more successful.\" \nIn his previous spell at the club Ba scored 18 goals in 29 league appearances for the Black Eagles, but could only help Besiktas to third spot behind Galatasaray and Fenerbahce. \nManager Senol Gunes added four new players during the window, with Ryan Babel, Ersan Gulum and Matej Mitrovic also joining the Turkish champions.
