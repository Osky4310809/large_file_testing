Natalie Amrossi , a travel photographer and Canon brand ambassador, says having a shot list can help you avoid heading home with a camera filled with boring, lifeless pictures. Advertisement \nAmrossi, who’s taken pictures in over 50 countries, tells Shivani Vora at The New York Times that travelers should make a shot list before they go somewhere. List out 10 to 20 places you know you’d like to get photos. That way, you’ll always remember to take certain pictures while you’re there. And don’t hesitate to include specific types of shots you’d like to get at each place. Note angles, times of day, or whatever you think will make your trip picture perfect. \nAlso, not every picture has to be at a big tourist spot either. Amrossi points out that pictures off the beaten path, like a residential neighborhood, can capture a place while making your photos unique.
