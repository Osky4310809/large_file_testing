He was scheduled to play the Genesis Open , the Honda Classic and this week's Arnold Palmer Invitational . Woods was also scheduled to hold a news conference at the Genesis Open, which benefits his foundation, but he canceled after meeting with doctors who advised him to \"stay horizontal.\" \nHe issued a statement last week saying, \"Unfortunately, due to ongoing rest and rehabilitation on my back, I won't be able to play in this year's Arnold Palmer Invitational ... Presently, I have no timetable for my return to golf, but my treatments are continuing and going well.\" \nWoods will be signing copies of his new book \"The 1997 Masters: My Story\" on Monday at 12:30 p.m. ET, but there are strict rules for fans who show up to the Barnes and Noble in Union Square. \nPer the Barnes and Noble website : \n\"This event offers an extremely limited amount of wristbands and seats with purchase of The 1997 Masters: My Story. Mr. Woods will only be signing copies of his new book, no memorabilia please. Wristbands will be distributed with purchase of The 1997 Masters: My Story, as of 9am on the morning of the event at this location only. \n\"Requests for signatures on memorabilia, book personalizing or photos with Mr. Woods will not be granted.
