Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWe all remember the classic 90s cartoon Hey Arnold! but how many of us know what the voice actor looked like? \nThat lovable football-shaped head had all the cartoon ladies swooning (sort of) - and now the actor behind him is having the same affect. \nHis name is Lane Toran and he's a musician now among other things. \nDisappointingly he doesn't have a football-shaped head (or should that be rugby?), but you can't have everything. \nHe has quite a lot going for him as it turns out. He's an actor, musician and went on to voice other characters in the Disney universe as well as Jimmy Neutron. \nJust look at him. Total cool musician and hipster. He's winning at life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:08:04.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
