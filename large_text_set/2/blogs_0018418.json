Bandai Makes Star Wars and Marvel so Much Cooler with Samurai If you’ve ever looked at Etsy , browsed /r/gaming , or been to any video game or comic book convention, you’ve seen Perler beads turned into sprite art. After all, Perler beads are an ideal canvas for pixel-based crafts. Each bead is a pixel you arrange on a pinboard, then a quick press with an iron fuses them together into a single plastic sprite of Mario, Mega Man, Sonic, or any other character you like from the 8- or 16-bit era.\nUntil now, they’ve all been unofficial craft projects made out of stock Perler or Perler-like beads in whatever colors come closest to the palette of the video game you want to turn into a piece of plastic art. Nintendo and Perler have come together to make some of those sprite projects official. Perler showed off its upcoming lines of Nintendo-branded bead kits at Toy Fair this weekend.\nCurrently, Perler’s Nintendo sets span across three classic games: The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. 3 on the NES and Super Mario World on the SNES. I would have loved a Link to the Past line as well, but it’s still a pretty excellent trio to start with.\nThe Super Mario Bros. 3 line is by far Perler’s biggest. Perler will offer the Mario Deluxe Kit with 4,000 beads, a pegboard, and 13 different projects. There’s a Super Mario Bros. 3 pattern pad with 60 different sprite projects, a tub of 5,000 Perler beads in the Mario palette, and ten different individual starter kits of 275 beads, a pegboard, and a sprite design like Mario, Super Star, Boo, Bullet Bill, and Cheep Cheep.\nSuper Mario World is getting five different Perler products, using the smaller Mini Beads. There will be a Super Mario World deluxe box kit with 16,000 beads and 18 different projects, a standard box kit with 4,000 beads and nine different projects; and three different starter kits with 2,000 beads and six projects. The smaller beads make sense for Super Mario World because the 16-bit sprites of the game use a wider variety of colors because it’s also more complicated in design. And smaller beads means more beads; therefore more colors can be included in a given set without increasing the price too much.\nPerler showed off only two The Legend of Zelda kits: a 2,000-bead The Legend of Zelda small box kit using standard Perler beads and a 2,000-bead The Legend of Zelda starter kit using Mini Beads.\nRetail pricing for these Nintendo-themed Perler kits haven’t been announced yet, but they should be hitting stores this summer.", "external_links": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/", "https://www.etsy.com/market/nintendo_perler"], "published": "2017-02-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:45:06.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
