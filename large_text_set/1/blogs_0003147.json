In fact, we are fewer than three weeks away from a pair of matches that could make or break the U.S. team's chances of making the 2018 World Cup. \nThe U.S. January national team camp should help answer some questions for Bruce Arena in terms of the player pool and his depth chart, while also giving him a better idea of potential starting options for qualifiers against Honduras and Panama. \nTop 10 American storylines to watch in 2017 \nQuestions such as: Can Clint Dempsey be ready for a key role in March? Is Jermaine Jones still a starter? Is there a left back in the pool worthy of the starting role? Are any goalkeepers ready to make a run at Tim Howard and Brad Guzan in the depth chart? \nThere will be some new faces emerging from the January camp, as is always the case, but anyone hoping for a drastic change in appearance in the U.S. team that heads into March qualifying might wind up disappointed. The reality is, as Arena has already stated, the squad he will take into those all-important matches is very likely to look a lot like the same team Klinsmann led to a pair of losses in November. There just isn't enough time to make drastic changes, and it is more likely that this summer's Gold Cup serves as a real opportunity for new faces to climb the U.S. depth chart. \nThe reality is we are likely to see many of the same players who started in the loss to Costa Rica take the field against Honduras on March 24. The coach will be different, as will the formation, and it will be up to the players to make sure the result is also different. \nAs we sit some 10 weeks away from the March qualifiers, here is how Arena's starting options stack up at the moment: GOALKEEPER \nWith Tim Howard sidelined by groin surgery, Brad Guzan should be in the net against Honduras and Panama. The big question now is whether Guzan will be playing in MLS by then. He has been heavily linked to Atlanta United, and if he signs, Guzan could have a handful of starts under his belt by the time the March qualifiers role around. If he stays at Middlesbrough, and continues to be stuck on the bench behind Victor Valdes, then Arena could have a tough decision to make. \nFrom an experience standpoint, Nick Rimando would probably be the next best option, and Arena has already mentioned him by name as a candidate. He has done well with his national team opportunities, and is coming off a 2016 where he still played at a high level for Real Salt Lake. \nThen there is 21-year-old Ethan Horvath, who just completed a move to Club Brugge . It remains to be seen whether Horvath will be Brugge's starter, but if he is, and he's playing well, Arena could be tempted to give him the nod. \nLastly, Howard could conceivably work his way back into action by March, and potentially be available for the qualifiers. DEFENDERS \nAfter last November's 4-0 loss to Costa Rica, there were serious questions raised about the U.S. defense, and some of those questions remain as he roll into the new year. \nGeoff Cameron remains sidelined at Stoke City with the same knee injury that kept him out of the November qualifiers. In fact, he has been out of action since October, which has to start making Arena a little nervous about whether or not he will have his best defender available. \nIf Cameron remains sidelined into March, it will open the door for a starting role for several candidates, including Omar Gonzalez, Steve Birnbaum and Matt Hedges, who will be one of the players to keep tabs on in the January camp. Arena's return as U.S. coach could help Gonzalez's case considering he played for Arena with the LA Galaxy, but then again, Arena could be tempted to give Hedges a longer look. \nAt left center back, John Brooks remains the top choice, even with his disastrous performance against Costa Rica in November. The fact that he was benched for the final three Hertha Berlin matches before the winter break bears watching. Matt Besler remains an option in place of Brooks, while Hedges could also be a challenger for the left center-back role despite being right-footed. \nThe fullback options are a bit tougher to hammer out. Timmy Chandler figured to be dropped from the picture after his latest national team struggles in November, but he continues to play well for Eintracht Frankfurt and with no clear-cut starting options aside from Chandler, Arena may have no choice but to give him a serious look. DeAndre Yedlin is continuing to battle for starts at Newcastle United, and could play his way into a starting role if he can find a good rhythm in England. In terms of new blood, Keegan Rosenberry is a player who should get a look in January, but is probably still too green to factor in as an option for March qualifiers. \nAt left back, we should see some familiar faces back in the mix. Arena has already let it be known he will bring in veteran DaMarcus Beasley for the January camp, while Greg Garza's loan move to Atlanta United should also earn him a ticket to the upcoming camp as well. Fabian Johnson is a good bet to start at left back in March, assuming Arena finds a suitable right-back option. MIDFIELDERS \nMichael Bradley and Christian Pulisic look like safe bets to start, but the rest of the U.S. midfield is very much up in the air. \nArena must first decide where he feels Fabian Johnson should play. If Arena goes the same route as Klinsmann, then Johnson will play at fullback, leaving a wing slot in play. If Arena decides Johnson is too valuable as a wide midfield to use in defense, then we will very likely see a Pulisic-Johnson tandem on the flanks. \nIf Arena keeps Johnson at fullback, then players such as Alejandro Bedoya, Gyasi Zardes and Darlington Nagbe will be in the conversation as potential wing options. Pulisic will work one of the flank spots, with Arena already making it clear he is putting an end to the Pulisic-as-playmaker experiment Klinsmann tried in November. \nIn terms of central midfield options, Sacha Kljestan is a good bet to benefit from Arena's return as coach. Arena tried signing Kljestan for the Galaxy before he joined the Red Bulls and he knows what Kljestan can do. Arena has to decide whether to keep Jermaine Jones in the lineup. If Arena feels Jones is too good to leave out, he may have to consider a 4-3-3 formation with Jones and Bradley as the base of a three-man midfield. If Arena sticks to a variation of the 4-4-2, then Jones could be the odd man out. \nIn terms of new faces who could factor into the conversation, Danny Williams remains a good option in a defensive midfield role if needed, while Sebastian Lletget could play his way into a prominent role if he has a good January camp. FORWARDS \nGiven how they both closed out 2016, and how well they played together, Jozy Altidore and Bobby Wood should be your starting U.S. forwards, with the only real question being whether to keep them paired as a tandem in a 4-4-2, or to add another forward and play them in a 4-3-3. \nClint Dempsey could definitely play his way back into the conversation , either as a third forward or as a playmaker. Of course that's contingent on him recovering fully from the heart condition that cost him the second half of 2016. \nBeyond those three, you have Jordan Morris and Gyasi Zardes as secondary options, though both will more likely wind up in bench roles.
