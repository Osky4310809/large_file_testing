(AP/KDKA) – Local Democratic officials warn Republicans who vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act risk losing their own seats in next year’s election. \n“There are people who are coming out of the woodwork — talented people who never gave it a thought before who want to run for government at every level of government,” said PA Rep. Dan Frankel, chair of the state House Democratic Caucus, in response to a question from KDKA political editor Jon Delano. \nOpposition to President Trump and his Republican congressional allies is creating a groundswell of new activists, just as the Tea Party did against President Obama in 2009. \n“Folks have created this tremendous grassroots level effort that we’re going to be working towards,” noted PA Sen. Jay Costa, the state Senate Democratic Leader. \n“But there’s no question as we go forward I think you’re going to see an enhanced level of candidates running in some of these races.” \nDemocrats think local Republican congressmen Tim Murphy, Keith Rothfus, and Mike Kelly — each expected to support the Trumpcare health plan — may be vulnerable to Democratic challengers next year. \n“There’s going to be a lot of congressional folks who will have to answer to their constituents when their health care gets taken away,” said Allegheny County chief executive Rich Fitzgerald. \nIt will take a major effort — and millions of dollars — to defeat local Republican congressmen. \nKeith Rothfus won with 62 percent of the votes last year, and Mike Kelly and Tim Murphy didn’t even have a Democratic challenger in 2016. \nFitzgerald said it will be different in 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:03:05.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
