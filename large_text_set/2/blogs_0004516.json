Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com \nKINLOCH • Regina Sykes said Sunday that she was praying that human remains found during a weekend search in Kinloch were not those of her daughter, who has been missing more than three months. \nA search party of volunteers scoured a desolate area of Kinloch on Saturday and stumbled upon remains some believe may be those of Sykes’ daughter, Monica Elaine Sykes, 25, who disappeared on Oct. 28. \nPolice provided no new information Sunday. St. Louis County police, who assisted with the body, said they were called about 1 p.m. Saturday. \nRegina Sykes, 50, said officials told her it could take weeks to determine if the remains are her daughter’s. \nShe did not participate in the search but had in other searches. \n“I couldn’t find myself going to another vacant building or wooded area looking for my child,” she said softly. “I’m still hoping and praying that she is still alive.” \nHer husband, Leonard Sykes, her daughter Dana Bailey, 30, of Berkeley, and her father, Roger Webb, 72, of St. Louis had been at the Berkeley Civic Center, the search command center, when word arrived of the discovery. \nHer son, Nathan Sykes, 27, arrived at the search site just as the area, along the Berkeley-Ferguson border, was being blocked off, she said. \n“I think about the people who are still missing in Berkeley,” she said. “I’m surprised that they didn’t find others out there.” \nShe was referring to Kelly L. Allen, 20, and Shemika Cosey, 16, who have been missing from Berkeley for years. Berkeley Police Capt. Art Jackson, the acting police chief, said he believed there was no connection between Monica Sykes and their disappearances. \nSykes’ mother said the area where the body was found was previously searched by police, using dogs and a helicopter, and more recently by volunteers. \nMonica Sykes lives with her sister and three nephews in the 6300 block of Fay Drive in Berkeley. She left to buy candy and never returned, her mother said. One of the nephews said he saw her get into a white car. \nThe missing woman had recently returned from a date with a Berkeley police officer. \nPolice have said they talked to Sykes’ boyfriend, who has a white car, but declined to further comment. Sykes had worked at least a year at Ol’ Henry Restaurant in Berkeley. \nThe family is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to her whereabouts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T13:31:35.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
