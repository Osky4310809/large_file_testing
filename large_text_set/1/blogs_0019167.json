KRIZJOHN ROSALES \nMANILA, Philippines - He would kill rogue policemen if he could. \nPhilippine National Police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa expressed embarrassment yesterday over the murder of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo by policemen right inside the PNP headquarters at Camp Crame. \n“Very angry. Very offended. If I could only melt in shame from where I am now,” Dela Rosa told reporters at Malacañang yesterday. \nDela Rosa said he would kill the policemen involved in Jee’s kidnap-slay if it were allowed by law. \n“If I have my way, I would kill the policemen who are kidnappers. But I cannot do it because it’s illegal,” he said. \nDela Rosa said President Duterte was also angered by the incident.   President Duterte swears in newly promoted PNP generals at Malacañang yesterday. KRIZJOHN ROSALES \nHe said he is convinced that SPO3 Ricky Sta. Isabel strangled the victim to death. \nDela Rosa also apologized to the South Korean government for what happened to one of its citizens. \n“I’m very sorry this crime happened and my men were involved. We’ll give them proper explanation in due time. We will update them and give the whole explanation when everything is done,” Dela Rosa said. \nHe belied notions the incident indicated a breakdown of rule of law in the country. \n“For all you know, let us be frank here, there were more crimes before the time of our President that we did not know about because the leadership of the PNP then was not as tough in terms of internal cleaning. I’m sorry to the previous PNP chiefs. I don’t mean to offend them,” he said. \nDela Rosa also maintained the wrongdoings of policemen would not be condoned and the President’s protection only covers acts done in the performance of their duty. \n“They would be punished if they are involved in wrongdoings,” he said.
