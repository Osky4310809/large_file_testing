We are the voice, we are the face of America. Our America is big, it is free, and it is open to dreamers of all races, all countries, all religions. Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump. I want to specifically tonight reject his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that.\" \nAnd Legend, who is open about his political views and not afraid to be honest, admitted it was a tough call for him and wife Chrissy Teigen to even attend the PGAs last night: \n\"But we came here tonight, and we also wanted to put our money where our mouth is. We made a donation to the ACLU and other organizations who are committed to fighting for freedom in the land of the free. There's a lot of money and power in this room and I hope you all will use it for something good. Let's all continue to stand up together for what is right.\" \nAmen! \nRelated: If You Support A Muslim Ban, You Should Read This \nIt's a better showing at the PGAs for Legend than for Mark Burnett , the producer and creator of The Apprentice , which helped make Trump a reality star; Burnett was booed throughout the evening when he took to the stage. \nNevertheless, all of this comes back to the very public protests against Trump for his immigration ban — celebs are watching, standing in solidarity, and in many cases participating themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T00:40:39.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
