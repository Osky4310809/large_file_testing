As such, Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty applies.” \nArticle 5 states , “Each Party recognizes that an armed attack against either Party in the territories under the administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger. … Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall be immediately reported to the Security Council of the United Nations in accordance with the provisions of Article 51 of the Charter.” \nMattis continued, “I want there to be no misunderstanding during the transition in Washington that we stand firmly, 100 percent shoulder to shoulder with you and the Japanese people.” Advertisement - story continues below \nHe added, “We all play by the rules, and if we have disputes we take them to arbitration, we don’t settle them by taking military means and occupying land that is subject to question, to say the least, about who actually owns it.” \nLu Kang, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said in a statement, “We urge the U.S. side to take a responsible attitude, stop making wrong remarks … and avoid making the issue more complicated and bringing instability to the regional situation.” \nThe sovereignty of the uninhabited Senkaku Islands has long been a point of dispute among Japan, China and Taiwan. \nThis was not the first time that China had sent ships into Japanese waters surrounding the islands.
