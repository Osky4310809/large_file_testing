This book includes Old Man Logan , Archangel, and at least three or so other mystery characters. \nMarvel does not name the new series, instead teasing that it is “The comic series fans have been demanding!” The series is set to debut in June 2017, meaning we won’t have too long to wait for a full reveal as June solicitations will be announced by the end of March. \nOld Man Logan is already featured heavily in the X-Men’s ResurrXion lineup. In addition to continuing his solo adventures in Old Man Logan with a new creative team, Logan is a member of Kitty Pryde’s flagship X-Men team in X-Men: Gold and leads an ad hoc team of mutants being hunted down in Weapon X . Up Next: The Near-Death And ResurrXion Of The X-Men \nWeapon X has been billed as the gritty X-Men book of the new relaunch but Marvel has insisted that it is not an X-Force book operating under another name despite former X-Force members Domino and Warpath being part of Logan’s group. Perhaps X-Force is what this new book is. Archangel was part of Logan’s X-Force team previously and, with the excitement building over X-Force possibly getting its own movie, it seems likely that fans have been asking Marvel to add an X-Force title ResurrXion lineup. \nIf that’s the case, it's easy to speculate that some other former X-Force team members may be joining the group. The silhouetted character in the top left of the image seems to be holding a rather large gun, suggesting it could be X-Force founder Cable, who is set to get his own solo series as part of ResurrXion and has been teased for and will appear in Deadpool 2 . \nThere’s another gun silhouette in the hand of the character on the right side of the image, who is also wearing a full mask that covers his or her hair. This sounds like it could be Deadpool, but the gloves and what looks like an overcoat suggest it is Fantomex. Both characters were a part of Logan’s previous X-Force squad. \nThe rest of the silhouette is much hard to make out as characters, and possibly a vehicle, seem to be overlapping, but we’re forced to make a guess, we’d say Wolverine (X-23), Psylocke and Marrow are likely contenders. \nCheck out the full image along with all of the other ResurrXion reveals in the gallery below. \nMore X-Men:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:17:38.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
