A team of Mega Man devotees has taken the gameplay we’re all familiar with and added a whole new dimension to it (pun most definitely intended). Though we’ve all seen countless fan-made versions of old-school games over the years, it’s safe to say that this project is one of the more unique ones out there.\nFor the past eight years, a team of developers led by creator Peter Sjostrand has worked hard on creating a greatest hits-type Mega Man game. What makes it stand out is that it is presented in 2.5D. This isn’t the type of 2.5D that you usually see in other games, however. Instead of using 3D polygons and locking them into a two-dimensional point of view, the 2.5D in this game is more like that of Paper Mario . It can appear a bit odd at first, but it all works beautifully. You can see for yourself in the trailer below.\nOn top of having a unique perspective that also affects gameplay, Mega Man 2.5D has a co-op mode. Here, one player controls Mega Man while the other plays as the (arguably cooler and more bad-ass) Proto Man. The two characters have to work together to solve the game’s puzzles. Mega Man titles are known for being solo affairs, so having the ability to play with a friend is certainly welcome.\nIf you want to try out Mega Man 2.5D for yourself, you can scoot on over to this page and grab it.
