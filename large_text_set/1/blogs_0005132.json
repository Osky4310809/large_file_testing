The financial conglomerate has also increased adoption leave benefits for female employees to 12 weeks, three times what they previously got. \nTwenty-six days of maternity leave will be given to women for the first two children, said Kalpana Ajayan, head of strategic human resources. For more than two children, the leave duration will be 12 weeks. For adoption, 12 weeks of maternity leave will be granted if the child is below the age of three months. Those who use surrogates to bear a child will also get the same benefits as in adoption. \nEdelweiss has introduced a programme - Women Empowered - to ensure that more women come up the pyramid and not really fall out. It aims to increase the share of women in its total headcount to 30% over five years from the current 19%. \nAmong other benefits, the company will provide 5,000 per month of maternity leave allowance during pregnancy in Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad and 3,500 in other cities. \nEdelweiss had 13% woman staff across levels four years ago from where it has increased the representation to 19%. At the senior management level, women hold 10% of the positions, which the company aims to increase to 20% in five years. The company's headcount is more than 6,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T08:33:54.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
