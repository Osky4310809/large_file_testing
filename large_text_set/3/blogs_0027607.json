Jordi Alba passed through Elazar Dasa's legs to Silva, who drilled a left-footed effort under goalkeeper Ofir Marciano. \nSpain allowed the tempo to drop and they were almost punished for that just before the break, as De Gea brilliantly kept out Refaelov's header to spare the hosts. \nThat proved to be the wake-up call Spain needed and on the stroke of half-time they doubled their lead. \nThiago fed Vitolo into the right side of the area and his shot squirmed under the right hand of Marciano before trickling over the line. \nCosta missed a glorious chance to give Spain a three-goal lead just after the restart, heading Dani Carvajal's pinpoint cross wide despite being unchallenged. \nBut he made no mistake in the 51st minute, nodding Thiago's corner in from close range. \nA fluid move almost brought another goal just before the hour mark, but Silva slammed an emphatic half-volley on to the upright after Costa cleverly knocked down a Carvajal cross into his path. \nIsrael pulled one back through Refaelov's powerful strike 14 minutes from the end, but it was nothing more than a consolation as Isco - a second-half substitute for Andres Iniesta - finished them off on the break right at the end, coolly finding the bottom-left corner from just inside the area.
