This law is collapsing while we speak. We have to step in before things gets worse. This is nothing short of a rescue mission,” Ryan added. . @SpeakerRyan on #Obamacare : This experiment has failed, this law is collapsing while we speak.

Cut benefits, cut investments and hospitals that care for our people, cut jobs. It’s with no positive upside to it,” Pelosi said on Friday. ‘We are not going to identify ourselves with cut and run, cutting benefits, cutting of those covered and cutting the savings that we have there.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:01:42.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
