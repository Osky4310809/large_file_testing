While unicorn food has thus far consisted mostly of sweets, one food blogger is changing the game with unicorn noodles .\nBored with normal white/tan noodles? A.J. of The Indigo Kitchen‚Äôs ‚Äú Quick and Simple Unicorn Noodles ‚Äù is sure to mix things up. Rather than using food dye or colorful sprinkles , unicorn noodles are made by cooking clear or white noodles with purple cabbage and adding lemon or lime juice. The cabbage turns the noodles a pretty blue hue and adding citrus sporadically turns some noodles a pretty pink.\nThe recipe is surprisingly easy, and the multicolored noodles make otherwise ordinary meals looks magical. There‚Äôs really no good reason to not try this at home.\nThis is by far one of my favorite rainbowls, a spicy Satay sauce, sweet and spicy shrooms, soft and tender baby kale, unicorn noodles, pickled jalape√±os and veggies. : You can find a recipe for the sauce and noodles on my blog (link in profile). : So today I planted my first seeds (nasturtium & pansies) and there are many more to follow, I also found some fun varieties of basil, didn't know there where so many . What are some of your favorite flowers and/or herbs to use in the kitchen? And let me know if you'd want me to share my \"gardening adventures\" on the blog. : Have a blessed day everyone, let food be thy medicine. : One Love \nA post shared by A.J. (@theindigokitchen) on Mar 16, 2017 at 9:53am PDT \nThe Indigo Kitchen‚Äôs Instagram highlights multiple meals made from unicorn noodles (and lots of other delicious-looking plates), and they all look way healthier than most unicorn-themed foods . Thanks to A.J., eating rainbow-colored food doesn‚Äôt have to be reserved for dessert, but can be enjoyed at every meal.\nIt doesn‚Äôt stop at noodles, either. A.J.‚Äôs Instagram also features rainbow rice and rainbow rolls. Whether you want to call them unicorn, rainbow, or simply pink and blue, these fun foods look amazing.\nHappy Monday friends, let's make this week unforgettable ‚ú®. I'll post the recipe for these \"unicorn\" rolls somewhere this week. What makes these rolls so much fun is that they're never the same. Every time you'll make them they'll have a different shade of awesome. Now let's talk eczema! I'm trying to be more mindful of the things I eat and how they effect my body by slowly removing them from my diet. I'll do this in steps of two weeks and will be sharing little updates to let you all know how it'll effect my body. Hopefully I'll find a way to get rid of this eczema without any extreme measurements. It's been two weeks of zero alcohol so tomorrow I'll be also giving up on gluten, which is another common trigger in eczema. Besides removing certain foods I'll also look into holistic remedies to aid this healing journey. I hope in me sharing this journey I can help others. Besides updates think of delicious gluten free recipes to make this process a little easier. But for now let's just have some maki. Oh and tonight I may or may not be having all the gluten. I'm going out with a bang ü§∑ ‚ôÇÔ∏è One Love \nA post shared by A.J.
