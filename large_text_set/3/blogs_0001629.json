2017 the bentley bentayga mulliner is the most luxurious SUV \n\nbentley’s in-house personal commissioning division, mulliner, has applied its exquisite craftsmanship to the ‘bentayga’ SUV , creating a new flagship model and setting new standards in automotive luxury. new interior and exterior features – including optional duo tone paintwork, unique 22″ wheels, mulliner bottle cooler and a new veneer concept – complement the ‘bentayga’s’ elegant, sculptural design. \nall images © bentley motors \n\n\nthe bentley bentayga ‘mulliner’ is the most exquisitely appointed luxury SUV created, and will appeal to owners searching for the peak of go-anywhere motoring, with fine performance and comfort. this model introduces striking optional duo tone paintwork for the first time on ‘bentayga’–the elegant finish is achieved by choosing the perfect proportional balance point for the split, the resulting effect making the cabin and bonnet appear as though floating. the split also serves to enhance the luxury SUV’s trademark super-formed muscularity and accentuates its powerful presence. new mulliner 22″ ‘paragon’ seven-spoke wheels with floating wheel centres, unique exterior badge, and color-coded lower bodywork with bright-chrome lower-bumper-grilles, complete the exterior enhancements. \n\n\nthe ‘bentayga’ is the world’s fastest SUV: featuring the british automaker’s 6.0 litre ‘W12′ engine, the ‘bentayga’ mulliner combines efficiency and refinement with ultra-luxurious levels of power and torque. with 608 ps (600 horsepower) and 900 Nm of torque (663 lb. ft.), this luxury SUV shifts from 0 – 60 mph in just 4.0 seconds (0-100 km/h in 4.1 seconds), hitting its top speed at 187 mph (301 km/h). \n\n\n\nstepping inside the exquisite cabin, mulliner has combined traditional and modern coachbuilding design . a new interior color split – with the front and rear seats finished in different hide colors and offered in seven suggested color ways – complements the optional duo tone exterior paintwork. the hand-stitched hides are finishedwith unique mulliner embroidery and contrast stitching. bespoke features by mulliner include a new mulliner bottle cooler in the rear of the cabin, with an illuminated chilling cabinet and bespoke cumbria crystal flutes, all seamlessly integrated into the generously proportioned, rear centre console. ombré burr walnut veneer is also introduced to the bentayga ‘mulliner’ model, showcasing a unique wood transition from black through to burr walnut as the veneer wraps around the interior and a special veneered panel replaces the standard central console fascia. \n\n\nthe naim for bentley audio system features twenty high-quality speakers driven by a 1,950-watt, 21-channel amplifier. a convenient, remote-controlled parking heater function allows the vehicle interior to be heated or cooled when the engine is switched off, while electric rear window blinds and a double sun-visor are also availabl. the ‘touring’ and ‘city’ specifications enhance the comprehensive suite of standard driver assistance features, including park assist, lane assist, adaptive cruise control, traffic assist, night vision and a head-up display. the flagship ‘bentayga’ is also available with an optional linley hamper by mulliner, complete with refrigerator, bespoke fine linley china cutlery, crockery and crystal glass, and storage area for dry goods. for comfort in the great outdoors, sections can be removed and used as seats. martin hislop I designboom", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled":
