It is the largest fine the commission has ever imposed on a party. Here is our story.\nConservatives fined £70,000 for campaign spending failures Read more \nAlthough the Conservative party has said it accepts the decision, the announcement coincides with the news that separate police investigations into allegations that the Tories broke local spending limits at the general election in up to 20 seats have resulted in files being passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. \nOn the Today programme this morning the Conservative MP Roger Gale claimed that Electoral Commission’s announcement could prejudice future prosecutions. He said:\n\nWhat I do find astonishing is the timing of this. Because of course we know that a number of cases have been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service and it seems to me that what the Electoral Commission has blundered into is a decision which could well prejudice decisions taken either way.\nI will be covering more reaction to this story as the day goes on.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n9.30am: Annual poverty figures are published by the department for work and pensions.\n9.45am: Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman and former deputy prime minister, gives a briefing on his latest Brexit paper.\n12pm: Nicola Sturgeon takes first minister’s questions in the Scottish parliament.\n12.30pm: Pascal Lamy, the former WTO director, gives a speech on Brexit and trade at the Institute for Government.\nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.\nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time.
