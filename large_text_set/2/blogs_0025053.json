A year prior, Truehl was caught in a stretch of unexpected weather during an outdoor Air Force training exercise. Instead of warm Colorado days, Truehl picked up frostbite on nearly 40 percent of his body after five days in the rain and 40 degree weather. \nTruehl had to leave the Air Force due to the incident, but continued to play hockey before transferring to Quinnipiac, where he is a member of the Bobcat’s three-goaltender rotation.\nIn 21 games played this year for Quinnipiac, Truehl has a .899 save percentage. Considering he gets hives if he doesn’t move about and protect himself from the cold, that’s not bad at all.
