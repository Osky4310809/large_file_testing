Gen. Keith Kellogg will replace Michael Flynn for now. (CARLO ALLEGRI/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Tuesday, February 14, 2017, 1:32 AM \nThe man slated to take over for ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was one of his right-hand men. \nRetired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg served as the National Security Council chief of staff under Flynn and was tasked with overhauling the Defense Department under President Trump's transition team. \nTrump announced Kellogg as Flynn's replacement on Monday night following a tumultuous weekend over his pre-inauguration talks with a Russian diplomat. \nThe President touted Kellogg as a 36-year veteran of the U.S. Army who served two tours during the Vietnam War. His post-military career involved bouncing from one defense contractor to another. Vice Admiral Robert Harward, center, has been floated as another replacement for Michael Flynn. (Bill Serne) \nHis name is most synonymous with his top role with the Coalition Provisional Authority's disastrous Iraq occupation after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. He served as the CPAâ€™s chief operating officer in charge of infrastructure, oil and aid. \nKellogg was often seen darting in and out of Trump Tower during the transition period after leaving his job at Cubic Corporation. He was the vice president of strategic initiatives at the San Diego-based company known for selling combat simulations to the Pentagon. \nThe technology firm reported an uptick in shares just last week and is expecting to bank on the Trump administration's plans to increase U.S. military funds, according to the San Diego Union Tribune. David Petraeus has two months left on his probation period for mishandling classified documents. (Miller Elisa) \nHe left the Pentagon in 2003 to join the Oracle Corp. as senior vice president of homeland security solutions for barely four months before the Iraq reconstruction called. \nYears later, he took over for former DARPA director Regina Dugan as the RedXDefense CEO in 2009, which produces bomb detectors. \nIt's unclear how long Kellogg is expected to serve in his new-founded capacity. Michael Flynn resigned on Monday night following a weekend of scrutiny over his calls to a Russian diplomat. (Tom Williams/AP) \nAlready the Trump administration is floating names to permanently replace Flynn, including Kellogg. The disgraced former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, David Petraeus, is another one of those suggestions, according to NBC News. \nPetraeus has about two months remaining on his two-year probation period for mishandling classified documents. He pleaded guilty in April 2015 after giving secret files to his former mistress and biographer. \nNBC reports that the White House is considering Vice Admiral Bob Harward as a front-runner, NBC reported. \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:57:43.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
