Shares \nAh, cricket. It is a sport much beloved by my compatriots here in Australia, but it rarely translates well into videogames. So it came as a surprise in 2014 when the first Don Bradman Cricket game released . It wasn't a masterpiece by any means, but it was a fun and serviceable cricket game – something that has not existed for a very long time. Remember, that in 2013 a cricket game released so bad that its publisher apologised and removed it from sale . \nInitially scheduled to release last year, Don Bradman Cricket 2017 has hit Steam overnight, and it comes with a bunch of features that weren't in the original. It reportedly boasts a \"deeper\" career mode, as well as a new \"reflex catching\" system, new ways to bat the ball, and more aggressive ways to bowl. \nThe official trailer is embedded below, and the Steam page is here .
