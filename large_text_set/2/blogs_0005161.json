Could Liverpool's agonizing 27-year wait for a 19th league title be about to end thanks to Klopp's tactical wizardry and infectious charisma? As an Arsenal fan, I always know the answer to this particular line of questions, but others foolishly saw it differently. \n\"From the teams we've played,\" said Watford boss Walter Mazzarri at the beginning of November, having already faced Arsenal, Chelsea and Man United, \"there's no doubt Liverpool is the team I'm most impressed with.\" \nCertainly, no one, least of all Klopp, could envision how drastically Liverpool's fortunes would turn as 2017 dawned. The Reds have won one of 10 games in all competitions since Jan. 2 and they needed two stumbling efforts to achieve that lone victory, eking out a 1-0 win over League Two side Plymouth Argyle in a third-round FA Cup replay. It's the team's worst start to a calendar year since the great relegation debacle of 1954 and Klopp has gone to great pains to keep smiling through the apocalypse. \n\"Even though at this moment it feels really bad, it's not the biggest problem in the world,\" he said after the limp 2-0 capitulation to Hull City, a relegation-battling side that Liverpool thumped 5-1 in September. \"There are solutions, 100 percent.\" \nIf the answers exist, he needs to pencil them in quickly with matches against Arsenal, Man City and Everton looming after Saturday's clash with Spurs. On the plus side, Liverpool tend to ratchet up their game against the top six -- they've dropped only eight points against their five closest rivals. \nIt's been the lower-ranked teams -- in addition to Hull, they've lost to Bournemouth, Swansea and Burnley in the league as well as Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup fourth round -- that have proved their downfall, which suggests that either: \n1. Klopp has instilled a level of mental toughness in his squad that can be best described as Arsene Wenger-esque. \n2. He believes his players are better than they really are, the same delusion that his Anfield predecessor, Brendan Rodgers, also fell victim to, albeit with one crucial difference: Rodgers had Luis Suarez to paper over all the cracks. \nNormally in these break-glass-in-case-of-emergency circumstances, the big clubs wave their chequebooks around Europe or South America during the transfer window in an attempt to find a quick, if expensive fix. But that is not a philosophy shared by Liverpool's risk-averse owners, Fenway Sports Group. If Klopp is to succeed in realising his paymaster's minimum ambition of securing a Champions League berth, he must do so with the players at his disposal, several of whom on their current form -- Simon Mignolet, Alberto Moreno, Emre Can and Daniel Sturridge come immediately to mind -- would be hard-pressed to play on either side of the Mersey. \nYou can make the case -- as have many of Klopp's critics -- that the Liverpool manager has gegenpressed his players into physical and mental exhaustion, and that his remorselessly intense style of chasing and harrying for 90 minutes is simply not sustainable in an attritional league like the Prem, where there's no winter break and opponents seldom pause for a breath. Jurgen Klopp turned around malaise at Mainz and Dortmund, but can he do it again at underperforming Liverpool? \nYet Mauricio Pochettino employs a similar full-throttle approach with a more consistently successful Spurs side. The difference is that the Argentinian has spent two and a half years building his team from the back, starting with a world-class keeper in Hugo Lloris and a rearguard second to none in the Premier League. With that kind of solid foundation, Spurs can push high up the field to press their opponents and not have to worry that the players behind them will suddenly suffer a nervous breakdown should the other team hit them on the counter. \nIt is almost inconceivable that neither Klopp nor Rodgers successfully closed the long-running circus show that passes for Liverpool's goalkeeping. Not since Pepe Reina, the team's No. 1 for eight years, left Anfield in 2013 has a Reds keeper been anything above the level of mildly useless. Klopp's attempt to rectify the situation involved bringing in the promising young German keeper Loris Karius to replace the howler-prone Mignolet, before the manager lost faith in his compatriot and went back to the Belgian's flapping talents. \nThe result is that no other top team in the Prem has surrendered more points due to the slapstick displays of the men between the posts, and this is a league that counts Claudio Bravo among its starting keepers. \nSurely, Dortmund's former favourite son will cajole Liverpool's reluctant-to-splurge owners to invest in an elite keeper over the summer -- Joe Hart, please pick up the white courtesy phone -- but by then they are liable to find themselves outside Europe once more. That would be a cruel blow to Klopp, who has never shirked responsibility for his team's underachieving season, a rare and admirable trait in a Premier League manager. (See Wenger, Pep Guardiola and all post-Sir Alex Ferguson Man United bosses.) \n\"What I think is very important is to never blame anybody else for your own mistakes,\" Klopp said last week. \"We don't look for excuses.\" \nWhat they are looking for is someone who can supply a cutting edge to an attack that appears to have lost its thrilling early-season mojo. Liverpool's over-reliance on their leading scorer Sadio Mane (nine goals, four assists) was painfully evident when the Senagalese striker sped off to the African Nations Cup. The thought that Roberto Firmino, Adam Lallana, Divock Origi and Sturridge would step up in his absence proved the maxim, \"hope is not a strategy\". \nWithout Mane's pace and audacity in the final third, Liverpool scored just five goals in seven games in all competitions and managed only one win -- against third-tier Plymouth Argyle. \nAnd yet Klopp has been here before with Mainz and Dortmund, who despite their ballyhooed successes both struggled badly at times during his tenure. It is a testament to his unshakeable self-belief and irresistible magnetism that I'm betting on him to restore Liverpool's swagger and win back those back-pass-protesting doom merchants who fail to realise how lucky they are to have such a refreshing and determined character in charge. \nIt may qualify as wishful thinking on my part -- it's Tottenham, after all -- but come Saturday I fully expect to see Klopp execute some glorious scissor kicks on the touchline. \nDavid Hirshey is an ESPN FC columnist.
