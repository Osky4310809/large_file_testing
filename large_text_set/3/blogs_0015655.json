Donald Trump signs executive order giving police more authority \n“There is a viewpoint that somehow law enforcement is never wrong and the government will want to invest more power in police to protect them and the community,” said Reverend Graylan Hagler, a senior pastor at Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ in Washington DC, who has held community meetings about police violence and racial tensions. \n“This means that police patrol a community and they have no relationship with that community whatsoever and they see the people as the enemy.” \nThe narrative of “Blue Lives Matter”, a counter movement to the Black Lives Matter protests, gained traction throughout the 2016 election campaign, although far fewer law enforcement officers were killed on the job in 2016 compared to the number of people they killed whilst on duty. \nGraphiq \n\nThe only time Mr Trump criticised law enforcement was when officer Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, after his car broke down. \n“I don’t know what she was thinking, and I’m very troubled by that,” he told a group of African American churchgoers in Ohio, shortly before the election. \n“We’ve had others [law enforcement killings],” he added. “And the police are aware of that, too.” Black Lives Matter organizes march to Trump tower Black Lives Matter organizes march to Trump tower 1/15 \nKandy Freeman participates in a Black Lives Matter protest in front of Trump Tower in New York City, U.S. January 14, 2017.

Kevin Hagen/Getty \nA report from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund found that 64 officers were fatally shot while on the job in 2016, including 21 who were killed in an ambush-style attack. \nThere is also very little, if any, de-escalation training, as admitted during the trial of Michael Slager, the former officer who shot unarmed black man Walter Scott multiple times in the back as he ran away. \nUnder the Trump administration, there is no federal oversight. The new Justice Department has given no sign that it would continue to investigate \"patterns of excessive force\" as was found to be the case in Chicago . \nVideo shows Walter Scott suspect appearing to use Taser on black man \nReverend Hagler told The Independent that there was no impetus on the part of the Trump administration to empathise with people of colour that are disproportionately impacted by police aggression.
