Owners David Tobias and Eric Adolfsen are opening The Wooly Public at 9 Barclay St., adjacent to the coffee shop The Wooly Daily , and the still-exclusive Wooly Private . All three spaces sit inside the neo-Gothic National Historic Landmark, the Woolworth building from the 1910s. The Times has called it, “one of the finest skyscraper interiors in New York and one of the most significant nationwide.” At the bar, Death & Co. and Mayahuel vet Eryn Reece offers New Editions and Old Soul cocktails for around $15. They include nods to lesser-known classics like Harry Craddock’s Wardays (gin, yellow chartreuse, Busnel Calvados) founded at London’s Savoy Hotel in the 30s. Grid View Tuna poke with avocado, grapefruit, cucumber, and yuzu. Alongside Reece’s cocktails, Maison Premiere vet, Jeff Srole is serving all-day dishes like confit chicken with charred broccoli, a fish sandwich, and a dish known as Peking Duck Tots — pulled duck and house queso served on tater tots. Srole will also rotate dishes inspired by the building’s original 1913 restaurant menu: such as crispy frogs legs with tartar. Since 2009, The Wooly has been a popular spot for private events and parties. Its owners closed the space when it was only months-old for a revamp in 2010, and mentioned that a restaurant was not out of the question . As of tomorrow, The Wooly Public will officially be open for lunch and dinner every day except Sunday. If you happen to stop by, do let us know what you think . 9 Barclay St. , New York, New York 10279 212-571-2930.
