On January 11, TMZ shared photos of the two singers locking lips next to a dumpster outside Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica. Selena Gomez and The Weeknd Making Out (PHOTO GALLERY) https://t.co/v848LeJwKt pic.twitter.com/AMtIZE47EC \n— NEWS CLEVER MEDIA (@HOTCELEBINSIDER) January 11, 2017 \nImmediately after, Bella Hadid unfollowed Selena Gomez on Instagram . But now, there is new information about how the model really feels about her ex’s new fling. \nAccording to TMZ, a source says Bella Hadid feels “betrayed” by Selena Gomez . The insider clarifies Bella was the one who actually broke things off with The Weeknd two months ago, but only because it was too difficult to maintain a long distance relationship. \nHowever, TMZ says the “Hands To Myself” singer and the “Starboy” spent the holidays together. Yeah, they’ve apparently been dating for two months… aka right after things ended with Bella.

I guess that’s not the case anymore! \nThe source explained the root of the issue to TMZ. The insider said, \nGiving Bella and Gigi a heads up would have been the respectful and honorable thing to do… but I guess that’s just Hollywood. \nIt’s not too surprising The Weeknd and Selena Gomez are hooking up when you look at all the ways they are connected . \nTaylor Swift and Justin Bieber and Drake and Selena Gomez and The Weeknd and the Hadid sisters all have had beef with each other at some point. It’s just one huge celebrity web of drama and Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are right in the middle of it.

Why Selena Gomez Getting With The Weeknd Is So Awkward To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nIn the end, I just feel bad for Bella. If I found out my ex was making out with Selena Gomez, I’d be pretty pissed as well. \nThe girl is hot, talented and makes great music. I’m also a walking piece of trash. \nHang in there, Bella. I’m here for you. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
