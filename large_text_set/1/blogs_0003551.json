I could hear screaming and murmuring. \n“I opened the window, put on my glasses and I could see a dog lying on the pavement and saw two figures on the ground. \n“It was one of the worst things I have ever heard or seen and I called the police and they said they would come out. \n“The man then carried the woman off on his shoulder and they went off with the dog up towards Hipswell Highway and stopped to talk on the corner and the police came. \n“Who does that in someone’s front garden? And who brings a dog? I have never seen that dog being walked in the area, so I don’t know where they live. \n“I can’t exaggerate enough the noises she was making. \n“We were really worried and we were really upset on Christmas Day. Do we sell the house, do we move? We don’t want to live in an area like that. \n“The woman whose garden it happened in was away. She’s an old lady and it’s not very nice.” The public antics ruined residents' Christmas (file photo) (Photo: Getty) \nShe added: “The police told us it was two people of Polish descent drunk on vodka and they were just having a domestic. They weren’t, they were having sex on the street and there is nothing being done about it. \n“It was 6am on Christmas morning and most people were asleep, but there are kids on the street.” \nA spokesman for West Midlands Police said that they had spoken to the couple, but no further action was planned. \nThey said: “There’s nothing in the log to say anything sexual was going on. The person who reported it did say they heard noises of a woman in distress.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:21:48.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
