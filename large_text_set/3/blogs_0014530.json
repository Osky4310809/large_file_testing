It had also sought a direction to the regulator to produce all the records related to its decision. \nThe appeal also sought to restrain Jio from providing its consumers the zero tariff plan and promotional plans. \nJio had launched the inaugural free voice and data plan in September last year, and in December, extended the freebies till March 31, 2017. \nFollowing this, the existing players such as Airtel and Idea moved the telecom tribunal against TRAI for letting the new operator continue the free promotional offer beyond the stipulated 90 days. \nThe operators criticised the regulator for being a “mute spectator” to the alleged violations. \nOn January 31, TRAI had held that Jio’s free voice calling and data plan were not violation of the regulatory guidelines. \nTRAI had further said its examination had revealed that the ‘Happy New Year Offer’ launched by Jio on December 4, 2016, is distinct from its earlier Jio Welcome Offer and could not be treated as an extension of the promotional offer as the benefits under both differed. \nRecently, Jio announced that it will start charging for its mobile services from April 1. \nLast month, Jio said its existing subscribers and new customers who come on board by March 31 can continue to enjoy unlimited benefits of its Happy New Year Offer for one more year (till March 31, 2018) by paying a one-time fee of Rs 99 and thereafter Rs 303 a month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T12:34:01.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
