The French forward had showdown talks with Jose Mourinho a fortnight and the manager has been disappointed with his response to this chat. His attitude hasn’t improved and that’s why he’s been left on the bench for United’s last two games. Marcus Rashford has been preferred on the left and it looks like the 19-year-old will start against Watford today as well. \nWhile he was one of United’s best players last season, Martial fell down the pecking order after Louis van Gaal was sacked. He had to vacate his shirt number for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Martial has scored just six goals this season. Moving on up \nUnited have the chance to finally climb the league table after weeks of being stuck in sixth place. They can move ahead of Liverpool, who play later in the day, and depending on the early result, potentially Arsenal too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T17:21:21.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
