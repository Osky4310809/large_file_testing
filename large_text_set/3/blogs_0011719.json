First, he posted a photo of him posing at the Roc Nation office captioned \"#Roc4Life.\" Then He then posted a photo of him throwing the Roc-a-Fella diamond with Hov's arm draped over his shoulder. â€œ2017 should be a Great year!!\" he wrote in the caption. \nFreeway was a key member of Jay Z 's Roc-a-Fella outfit in the early '00s. He would be the first Roc-a-Fella artist to reunited with Hov at Roc Nation. The Roc has been stockpiling veteran emcees as of late. In the past three months, the label has announced deals with The L.O.X., Yo Gotti , Fat Joe , and Jim Jones .
