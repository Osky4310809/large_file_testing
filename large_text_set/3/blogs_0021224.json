(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post) Jocks don’t have to be dumb, but according to former NFL player Myron Rolle, the league sure prefers them that way.\n“Their sentiment was, ‘You play very well, but there’s other guys who will run through a wall for this, they need this,’” Rolle, who’s readying to enter his neurosurgeon residency at Massachusetts General, told the Post’s Rick Maese . “‘We’re not worried about you — you could go be President of the United States. But they need this.’ I was like, how could you take this from me? They tell you all your life: be a student athlete, focus on your grades. So I do that, and because it gets attention, it becomes an issue?”\n[ ‘With neurosurgery, every day feels like a football game’ for Myron Rolle ]\nRolle said his book smarts were never an issue while an undergraduate at Florida State. But after completing his bachelor’s degree in 2½ years and leaving the Seminoles to spend a year at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, Rolle learned his academic curiosity might be a hindrance in the NFL.\nPer Maese: “He recalled interviewing with teams that asked whether he felt like he abandoned his college teammates by leaving a year early for Oxford.”\nRolle has no definitive proof of the NFL’s bias toward less academically inclined players, but he is “absolutely” and “unequivocally” convinced his brain lowered his stock in the 2010 draft, when he was projected to be a second-round pick, but didn’t hear his name called until the sixth round.\nMore evidence, he believes, is what happened afterward. He never appeared in a regular-season game. Instead, he ended up on the Tennessee Titans’ practice squads, before being cut and shuffled to the Pittsburgh Steelers, who also ultimately decided to pass on him.\nAt that point, Rolle decided to take his talents back to medicine, where he’s hoping to study concussions, which not coincidentally is a huge issue in football.\n“With neurosurgery, every day feels like a football game,” he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@marissapayne"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:45:14.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
