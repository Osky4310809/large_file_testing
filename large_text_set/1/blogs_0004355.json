These weapons are massive coil guns that are used to accelerate projectiles ranging in mass from 600 tons in the case of smaller warships, and 3,000 tons in the case of Super MAC platforms, to extremely high velocities. \nAlmost all UNSC warships are equipped with Archer Missile pods for ship-to-ship engagements, which prove mostly effective against unshielded targets. UNSC ships in 2525 carried Fusion rockets as an offensive weapon but they seem to have been removed or replaced over the course of the war. UNSC ships may also carry Shiva -class Nuclear Missiles . In addition, the UNSC mounts 50mm auto-cannons on its ships for defense against enemy fighters and boarding craft, controlled by shipboard AIs . However, these auto cannons can be used against Covenant capital ships if the two ships are close enough, as displayed by UNSC Savannah during Operation: UPPER CUT . UNSC Home Fleet above Earth. \nUNSC warships also carry significant Marine detachments for internal security, boarding actions, and planetary assault, and carry all the equipment and materiel needed by Marine forces. It is implied that a significant portion of the interior of UNSC warships are devoted to this purpose, as there are armories and barracks that hold these supplies. \nShips of the UNSC navy also carry a number of GA-TL1 Longsword -class Interceptor . These are armed with 110mm Rotary cannons and ASGM-10 Missiles , and sometimes a Moray space mine system or even a single Shiva -class Nuclear Missile . They can also be remotely-operated and used to carry a remotely-detonated Shiva missile, which, when detonated, effectively destroys both the Longsword and its selected target. \nDespite all of this firepower, however, UNSC warships have great difficulty defeating Covenant ships even with a numerical advantage. It typically takes multiple hits from a ship-based MAC weapon to disable a Covenant ship's shields, although larger, ODP-based Super MACs can fire a round that can literally shatter Covenant capital ships. [10] Archer missiles must be used in tremendous amounts to breach Covenant shield systems. Even with their shields down, Covenant ships have been noted to remain operational after multiple direct hits from normal MAC rounds. This advantage in firepower and shielding gives the Covenant an effective 3:1 ratio and better against UNSC ships in combat. Equipment \nRespirator packs are worn by UNSC Navy personnel when an atmosphere is not present, and provides an auxiliary supply of Oxygen for the wearer.
