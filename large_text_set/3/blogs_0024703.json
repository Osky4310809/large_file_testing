An exhibition of his work, Portraits of Nature: Myriads of Gods , is at Sway Gallery, London, to 28 March. All photos: Nobuyuki Kobayashi Mizoregawa Kobayashi was born in Japan in 1970. After starting his career in photography, he travelled to the US, where he learned the platinum printing technique Kodou Platinum prints allow for deep dark tones and create a beautiful matte finish Yuuzen Kobayashi’s work is inspired in part by the Shinto belief that everything in nature contains a god. ‘There are moments that I feel perhaps there is a god here, especially when I am looking at nature,’ he says . ‘I feel as if I am taking portraits of gods’ Zen ‘I just keep walking around until I can find a place that incites my emotions,’ says Kobayashi. ‘I feel as though I am not the one who finds places to shoot but am led there by places’ Shin ‘Strength, beauty and nobleness: all characteristics reveal themselves to me’ Souzou Kobayashi prints on Hosokawa paper, a product that has been made in the same way since 1642. He says he uses this paper to add a ‘Japanese identity’ to his work Mugen He leaves the paper to dry for three to five years after he acquires it. Only then is it ready to be printed on Kyouzon Kobayashi says his respectful and patient techniques mean that ‘if there is a god there, he may feel, “I don’t mind being photographed by this guy”’ Syouucyuu 2 Kobayashi will host a Q&A and walk-through of his work at the Sway Gallery, London, on 24 March, 6-8pm Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T09:22:33.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
