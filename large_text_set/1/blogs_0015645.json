Though she says it took a bit of coaxing from her co-worker, the multilingual 24-year-old New Jersey resident entered and won the Face of Torrid 2017 contest, joining the ranks of 2016 winner and Torrid model Lyanna Lynette . After a long, personal struggle with weight, self-love and respect, Gimena says being the Face of Torrid has given her a body-positive platform. As a kid taking dance and swimming lessons, “I was confident enough in my performance that I ignored the bullies and didn’t focus on the way I looked,” the health center office administrator, who was born in Uruguay, says. But in middle school, that changed. “I began comparing myself to others and sadly the bullying got to me,” she says. “One of my classmates I had a crush on came up and told me I had such a pretty face but my body did not match it… That day I promised myself to work hard to obtain what I wanted and to not let other people’s perception of what I should be or do define me. Today, I stand proud in my body and skin, stretch marks and all!” \nSo who will inspire Gimena professionally as she stars in seasonal campaigns and appears across social media channels? None other than ANTM judge and Sports Illustrated cover girl Ashley Graham , who Gimena says “is proof that loving yourself is the greatest power of them all.” \nCheck out some of Maria’s favorite items below, perfect for day or night : Courtesy Torrid “I absolutely love halter tops, I find them so sultry!” Gimena shares.
