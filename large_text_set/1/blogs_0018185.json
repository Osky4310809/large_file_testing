According to the march’s mission statement, participants aim to “send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world, that women’s rights are human rights.” Six hundred similar marches are being held Saturday around the country. Others have been organized around the world.\nIn Washington, a morning rally will be held at 10 a.m. ET, and the march will begin at 1:15 p.m. ET. We’ll bring you the latest updates from the nation’s capital as the day goes on.\nRead On » \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T16:22:00.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
