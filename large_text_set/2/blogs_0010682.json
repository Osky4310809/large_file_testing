Google Chrome seemed to be the worst offender. Dr Cleaner made it (almost) like a new ‘pute. My MacBook now boots up quickly, loads software quickly, and runs very well. While a long ‘net surfing session still will eventually slow my MacBook down to a crawl, Dr. Cleaner provides a neat little feature — an icon on the tray — which constantly displays the % of operational capacity. When it gets near 90%, I know I have to close some browser windows. Dr. Cleaner then AUTOMATICALLY optimizes that memory space and my computer speeds right up. I love this software and, especially for free, I strongly recommend it. Seems to only get better by Zoeys dad I’ve been a user of this app for some time now and aside from a minor backstep a few updates ago, Dr. Cleaner only seems to get better. I can quickly optimize my system while working with large files in creative suite apps to keep everything moving smoothly. The newest update allowing to quickly scan for burdensome files and quickly delete is a nice feature. I did notice that some of the funcitonality buttons seemed moved around and certain less used features axed, so it might take a bit of reaquainting to get completely familiar to all of it’s full potential. Keep improving and I’ll keep using it. Free? Not quite. by False Neutron I saw a post advertising this app, so I had to check it out. Reading the comments before download, I was getting a bit bummed out with how some of the older customers feel about the recent updates. I still figured I’d give it a shot. It’s not the worst mac cleaner, but there's definitely some red flags when a feature advertised in the description is not accessible, or even worse when the feature is there, but.. WAIT, you need to buy the full version to use this. Read some more reviews; it’s not terrible but not something I necessarily support. Could use some work before I try it out again.
