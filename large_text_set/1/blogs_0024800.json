Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA teacher was unfairly dismissed by the school she had worked in for 23 years after she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. \nNicola Sinclair, 50, has told how the loss of her job led to her losing her home, her marriage, and her health. \nShe now lives on benefits in a caravan, but was awarded £346,175 by an employment tribunal in Cardiff on Friday, reports Wales Online. \nThe tribunal had already ruled in April last year that she was forced to resign by Bishop of Llandaff Church in Wales High School, which amounted to constructive dismissal.

That was outrageous behaviour. \n“She should have been treated with kid gloves. Instead she was treated with an iron fist.” \nKerry Gardiner, barrister for the school, told the hearing Ms Sinclair’s health was deteriorating before issues at work arose. \n“It’s clear the respondent’s treatment is not on its own what caused her ill health,” she said. Bishop of Llandaff school \nThree months after losing her job Ms Sinclair, who had coached the school debating team to national success, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and was hospitalised with what was then diagnosed as bipolar disorder. \nThe teacher had had two periods of several months of absence after suffering mental health problems in 2012 and 2014. She returned to work both times, the last time in July 2014 when she came back in an altered role. \nWhen Mr Belli arrived as new head teacher in September 2014 Ms Sinclair was told that after complaints from parents and pupils she would be subject to formal lesson observation. \nShe signed a resignation letter and a legally unenforceable settlement agreement in January 2015, the court ruling from last year shows. \nIn the months that followed she had temporary jobs before being hospitalised in April 2015 with bipolar disorder. \nComing out of hospital in July she said the strain of losing her job led her to leave her husband of 20 years and the Victorian terraced house they shared in Cardiff. School head Marc Belli \nShe moved into a flat with rent paid by the council but when the council refused to continue paying rent she became homeless and stayed with friends, living on benefits. \nIt was only when her legal team requested an advance on her award for unfair dismissal that she was able to buy a holiday caravan for £14,000. As it is on a holiday park she can only live in it 10 months of the year and is now ‘sofa surfing’ with friends until February, she said after the hearing. \nAwarding Ms Sinclair a total of £346,175 tribunal judge Sian Davies said: “The purpose of performance management is to improve performance. We must consider what would have happened if a supportive programme had been put in place. \n“It seems that had performance management been dealt with support and sensitivity the claimant may well have been able to sustain a long career with performance at an adequate. \n“An adequate level may not have been at previous level but necessary to discharge duties.” Nicola Sinclair was awarded the cash (Photo: Richard Swingler) \nAfter the hearing Ms Sinclair said: “I am reliant on friends. I am just living out of suitcases. \n\"The caravan is ideal because it is cheap. I have learned to adjust. \n“My friends have been incredibly supportive but I do feel a loss of status. What sustained me is the people telling me I was respected as teacher. \n“I am very satisfied with the result.” \nFflur Jones, head of employment law at Darwin Gray, which represented Ms Sinclair, said:“As the Employment Tribunal’s judgement stated, Ms Sinclair had been a ‘high performer’ but her employer’s practices caused her to suffer discrimination due to her disability and failed to make reasonable adjustments to assist her to continue to perform in her role despite her disability.” \nThe school’s chairman of governors Reverend Canon Mark Preece said: “As the employer, the governing body wishes Ms Sinclair all the best for the future following the conclusion of this long-running process.” \nHer award covered loss of earnings, notice pay, future loss of earnings, injury to feelings, personal injury, pension loss and a basic award.
