The Calphalon knife recall comes after several reports of injuries caused by broken blades.\nThe recalled knives include the Calphalon Contemporary Cutlery and Calphalon Contemporary SharpIN Cutlery lines and were sold individually and in sets. Recalled items were sold between August 2008 and December 2016 at J.C. Penney, Kohl's, Macy's and other stores in the United States and Canada and online via Amazon.\nThe reported injuries occurred when knife blades broke away from their handles, causing lacerations to users' hands and fingers, some of which required stitches.\nTo determine if a knife is included in the recall, Calphalon is instructing consumers to locate the date code embossed at the base of the knife blade ( click here to see an example ). Knives marked chronologically from \" 0860916 \" to \" 0865216 \" and knives marked with date codes ending in “ 7 ” are not affected by this recall. If your knife is marked with any other number—or if you cannot locate a date code—it is included, and you should stop using the knife immediately.\nRelated", "external_links": ["http://www.calphalon.com/en-US/recall", "http://image.email.calphalon.com/lib/fe8f137275660d797d/m/1/Calphalon-Contemp-R2.pdf"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:18:46.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
