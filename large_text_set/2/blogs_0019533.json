Unless you’ve got a yen to discuss “Lion,” let’s move on to the acting categories. Is there anybody you’re really dying to see win? Who’d give the craziest acceptance speech? Frank: If Meryl Streep somehow won best actress, which she won’t, we’d get something juicy and political, because she’s deep into her juicy and political phase now, though I suspect she’d leave football out of it this time around. I’d love to see a win by Isabelle Huppert for “Elle,” a movie that I found mesmerizing in part because its feminist politics, for lack of a better phrase, were so impossible to parse. I’ll tell you this: If you made that exact same script with that exact same director but set it in San Francisco and put Sharon Stone in the lead, women would be picketing it. You buy yourself a lot of wiggle room with a French accent, subtitles, a Parisian locale, the Seine, a few baguettes and Huppert. \nAdvertisement Gail: Too bad we’re not still doing the political comparisons, since “Elle” calls to mind the adjectives “dark and twisted.” Photo Mel Gibson, center, and actor Vince Vaughn on the set of the film “Hacksaw Ridge.” Credit Summit, via Associated Press I’m rooting for Mahershala Ali to win best supporting actor for “Moonlight.” Frank: I find the supporting categories more exciting this year than the lead ones, which have nominees I seriously question: Ryan Gosling in “La La Land,” Ruth Negga in “Loving,” Streep in “Florence Foster Jenkins.” Streep is the best of those three, but she’s had so many nominations at this point that when she’s anything short of transcendent, the nod seems obligatory, compulsory, predictable — like a Trump brag about his Electoral College haul whenever he utters more than 10 sentences in public. Gail: Sometimes you have supporting nominees who actually seemed to be the lead in the movie — thinking here of Dev Patel, the star of “Lion,” no matter what the list-makers say. He can be our stand-in for Mike Pence, who I suspect is going to wind up as the real chief executive while Trump just … roars. And then there are the ones who make brief, spectacular appearances, like Michelle Williams in “Manchester.” But Ali was very low-key as the fatherly drug dealer. And he wasn’t onscreen long, yet he made a huge impact — really set the tone for the whole film. Frank: The supporting actress category marks the first time three of the five nominees in an acting category are black. It also happens to be, in my view, the strongest field of the four acting categories. In any other year, Williams — spectacular indeed — would win. But this year Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”) and Viola Davis (“Fences”) are up, too, and they’re spectacular. Gail: All the actors in “Fences” were top-notch, but I sort of lost track of their quality in the fog of all that talk. Frank: Yeah, “Fences” was so clearly a stage production in cinematic drag, talky and inert in a way that rarely works onscreen. But there’s still no denying the artistry of Davis’s work in it or the fact that she’s due an Oscar. The trophy will go to her. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Are there categories beyond the acting ones that you find interesting, especially at this fraught juncture in our country’s existence? Gail: Yes, I’m dying to see who’ll pick up the award for best foreign film, if “The Salesman” from Iran wins. The director, as you know, was barred from the country during the Trump immigration crackdown. The real drama is going to be in those acceptance speeches. How many of the honorees will take the time to thank their co-stars and agents before going directly to the horrificness of Donald Trump? Frank: That depends, really, on how much more horrificness Trump will yet commit. There’s — what? — a week until the little gold men are doled out. That’s plenty of time for our big gold man to ban Hindus, levy special tariffs on Delta (poor, scapegoated Delta), fire two more senior aides and divulge his top-secret strategy for fighting ISIS (um, whatever happened to that?) over s’mores on the beach in front of Mar-a-Loco. Sorry, Mar-a-Lago. Gail: Well, it should be … an evening. And you know the president will be watching every minute. Frank: I await the morning-after tweets. And for a reality check, may I say that I never imagined a day when I’d be expecting angry post-Oscar tweets from the president of the United States? Someday this will be a movie. I cannot wait, because it will mean that we’re finally past this fearful present. \nGail Collins and Frank Bruni are Op-Ed columnists. \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:15:08.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
