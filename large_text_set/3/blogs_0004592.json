In a video posted by TMZ Sports on Monday , “Gamebred” is encountered in true TMZ fashion by a cameraman who compliments Masvidal on his January blowout stoppage of “Cowboy” Donald Cerrone , before asking Masvidal's thoughts on Demian Maia , who Masvidal faces on May 13 at UFC 211 in Dallas. “I'ma f--- him up, man. Those are my thoughts,” Masvidal muses while removing his sunglasses in melodramatic fashion. “I'm not a classic striker, man, you don't know nothing about me,” Masvidal responds to the suggestion his bout with Maia was a “classic striker versus grappler match-up.” “I can wrestle my ass off, I ain't got nothing to worry about. I'm betting the house on this. I been calling Dana to see if he'll take a $200K bet, but he hasn't taken it yet.” The 32-year-old American Top Team product has rebounded from a pair of contentious split decision losses to Benson Henderson and Lorenz Larkin by going on a three-fight winning streak. Since last July, Masvidal has dominated Ross Pearson , Jake Ellenberger and most recently Cerrone, who he toppled in just six minutes flat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T12:05:04.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
