Mike McCarthy opted to go for it, and the Packers tried to hand it off to Ty Montgomery, who was stuffed at the line.\nTwo plays later, Eli Manning took a few steps to get his feet set, stepped into the throw, and hit Tavarres King in stride for an easy 41-yard touchdown pass.\nThat touchdown made it a 14-13 game, and gave the Giants momentum going back on defense. It was also Kingâ€™s first career touchdown pass, and there might not have been a better time for it to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:07:30.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
