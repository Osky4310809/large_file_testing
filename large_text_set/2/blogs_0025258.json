After several of the filmmakers involved with \"La La Land\" had already given acceptance speeches, it was revealed onstage that \"Moonlight\" had actually won.\nWarren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were co-presenting the best picture Oscar, and Beatty hesitated after opening the envelope. Dunaway took the paper from him, and said the winner was \"La La Land.\"\nBut later, Beatty said that the card had said \"Emma Stone, 'La La Land,'\" which was the reason for his confusion.\n\"I want to tell you what happened,\" Beatty said. \"I opened the envelope and it said, 'Emma Stone, La La Land.' That's why I took such a long look at Fey and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny.”\nLooking back at the moment when Beatty opened the envelope, it appears he was actually holding an envelope which read \"Actress in a Leading Role\" (which Emma Stone had won moments before).\nTake a look:\nABC\nOnstage, they held up the real best picture card which listed \"Moonlight\" as the winner for the camera to see:\nABC\nKimmel came onstage as well, assuring the audience that this was not a joke. \"This is very unfortunate what happened,\" he said. Kimmel also made a reference to Steve Harvey, who memorably announced the wrong winner at the Miss Universe competition in 2015 .\nLater backstage, Emma Stone told press she had her Oscar card with her the entire time backstage.\n\"I also was holding my best actress in a leading role card that entire time,\" said Stone backstage to press in a segment that aired on ABC after the Oscars. \"So whatever the story... I don't mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card. So I'm not sure what happened.\"\nAccording to the BBC, Beatty had a second envelope because there are two envelopes made for each award .\nYou can check out the chaotic scene below:\nThat awkward moment when La La Land producers found out #Moonlight really won best picture. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/2FBlUV4lnD\n— Q.
