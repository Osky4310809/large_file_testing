RUDY SANTOS \nMANILA, Philippines - Retired police officer Wenceslao “Wally” Sombero has insisted he is no briber, but a whistle-blower of extortion activities in the Bureau of Immigration (BI). \nHe also denied going into hiding, claiming he had permission to leave the country from Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II. \nBut Aguirre firmly denied this. \nArriving at 8:55 a.m. yesterday at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport from Canada, the alleged middleman of Chinese gaming mogul Jack Lam said he had no plans of escaping. \nSombero is being accused of bribing immigration officials on Lam’s behalf to release the latter’s arrested illegal Chinese workers. \n“Nagpapalamig lang at wala akong balak tumakas (Just wanted to cool off and I don’t have plans of escaping),” he said.   \nSombero was met yesterday at the airport by Immigration Terminal 2 head supervisor Dennis Robles, Port Operations Division assistant head Fidel Mendoza and agents of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). \nTraveling alone from Vancouver, Canada, Sombero took Philippine Airlines flight PR 119 and was in seat 2D of business class. \nAn airline staff, who asked not to be identified, said Sombero seemed “nervous,” going to the lavatory several times when the plane was about to land. \nSombero said he left the country last Jan. 17 with Aguirre’s permission and made a stopover in Taiwan before flying to Vancouver. \nBut according to Aguirre, he did not issue an Allowed Departure Order (ADO) to Sombero when he asked to leave the country. \nSombero said last Jan. 16, the day before he left, he wrote the justice secretary a letter stating his intention to leave. \n“Yes, he wrote to me, but… I did not issue an allowed departure order… I did not allow it,” Aguirre stressed, noting that Sombero was in the list of the Immigration Lookout Bulletin Order (ILBO) since Dec. 16 last year because of the bribery/extortion scandal at the immigration bureau. \nThe DOJ chief said it was the job of the immigration officer to stop Sombero from leaving the country, since the latter was a subject of an ILBO. \n“In the case of Sombero, he had no ADO, so the immigration officer should have prevented him. It is no longer the fault of the DOJ (Department of Justice) secretary,” Aguirre pointed out. \nLast Monday, Aguirre issued an “extremely urgent” memorandum for BI Commissioner Jaime Morente and NBI director Dante Gierran on the expected arrival of Sombero yesterday at 7:30 a.m. from Vancouver. \nThe justice secretary ordered the NBI to give Sombero the necessary protective custody as the agency assists and turns him over to the Blue Ribbon committee of the Senate in time for the next hearing on Feb. 16. \nSombero was turned over to Senate officials at the airport yesterday. \nHe said he had no knowledge to link Aguirre to the immigration bribery scandal. \nSombero had reportedly left the country for medical reasons and threats on his life over the alleged P50-million bribe to immigration officials from Lam. \nSombero was set to return to the Philippines from Canada last Feb. 6, in time for the Senate’s third hearing on the case, but was stopped by airport authorities in Canada because he exhibited palpitations and shortness of breath when he was about to board a plane to Manila. \nCanadian authorities reportedly asked Sombero to see a cardiologist before they give him clearance to rebook his flight. \nSombero said he wants to appear before the Senate committee “to personally assert the fact that it was a consummated extortion case, rather than a mere perception of bribery.” – With Paolo Romero, Marvin Sy  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:00:35.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
