It was soon used to falsely claim the 19-year-old was a terrorist.

Modamani soon became a target for racism and hate as his image was used as a symbol of Germany’s refugee policy. \n\"I cried when I saw it,\" Modamani told Al Jazeera . \"I want to live in peace in Germany. I fled from the war and bloodshed in Syria to live in safety... I was too afraid to leave my house after I saw what people wrote about me.” \nModamani’s lawyer, Chan-jo Jun, said in January that Modamani was “fighting back based on his personal rights so that no person is able to slander him or accuse him of crimes.” #Facebook cracks down on iconic #Vietnam War photo over nudity, Norway goes berserk https://t.co/MGCD8NkToy pic.twitter.com/tol0YZMQcb — RT (@RT_com) September 8, 2016 \nOn Tuesday, however, a German judge ruled that Facebook didn’t have to seek out and delete defamatory posts as it wasn’t the “perpetrator or participant in the smears.” \n\"Facebook didn’t adopt the statements and the postings as its own opinion,\" Presiding Judge Volkmar Seipel said, as cited by Bloomberg . \"It’s not Facebook that’s claiming these things when users are uploading the picture.\" \nJun accused Facebook of failing to take sufficient action to stop the defamatory images and posts from being shared. \"We need to decide whether to allow Facebook to do whatever it wants – to keep anything online that elicits traffic,\" Jun said after the ruling. \"Lawmakers need to step in.\" \nREAD MORE: Facebook under fire after it censors ‘explicitly sexual’ statue of Neptune \nThe ruling appears at odds with Facebook’s policy of removing content it deems inappropriate. The social media giant has come under fire for censoring art, and for failing to remove reported sexually explicit images of children. \nMark Zuckerberg’s company has also been criticized for selectively removing posts it says incite violence, and not removing others .

During the US presidential elections, it was criticized for allowing the spread of fake news stories. \nIn January, the European Commission warned it would face legal action if it did not eliminate fake news. The company has since begun flagging content it believes is “disputed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:29:27.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
