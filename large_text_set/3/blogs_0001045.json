Game of the Year: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is here and real and spectacular. This weekend Nintendo Switch , as well as Wii U, owners will be able to play this Game of the Year for themselves. But at this year’s GDC , Nintendo showed that the game hitting shelves March 3 used to look very different. Breath of the Wild is a massive, 3D adventure, but its earliest prototypes resembled the original, 8-bit, 2D, Legend of Zelda on the NES\nThe quickest way to bring these ideas to life, and present it to the team, a 2D prototype of #Zelda was created. pic.twitter.com/OJnE4yt8Oi \n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) March 1, 2017 \n\nThe 2D #Zelda prototype we discussed earlier? It was actually 3D, running BotW’s physics and “chemistry” engine in the background! pic.twitter.com/xouThXgwqb \n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) March 1, 2017 \n\nAt the panel, the Zelda team explained how these 2D (technically 3D but with a 2D perspective) prototypes were used to test the game’s various complex systems, systems that had never been in a Zelda game to this extent. These systems include the game’s liberal use of physics, like levitating metal blocks and seeing what happens when you drop them, as well as a chemistry system that dictates what happens to different objects when exposed to fire or electricity.\nWhat is the “chemistry” of #Zelda : Breath of Wild?

But Breath of the Wild’s final, painterly art style was chosen for more than just aesthetics. The graphics are somewhat cel-shaded, but the team opted for a semi-realistic world as opposed to Wind Waker’s full-on cartoon look because it better communicates to players what is possible in the environment. We can predict how things will behave in a realistic world better than in an abstract cartoon world.\nBut that wasn’t the only surprise we learned about Breath of the Wild’s development. Early prototypes also included a game called Hyrule Wars , an alien-themed adventure called The Legend of Zelda: Invasion , as well as drawings of modern-day Link looking like a total tool with a motorcycle and a guitar.\nBefore there was #Zelda : Breath of the Wild there was.. Hyrule Wars? And an alien attack!? The early concepts were definitely wild. pic.twitter.com/0vNYFvtrsQ \n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) March 1, 2017 \n\nLink himself went through some trial and error.
