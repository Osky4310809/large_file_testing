Six-goal top scorer Austin has missed a month already and won't be back soon (Photo: Getty) \nSummer appointment Puel had previously stated he would not be looking to bolster his front-line during the winter window, but his stance is believed to have changed following this dismal run of form. \nSouthampton visit Championship Norwich in the FA Cup's third round on Saturday and defeat would heap more pressure on the Frenchman, who was forced to answer questions on his future after the 3-0 loss at Everton.
