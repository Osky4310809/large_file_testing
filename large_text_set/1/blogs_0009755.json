There are many great things at CES this year, from Bluetooth tech to Alexa to autonomous cars, a few phones, Alexa, some great laptops and gaming rigs, and, did I mention Amazon’s Alexa? We don’t say this often, Google, through Google Assistant and Android, has some serious catch up to do.\nThe Android Authority Podcast – discussing topics in Android every week.\nCES 2017 Podcast #1 We’re back at CES 2017 with the first in a series of daily podcasts hosted by Joshua Vergara!

Josh, Jonathan, Lanh and Andrew Grush hang out for a bit to discuss the best and our favorites from our week in Las Vegas. Phones, laptops, smart cars, drones and so much more.
