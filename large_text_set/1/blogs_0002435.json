Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nLow cost carriers like Norwegian and WOW Air have been busy offering insanely cheap fares to Europe on a seemingly constant basis. However, today we’re seeing similarly low fares, but on full-service carriers Air Canada and United. Fly round-trip from Los Angeles (LAX) on Air Canada from just $388 round-trip with one stop in each direction, or nonstop on United’s Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner for just a few dollars more. If you’re based on the East Coast, you can fly nonstop and round-trip from just $407 from United’s hub in Newark (EWR). The best part about these fares is that they’re valid all the way through August 2017, which is peak travel time for tourists to flock to Europe — and typically the most expensive time to fly there.\nAirlines: Air Canada, United and other Star Alliance carriers\nRoute: EWR and LAX to London (LGW and LHR)\nCost: $388+ round-trip in economy\nDates: May – August 2017\nBooking Link: Orbitz or Expedia \nPay With: The Platinum Card from American Express ( 5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel ) , Chase Sapphire Reserve , Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express , Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or Chase Sapphire Preferred (2x on travel)\nHere are a few examples of what you can book:\nLos Angeles (LAX) to London (LGW) for $388 round-trip on Air Canada: \n\nNewark (EWR) to London (LHR) for $407 round-trip on United: \n\nLos Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) for $416 round-trip on United: \n\nMaximize Your Purchase \nDon’t forget to use a credit card that earns additional points on airfare purchases, such as the American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold or Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (2x on all travel purchases).
