A new Norwegian study found that 35 percent of women regretted their one-night stands, and the researchers think this is because women are hard-wired to crave more out of a relationship than a short-term rendezvous. While that doesn't apply to all women—I know plenty who love a casual romp—it's pretty safe to bet that she'll appreciate hearing from you. \nGetting asked out on real date will make her swoon more than three-paragraph text about how awesome the sex was, anyway. (Less creepy, too.) She’ll immediately peg you as the confident, stand-up guy you surely are who’s interested in more than just sex. And you have every reason to believe she’ll say yes—she already slept with you, didn’t she? \nGot a question about women, dating, love, or lust? Submit it to Ali via Facebook , Twitter , or email .
