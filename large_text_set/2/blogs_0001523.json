Dakota Johnson (Photo: Rex Features) Dakota Johnson (Photo: Rex Features) \nMiley Cyrus' sister also appeared to follow suit with in a daring sheer black dress. \nEarlier in the week, Dakota revealed the film will feature a surprise tribute to her 59-year-old mum Melanie Griffith. \nDakota explained: \"There is a moment, a little surprise moment especially for my mom in this movie.\" \nMelanie has vowed never to watch her daughter in any of the steamy films, and so Dakota knows her actress mother is unlikely to see the tribute for herself. \nBut she told the 'Today' show: \"Maybe she'll see this one specific little clip.\" \nAnd when she was asked if movie-watchers will notice the subtle tribute, Dakota said: \"I hope so. I think so.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:25:48.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
