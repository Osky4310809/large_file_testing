TAKE A HIKE, FOX AND THE HOUND! SAYONARA, UNLIKELY ANIMAL BEST FRIENDS! \nThere’s a new adorable couple in town, and they go by the names of Most Lovable Grandma and Grandpa. (Full disclosure: I actually have no idea what they go by, but that’s what we should call them.) \nThis amazing older couple loves two things: each other and dining at In-N-Out Burger. If that’s not true love , then I’m not interested in true love!!! You hear me, universe?! How You Know When You're In Love.

Twitter \nHeather, I HOPE to be like them one day, too. \nThe series of photos shows Heather’s grandpa rocking a genuine smile while holding up some sort of In-N-Out delicacy, like fries, soda or the burger itself. \nImgur commenters couldn’t handle the cuteness, but more importantly, they couldn’t stand how amazing the gentleman looks in blue plaid shirts. And I gotta say… they have a point. Mr. In-N-Out is a looker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:44:52.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
