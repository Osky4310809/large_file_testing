After one practice he got drunk at a bar in Wakefield and then started swearing his mouth off in front of children, shouting the word c***. The parents who heard him were furious. He’s not showering himself in glory on the tour.\" \nThe singer is also said to have upset his X Factor colleagues after being late and hungover while on the X Factor tour. \nThe source claimed: “He has turned up late for call times and has appeared hungover at rehearsals.\" \nWhile a friend of Matt's told the newspaper: “Matt’s 23 and just having a good time on tour. He regrets getting drunk and swearing in a family environment, but he’s 100 per cent dedicated in his performances.” X Factor winner Matt Terry (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nMeanwhile, Matt recently revealed he hasn't spoken to boss Simon Cowell since coming out on top on the show. \nThe talent show champion admitted the pair haven't been in contact, but insisted he will \"always be grateful\" to the music mogul for giving him the launching pad he needed for his career as an artist. \n\"We haven't spoken at all,\" Matt told Reveal magazine. \"He always said if I ever needed him, I could speak to him. He's a lovely guy. He gave me this amazing opportunity so I'll always be grateful to him.\" \nMirror Celebs has contacted a representative for Matt for comment.
