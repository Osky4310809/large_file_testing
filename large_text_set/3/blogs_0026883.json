These strays are left behind to live in car parking lots, construction sites and under high rise buildings, or basically anywhere which provide water, which is usually AC condensate, and food. Not only do the cats struggle to cope with the harsh environment and summer desert temperatures, they also face cruelty from some pest control companies whom upon receipt of a complaint, trap the cats inhumanely, in rusted, harmful enclosures, with sharp edges and penetrating rods. The cats are left in these traps alone, in open environment with no shelter, for periods of more than 14 hours with no water or food awaiting a dark fate, and to never be seen again.Signing this petition you demand an end to pest control unacceptable inhumane behaviors, you request law enforcement and punishment against animal inhumane trapping and request a more active role from the municipality in humane trapping, neutering and re-homing in suitable safe environments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T10:07:53.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
