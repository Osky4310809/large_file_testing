She would need to move to contest the Democratic nomination. \nSources who spoke to the New York Daily News said the formerly close relationship between Clinton and de Blasio had soured during the White House race, when he was slow to support her bid for the nomination. media_camera New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Picture: Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP \n“It’d be sweet justice considering the way that de Blasio treated her (in the primary),” the paper quoted one Democratic leader as saying. \nThe new report comes after the certification of Donald Trump’s victory by US Congress. \nHouse Democrats objected to the votes from at least 10 states, raising issues of voter suppression as well as American intelligence showing that Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Trump. In each case, their objections were denied because they didn’t have the support of any senators. \nUnder federal law, if at least one senator and one House member object to the vote from any state, the House and Senate will meet separately to debate the merits of the objection. \nAs the votes were announced for state after state, Democratic members of the House stood up to object. But in each case, no Democratic senator would join them, and Vice President Joe Biden cut them off. \n“There can be no debate,” Biden said repeatedly. “It is over.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:13:48.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
