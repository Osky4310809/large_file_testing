Why does this baby look more like Ed Sheeran than Ed Sheeran does? pic.twitter.com/3I50d7yQlh \n— Tom Davies (@1TD) March 17, 2017 Like the red-headed crooner, Sheeran’s twin in baby form is also from the UK, so naturally people were looking for his take on the situation. Could little Isla Watson be a long-lost cousin or sibling? No pressure, Ed, except we REALLY need to know if it’s time for us to pitch in and buy this potential relative a guitar and start honing her for the spotlight. Times a tickin’ here.\n\nvia GIPHY \nActually, we’re not even close. And before anyone reaches out to Maury Povich about a televised DNA test, Sheeran assures us all that his young twinsie isn’t his daughter either. During an appearance on ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Wednesday, host Richard Arnold showed the singer the baby’s photo.\n“She’s not mine,” Sheeran joked after seeing the snap of his mini-me. “She’s not mine! It’s mad the kind of things that go viral.” LOL. Well, whaddya expect, Ed?! We can’t help it if all of these twins keep coming out of the woodwork, but consider it a compliment that your musical fame is making viral celebrities out of random fans.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:27:31.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
