Carmel Jewish Cemetery is a kind of spiritual violence that must be stopped and denounced by all people who abhor the hate-filled antisemitism that is escalating,” Burkat said. \nMonsignor Daniel Kutys, the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, read a statement on behalf of Archbishop Charles Chaput, who had a prior commitment in New York. \n“Join in prayerful solidarity with the families of those whose final resting places have been disturbed. Violence and hate against anyone, simply because of who they are, is inexcusable,” Monsignor Kutys read. \nImam Anwar Muhaimin of the Quba Masjid says “any act of intolerance – which we’re seeing a lot of today – is something that goes against the spirit of the city that we all know and love.” \n“I wanted to stand against the bigotry, intolerance, antisemitism and Islamophobia. We are all in this together, and I pray that God’s power is with us,” said Muhaimin. \nMayor Jim Kenney believes the good will prevail. \n“I think there are good people overwhelming, there are more good people overwhelming than there are rotten hating idiots. And I think I the end the good will prevail,” said the mayor. \nSteve Tawa Steve Tawa joined KYW Newsradio in 1990, and splits his time between reporting and anchoring.
