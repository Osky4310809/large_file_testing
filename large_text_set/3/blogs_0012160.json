Fortunately, we’ll know exactly what Samsung has up its sleeve later this month when it takes to the stage to showcase the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus on March 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T15:33:17.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
