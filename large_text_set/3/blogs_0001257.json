Caught up in all the excitement we start discussing our favorite consoles over the years. Here’s what gave us goosebumps and hours of entertainment. Leave your favorites in the comments section below!\nNINTENDO Wii \n\nSubmitted by: J ordan Minor \nThis is an easy one for me. I don’t think I’ll ever be as excited for a video game system as I was for the Wii.\nI already wrote a whole story about my Wii love affair.\nThe Wii hit at the perfect time in my life, days away from my 15th birthday, when I was old enough to be seriously following gaming news but young enough to be hyped and not cynical. I didn’t even care about many launch titles, Zelda included, but the E3 promises of Mario and Metroid were irresistible. And while motion controls didn’t end up being quite as magical as the initial pitch, Wii Sports at the time really was a game changer. The only thing that gave me more sleepless nights than waiting for the Wii itself was waiting for its entry of Smash Bros. \nSEGA DREAMCAST \n\nSubmitted by: Keenan McClelland \n9.9.1999. I remember it like it was yesterday. Toonami finally started airing new DBZ episodes into the Namek saga, and the Sega Dreamcast was finally released! Being an anime fan already, the Dreamcast was like a love letter written specifically to us fans. In the states, we were aware that the Playstation had fantastic Japanese titles. The only problem was the games did not score well with the Sony marketing departments here in America, so they would never see the light of day (unless imported). The Sega Dreamcast embraced these games and knew there was a viable market for them here in the U.S. Titles like Jet Grind Radio, Shenmue and Project Justice were largely influenced by Japanese culture and sold extremely well here. The VMU (Visual Memory Unit) was the future when it came to sharing save files and Chaos . Sonic had a home again, and it felt good. While it lasted anyways. Rest in peace you beautiful bastard.\nSONY PLAYSTATION 2 \n\nSubmitted by: K. Thor Jensen \nI’m not an “early adopter” kind of guy. I grew up in a single-parent household, and while my mom certainly did right by me, we weren’t one of those families who got the latest and greatest thing the day it hit store shelves. I never had an NES. I bought a SNES second-hand from a thrift shop. I bought a PlayStation two years after it came out. So when Sony announced their second entry into the home console market, I figured I’d wait a while to try it.\nHere’s the thing, though. At the time, I was working at UGO, which old-school heads will recognize as the precursor to today’s Geek. It was a scrappy, independent nerd culture site that was for people like us. We had no time for marketing or bullshit and that just made companies want to work with us more.\nSony sent us a PS2 on release day. I remember the whole editorial department coming over and plugging it in. The only game we had was NHL Hockey 2001 , but it didn’t matter. The controller felt great. The graphics were sharp. The next generation was officially here.\nWe all knew that this would be big, and it was – the PS2 became the single best-selling console ever released, and has a software library that you could spend the rest of your life in. That magical feeling of being able to dive in on the first day was unforgettable.\n \nNINTENDO 64 \n\nSubmitted by: Nick Mangione \nThe console that began my lifelong love of video games. I was always a Nintendo kid growing up. One of my earliest memories is struggling with Super Mario Bros., and asking my mom to help me get across a really hard jump. She knew how to make Mario run. I, at three years old, was afraid to. I never owned a Super Nintendo, though I played it at friends’ and cousins’ houses. That NES lasted me until I was nearly 10. It finally died after years of constant Mario, Zelda, Kirby and The Little Mermaid . (What? That game was awesome.)\nWe needed something to replace our beloved NES and were naturally considering a Super Nintendo. With one of those, we could rent games at Blockbuster. Our priorities changed when we heard that Nintendo was releasing something new that year. It was a video game system capable of 3D. I may not have been quite sure what that meant at ten years old, but I knew I wanted it.\nFor a year, my sister and I did extra chores around the house, saving up everything we earned for a Nintendo 64. Finally, the day came. My sister and I had saved up enough money between the two of us to buy the system and one of its two launch titles. Pilotwings 64… I’m kidding. Let’s not be crazy here. Pilotwings was cool and all, but it was up against the greatest game ever made.\nThe N64 only launched with two games, but it only needed one great one. Super Mario 64 was more than enough to tide me over until Shadows of the Empire and Zelda: Ocarina of Time came out. The system’s not much to look at now, and it had some severe technical limitations even for the time, but it was the first system that was mine (and my sister’s). I still remember being amazed by making Mario run around 3D environments. I was in awe that a video game system could produce such clear voices. Mario could talk. Link could shiver. The Nintendo 64 was magic.\nSEGA DREAMCAST \n\nSubmitted by: Tony Polanco \nMy love for Sega and Dreamcast is without measure. I could easily write an entire editorial about why the Dreamcast was one of the greatest systems of all time. For this piece, however, I’ll give you a quick summary of my experience with Sega’s magnificent final console.\nThe Dreamcast was the very first system I purchased with my own money. I remember waiting for nearly a year for it to come out and had even paid it off completely at my local game store (which is now a GameStop). It came out on September 9, 1999. I was 19 and had just started college. I purposely skipped classes that day to spend it with the Dreamcast, though. Higher education, be damned! This was a new Sega console!\nTo this day, the Dreamcast has the greatest launch lineup in history. Sonic Adventure, Soul Calibur, Power Stone, Ready 2 Rumble , were just some of the games for the system on day one. The system would eventually get other classics like Shenmue, Jet Set Radio, Skies of Arcadia, Resident Evil: Code Veronica , and so many more. If you had a Dreamcast in your home, you were one happy gamer.\nUnfortunately, the dream died shortly after two years. Though Sega is merely a shadow of its former self, many still have fond memories of the company and its brilliant Dreamcast.\nSEGA GAME GEAR \n\nSubmitted by: Sheilah Villari \nI loved my Game Gear. I think it was the first real portable console I had…not having to share with anyone in my family was pretty key. Looking back on it now it was a total brick of a system, weight, size, design, the whole thing was not aesthetically pleasing. I mean seriously, why was the battery pack as big as the actual system?! No wonder the bag was essentially a briefcase. But young Sheilah didn’t care, and my mom was happy to keep me occupied on vacations and long trips. I was so excited to have a colorful (yes I had the ‘sport’ blue) and colorful way to play games while traveling. The hours I put into Echo the Dolphin was everything to me at that time. And I felt personal satisfaction for dominating Legend of Illusion in mere days. I could still tell you exactly how to defeat the caterpillar monster at the end of the crystal level. I eventually moved onto PlayStation, then Xbox, and now PlayStation 4. But I began to miss that tangibleness of playing video games. Last year I bought a DS3 for my commutes and fell in love all over again. I will never forget the not super convenient but wonderful handheld console Game Gear of my youth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T08:43:25.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
