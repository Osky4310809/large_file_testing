And their behind-the-scenes spat is out there in the public sphere, all thanks to gossip tabloids. If rumours were to be believed, it was Kangana who seem to have started the battle, by calling Shahid out in the media. She called him \"a torture to make out with\", \"extremely moody\" and even ... wait for it ... compared him to ex Hrithik Roshan. Ouch! Shahid, who was chill for like a second, retaliated with this comment saying, \"She (Kangana) has a vivid imagination. She makes up things in her head.\" \nAs the battle got nastier and mean-spirited comments were thrown around, Shahid decided to put an end to the entire situation, saying \"I would not like to play a table tennis match on this whole episode by answering to each of her comments. I just wish to put an end to this match. Kangana should move ahead with all her co-stars in an amicable manner and work with a team spirit.\" Here's hoping this is the end to a what is otherwise an extremely childlike fight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:02:32.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
