Fuel economy, journey distance, power and torque curves, a stopwatch as well as a G-force monitor can be displayed via a new 4.2-inch multifunction display. \nThe driver-oriented car is a concept not lost on Toyota, least of all on its company chief, Akio Toyoda. “If it’s not fun to drive, it’s not a car,” Toyoda said. Data and feedback gleaned from Toyota’s participation in the Nürburgring 24 Hours with Toyota Gazoo Racing has influenced the changes made towards the revised coupe for the 2017 model, the company says. \nCheck out the 145-image gallery below.
