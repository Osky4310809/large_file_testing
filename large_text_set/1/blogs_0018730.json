By Robert Purchese Published 20/01/2017 \nThere's a new Ghost Recon game just around the corner - Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands. Hasn't exactly been shouting and hollering has it? \nBut here's a new video showing 20 minutes of single-player mission footage no less, narrated by lead game designer Dominic Butler. The last time we saw Ghost Recon Wildlands was at E3 2016 . \nThe footage shows a helicopter mission to a ramshackle jungle village, which the player and squad infiltrate in classic Ghost Recon tactical fashion, all gadgets and gizmos and funny hand gestures. \nGhost Recon Wildlands comes out on PC, PS4 and Xbox One 7th March. There will be a beta before launch that you can sign up for now.
