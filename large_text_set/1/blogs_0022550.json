The e-commerce behemoth, which is set to become the number one apparel retailer in the U.S. by the end of this year, is said to have signed agreements with major manufacturers of auto parts to sell their products on its website at prices that undercut those at traditional brick-and-mortar stores. The report states that Amazon's auto parts business could surge in revenue by 50% to $5 billion by the end of this year. \nAccording to a September report by research firm Jefferies, prices for auto parts on Amazon's website were on average 23% lower as compared with other industry players. Amazon reinforces this pricing advantage by acquiring regional parts distributors, according to The Post's report. A majority of the manufacturers – including Robert Bosch, Dorman Products and Cardone Industries – are now selling directly to Amazon.

A Morgan Stanley analyst wrote that the push could also clear the way for Amazon to become a retailer for new and used cars. That said, the company is playing in a limited market for now because most consumers lack the knowledge and training to shop for used car parts on their own.(See also: Amazon Launches Platform for Car Buyers . ) \nAmazon's entry into the auto parts business is not surprising when you consider the industry's dynamics. A surge in imports from China coupled with favorable currency exchange rates have helped the auto parts suppliers generate fat profit margins . For example, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ( ORLY ), a major player in the industry, has seen its profit margins increase by approximately 3% within the past three years. The U.S. imported $138 billion in car parts in 2014, equating to a record $12,135 of imported content per American vehicle, according to a 2015 WSJ report . \nThe situation also led retailers to gain an upper hand over manufacturers during supply negotiations. Amazon, which is famous for its low margins, is breaking this stranglehold. According to a Reuters report , the company is offering 30% more to manufacturers as compared with other retailers. Given increasing revenue from other lines in its e-commerce business, Amazon likely is not concerned with generating large profits at this point.
