And it's got plenty of people on the internet asking questions. \nIn the footage, which was posted to YouTube with the horrible title, \"How to quickly get rid of a girl\", we meet a young couple by the sea in France. Everything seems romantic to begin with. \nThe pair are seen holding hands on the edge of a steep ridge gazing out to see and admiring the view. Everything seems fine The video is scary and we really hope it's a stunt (Photo: Jukin 125) \nThe woman then turns and beams at her partner, who takes her hand to keep her steady on the edge of the hilltop. \nAnd then he pushes her off it. \nThe woman can be heard letting out a scream before tumbling to the ground below. She lies motionless on the rocky grass, and the clip then cuts out. Shocking The girl is seen tumbling down the ridge (Photo: Jukin 125) \nWe should reiterate that we're unsure whether the footage is staged – though many believe it was. If not, the video is serious, and quite sickening. \n\"So mean but so funny,\" wrote on commenter on YouTube. \nAnother said: \"Straight f*", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T15:04:50.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
