Trump, would be the nation’s first homeschool shooter . First, Barron Trump isn’t homeschooled. Second, it was an unprovoked and disgusting attack on the First Family. \n“That it even need be said is ridiculous, but mocking the 10-year-old child of a politician you loathe is odious, immoral, & self-defeating,” tweeted CNN’s Jake Tapper. \nRich protected her account, and then deactivated it. But now it’s up and running again, with her tweeting an apology for her actions: I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions & offensive words. It was inexcusable & I'm so sorry. — Katie Rich (@katiemaryrich) January 23, 2017 \nThe New York Times added that a source with NBC told them that Rich has been suspended indefinitely: Katie Rich, a writer for “Saturday Night Live,” has been suspended from her position at that show following a widely criticized post she made Friday on her personal Twitter account in which she mocked Barron Trump, the 10-year-old son of President Donald J. Trump.\nShe was suspended immediately after her tweet, and her suspension is indefinite, according to someone familiar with the plans at “S.N.L.,” who was not authorized by NBC to comment on personnel matters. \nThat tweet on Friday, during Mr. Trump’s inauguration ceremony, drew widespread condemnation, and Ms. Rich subsequently deleted the post and deactivated her Twitter account. Her name did not appear in the closing credits of “Saturday Night Live” in its broadcast on Saturday. \nWell, it looks like I stand corrected regarding NBC holding Rich accountable. You know you’ve screwed up royally when Chelsea Clinton came to the defense of Barron .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:38:27.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
