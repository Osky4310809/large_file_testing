I'll be the first one to say that they had a meeting about a month ago, and decided they aren't going to go on tour for at least a year. They're going to take a break.\" \nBack in August 2015, bassist Jeff Ament said the band was aiming to release a new record in 2016. Whether or not the boys will dedicate themselves to writing and recording during the alleged break or just take time off remains to be seen. \nThe latest Pearl Jam album, \" Lightning Bolt ,\" saw its release in October 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:01:22.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
