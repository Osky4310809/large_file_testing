The skin disorder is estimated to affect around 3% of the global population and 2% of the U.S. population. Around 150,000 new psoriasis cases are reported in the U.S. each year, indicating the large market size. Cosentyx Maintained Skin Clearance Even After Drug Discontinuation \nThe data assessed a group of patients who were treated with Cosentyx for a year and were randomized to continuous treatment, or end of treatment, until relapse. A relapse indicates the return or worsening of a disease after a period of improvement. \nWhile patients on the continuous treatment demonstrated high level of response, interesting observations emerged for the ones who discontinued the therapy. Twenty-one percent of the patient in the latter group demonstrated that skin clearance was maintained for up to one year even without treatment, and among 10% of the patients the skin clearance was maintained for up to two years without treatment. \n“These results suggest that Cosentyx may go beyond simply treating symptoms and could actually modify the course of psoriasis, and highlights the need for further investigation into early intervention,” said Vas Narasimhan, Global Head, Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. \nBuoyed by the positive results, Novartis has initiated a trial to further evaluate the drug’s potential for its disease modifying ability in psoriasis. Highly Competitive Psoriasis Drug Market \nThe drug market is very competitive and is dominated by AbbVie Inc.’s ( ABBV ) blockbuster therapy Humira. Amgen’s biosimilar Amjevita has already secured approval and is awaiting legal clearance for launch. (For more, see Amgen's Biosimilar Gets FDA Approval .) \nOthers in the making include Celgene Corp.'s ( CELG ) Otezla (apremilast), Galectin Therapeutics Inc.’s ( GALT ) GR-MD-02, Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s ( MNTA ) M923, and Dermira Inc.’s ( DERM ) Cimzia (certolizumab pegol).
