Google hopes you are while you also spend time watching Super Bowl LI. The NFL football championship between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots will also see the company show off its Google Home connected speaker as part of the huge TV commercial festivities.\nSee also: Watch two Google Home speakers share a deep conversation 4 weeks ago Ad Age reports that Google is keeping the content of the Google Home ad a secret until the big game itself on Sunday, Feb. 5. Advertisers are spending $5 million for each 30-second Super Bowl commercial, so you would think Google has something pretty cool to show off, especially since the speaker itself has been available to buy for a few months now.\nGoogle joins a number of tech companies who will be running ads during Super Bowl LI. They include wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile, chip maker Intel, and software services like GoDaddy, SquareSpace, Wix.com and TurboTax. It will also feature an ad for the mobile game strategy game Evony: The King’s Return, and that particular commercial is supposed to be full of celebrities.\nWhy do you think Google is spending $5 million to promote Google Home? Will it be worth all that money or is it a waste of its marketing budget?
