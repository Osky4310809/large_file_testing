Frankly, even being nominated for a couple awards feels like a big deal, so we’re super happy that one of our faves was able to bring home a couple of well-deserved accolades. But what we’re maybe MOST jazzed about is that the TBBT fam was SO happy and cute while celebrating the news that we’ve got to admit, we love them a little more than we already did…and we didn’t think that was possible.\nFirst, there’s the anticipation, everybody leaning in and waiting to find out how much ass they kicked.

Christopher Polk/ Getty Images And of course, there was a group picture following their win that would qualify each and every cast member to be a finalist on America’s Next Top Model . Seriously, we’re swooning at the collective good-looking factor. CBS Photo Archive/ Getty Images We pretty much love everything about this. Award shows are always great fun to watch — the lights! The cameras! The fashion! But they’re even more fun when shows and actors we feel deserve the commendation get to accept awards…and even MORE fun than that when the cast is so precious and visibly grateful.\nYou go, TBBT .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T03:57:40.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
