But the kitties of Istanbul do have their human associates, the people who feed them, watch out for them and take care of them when they’re sick. Indeed, more than anything, the film is about these relationships. We understand that these folks need these cats as much as, or perhaps more than, the cats need them.

An interviewee tells us how she only found the way toward healing her own wounds by healing the cats around her. Another talks about how the cats allow her to find some sense of calm and hope amid the chaos of life. “They remind us that we’re alive,” another says. \nThere’s something missing here, however, but I think it’s been deliberately hidden. Torun’s film offers little sense of the current political reality of Istanbul, a city that’s been racked by terror attacks and protests and that is, in effect, at war with itself. You could argue that Kedi seeks a more timeless approach. There’s very little politics or history of any sort to be found in the film. EXPAND Courtesy of Oscilloscope Laboratories \nOne interviewee does speculate about why there are so many cats of such diverse breeds in one particular part of the city — they probably came off the many boats sailing through the Bosphorus — but that’s about it. (I don’t blame Torun for not getting too deep into the history, because otherwise she’d also have to reckon with the fact that more than a century ago, Istanbul, then known as Constantinople, was famous for its stray dogs; what happened to them is a sad, shadowy tale I won’t get into here.) \nConflict and unrest have always defined Istanbul, and if you look closely enough, these forces do seem to be lurking somewhere beneath the film’s placid surface. One interviewee talks about the death of the city’s parks, which may evoke for some the Gezi Park uprising of 2013. \nThose protests initially erupted over the government’s decision to level one of the city’s remaining green spaces to make way for a giant, garish shopping complex. We’re told of steel and glass buildings going up and changing the city, pushing the cats (and, let’s face it, also the people) out. There are those right now who wish to turn Istanbul into a variation on Dubai, all shopping centers and office complexes and alt-brutalist shrines to money and power. And guess what? They’re not big on stray cats in Dubai. \nKedi stands as a subtle, gentle rebuke to such politico-architectural follies. And by showing the citizens of this troubled city at their most generous, it suggests that a social fabric that often seems as if it’s rapidly fraying — at least to many of us now on the outside — still endures. There is a part of me that wishes Kedi had more context, that it further clarified and spelled out some of the threats facing this beautiful city and its people. But in its own, pleasantly dreamy and lilting way, the film embodies what it preaches: As life gets rougher, people endure not by hardening themselves even further but by continuing to find the freedom to be kind. In Istanbul, the chaos never really stops. Kedi slyly reminds us that the humanity too has always been there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:47:17.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
