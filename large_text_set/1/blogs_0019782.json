Taking over the former Cravings space, BBCN was at the center of much speculation after LLC documents pointed to the corporate headquarters of Chin Chin , the longstanding Chinese fusion restaurant across the street.\nWell now the fog has cleared, and we now know that Craig Hopson has stepped in as executive corporate chef for the Chin Chin brand, with Ren Nisenbaum acting as executive chef of BBCM. Hopson — who you might remember as the Michelin star-earning chef formerly behind the socially conscious concept Everytable — and Nisenbaum have put together an extensive menu that stretches from daily breakfast on to dinner.\nAs the name would suggest, the seasonal, European-influenced menu features everything from hearty meats to freshly baked goods to a specialty coffee program, with craft cocktails to boot. On offer are items like a pork belly and buttermilk biscuit benedict for brunch, marinated tofu grain bowls for lunch, and grilled daurade filet for dinner.\nThe indoor/outdoor space features an airy dining room with bright yellow banquettes, marble countertops, and a lovely patio with shady olive trees. All in all, it seems like a pretty pleasant place to spend the day, from your morning cappuccino to evening salad and rose. BBCM is open Sunday to Thursday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.\nBBCM Cafe \n8653 West Sunset Blvd \nWest Hollywood \nIs Cravings in West Hollywood Coming Back from the Dead?
