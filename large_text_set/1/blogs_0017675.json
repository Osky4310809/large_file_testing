Pruitt is a dangerous Christian extremist with no respect for the environment, for women, for the LGBT community, and for the secular values upon which this nation was founded. \nA petition to stop Pruitt from Climate Hawks Vote, explains: \nPruitt is a polluter-backed extremist, allied with other climate deniers like Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe. As the fracking industry poisoned the water and created damaging earthquakes in his state, Pruitt did nothing. And he’s not just an anti-environmental extremist. He literally stood up for the right of the poultry industry to dump chicken manure into clean water – after taking tens of thousands of dollars from the poultry industry, of course. Pruitt also actively demonizes transgender Americans, leading a national suit attacking President Obama’s initiatives to fight discrimination against gay and transgender students. Pruitt poses a threat not only to the mission of the EPA but also to the agency’s staffers. \nMichael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, paints an alarming picture : \nHaving Scott Pruitt in charge of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is like putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires. He is a climate science denier who, as Attorney General for the state of Oklahoma, regularly conspired with the fossil fuel industry to attack EPA protections. \nIn short, Pruitt is bad for the environment, and bad for the United States. He is an anti-science, climate change denying, religious extremist. \nOn his LinkedIn page, Pruitt brags about being “a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda.” He also calls himself a “leading voice for religious freedom and pro-life issues.” \nLast year, as Oklahoma attorney general, Pruitt defended bible distribution in schools, saying : \nFew things are as sacred and as fundamental to Oklahomans as the constitutional rights of free speech and the free exercise of religion. It is a challenging time in our country for those who believe in religious liberty. Our religious freedoms are under constant attack from a variety of groups who seek to undermine our constitutional rights and threaten our founding principles. \nAnother example of Christian extremism: In 2014, Pruitt filed a brief with the Supreme Court arguing that companies can deny employees birth control if it violates their sincerely held religious beliefs. religious convictions. \nReligious News Service describes Pruitt as a “a climate-change denier” noting that “he has a record of opposing marriage equality , transgender bathroom access and abortion , and opposed a church-state separation ballot initiative on the Oklahoma ballot earlier this year.” \nBottom line: Pruitt is a an anti-science, Christian extremist. His attacks “on the climate, the environment, and civil rights disqualify him from service.” Scott Pruitt (Image via Screen Grab) Stay in touch with Progressive Secular Humanist on Facebook:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:05:39.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
