Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Barely 24 hours have passed since Romelu Lukaku had supposedly rejected the contract extension that his agent claimed he was 99 per cent sure to sign with Everton, and just about every publication from the worst tabloid to the most reliable broadsheet has printed something to the effect of Chelsea buying Lukaku. Whether that’s the Mail going with “Chelsea and Manchester United leading the chase for £65m-rated man” or the Telegraph throwing in Ross Barkley as well ( “Chelsea considering £100m bid for Everton duo Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley” ) or The Sun turning it up an extra notch as they are wont to do and claiming that “Chelsea want Romelu Lukaku AND Alvaro Morata to replace Diego Costa” , it’s all happening. Whether any of this means anything remains to be seen of course. It’s not like Lukaku has never changed his mind before. But he does consistently claim that he wants Champions League football and he’s no closer to finding that Everton than he was three seasons ago when he first joined. There were strong rumors of a Chelsea return last summer already, and we can expect those to only grow as we approach the next transfer window. “You cannot only be remembered by scoring goals, you want to be remembered by winning trophies.” [...] “At the minute, I am one of the best strikers in the league. I can't not say that. If I don't say I am one of the best I am shooting myself in the head. At the minute I am one of the best in the Premier League, 100 per cent.” -Romelu Lukaku; source: Sky", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T08:06:01.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
