In early January, West was spotted in Calabasas rocking a never-before-seen silhouette, which the internet quickly dubbed the YEEZY Runner. There was hardly any verified information about this sneaker, but certainly lots of speculation.\nFast forward to last week, adidas and Kanye West finally confirmed the sneaker during the YEEZY Season 5 presentation in New York City. It doesn’t require much scrutiny to see that the shoe’s design is quite different from other Kanye West-designed low-tops like the 350 or 350 V2. As with so many of West’s creative efforts, nonbelievers started with derisive comments, and before long, comparisons were being made between the YEEZY Runner and sneakers like the Nike Air Monarch.\nBut here in the Highsnobiety offices, we were quickly reminded of another sneaker, as it’s far more likely that West took cues from his partners at adidas as opposed to Nike. Our eyes were quickly drawn to the YEEZY Runner’s grooved sole unit, which bears some resemblance to that of the adidas EQT Solution, a sneaker from the mid-1990s.\nSemblances of adidas’ triple stripe motif are imagined as rounded brush strokes that stretch across the midsole of each, most easily identifiable when viewing the silhouette laterally. There’s no doubt that ‘Ye has been given access to the extensive adidas archive in Herzogenaurach during his stint with the German sportswear brand, which was inked in 2013.\nThe new sneaker leans towards ’90s running aesthetics, rather than adidas technology like Boost foam, so we’d place our bets that the adidas archive informed this design in one way or another. It’s more than likely that West drew inspiration from a number of places, but when glancing at the midsole of the EQT Solution and the YEEZY Runner, it’s hard to miss the similarities.\nSpecific prices and release information have yet to be released, but we will be sure to update you with more details as they arrive. If you want to hop on the trend already, you can shop vintage adidas models on eBay, like the EQT Vapor Torsion and the EQT Vapor FYW .\nSubscribe to Highsnobiety’s sneaker chatbot on Facebook to receive lightning quick updates on release dates, sneaker street style, shopping tips and more. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:17:42.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
