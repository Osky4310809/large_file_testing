Schaefer works for the Inquirer. More by Mari A. Schaefer Arrow icon \nA New Jersey dog is home safe after disappearing six months ago. \nParis, a 1-year-old Maltese belonging to Tanya D. Flowers, bolted from her Jersey City apartment on Gardner Avenue in September. A witness reported seeing a man pick up the pup and drive off, NJ.com reported. \nAt the time, Flowers spent hours handing out fliers and contacting shelters, to no avail. \nAbout a week ago, she got the call she had hoped for when a shelter in Staten Island, N.Y., let her know it had her missing dog. \n\"I really thought my dog was gone forever,\" Flowers told the website. \"I also wasn't sure if this was a joke or not because I had received numerous prank phone calls from the fliers I had put up.\" \nThe dog was reportedly found in North Bergen four months ago by a man who took her in. When he could no longer care for her, he took Paris to his mother's home in Staten Island, N.Y. She then took the dog to a vet, who discovered a microchip, Flowers told the website. \n\"When I walked up to the door in Staten Island and saw my dog, I just started screaming,\" Flowers said, adding that Paris immediately began barking and licking her face.
