The quarter-litre class dual-purpose tourer is expected to be in Kawasaki dealer showrooms by March or April, pending Customs clearance. \nNo details were forthcoming about likely pricing for the Versys-X 250, which is expected to open a new segment for Kawasaki in the road-going 250 cc arena. Quietly launched in November last year, the Versys-X 250 carries a 249 cc liquid-cooled parallel twin with DOHC and eight-valves. \nSaid to be based on the engine from the Kawasaki Ninja 250R, it is surmised that the Versys-X 250’s engine will produce somewhere about 29.9 hp at 10,500 rpm and 21.7 Nm torque at 10,000 rpm. Driving a six-speed gearbox, the Versys-X uses EFI, which feeds twin-throttle bodies equipped with dual throttle valves. \nFuel is carried in a 17-litre tank, and braking is with single discs, 290 mm front and 220 mm rear, clamped by Nissin calipers. A 41 mm telescopic fork props up the front 19-inch wheel, with Kawasaki’s Uni-Trak single gas-charged absorber at the 17-inch rear. \nThere are two versions of the Versys-X 250 – City and Tourer. The Tourer comes with a brush guard, twin auxiliary driving lights, hand guards and rear panniers, while the City version does without. \nNo official word on pricing at the moment, but in Indonesia , the 2017 Kawasaki Versys-X 250 retails for 61,900,000 rupiah (RM20,756) for the City and 72,700,000 rupiah (RM24,377) for the Tourer. Two colour options are shown on Kawasaki’s Indonesian website for the Versys-X 250 – Candy Lime Green/Metallic Graphite Gray and Candy Burnt Orange/Metallic Graphite Gray for the Tourer, while the City gets Candy Lime Green/Metallic Graphite Gray and Metallic Graphite Gray/Flat Ebony.
