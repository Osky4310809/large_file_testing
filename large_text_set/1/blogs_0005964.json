Then again, how many years with no edit feature on comments, so I don’t have much confidence on them coming around to either.

No one understands what Upstream Color is about so everyone just says “Hey this must be amazing since we can’t tell wtf the story is! Definitely highbrow stuff!”. Frances Ha! is boring as watching a Documentary about C-Span. Who gives a shit! Nothing happens in this movie. Literally nothing. They don’t a purpose at all. They’re just there on the screen doing nothing and no one gives a crap whether they find a meaning or direction in life because with no character development the viewer doesn’t give a rats ass!! So many better movies with the same topic are out there. The Graduate, Liberal Arts, hell Even Garden State is better than this waste of time… By: tgbusteed 09.29.2016 @ 4:21 PM \nYo, Upstream Color is not a difficult movie to follow. I think a large subsection of people dislike it because it doesn’t follow traditional narrative structure, but that’s exactly what makes it good. When a movie rewards your attention with legitimate “A-ha!” moments, then it deserves praise. It’s odd structure is exactly why it’s good. If anything, it’s underrated. That being said, if you don’t like movies that require inference and what is essentially “viewer participation,” I can see why you wouldn’t like it. But that doesn’t mean its overrated.
