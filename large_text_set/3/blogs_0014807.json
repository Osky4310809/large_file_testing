Milner fouled Sterling to prevent the former Liverpool man from scoring (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) \nThe most noticeable chance and moment came in the first half when James Milner's sliding tackle caught Raheem Sterling's leg putting the winger off a golden goalscoring opportunity. However, no penalty was awarded. Milner puts Liverpool in front (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nAfter a goalless first half, the second 45 only needed six minutes to spring into life. Roberto Firmino was brought down by Gael Clichy inside the penalty area - Milner converted from the spot. \nBoth sides proceeded to throw everything at each other, but it was City who got their much-needed goal next. A superb Kevin De Bruyne cross was buried by Sergio Ageuro. Aguero levelled the game for City (Photo: Michael Regan) \nAdam Lallana had a chance to win the game shortly after, but was left red-faced after completely missing a tap in. \nAguero had another chance late on but could only blaze his volley over the bar. \nIt was the type of game that could have ended 5-5, but poor finishing kept it an exciting 1-1. Adam Lallana missed a sitter at the end of the game (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) \nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the game, Guaridiola said: \"You cannot imagine. It is one of happiest days of my career as a manager. I am so proud. \n\"How we fought, how we run, the spirit we showed, it’s one of the happiest days of my life as a manager. Pep Guardiola was a very happy man at full-time (Photo: Michael Regan) \n\"The way we played we conceded some chances but we created more chances again, but our problem is we don’t score goals. \n\"When you approach one game after 10 games winning nothing is special. You have to consider the situation we played this game, how we played against them, a top team - they have exceptional players – means a lot to me. That is why I am so happy.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T21:29:40.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
