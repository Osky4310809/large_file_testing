It’s beyond outrageous — and reason enough to scrap the PA police.\nAs DNAinfo reported Monday, one cop, Sgt. Kevin Cottrell, was paid $319,922. Another, Officer Andrew Kurpat, got $316,213.\nThat’s an improvement over earlier years, when a few PAPD cops got $400,000-plus.\nBehind it all is out-of-control overtime. Kurpat’s total was more than three times his $90,000 base salary, thanks largely to double-duty pay. As DNAinfo notes, his OT works out to “more extra eight-hour shifts than there are days in the year.”\nAs a “bonus,” many of these cops’ pensions will be based on their sky-high, OT-boosted pay, meaning they’ll get six-figure yearly payouts forever — at public expense.\nAnd here’s the kicker: The PAPD doesn’t even do a good job protecting New York. A 2011 study flagged its security practices as “profoundly deficient,” and a City Journal report last year said it “remains the weak link” in the area’s “public-safety profile.”\nIn December, an internal probe accused 44 PA cops of leaving their posts at PATH stations, with some caught snoozing. A few were even on overtime at the time.\nTo rein in the abuse, officials have to get a handle on the PAPD cops’ insane labor contract. That 400-page tome (far longer than the city teachers contract and more than 10 times the size of the one for NYPD cops) basically lets the union call the shots, making it near-impossible to curb OT.\nThe good news: The old contract expired in 2010, and officials are hashing out a new one. It’s their chance to burn about 360 of those pages and hand control to the PA.\nShort of that, best to just ditch the PAPD altogether — and let cops who can do the job at a fair cost take over.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:13:58.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
