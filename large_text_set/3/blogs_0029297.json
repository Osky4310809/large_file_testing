LIPS: @katvondbeauty Everlasting Liquid Lipstick in \"Ludwig\"\nA post shared by Kat Von D (@thekatvond) on Mar 25, 2017 at 4:58pm PDT\nEach time Kat Von D posts a photo on Instagram, we somehow find ourselves digging for hidden details about a new product release, and her latest post is no different. Kat recently took to Instagram to show off a stunning look, showing off some of her own Kat Von D products, as well some Too Faced Cosmetics, seen above. In her lengthy caption about the products she used for the look, Kat hints at an upcoming product she's testing out and it has every KVD fan anxiously obsessing over how this will transform their makeup regimen.\n\"Neon green shade is a loose pigment powder I'm currently testing,\" she wrote. \"Same with my brows.\" Do you guys hear that? It's the sound of fans losing their minds. Almost immediately after posing the photo, fans filled the comments section writing how much they loved the neon green shade, explaining how \"smooth\" it looks and how they have never been able to find a color that \"pops\" like Kat's.\nRelated:\nPrepare to Lose Your Sh*t Over These 9 Unreleased Kat Von D Products\nIt's important to point out that we're not sure if Kat is testing this for her own brand or testing it for another brand or what it could possibly mean for us neon-makeup-lovers , but we can all agree that there are a lot of people who would be very happy if this is eventually sold (including ourselves). Stay tuned for more details on this potential product release!", "external_links": ["https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/17493662_166138197239262_8231146712152932352_n.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/thekatvond/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BSFJUAAgs9v/"], "published": "2017-03-28T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:05:25.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
