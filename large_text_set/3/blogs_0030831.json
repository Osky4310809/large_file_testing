EPA 11 Syria beat Uzbekistan and could realistically make World Cup play-off spot \nAnd a shock victory over South Korea could see them leapfrog the Asiatic giants into second place and an automatic qualification spot. \nThe top two in the group are automatically granted their place in Russia, with the third-place sides advancing to a continental play-off. \nIt’s been a harrowing period for Syria . \nThe Middle Eastern state has been engulfed in a civil war for the best part of six years — with horrifying stories emerging from the tragic conflict.

Getty Images Syria’s Omar Kharbin puts a tackle in on Qatar’s Luiz Ceara during 1-0 defeat EPA 11 Syria home games take place in Malaysia without any support \nWith 90 minutes on the clock and score still goalless against Uzbekistan in Krubong, the ‘home side’s’ prospects were looking bleak. \nBut 23-year-old Omar Kharbin showed immense coolness beyond his age when given the chance to snatch the victory in stoppage time from 12 yards — stepping up to convert a Panenka-style penalty. \nTo give it a little context, the victory over Uzbekistan earned the players a bonus of £800, which is a year’s wages for a Syrian footballer.

Getty Images Syria head coach Ayman Hakeem would create folklore with World Cup appearance EPA 11 South Korea prepare for their massive World Cup qualifier against Syria \nAnd now, they face the biggest match in their history as they travel to Seoul to face World Cup regulars, South Korea. \nVictory would put them on the brink of football folklore. \nWhile Syria qualifying for the World Cup would surely be the greatest sporting story of all-time, compared to the devastation the country’s people are suffering, this would be a walk in the park.
