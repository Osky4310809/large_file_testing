Former U.S. President Bill Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar, as was singer Kris Kristofferson.\nThe BBC describes Nott as “the son of a wealthy South African lawyer,” and reports that there has been intense social media criticism of the trustees’ decision to award the scholarship to him. Nott has been accused of hypocrisy, the BBC says, with some saying that the scholarship should have gone to somebody more deserving.\nNott reportedly says he will use his time as a Rhodes Scholar to fight for social justice and that he will “never toast Cecil John Rhodes.”\nIn that, he will not be alone. Oxford University’s student newspaper, Cherwell , reported that Rhodes Scholars who completed their two-year scholarships in 2015 did not toast Rhodes at their farewell dinner.\n“We propose to actively involve each future … class in the scripting of future toasts,” the Rhodes Trust told the paper.\n[ BBC ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T11:02:43.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
