Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016\nPolitico’s report says Senator John Cornyn confirmed Trump said this today, adding, “I didn’t pay a lot of attention to it. I was ready to move onto some policy issues. I didn’t anticipate that discussion.”\nAnd WaPo ‘s report features this Quote: from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy :\n“We talked about different electoral college, popular vote going through the different ones. Well, we talked about going back through past elections. Everyone in there goes through elections and stuff so everybody’s giving their different histories of different parts.”\nThere has been no concrete evidence to back up the claim of millions of illegal votes, something CNN’s Jake Tapper highlighted in this tweetstorm earlier tonight:\nThat was WaPo headline — I don't change headlines. But in point of fact there is zero evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 24, 2017\nIn fact, if there were even 1 million illegally cast votes (there weren't), a president would be derelict to not order a major investigation\n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 24, 2017\nIf it were true, @jasoninthehouse and @SenRonJohnson would need to immediately hold hearings. @DHSgov would need to devote much time/energy\n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 24, 2017\n3-5 million illegal votes??? Why, if it were true, why would @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr not be talking about this every single day???\n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 24, 2017\nUnless of course it's not even remotely true and we all know this but no one in the WH and no GOP Leaders are willing to say this to him.\n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 24, 2017\nBut that can't be it.\n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 24, 2017\n[ image via Shutterstock ]\n— —\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/823716480814551040", "https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/823717493286047746", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664", "https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan", "https://twitter.com/SenateMajLdr", "https://twitter.com/SenRonJohnson", "https://twitter.com/#!/feldmaniac", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/at-white-house-trump-tells-congressional-leaders-3-5-million-illegal-ballots-cost-him-the-popular-vote/?utm_term=.5179eed7949c", "https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/823715491256659968", "https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/823716059555438592", "https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/823714971091668992", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/823717427032821760", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Ftrump-reportedly-reiterated-unsubstantiated-voter-fraud-claim-in-meeting-with-congressional-leaders%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://twitter.com/danmericacnn/status/823707421717762049", "https://twitter.com/DHSgov", "http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/donald-trump-fraud-claims-234083", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Ftrump-reportedly-reiterated-unsubstantiated-voter-fraud-claim-in-meeting-with-congressional-leaders%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/donald-trump-1.jpg&description=Trump%20Reportedly%20Reiterated%20Unsubstantiated%20Voter%20Fraud%20Claim%20in%20Meeting%20With%20Congressional%20Leaders", "https://twitter.com/jasoninthehouse"], "published": "2017-01-24T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:55:37.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
