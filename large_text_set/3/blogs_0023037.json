And as the country battles rising wages , the automation trend is only going to accelerate.\nBut it’s not just manufacturers – like iPhone maker Foxconn – that are turning to robotics. So are online shopping companies.\nThat’s why Alibaba is emulating Amazon in putting more robots into the logistics warehouses it runs with several Chinese delivery firms. For robots that’ll fetch and carry stacks of goods, Jack Ma’s ecommerce behemoth, through its Cainiao spin-off, turns to a local startup named Geek+ . It makes these:\nGIF by Tech in Asia; from video by Geek+.\nThat small team, put together in 2015, has just secured US$22 million in series A+ funding to help it grow amid China’s robotics boom, reports China Money Network today . Alibaba is its biggest name client .\nGeek+’s automated pods look like those from Kiva, the American startup snapped up by Amazon for US$775 million in 2012. Now it’s a unit of Jeff Bezos’ company called Amazon Robotics.\nMoving shelves full of stuff.

They’re designed for any warehouse or factory where bits and pieces need to be moved to be accessed by human workers.\nThe startup says it has over 300 robots already in commercial use across China.\nIts fresh US$14 million round was led by Vertex Ventures, a spin-off from Singapore’s state-owned sovereign wealth fund, Temasek. Volcanics Ventures and Banyan Capital also contributed.\nApproximately 70 percent of China’s bots were produced by overseas firms. So Geek+ is also helping push forward China’s drive to challenge the US, Japan, and Germany as a leading maker of industrial robots.\nThis post Alibaba’s favorite ‘warehouse robot’ maker gets funding appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T06:59:41.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
