Vogel (@kenvogel) March 4, 2017 \nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) faces constituents at a town hall meeting Saturday morning in Clemson, South Carolina. MSNBC reported most of the attendees were Democrats who traveled up to 2 hours to attend the meeting. The full town hall is available at the bottom of the post. \"The president of the United States is claiming is that the former President of the United States ordered the wiretapping of his campaign, last year,\" Graham said. \"I don't know whether it is true or not but if it is true, illegally, it would be the biggest political scandal since Watergate.\" \"If the former president of the United States (Obama) was able to obtain a warrant, lawfully, to monitor Trump's campaign for violating the law that would be the biggest scandal since Watergate,\" Graham also said. Graham's remarks on wiretapping Trump and how that would be a political Watergate: SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): The president of the United States is claiming is that the former President of the United States ordered the wiretapping of his campaign, last year. I don't know whether it is true or not but if it is true, illegally, it would be the biggest political scandal since Watergate. [Audience groans] AUDIENCE MEMBER: Russia? Russia? GRAHAM: The other side of the story -- just be quiet. If the former president of the United States (Obama) was able to obtain a warrant, lawfully, to monitor Trump's campaign for violating the law that would be the biggest scandal since Watergate. So here's the deal. As we get ready to talk to each other I am very worried. I am very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally. I would be very worried if in fact the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with a foreign government. So, it's my job as a United States Senator to get to the bottom of this. I promise you I will.
