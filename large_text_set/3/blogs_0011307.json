As reported by Eren Sarigul of ESPN FC, the Gunners had representatives in attendance to run the rule over the 24-year-old during his team's UEFA Europa League showdown with Olympiakos last week, in which the Turkey international was introduced as a second-half substitute. Arsenal scout Jurgen Kost recently told Turkish-Football (h/t Sarigul) that the Premier League side rate Ozyakup highly. \"Ozyakup is a player of the highest standard, we have been closely tracking his progress and when we do our next search for players in his position he could return to Arsenal,\" he said. Dan Istitene/Getty Images Here is a look at why the Gunners may well be keen on a reunion with their former midfielder, who is said to be valued at around €15 million (£13 million) by his club: Ozyakup made just one start in his time at the Emirates Stadium, featuring in a League Cup win over Shrewsbury Town in 2011. With first-team appearances otherwise scarce, he joined Besiktas in 2012 and has since gone on to make impressive strides as a footballer. Now he's a regular in the Besiktas side, as well as blossoming for the national team. As these numbers from OptaCan illustrate, he's become something of a good luck charm for the Super Lig outfit: OptaCan @OptaCan 0 - Beşiktaş are unbeaten in their last seven games in which Oguzhan Ozyakup contributed to goal this season (5 goals and 3 assists). Factor https://t.co/hkfy5fFS49 3/12/2017, 6:34:23 PM Without Santi Cazorla in the team, the Gunners have lacked a composed player who can distribute with intelligence at the base of midfield. It's a job that Ozyakup has been doing with distinction for his side in recent weeks, although he's also adept at influencing the play higher up the pitch, too. Although he's not to the same standard as Cazorla in his playmaking duties, there's obviously talent to harness in Ozyakup. Should Arsenal splash out to sign him, they will lament not spotting those attributes sooner. United Plot Mesut Ozil Swoop Shaun Botterill/Getty Images According to Charles Watts of Football.London, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho is monitoring Mesut Ozil's availability at Arsenal. In the piece it's suggested that Ozil and the Gunners have reached an impasse over a new deal, and as a result, the Red Devils are preparing to capitalise. Mourinho has worked with Ozil previously during a stint together at Real Madrid . According to Watts, aside from United, Bayern Munich are also said to be interested in the playmaker and believe they are in the box seat to land Ozil if he is to depart. AFP/Getty Images Rumours over a possible exit for the Germany international have gathered pace lately, with no developments over a new contract for the player. It means Ozil will have just one year left on his contract at the end of the current campaign, although he recently revealed to Bild (h/t ESPN ) he remains \"open\" to an extension. While he has long been adored by the Arsenal fans, some poor performances have seen Ozil's stock fall lately, as ESPN's James Dall noted here: James Dall @JamesDallESPN Think you'll struggle to find an Arsenal fan hoping Ozil is fit to face Liverpool on Saturday. 3/2/2017, 1:21:42 PM Mourinho helped bring the best out of Ozil in Madrid, where he linked up well with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. The German knits attacks together with impudence and flair, something that'd potentially benefit the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Paul Pogba. Even so, it'd be a shock if Arsenal did decide to sell one of their vital players to United, even without the security of an extended contract.
