By halftime they had a 41-14 advantage in a game in which George Washington used full-court pressure and consistent finishes at the rim to assert its dominance. MORE: BOX SCORE \nSenior Calvin Fugett Jr. led all scorers with 26 points, and George Washington got additional 18-point contributions from both junior Jon’il Fugett and senior Shaheem Speer with star senior point guard Jervay Green sidelined by injury. \nThe Patriots now have racked up two impressive wins in a row following their first in-state loss to No. 1 ThunderRidge on Jan. 6, and Friday night they looked like a team capable of earning the program’s sixth state title and first since Chauncey Billups led them to the 1994 state championship.
