The suggestion is Aguero needs to do more off the ball (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nAlthough Guardiola has insisted Aguero remains a key part of his plans and the player himself says he wants to stay, much will depend on what happens between now and the end of the season. \nGuardiola has dropped Aguero several times already this season and it is likely he will have to get used to the bench, with the City boss in no mood to rest Jesus on current form.
