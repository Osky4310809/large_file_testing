Aside from the whole spending your life with the person you love part, of course. For others, it’s the most stressful part. Well, Emmy Rossum doesn’t care what her wedding dress looks like, and she’s not feeling stressed about any of it — making her our wedding hero.\nThe Shameless star has been engaged to director Sam Esmail since 2015, and planning finally seems to be underway. ( Sort of.) Rossum’s dress is being designed by the legendary Carolina Herrera, and she’s so confident in Herrera’s ability to make stunningly perfect dresses, she’s totally fine with however it turns out. \nWhile at the Carolina Herrera fashion show at New York Fashion Week, Rossum explained that she hasn’t even had a fitting for her dress and has no idea what it will look like.\nMike Pont/WireImage/Getty Images “We haven’t done any [fittings],” Rossum told E ! at the Carolina Herrera show . “We don’t even know yet. We’re no where.” \nBut she has no doubt that Herrera will work her magic. “She’s got it,” Rossum added. “There’s no rush. She can turn it around in a day. I’m not concerned.” Rossum doesn’t just have a super casual attitude about her wedding dress, she’s also very laid back about the entire event.\n“I don’t really care what the dress looks like,” she said. “I don’t really care what the plates look like. I don’t really care what the invitation looks like. The only thing that’s really important to me is that we get married and there’s some kind of party.” \nC Flanigan/Getty Images \nAmen to that!\nHer reasoning for not caring so much about wedding details makes a lot of sense.\n“ Weirdly, I feel like so many times in my life are about dressing up for a film premiere or a fashion show so this is the one time in my life where I’m actually not that focused on details,” she explained. \nWe’re certain that Rossum and Esmail’s wedding will be gorgeous and perfect no matter what.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:05:50.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
