Prior to the inauguration, officials had estimated that between 700,000 and 900,000 would gather to see Trump’s swearing-in. \nBut pictures on social media comparing the crowds on Friday and Saturday show that the gathering on the main stretch of the Washington Mall was larger than that of the inauguration. \nVideos taken by reporters also showed that large swaths of the bleachers set up for the parade which followed the inauguration were mostly empty. \n- Sarah S F.MD (@RedRoadRail) January 21, 2017 \nIt should be also noted that the streets surrounding the Mall, which were cordoned off during the inauguration, were open for Women’s March attendees to march through. Also, the west end of the Capitol Building, which was at capacity when Trump made his inauguration speech, was not accessible during the Women’s March. \nThere is no definitive attendance rate for the inauguration at this time. The National Park Service, which manages the Washington Mall, stopped providing attendance for events at Washington D.C. monuments in 1995. Trump is as insecure as it gets. Sean Spicer lied. Thanks for reminding everyone why they protested today. #WomensMarch #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/9XBWbkoSGg \n- Jim Fondriest (@Jim_Fondriest) January 21, 2017 \nBut a possibly even larger Women’s March crowd gathered in downtown Los Angeles. The LAPD estimated that more than 100,000 attended, but stopped counting at that point. Organizers reported approximately 750,000, which far exceeded organizers’ expectations for 150,000 protesters. LAPD also reports that no arrests were made at the march . \n750,000 Marchers strong here in LA! Thank you for being with us! LAPD has asked us to move to the second stage at 6th and Broadway! \n– Women’s March LA (@wmnsmarchla) January 21, 2017 women’s march downtown la 2017 // ✨❤️ pic.twitter.com/ycpZhFZm7o \nNBC Chicago said 250,000 people – three times as many as expected — turned out on an unseasonably nice day for the demonstration, forcing the cancellation of a planned march. \nThe New York Times cited the following numbers for other cities: \nAttendance in New York City was more than 400,000, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office. The St. Paul [Minnesota] police issued an official crowd count of 50,000 to 60,000 people. Attendance in Boston was 175,000, according to Nicole Caravella, a spokeswoman for Mayor Martin J. Walsh. The Atlanta Police Department estimated about 60,000 people attended a rally there. The Department of Public Safety in Phoenix estimated that some 20,000 marched, while in Key West, Fla. , a town of 25,000, police said more than 2,000 people marched. \nAnd that was just in major U.S. cities. Organizers also expected sister marches in cities around the world. Best Signs From the Women's March (Updating Photos) \nMillions of people worldwide have taken to the streets to celebrate their rights and protest Donald Trump's presidency. Signs and slogans condemned Trump's comments about women, minorities, Muslims, the LGBT community and the GOP's plans to crack down on undocumented Americans and Planned Parenthood.

TheWrap/Tim Molloy \nA doctored emoji illustrated this petitioner's words. TheWrap/Tim Molloy \nMore cats, with their claws proudly out. TheWrap/Tim Molloy \nCarrie Fisher lived on in marchers' hearts as Princess Leia became a symbol of resistance. TheWrap/Tim Molloy \n... and she brought The Force with her. Itay Hod/TheWrap \nYou're probably right about that. Facebook \nA big theme: hands off. And rosaries off, too. Itay Hod/TheWrap \nMany Hillary Clinton quotes made their way into the festivities. Itay Hod/TheWrap \nPink hats, cat ears and pink hats with cat ears were very popular. Itay Hod/TheWrap \nNeoliberal: \"a liberal who de-emphasizes traditional liberal doctrines in order to seek progress by more pragmatic methods.\" Thank you, Merriam-Webster Dictionary.
