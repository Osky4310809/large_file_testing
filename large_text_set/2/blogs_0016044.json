Sutton United have sacked Wayne Shaw. For eating a pie.What a pathetic bunch of clowns. \n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 21, 2017 So The Sun allowed for bets on Wayne Shaw eating a pie, he ate a pie, now he's been sacked and fined. What did they honestly expect #piegate \n— Jamie Murtagh (@_JMW_) February 21, 2017 Wayne Shaw slept on sofa 3nights a week to maintain and run Sutton ground and has been sacked for a sneaky bet with his mates fuck off", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:39:55.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
