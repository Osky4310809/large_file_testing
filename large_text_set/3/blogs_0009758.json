Pippa wants to avoid being upstaged, according to friends (Photo: Getty) Pippa and her fiance James Matthews (Photo: PA) Meghan and Harry at last week's wedding in Jamaica (Photo: MEGA) \nThey were pictured holding hands and looking affectionate at the wedding of pals Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip and Lara Hughes-Young. \n“She saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara,” a friend tells The Mail On Sunday . “The situation was also stressful for Harry.
