READ MORE: Obedience and uncertainty in Singapore \nHe said Yee's prison sentence was \"unusually long and harsh\" especially for his age. \nDepartment of Homeland Security attorneys had opposed the asylum bid, saying Yee's case didn't qualify as persecution based on political beliefs. \nIt was unclear whether they would appeal the decision or if Yee would have to remain imprisoned if they did. Attorneys have 30 days to appeal. \nSingapore, an island republic of 5.6 million which has long been been criticised for strict controls on dissent, takes pride in its racial and social cohesion, which it regards as essential for stability in a volatile region.
