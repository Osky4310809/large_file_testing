It’s part of his personal sacrifice to Make America Great Again. But which of Trump’s favorite ladies will be at his side in the White House? Will the job of first lady go to former Slovenian bikini model and accused plagiarist Melania Trump? As the president’s third wife, the timing of her marriage works out nicely. But Melania has hinted that she wants to stay in New York instead. So will the job instead go to Trump’s favorite scion, Ivanka? \nIt’s been awhile since the daughter of a U.S. president has played the role of first lady. But it’s not unpresidented, or even unprecedented. The last to do so was Woodrow Wilson’s daughter, Margaret, after her mother died in the White House 100 years ago. \nBut for a more recent example, let’s look to Peru, where Keiko Fujimori played the role of first lady for her dad, former President Alberto Fujimori. \nOld man Fujimori was a notoriously corrupt and abusive autocrat. But for a while, many Peruvians were willing to overlook his iron-fist tactics because Peru’s economy was growing and the Shining Path communist revolutionary group was getting pushed back into the mountains. \nKeiko also helped dad’s image. As a first-lady daughter, she helped to soften her father’s tough edges. She made President Fujimori look like a relatable family guy. \nBut he couldn’t keep up the charade. Alberto Fujimori’s sins eventually caught up to him. In November 2000, he was forced to flee Peru in disgrace. He was arrested five years later in Chile and extradited to face criminal charges in Peru. Now he’s serving a 25-year prison sentence for corruption and human rights abuses. \nKeiko, on the other hand, turned her former first lady fame into a political career of her own. She leveraged her family’s name to create her own political party. She got herself and her brother elected to congress and twice ran for president, losing in a tight run-off race in 2016. And she did it all without disowning her incarcerated father. \nIn fact, Keiko told me in an interview a couple of years ago that she still visits her father in prison every weekend. She’s still a daddy’s girl at heart. And her strong ties to dear old dad have even helped her gain favor among a segment of Peru’s population that is nostalgic for the days of strongman rule. \nBut most importantly, Keiko is living proof that even if your dad’s presidency ends in total disgrace, you can still jump from the wreckage and land on your feet. So stay on your toes, Ivanka. If you play your cards right, your political career could outlast your dad’s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T08:55:47.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
