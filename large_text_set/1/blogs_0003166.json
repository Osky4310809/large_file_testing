Even as the five-match   (ODI) series is yet to start, he already has his eyes on the upcoming tour against India. Having suffered a torrid time against the Sri Lankan spinners earlier in the year, a series which the then world No 1 ranked Australian side lost to a relatively young home team, the Australian southpaw hopes to improve on his game against spin from the lessons learnt on the Sri Lankan tour. \n\"I'll definitely have a chance, and I've already started doing some work,\" Khawaja said, on Sunday (January 8), on being asked if he will get time to work on his red-ball game during the upcoming ODI series against Pakistan. \nAfter a run of bad scores in the Sri Lanka series, where he managed just 55 runs in four innings, before being dropped from the final Test, he struck a couple of half centuries against South Africa at home and then followed it up with 581 runs in the three-match series against Pakistan, at an average of 58.1. There is little to argue that Khawaja has been a fine batsmen in home conditions, but his game against spin was greatly exposed on turning pitches - in both Tests as well as ODIs. However, he is confident of making it to the squad for the India tour. \n\"I know the team (for India) hasn't been picked but you've just got to be prepared no matter what. It's always something you've got to be mindful of, even when you're playing white-ball cricket. \n\"I'll wait until the team is picked and then it will be easier to plan out.\" \nKhawaja has studied Indian spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin, analysed his mode of dismissals during the Sri Lanka series and is willing to bring in a new approach to his game based on his observations of the two. \n\"At the end of the day, I think the most important thing is ... whoever goes over there, it's all about experience,\" Khawaja said. \"India is a tough place to play cricket, as a lot of other places are. It's always tough when you go to England, or go to South Africa. \n\"They are different conditions and that's what makes the challenge. And India is probably one of the greatest challenges because it's the most different to what we've grown up playing against. \nMuch like Matthew Hayden, who swept Indian bowlers to shreds during the 2001 Test series, Khawaja hopes to device a preparatory regime where he will duplicate the Indian conditions to practice and improve his technique against spin, and also look to be a bit more attacking in approach. \n\"From experience, you practice and practice and practice but until you get out in the middle and get put under pressure and have those experiences in the middle and find your way around it, it's just not the same,\" he concluded. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T08:53:36.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
