It is easy to use and the setup wizard even installs a demo course for you. It is a little more expensive and the pricing will add up if you choose to buy individual addons.\n3. LearnPress \nLearnPress is a free WordPress LMS plugin with powerful features. Unlike other LMS plugins in this list, which come with a setup wizard, LearnPress lets you do the setup which is not that difficult. \nCourse creation is easy with the help of lessons, quizzes, and questions. You can use lessons and quizzes from one course into another course.

Support is available from official forums for paid subscribers and limited support is offered to free users. \n4. WP Courseware \nWP Courseware is a popular WordPress LMS plugin.

It is easy to use and comes with flexible options which give you freedom to create engaging learning environment. Lack of built-in support to accept payments is a downside of using WP Courseware. Adding an eCommerce or Membership plugin can make things complicated for beginners. \n5. Sensei \nSensei is a powerful WordPress LMS Plugin created by the folks behind WooCommerce. It is flexible and easy to use and follows the same best practices as WordPress and WooCommerce. \nCourse creation with Sensie is easy but it is not as powerful as with other solutions. You can run quizzes, assignments, grade them automatically or manually, and even offer badges and certificates to students. \nTo sell your courses and accept payments you will need to use WooCommerce. For each course you want to sell, you will have to create a product and then link it to your course. \nThere are not many third party integrations available. You can integrate Sensei with a membership plugin, but there is no addon for that. \nPricing: Starting from $129 for a single site license with 1 year of support and updates. \nGrade: B\nReview: Sensie is a good solution to offer online courses. If you already run an online store using WooCommerce , then this will perfectly integrate with your store. However, we feel that WooCommerce integration is hard for beginner users. There are also fewer features and addons for Sensei than other LMS plugins in this list. \nConclusion As we compared different WordPress LMS plugins, one thing became obvious that LearnDash is clearly the best option for most users. It is extremely easy to use with tons of features and lots of cool integrations for users who need them. \nLifterLMS is a close second with an intuitive user interface and great set of features. \nIf you would prefer a free option, then LearnPress can be a good choice.
