Common sense really,\" and \"That baby never shows emotions, she never smiles or cries. Itâ€™s weird.\" \nChrissy wrote: \"Imagine being this miserable. We are fine, thanks. Some people are just hell bent on being the f***ing worst.\" \nMeanwhile, earlier this month, Chrissy opened up about her battle with postpartum depression, which left her unable to muster up the energy to leave the house.

I mean, never. Not even a tiptoe outside. I'd ask people who came inside why they were wet. Was it raining? How would I know - I had every shade closed. \n\"Most days were spent on the exact same spot on the couch and rarely would I muster up the energy to make it upstairs for bed. John would sleep on the couch with me, sometimes four nights in a row. I started keeping robes and comfy clothes in the pantry so I wouldn't have to go upstairs when John went to work. There was a lot of spontaneous crying.\" Chrissy Teigen and John Legend (Photo: Rex Features) Chrissy Teigen wowed in a thigh-high split LBD (Photo: Getty) Read More Chrissy Teigen reveals battle with post-natal depression as she went on a downward spiral \nHowever, Chrissy finally saw a light at the end of the tunnel when she visited her GP and got diagnosed. \nShe shared: \"Before the holidays I went to my GP for a physical. John sat next to me. I looked at my doctor, and my eyes welled up because I was so tired of being in pain ... My doctor pulled out a book and started listing symptoms. And I was like, 'Yep, yep, yep.' I got my diagnosis: postpartum depression and anxiety.

John had that same excitement. I started taking an antidepressant, which helped. \n\"And I started sharing the news with friends and family - I felt like everyone deserved an explanation, and I didn't know how else to say it other than the only way I know: just saying it. It got easier and easier to say it aloud every time.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T06:48:31.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
