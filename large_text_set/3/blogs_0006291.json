It actually used Facebook log-in for user sign-up so if anything it is/was a Facebook app. If you’re looking for a comparison, the focus on image collages and video made So.cl a little like a Pinterest-style service for visual content. \nEither way, So.cl quietly existed outside of the mainstream social bubble garnering little attention for itself, but now, after more than five years, it will cease to exist from March 15, Microsoft Research said in a brief post blog : \nSocl has been a wonderful outlet for creative expression, as well as a place to enjoy a supportive community of like-minded people, sharing and learning together. In supporting you, Socl’s unique community of creators, we have learned invaluable lessons in what it takes to establish and maintain community as well as introduce novel new ways to make, share and collect digital stuff we love. \nSo there you go, remember that time Microsoft had a social network. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:47:13.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
