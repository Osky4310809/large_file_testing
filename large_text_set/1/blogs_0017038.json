Carson was asked by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) about his controversial statements on protections for the LGBT community. During his failed 2016 presidential campaign, Carson claimed that Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision on same-sex marriage, amounts to “extra rights.” The White House hopeful has repeatedly reiterated this belief — that LGBT equality affords the community undue, unnecessary privileges. \nOn Thursday, the Trump appointee did not back down from that argument. “Of course, I will enforce all the laws of the land,” Carson said, adding: “No one gets extra rights. . . . Extra rights means you get to redefine everything for everyone else.” \nWhat’s alarming about Carson’s statement is he actually wasn’t being asked about his opposition marriage equality. Brown, who serves as the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was grilling the Republican figure on whether he would protect the LGBT community from discrimination in federal housing, which Carson dismissed as frivolity. This is a grave reminder that Carson could do serious damage to federal housing programs by ignoring the egregious bigotry queer and trans people face every day when trying to find something as simple as a place to live. \nCarson, who has repeatedly made headlines for his incendiary, outlandish statements about the LGBT community, is no friend to queer people. \nThe “Gifted Hands” author is one of the nation’s most vocal opponents of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples, which he has equated to bestiality , polygamy , and pedophilia . During a speech he delivered at the Pensmore National Symposium on Religious Liberty, a 2016 conference held at Missouri’s College of the Ozarks, Carson warned that the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling was a harbinger of an “ever-growing government” that would lead to “utter chaos,” as well as mass executions. \n“The peace we experience now will be a memory only,” Carson said. \nThe idea that these granting same-sex couples the same rights to have their relationships recognized and protected by federal law constitutes special benefits for a niche community is an old one and a favorite of conservatives. It suggests that, as Jeff Sessions argued earlier this week in his own confirmation hearing, these communities don’t experience discrimination. If they’re already being equally protected under the law, why do they need more laws granting them those same protections? \nBobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana who also mounted an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2016, even used the “extra rights” reasoning to argue for targeting the basic civil liberties of the LGBT community. \nDuring an interview with “Meet the Press,” Jindal claimed that making LGBT people a “protected class” — borrowing phraseology from hate crime legislation — would amount to “extraordinary circumstances.” Citing greater “tolerance” in society that makes such “special legal protections” unnecessary, Jindal backed the introduction of a “religious liberty” bill in the Pelican State. Such legislation would allow businesses to deny services to customers on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, so long as they cite “sincerely held religious belief.” Numerous LGBT advocates have argued this is a clear pathway to broad-based discrimination. \nAs the Secretary of Department of Housing and Urban Development, Carson would have little authority to impact already settled cases on nationwide marriage equality. But if he feels that LGBT protections are unnecessary, that would give him the ability to harm particularly vulnerable communities that already experience extraordinary discrimination at every turn. \nA survey from the National Center for Transgender Equality found that 20 percent of transgender people report being denied housing on the basis of their gender identity, while 10 percent even say they’ve been evicted for being trans. This widespread discrimination even extends to homeless shelters. When the Center for American Progress called local shelters to see if they would house a transgender woman, just 30 percent said they would do so. Twenty-two percent outright refused, and one center in Virginia said that sharing space with a “man” would spook the other residents, citing unfounded fears of sexual assault. \nThese practices should be illegal, yet unfortunately they persist. As the Center for American Progress reports, LGBT people are not explicitly protected under the Fair Housing Act, also known as the Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. This law protects tenants under the basis of characteristics like sex, race, religion, or national origin, but does not explicitly name gender identity or sexual orientation. \nLast year, the Department of Housing and Urban Development attempted to remedy this issue by introducing the Equal Access Rule . The law states that housing units and homeless shelters that receive federal dollars cannot discriminate on the basis of gender identity. \nThis provision, while a necessary step forward in ending the housing discrimination that leads to extremely high rates of homelessness among transgender people, will likely face a fight from the Trump White House. Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, has already claimed that the incoming administration will seek to roll back protections for trans students enacted under the Obama presidency. In 2016, the administration issued guidance saying that transgender youth had the right to equal access in schools under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. \nWhen it comes to public housing, Carson is unlikely to fight against the repeal of equivalent protections for trans people. In a speech delivered at the Republican National Convention , he referred to “the whole transgender thing” as “absurd.” \n“For thousands of years, mankind has known what a man is and what a woman is, and now, all of a sudden we don’t know anymore,” Carson said. “Now, is that the height of absurdity? Because today you feel like a woman, even though everything about you genetically says that you’re a man or vice versa? Wouldn’t that be the same as if you woke up tomorrow morning after seeing a movie about Afghanistan or reading some books and said, ‘You know what? I’m Afghanistan [sic]. I know I don’t look that way.’” \nThese views are ludicrously ill-informed, but with Carson as a part of Trump’s Cabinet, they will have power. His perspectives will have the authority and influence to deepen the extreme marginalization to which transgender people are already subjected. \nTrans individuals, particularly trans women of color, are more likely than any other group to be the victim of a hate crime. They are disproportionately likely to live under the poverty line , be underemployed , or not have a job at all . Transgender people face higher rates of sexual assault , domestic violence , and suicide , all of which illustrates an important reality. This community doesn’t have extra rights. Trans folks have almost no privileges at all, especially under a hostile administration that’s on the verge of stripping them of access to life-saving medical care under the Affordable Care Act. \nWhat Carson doesn’t understand is that trans people aren’t asking for extra privileges, just basic equality. They want the same things all of us do: safe, fair housing and to live their lives without fear. There’s nothing special about wanting to live your life without wondering whether you’ll be homeless tomorrow just because of who you are.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:35:08.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
