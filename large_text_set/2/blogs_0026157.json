Newcastle's three away games in a week will shape the Championship title race \nIn the next seven days Newcastle will travel to Brighton, Huddersfield and Reading to play the three clubs in the Championship with the best home records \nBy Martin Laurence for WhoScored? , part of the Guardian Sport Network Newcastle’s next three matches will be crucial in the Championship title race. Photograph: WhoScored   Martin Laurence   14.06 GMT \nN ewcastle were top of the Championship when they welcomed 20th-place Bristol City to St James’ Park on Saturday afternoon. With three tough away fixtures coming up after the visit of Lee Johnson’s team, the Newcastle players would have been looking for a simple afternoon’s work. It didn’t turn out that way. \nBristol City had taken just two points from the last 33 available on their travels, but they raced into a 2-0 lead within 21 minutes. Newcastle came back to secure a 2-2 draw but Rafa Benítez will consider it two points lost rather than one gained as his team looks forward to a week that could define their season. \nIn the next seven days Newcastle face three tough away trips: against Brighton tonight, Huddersfield on Saturday evening and Reading next Tuesday night. All three teams are in the top six and they boast the three best home records in the league this season in terms of points per game. Between them they have played 50 home games this season, winning 36 of them. Newcastle have been excellent on the road this season – picking up six more points from away matches (35) than any other team – but they will have to be at their best to take points off their direct rivals. \nFirst up Newcastle face top of the table Brighton , who have been the epitome of efficiency this season. Chris Hughton’s side rank ninth for shots per game (13.5), eighth for possession (50.9%), seventh for pass accuracy (76.5%), sixth for tackles per game (17.3 is sixth) and fifth for shots conceded (11.7), but their ability to convert their pressure into goals has set them apart. \nBrighton have scored 57 goals – only Newcastle have scored more, with 64 – from a modest shot tally, making Glenn Murray’s total of 16 (14 of which have been scored at home) hugely welcome. Tomer Hemed , Sam Baldock and Anthony Knockaert have all reached double figures and no side has scored more goals on the counterattack. Knockaert has been especially dangerous, adding a further seven assists to his 11 goals, making the French winger our highest rated player in the Championship this season. \nHuddersfield have not scored as many goals as Newcastle, Brighton or Reading but they have been among the most entertaining teams in the league. They rank third for possession (55.6%) and fourth for shots per game (14.1) and dribbles (10.8). Their ability to keep the ball has helped them concede fewer shots than any other team in the league – and concede just 13 goals in their 16 home matches. \nLike Brighton, Huddersfield will pose a considerable threat down the right flank. Paul Dummett, who has not always convinced at left-back for Newcastle, needs to be at his best next Saturday to deal with Hudderfield’s top scorer Elias Kachunga. The German is usually deployed from the right in Hudderfield’s 4-2-3-1 formation and he will be backed up by impressive right-back Tommy Smith, who has three goals and nine assists in the league this season. Smith’s willingness to make overlapping runs when Kachunga cuts infield is a real feature of Huddersfield’s play. Brighton promotion would be bigger feat than taking Newcastle up, says Hughton Read more \nReading are similar to Huddersfield in the sense that they place considerable importance on possession, which may be a minor blessing as far as Benitez’s planning is concerned. Jaap Stam has inspired a complete turnaround in the team’s approach, with the team now looking to win by starving their opponents of the ball. Only Fulham have averaged a greater share of possession (58.1%) in the Championship this season – and Reading are also second to Fulham for pass accuracy (81.1%). \nReading keep the ball well but they rank way down in 18th for shots per game (12.2) and they have conceded considerably more shots than they have attempted – 14.8 per game is the third highest in the league. They are prone to conceding goals on the break – which is worth bearing in mind for Newcastle – and have relied on the heroics of Ali Al-Habsi on a number of occasions, with the veteran keeper’s rating of 6.98 giving him a place in our Championship team of the season so far. \nNewcastle have been guilty of complacency at times this season. If they show any carelessness at Brighton, Huddersfield or Reading, their season could unravel in the space of a week. However, if they avoid defeat in these games, their promotion bid will be in excellent shape despite a string of underwhelming results this year.
