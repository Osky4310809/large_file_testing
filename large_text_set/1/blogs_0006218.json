Sainz lost over two hours because of the roll, which put him out of contention for a rally win. He was only 3.1 miles from the end of Stage 4. \nSainz and codriver Lucas Cruz were trying to make up for lost time from an earlier navigational error when the roll occurred, per Road & Track . Sainz ran wide on the turn, essentially becoming a passenger in the car thanks to the lack of runoff. Fortunately, Sainz escaped with only a little pain in his back, however, his Peugeot 3008DKR’s cooling system and gearbox were both damaged. \nThe spectators appear to have run away in time to escape harm.

Two-time winner and possible savior of Volkswagen’s 2017 WRC cars Nasser Al-Attiyah retired the morning after Stage 3 due to extensive damage to his Toyota Hilux caused by a giant pothole, per Red Bull . \nThey don’t make Hiluxes like they used to , man. Al-Attiyah’s accident happened while he was leading the rally, making it even more painful to see.

If 12-time Dakar Rally winner Stephane Peterhansel wasn’t in the lead, I’d say Dakar wants a brand-new set of winners this year.
