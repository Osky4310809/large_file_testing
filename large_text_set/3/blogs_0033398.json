He’s also authored three full-length books and three Amazon Kindle Single e-books, including 2015’s The Bern Identity: A Search for Bernie Sanders and the New American Dream. Prior to coming to Philadelphia, he worked at New York Newsday, where he was part of a team that won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for spot news reporting. \nthis week's vote in Congress to strip Obama-era internet privacy protections struck a new low in the not-at-all-draining-the-swamp politics have ruled the day since Trump and the ultra-conservative 115th Congress went to work on behalf of their corporate masters this January. \nromised America that his administration would be dedicated to \" the forgotten men and women of this country ,\" he forgot to add that they'd be remembered for the lurid websites they visited -- or maybe for living near once pristine local streams that Big Coal companies are now allowed to pollute , or for their naivety in believing that Trump would take on Wall Street instead of hiring its leaders . \nnot a detail guy -- which was pretty obvious in watching the health care debacle cash and burn like the Hindenburg. But there is still much that he can delegate: Bannon and Trump's cabinet push banally evil stuff like the travel ban or brutal ICE tactics , while the GOP majority in Congress -- whose support is critical for the president as the Russia scandal unravels -- is following the path of least resistance, which is passing the bills drafted by corporate lobbyists. \nthe nation's largest internet service provider , or ISP, with more than half of America's broadband customers. \nThat's according to the Center for Responsive Politics . \nAccording to the CRP , Comcast employees and PACs gave them just under $1.5 million -- $1,492,544, to be exact. That doesn't include donations to other causes -- so-called \"leadership PACs, or party committees -- that also benefit the 266 non-swamp-drainers inside the Beltway. It also doesn't include the millions more they received in past election cycles. \nRep. Pat Meehan , whose district sprawls across Philadelphia's western suburbs and exurbs like a wounded butterfly, received $33,600 in Comcast-related donations for his 2016 re-election, and the only House Republican who got more was powerful House Speaker Paul Ryan ($46,301). In the other chamber, Sen. Pat Toomey may be hard to find for his constituents but Comcast knows where to deliver the checks, with $33,200, the second most for GOP senators behind Missouri's Roy Blount. \nyou can follow all of their money here . \nhas the backing of somewhere on the order of zero percent of the American public . Indeed, support for internet privacy is one of the few things left that unite liberals, conservatives, centrists, Trotskyites, practitioners of Zoroastrianism...you name it. Even commenters on Breitbart News, the pro-Trump website recently controlled by top aide Steve Bannon, are enraged . \nfor oil companies to bribe foreign governments , which were the first two laws passed by this Congress and signed by Trump? \nchortling over Trump's 35 percent approval rating , Republicans are still using executive orders and small-bore legislation to make America safe for polluters and corporate hegemony. And the damage is going to take years to undo, even if 2018 is a \"wave\" election for Democrats. \nblock the Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch , who has a record of supporting few if any checks on corporate power , and is unlikely to overturn or undermine the Citizens United ruling that allowed for the flood of big money into our elections. The last thing this country needs is for our politics to get even more Comcastic in the decades to come.
