Bob Goodlatte, enabler of corruption \nIf you were holding out some hope that congressional Republicans would put some kind of limits on how corrupt Donald Trump could be, check out how they’re gutting their own ethical oversight : \nDespite a warning from Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), House Republicans on Monday adopted a proposal by Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) to put the Office of Congressional Ethics under the jurisdiction of the House Ethics Committee. \nThe office currently has free rein, enabling investigators to pursue allegations and then recommend further action to the House Ethics Committee as they see fit. \nNow, the office would be under the thumb of lawmakers themselves. The proposal also appears to limit the scope of the office’s work by barring them from considering anonymous tips against lawmakers. And it would stop the office from disclosing the findings of some of their investigations, as they currently do after the recommendations go to House Ethics. \nRepublicans voted the proposal through 119 to 74; it will be part of a bigger package of House rules to be voted on Tuesday afternoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T04:41:10.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
