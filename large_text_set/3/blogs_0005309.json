Subban’s return to Montreal was coming. On Thursday, the Predators took to the ice to play the Canadiens as Subban returned to Montreal for the first time. \nIt was always going to be emotional, not only for Canadiens fans but also for Subban himself. Those emotions came to the forefront during Montreal’s heartwarming tribute to Subban’s seven seasons with the club before the start of the game.\nWhat a beautiful tribute! An emotional P.K. Subban is saluted by the @CanadiensMTL for his time playing with the #Habs . #NSHvsMTL #Preds pic.twitter.com/hUTNrkzGeH \n— FOX Sports Tennessee (@PredsOnFSTN) March 3, 2017 The video features highlights of Subban’s time in a Canadiens’ sweater, and also his endless philanthropy to the city of Montreal. \nIt was enough to make Subban visibly emotional and in tears by the time the tribute was done.\nWhat a moment in Montreal as P.K. Subban gets a massive standing ovation from @CanadiensMTL fans. pic.twitter.com/aH4c8G57Fm \n— Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) March 3, 2017 A well-deserved tribute and a standing ovation.
