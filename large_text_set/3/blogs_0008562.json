PPD \nMANILA, Philippines - By threatening to declare martial law in Mindanao, President Duterte was merely trying to “underscore the depth and breadth of lawlessness and violence” in the region and did not mean to alarm the public, his spokesman said yesterday. \n“The context of the statement was the challenge to the local chief executives in Mindanao to be more fully engaged in the regional challenges, otherwise he would be constrained to enforce more drastic measures,” Ernesto Abella said. \nBy raising the prospect of martial law, Abella said Duterte “is hopeful that local leaders would realize the magnitude of the law and order problem and consequently help his administration to fight terrorism, illegal drugs and other forms of violence.” \nOn Thursday, Duterte called on local executives in Mindanao to help him in the fight against extremism, terrorism and rebellion or he would be compelled to declare martial law. \nHe also urged them to maximize the use of their police forces to prevent terrorism from spinning out of control. \n“I am asking you… because then as President, I will be forced, I will be compelled to exercise extraordinary powers,” Duterte told local officials in Davao City. “Either you help me or I will declare martial law tomorrow (in) Mindanao.”   \nSenate President Aquilino Pimentel III also downplayed President Duterte’s latest pronouncements on martial law. \n“(There’s) no need to be alarmed because if martial law is declared in Mindanao, that would really be based on the need for it and in areas which need to be put under ‘control’ to bring back normalcy and sense of law and order,” Pimentel said in a text message to reporters. \nWhen Duterte threatened to declare martial law last January, Pimentel also asked the public not to make much out of such pronouncements even as he stressed there was no justification for authoritarian rule in the country. \nPimentel earlier said Duterte’s statement – even if hypothetical – was in conformity to the Constitution. \nSen. Ralph Recto, for his part, said Filipinos should be used to the “theatrical bombast” of Duterte, whose “bluster should be likened to a dog that always barks but seldom bites.” \n“There is no basis to declare martial law. Rebellion has been tamed. No foreign army is steaming towards our shores to invade us. And as the President himself likes to brag, crime is down and the people are safe in their homes and communities,” Recto said. \n“And as to the real enemies of the people –joblessness, hunger, poor social services – these cannot by suppressed by the armed forces,” he said. He described martial law as a cure worse than the perceived disease. \n“At a time when we project stability to reel in tourists and investors, a martial law declaration will show the opposite, of how unstable we are,” the senator said. \nSen. Franklin Drilon had also cautioned Duterte against making statements that could cause fear and tension among the people. Justified order \nWhile it may have caused jitters in some quarters, the President’s directive to the military to unleash its whole might against the New People’s Army (NPA) is an indication of his determination to stop lawlessness in the country, military spokesman Col. Edgard Arevalo said. \n“That pronouncement of the President allowing or giving us permission to make use of the jets and rockets of the AFP only mirrors his desire to end this menace brought by the NPAs,” he said. \nArevalo, however, stressed the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) would use its might with caution and that careful intelligence gathering would be made so that every operation would be surgical in nature. \nDuterte’s order for the military to destroy the NPA came in the wake of the killing of four policemen in an ambush believed to be carried out by the guerrillas in Davao del Sur. \n“We will deploy and use these assets when they are extremely needed and in intelligence-driven missions. If aircraft will be deployed it will only be used for surgical operations,” Arevalo said. \nThe ambush-slay meanwhile has also prompted the Philippine National Police (PNP) to place all its units in “active defense mode.” \n“We have taken an active defense at the stations and have our mobile units continue to have active support to the AFP in going after terrorists and insurgent groups,” PNP spokesman Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos told reporters yesterday. \n“We will review the camp defense plan. We will look at the intelligence information if there is a plan to target a police station,” he said. \nMeanwhile, a soldier was killed and another seriously wounded in an attack by about 50 NPA rebels Thursday night in Barangay Budlingin, Alegria, Surigao del Norte. \nAlegria, Surigao del Norte police chief Insp. Juan Belarmino said the firefight lasted for about 30 minutes. \nLt. Col. Rico Amaro, 30th IB Philippine Army commander, said the Sandatahang Yunit Propaganda-Lumad, Guerilla Front 16 Northeastern Mindanao regional committee under a certain Ka Ricky was behind the attack. \n“A tribal leader opposing the recruitment of the terrorist NPA rebels was killed in the same area last year,” Amaro said. \nMeanwhile, Ka Ariel Montero in a press statement claimed the NPA rebels were preparing to release PFC Erwin Salan last March 2 but were prevented from doing so by attacks by Amaro’s men. \n“We are serious about releasing Salan as a show of support for NDFP stand on the resumption of peace talks but some people in the Army don’t seem to want peace by waging war instead,” Montero said. Protests \nMilitant youth groups, meanwhile, yesterday criticized President Duterte for threatening to declare martial law in Mindanao if local officials fail to solve the region’s security problems. \nLikening Duterte to the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the League of Filipino Students (LFS) said the violations of human rights and civil liberties during martial law persist under the present administration. \n“After seven months in power, Duterte is becoming more and more like Marcos. He is more than willing to kill the Filipino people and employ state terrorism across the country. Even before he declares martial law, either in Mindanao or the whole country, there are already countless human rights violations committed by the regime,” LFS spokesman JP Rosos said. \n“In the strongest possible terms, we condemn Duterte for his threats to declare martial law. Despite knowing the violations of human rights and civil liberties that martial law entails, Duterte unacceptably dangles this threat to the people,” he added. \nMembers of youth group Anakbayan trooped to Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City to protest the latest statements made by the President, including his order for the military to “unleash its weapons” against the NPA. \nAnakbayan said the public should not take Duterte’s statements lightly as it could result in more killings across the country. \n“Duterte’s order for military forces to flatten the hills with bombs in its ruthless counterinsurgency war is bound to result in more human rights abuses and sow terror in civilian communities,” the group said. \nIn Congress, Kabataan party-list Rep. Sarah Elago also criticized Duterte’s threat to declare martial law. \n“Martial law is the only logical conclusion in the Duterte administration’s maneuvers to reinstate an atmosphere of fascism and terror in the country,” said the lawmaker. \n“Martial law will only pave the way for greater and graver state-sanctioned atrocities and killings, and would worsen the number of casualties since the start of all-out war. Hindi pa ba tayo natututo (Haven’t we learned)?” she added. – Paolo Romero, Jaime Laude, Ben Serrano, Emmanuel Tupas, Janvic Mateo  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:28:59.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
