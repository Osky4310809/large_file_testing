The Nokia 3310, which was released in the year 2000, was groundbreaking at the time, with its sturdiness, durability and long battery life making it a favourite of customers the world over. Its new avatar will be revealed at the Mobile World Congress later this month, according to leaker Evan Blass, who first revealed the details . Image courtesy: YouTube \nThe phone is said to be priced at €59, and will make for an ideal second phone for those who want to relive their good old days. While Nokia was bought out by Microsoft in 2014 in a $7.9 billion deal, phones made under the Nokia brand are also sold by HMD Global, a Finnish company that bought the rights to their name. HMD itself will be doing the big reveal of three new Nokia phones - Nokia 3, 5 and 6 – at the same MWC event. \nThe 3310 is still available on Amazon, albeit sold by a host of other manufacturers rather than Nokia or HMD themselves. In fact, the four games that came built into the phone - Snake II, Pairs II, Space Impact and Bantumi - were just as iconic as the phone itself, and Snakes II was actually made available even to iPhone, Android and Windows phone users. \nNokia did not have as great a stint in the smartphone era, however, and this led to its acquisition. But since then, they have come out with revamped versions of a host of their phones, like the Nokia 215, which costs $29.
