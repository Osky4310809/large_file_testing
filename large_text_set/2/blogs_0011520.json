Justin Johnston being sworn in as Constable Pct. 1 for Liberty... \nLiberty County Precinct 1 Constable Justin Johnston remains hospitalized at the Texas Medical Center after he was struck by a truck near Dayton, officials confirmed Wednesday. \nJohnston was hit about 5:15 p.m. Wednesday while he was helping to directing afternoon rush-hour traffic along a stretch of State Highway 146 north of Mont Belvieu, troops with the Texas Department of Public Safety said. \nInvestigators said a man in a pickup truck tried to avoid the backed-up traffic by driving along the southbound shoulder. The driver crashed through a traffic barricade and struck a Liberty County Sheriff's Office patrol car. \nThe pickup then hit Johnston, DPS troopers said. \nJohnston and the driver of the pickup, identified as Samuel Leyva, 39, were flown by Life Flight helicopter to Memorial Hermann Hospital. \nDPS officials said Johnston was in critical condition while Leyva, a Cleveland resident, was in serious condition. \nThe driver's 8-year-old daughter had minor injuries and was flown with her father to the Texas Medical Center, officials said. \nA sample of Leyva's blood will be taken at the hospital to determine if he was impaired at the time of the crash, officials said. \nThe investigation into the crash is continuing, officials said.
