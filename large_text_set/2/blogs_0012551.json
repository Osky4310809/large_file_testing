You know that annual, uncomfortable lull between winter and spring when your relationship with the weather worsens? So does your tolerance for the inept silhouettes that don’t deliver. Well, that’s the “transition” the high guards of fashion keep talking about. It may not be a familiar phenomenon,but it sure is a familiar feeling. Slipping into a pair of boots feels too warm, yet strapping on a foot-baring flat, a tad too naked. So, how do you layer right when it’s a thin line between balmy and nippy?

Trade your longer lengths for a cute 60s mini to go with your fancy, going-out sweater. sanjanabatra/via Instgram 7. Pick a shift dress, and layer it under a cute shirt so that the occasional cold winds don’t spoil your sass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:48:58.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
