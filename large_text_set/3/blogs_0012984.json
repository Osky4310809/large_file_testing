Cowboys player Matt Scott looks is out for the season injured. Source: AAP \n“(Korbin Sims) Simsy has come along well and is playing some good footy. \n“Coen Hess is playing well. The two Kaufusi boys — one at Melbourne (Felise) and one at the Cowboys (Pat). They’re all young fellas coming through. \n“There’s a couple other at Melbourne like Tim Glasby. He started with Jesse Bromwich out so that’s always a big help. Whoever puts their hand up from those guys, that’s where it’ll come from.” \nBen Ikin, Nathan Ryan and Ben Glover are joined by Dragons recruitment boss Ian Millward to discuss the club’s recruitment plan and why it revolves around Ben Hunt. \nYou can also subscribe via iTunes or for Android users, listen on the iPP Podcast Player app. \nWhile Hess isn’t a forward, that won’t hinder his chances for selection. \nAt 20, Hess has only played 11 NRL games. \nBut he’s already scored seven tries, averages 86 running metres and 55 minutes per game. Scott leaves 'big hole' 1:03 \nThe Cowboys backrower is very much in the mix to make his Origin debut this year with Walters having the luxury of playing someone like Sam Thaiday up front to create a space in the backrow. \nIt’s a role Thaiday has played before and gives the Maroons coaching staff options due to Thaiday’s versatility. \n“Sam’s pretty flexible with the way he played on the left edge for us last year,” Walters explained. \n“Sam will be in there but how we use him will be something we have to come up with. I was really happy with how he played for us last year and he’s playing on the left for the Broncos but we’re fortunate with guys like Sam who are flexible with where they can play.” \nDownload the new FOX SPORTS App to get the latest news and scores from your NRL team.
