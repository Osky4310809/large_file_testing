Jerry Alagbaoso was meant to give the NCS more financial, administrative and operational latitude as the second largest revenue generating agency in the country. \nHe said: “it is evident that one of the factors militating against innovation and efficiency in the Nigerian Customs Service is the lack of autonomy in the formulation and execution of its operational policies without recourse to the Ministry of Finance. \n“Hence the agreement with service providers is always entered on behalf of the Nigerian Customs Service by the Federal Ministry of Finance and not by the Nigerian Customs Service itself.“This always led to unnecessary delays in Customs’ operations. In the ports, for example, in the event of scanners’ breakdown, or failure, the Nigerian Customs Service does not have direct access to the suppliers of the scanners because the service providers still retained the franchise of their repairs and ought to service or maintain them according to their agreement and understanding with federal Ministry of Finance.” \nAlagbaoso said the situation in which the Minister of Finance is the Chairman of the Board of Customs does not give room for the effective monitoring of the affairs of the Agency. \n“Hence the need to reduce the burden on the Minister by providing through this bill a robust management structure through a Customs Service Commission which would ensure discipline and promote accountability in line with both Customs and Excise Management Act and the change mantra of the present federal government.” \nWhen the Speaker. Yakubu Dogara called for a voice; the bill passed without dissent and was referred to the relevant committee for further legislative input. \nIn a related development, the House also yesterday mandated its committee on Customs and Excise to investigate reasons for banning the auction of seized goods by the NCS and to determine if the decision has caused the country any financial loss. \nThe resolution of the House was sequel to the passage of a motion sponsored by a member Prestige Ossy with the title: ‘ Urgent need to investigate the failure of the Nigerian Customs Service to auction confiscated goods” \nThe lawmaker while presenting the motion noted that in 2015, the Nigerian Customs banned the auction sale of goods seized by the Service and legally forfeited to the Federal Government. \n“Since the imposition of the ban, there has not been any form of auction sale by the Service and this has ultimately resulted in the proliferation of seized goods at the various formations of the Nigerian Customs Service,” the lawmaker said. \nAccording to him, “the list of seized goods include vehicles , trucks, containers of assorted household goods, clothing materials, consumables etc, and a large number of these goods have been gazetted and forfeited to the federal government on the orders of various courts in the country.” \nHe said the failure of the NCS to set up a website for auctioning the goods as earlier promised is ” denying the federal government of resources worth over N1 trillion which ought to have accrued to it from the auctioning of those goods.” \nMembers also supported the passage of the motion sequel to a call for voice votes by the Speaker.
