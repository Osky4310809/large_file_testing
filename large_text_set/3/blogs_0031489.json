With today’s move, Fryer has officially won a reserve spot with the Cardinals once again. He’ll serve as the backup to Yadier Molina in 2017 and could also function as a stopgap of sorts while highly touted catching prospect Carson Kelly continues to develop in the minors. \nWith Fryer’s addition to the Opening Day roster, the Cardinals are largely set on the position-player side of the equation, as can be seen on their depth chart at RosterResource.com. The veteran Fryer will be joined on the Cardinals’ bench by the likes of Matt Adams , Jedd Gyorko (who figures to platoon with Kolten Wong ), Greg Garcia and Jose Martinez , who won the team’s reserve outfield role over the weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:59:55.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
