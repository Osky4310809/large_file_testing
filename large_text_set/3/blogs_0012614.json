Everything must be tightly controlled.” \nIn England, a similar program of chemical castration was tested at Whatton Prison in Nottinghamshire with 100 volunteers. Researchers involved with monitoring the situation found the results to be “encouraging.” \nUnlike physical castration, the chemical process does not remove organs, and is not a form of sterilization.
