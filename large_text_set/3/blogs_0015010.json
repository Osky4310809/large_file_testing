He said he learned a lot about “the Patriot Way” from his time practicing against New England the past two summers. \n“It’s a first-class place — a place you’d love to be a part of,” Cooks said. “When we practiced against them, it was always competitive. These are they type of teams you want to go against to better yourself. So to be on a team like this now, it’s amazing.” \nCooks reportedly grew frustrated with his role in the Saints’ offense last season and left a cryptic message on Instagram a day after contributing zero yards in the Saints’ blowout win over the Rams in November.

Coaches thank you for always pushing me to be the best I can be. Fans you guys have been nothing but great to me and I couldn’t be more thankful! To the guys in the locker room your support never went unnoticed. My love for you all is deep.
