The building also has been criticized by players because of the quality of the ice in an arena that was not designed with hockey in mind. \nNewsday has reported that the owners have spoken about a new arena, either near Citi Field or Belmont racetrack. Without elaborating or giving specifics, Bettman basically confirmed that. \n“There are some issues about playing in Barclays, it may be fundamental to the ice system and that’s not something that can be fixed in the short term,” the commissioner said. “I think as is prudent, Scott Malkin and Jon Ledecky are reviewing the situation and looking very seriously at what their options are.” Subscribe to Newsday’s sports newsletter \nReceive stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T01:01:00.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
