But the 76ers had won just 24 games coming into the game, exactly the kind of opponent the Warriors needed to face during this slide. \nBut if the first half is any indication, Golden State is in for another close one. No sequence in the first half perfectly summed up this situation than the hustle play T.J. McConnell pulled off at Steph Curry’s expense in the second quarter. \nWith the score tied, Curry attempted to inbound the ball, opting to lob a pass that he assumed would be out of McConnell’s reach. But the 24-year-old point guard leaped up and snatched the pass out of the air and initiated the fast break, which he finished with a layup. Heads up play from TJ! #MadeInPhila pic.twitter.com/J8UyYTBZpY", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:59:42.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
