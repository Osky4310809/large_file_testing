But their claims of improper contacts between Sessions and Russian officials are laughable.\nThis is how today's far-left Democrats work. Not winning any political arguments of late, they have to be satisfied with smearing decent people trying to do a job. That would be the courtly, respected Sessions, whom Democrats loathe.\nLed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the Democrats have made the wild claim that Sessions should quit, simply because, well, they've accused him of something.\n\"Because the Department of Justice should be above reproach, for the good of the country Attorney General Sessions should resign ,\" said Schumer. The hypocrisy in this statement is clear, since it's only far-left members of Schumer's party who've \"reproached\" Sessions.\nLet's review the case. The allegation is that Sessions met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak , once in July and again in September of 2016, but didn't report it when asked if he had met with Russian officials while serving as a Trump campaign surrogate. His answer was no.\nAnd he was right. He did in fact meet twice with the ambassador, but he says it was as a part of his job as a member of the Armed Services Committee — not as a Trump campaign adjunct. There's a very big difference.\nAs Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, correctly said: \"He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign — not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.\"\nEven so, Sessions has agreed to recuse himself from the ongoing Democrat-driven FBI investigation of the nonstory of Russian contacts with the Trump campaign.\nLet's make something clear: The Democrats don't really care about Russia, or its potential threat to our country. If they did, they wouldn't have sat mute for eight years under President Obama while he and Hillary Clinton vainly pushed the \"reset\" button and pursued an open policy of appeasement with Vladimir Putin. These actions of craven, self-abasing weakness only incurred Putin's contempt and encouraged him to seize the Crimea, invade Ukraine, forge a nuclear alliance with Iran, and meddle in the Mideast, all at our expense.\nWhere were your party's calls for an investigation then, Sen. Schumer?\nOf course, there's a reason all this is happening: Barack Obama, who has taken up residence in Washington, D.C., mainly to serve as a thorn in President Trump's side.\nThe New York Times reveals that the Obama administration secretly tried to undermine and sabotage Trump's presidency by, as the Daily Caller put it, waging \"a campaign to procure, save and disperse classified intelligence regarding Trump associates' contacts with Russians.\"\nAnd it was a coordinated effort of not just the White House but the intelligence agencies and the State Department, according to the Times. Just think of that: Three agencies of the federal government colluding to impede a new president as he takes office.\nBy the way, the Times report once again noted there was no evidence that Trump campaign officials coordinated in any way with Russians. And there's likewise no evidence that Russian tampering had any impact on the election.\nMeanwhile, sources for the Times story said the campaign was not directed by Obama himself. Maybe not.\nBut did he know of it and, therefore, tacitly approve of it? If so, using a public office for a political purpose is a violation of the law, and this is highly questionable if not illegal behavior by a former president.\nWill Schumer now call for an investigation of Obama and his aides for possible illegal interference with the operations of an incoming president? How about the Benghazi disaster? Or the IRS' targeting of conservative groups? Fast and Furious? Hillary Clinton's illegal email server? Or Obama signaling to Russia that he would have \"more flexibility\" after the 2012 election, which showed actual collusion with Russia to influence an American election? Somehow we doubt it.\nNo doubt, the politically motivated \"investigation\" of Sessions will continue. The Democrats, denied a chance to keep Sessions from getting the attorney general's post, are keen on getting a scalp.\nBut if no hard evidence emerges that incriminates Sessions and further evidence emerges of an illicit Obama administration spying operation on Trump, then Sen. Schumer should resign — as he might say, \"for the good of the country.\" And the investigation should turn to the still-active Obama administration.\nRELATED: \nThe Newspapers Bully Sen.
