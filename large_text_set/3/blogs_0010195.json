She made no comment. \nTaylor did not hide his face, walking with other male prisoners and also made no comment. \nNeither made any comment. \nTaylor’s parents, John and Janet from the UK, visited their son in the holding cell to provide support. \nThe couple was placed into separate holding cells along with other local prisoners behind the courtroom where they will later today both learn their fate media_camera Sara Connor is expected to be sentenced to six to eight years in jail. Picture: Lukman S. Bintoro \nThey face separate trials and verdicts and Taylor’s verdict is expected to be handed down first, during which time Connor will face an anxious wait in the holding cell, metres from the court. \nTaylor is expected to be convicted and sentenced to six to eight years in jail. He has confessed his role in the crime, apologised and written a letter of deep remorse to the victim’s widow, Ketut Arsini. Connor is expected to receive a similar sentence. \nProsecutors have demanded that both Connor and Taylor be convicted of group violence causing death and sentenced to eight years in jail. The maximum sentence for the crime is 12 years. \nThe couple faces three charges each — murder, carrying a 15-year maximum, group violence causing death and assault causing death, which carries seven years. \nThe judges however are not bound by the prosecutor’s demand and can find the couple guilty of any of the three charges and can deliver any sentence up to 15 years. \nThe body of veteran Bali police officer, Wayan Sudarsa, was found bloodied and dishevelled and sprawled on a Kuta beach in the early hours of August 17 last year. media_camera Sara Connor during her trial.

He died of blunt force trauma to the head. \nA doctor told the court that Sudarsa lived for two hours after the attack and his life may have been saved had he been taken to hospital. \nConnor’s NSW driver’s licence, along with her ATM card, were found in the sand near the body. \nConnor and Taylor were enjoying a romantic liaison in Bali when their holiday ended in jail. Connor had only arrived in Bali on the afternoon of August 16 and she and Taylor ate dinner at a restaurant and then bought a beer each to drink on the beach. \nWhile the couple was down at the water’s edge cuddling they noticed Connor’s small black handbag was missing and began a frantic search. \nTaylor says he met Wayan Sudarsa at the beach gate and the pair got into a fight after Taylor asked him about the bag and tried to pat him down, searching for it. \nThey ended up wrestling on the sand and Taylor says at one stage he feared for his life when the officer tried to choke him by pressing on his throat. He pleaded self-defence in the court and admitted his guilt. media_camera David Taylor is also expected to be sentenced to six to eight years in jail. Picture: News Corp \nConnor, by contrast, denied any role in the killing. She said she was not present for much of the fight and that when she discovered her boyfriend and the officer brawling, she launched herself into the middle of them to separate them. The officer bit her on the arm and thigh. \nTaylor says that when they left the beach that night the officer was still alive and breathing. He had rolled the body to face up and stolen his wallet and mobile phone. \nConnor says that at no stage did she know the officer was mortally wounded. As they left the beach, she says Taylor told her he was okay, just passed out. \nBack at their hotel, Connor cut up the ID cards which were in the officer’s wallet and they threw them in the garbage the next day. \nBoth Connor and Taylor have insisted that they did this to avoid identity theft. Initially they had planned to report Sudarsa to police but then decided not to give him any more trouble. He was dying by this time. \nThe prosecutors say this shows a consciousness of guilt on the part of Connor and Taylor, as does their burning of the clothes they were wearing on the night of the murder. \nUnder Indonesian law judges are required to take into account, on sentence, the defendant’s remorse and contrition and whether they confessed honestly to their crime. \nTaylor has done this but prosecutors, in their final summation of the case, were scathing of Connor’s failure to admit guilt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T07:56:19.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
