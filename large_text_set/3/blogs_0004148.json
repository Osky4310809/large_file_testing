Arpaio, who has pleaded not guilty to the charge, has acknowledged violating the order but insists his actions weren’t intentional. Sheriff Joe Arpaio legal troubles See full azcentral coverage \nThe 84-year-old could face up to six months in jail if convicted. His trial is set for April 25. \nProlonging the patrols fueled an increase in taxpayer-funded legal costs in the profiling case and is believed to have contributed to the Republican lawman’s election loss in November to Democrat Paul Penzone after 24 years in office. \nMel McDonald, Arpaio’s lawyer, said his client won’t appeal the latest decision. “It’s not surprising,” McDonald said, noting that Bolton had previously said she was leaning toward deciding the case herself. “We wanted a jury, but in life you don’t get everything you want.” \nMcDonald had argued that an elected official’s actions should be decided by an impartial jury of his peers and that he thought U.S. District Judge Murray Snow, who presides over the profiling case, was angry when he recommended the charge. \nBolton said people have no right to jury trials in cases in which their potential jail sentences are limited to six months or less. She also wrote that Snow’s motives aren’t relevant in determining whether Arpaio intentionally defied the court order. \nProsecutors argued the media-savvy Arpaio was trying to turn the trial into a political spectacle by having a jury hear the case. \nIt’s unclear how the Justice Department in the Trump administration will handle the case going forward. \nArpaio campaigned and shared the stage with Donald Trump on several occasions last year and has similar views on immigration as U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \nMcDonald declined to comment on whether he is seeking a pardon for his client.
