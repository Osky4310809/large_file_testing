Since then, it has been viewed thousands of times, showing a New Kensington police officer and another officer from the city of Arnold allegedly punching, stomping and putting a man in a chokehold. \nThat man has been identified as 40-year-old Justin Harvey. He was taken into custody in New Kensington, after a brief police chase and pursuit. \nChief Kline said the two officers involved in the confrontation have been placed on administrative leave. He says he also asked Westmoreland County District Attorney John Peck to investigate the video. \nWarning: This video contains vulgar language — \nTodd Hollis, an attorney retained by Harvey’s family, said, “Police want to build trust with the community, but when you look at the [cellphone] video, how can you even suggest that? If a picture is worth a thousand words, then this video was worth a million.” \nJeris Price, Harvey’s cousin, who showed up at the police station Friday night along with other family members, said, “The action of the police while he’s in custody is very disturbing. I thought the New Kensington Police were better than that.” \nWhen asked what he thought of the cellphone video, Chief Kline told KDKA-TV’s Ralph Iannotti, “It’s disturbing. We’re not going to condone any type of misconduct that’s done. We will let the facts be facts, and will let this play out.” \nA district judge held an arraignment for Harvey behind closed doors Friday night, because he said a crowd had started to gather outside and he was concerned for everyone’s safety. \nThe judge set bail at $75,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T13:02:58.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
