A clarified source of the original story is available in the tweets below, with the key taken away being that the pro-Trump Smith beieves that Trump would create “Bloody Friday” for ISIS by increasing pressure on the terrorist organization. However, Inauguration Day remains a terrorist target. Original story below. Re #FAKENEWS : The @Daily_Express story misquoting me re 'Bloody Friday' that's linked to @DRUDGE_REPORT is just that. Here are details… pic.twitter.com/OlA9SF65j9 \n— Michael S. Smith II (@MichaelSSmithII) December 5, 2016 \nIslamic State sympathizers in the United States are setting their sights on President-elect Trump’s Friday, January 20, 2017 Inauguration Day as an opportunity for a terrorist offensive in Washington, DC. \nThe report comes a week after ISIS in Indonesia released a propaganda video urging its followers to assassinate Trump. Watch it here. \nThe last ISIS-influenced attack in the US occurred just last week, when students returning to Ohio State University from Thanksgiving break were attacked by a Somali refugee named Abdul Razak Ali Artan. \nArtan drove a car into a group of people, which fits tactics distributed by ISIS to its supporters. On the day of the attack, police tweeted just before 10 a.m., “active shooter on campus. Run Hide Fight. Watts Hall. 19th and College.” The Columbus Dispatch reported that one person in the car had a gun while the other had a “large knife.” \nHowever, it was later revealed Artan was working alone and that no gun was found on his body or in the crime scene. \nWBNS reports that nine people were injured. \nLast month, an ISIS magazine article targeting the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade suggested to jihadists how to carry out a successful attack as a lone wolf operative. In the article, ISIS suggested that a lone wolf use a vehicle to plow into a crowd and to carry a secondary weapon. \nA similar attack claimed by ISIS was carried out this year on July 14 at a Bastille Day celebration in Nice, France by Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel . Bouhlel is responsible for murdering up to 84 people by ramming into them with a truck and shooting at them. \nLast month, ISIS released a video encouraging knife attacks on non-Muslims in the West. \nThe FBI also recently arrested a New York man, Mohamed Rafik Naji , who had tried to join ISIS overseas and is accused of talking to an informant about possibly attacking Times Square using a vehicle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T22:09:30.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
