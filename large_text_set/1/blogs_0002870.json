However, we should keep in mind that this past year delivered some animated gems: Finding Dory, Zootopia, The Secret Life of Pets , and Kubo and the Two Strings . \n2017 could be just as good if not better with Despicable Me 3, Cars 3, Captain Underpants, The Lego Ninjago Movie , and The Boss Baby coming out later this year; though, I'm especially excited to see The LEGO Movie spinoff starring Will Arnett's Batman. \nTo start 2017 right, Warner Bros. has released a new promo for The LEGO Batman Movie . It features Bruce Wayne wishing everyone a \"Happy New Year.\" He then changes into his cape and cowl in a split-second so that he can finish his message: \"From Batman.\" The easily-excitable Boy Wonder watches his mentor with awe and repeatedly shouts: \"Oh my gosh!\" \nIn the irreverent spirit of fun that made The LEGO Movie a worldwide phenomenon, the self-described leading man of that ensemble – LEGO Batman – stars in his own big-screen adventure. But there are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if he wants to save the city from The Joker’s hostile takeover, Batman may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others and maybe, just maybe, learn to lighten up. \nWill Arnett reprises his starring role from The LEGO Movie as the voice of LEGO Batman, aka Bruce Wayne. Zach Galifianakis ( Hangover films) stars as The Joker; Michael Cera (TV’s Arrested Development ) as the orphan Dick Grayson; Rosario Dawson (TV’s Daredevil ) as Barbara Gordon; and Ralph Fiennes ( Harry Potter films) as Alfred. \nThe LEGO Batman Movie is directed by Chris McKay and produced by Dan Lin, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Roy Lee, who worked together on The LEGO Movie . It is written by Seth Grahame-Smith and Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers, with additional screenplay material by Jared Stern & John Whittington, based on LEGO Construction Toys. Jill Wilfert, Matthew Ashton and Will Allegra serve as executive producers. \nThe LEGO Batman Movie will open in theaters on February 10, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T14:10:58.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
