(AP/KDKA) – Authorities say an eastern Pennsylvania woman found shot to death had a protection from abuse order against a man later found dead in his car in New Jersey. \nNorthampton County authorities said 47-year-old Lisa Menzo Santoro was found Friday afternoon in a vehicle in the garage of her Palmer Township home. Police were seeking 45-year-old Leonard Moser, but after his car was stopped in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, Warren County authorities said he apparently killed himself with a shotgun. \nThe Morning Call reports that authorities are not looking for anyone else in the woman’s death. \nNorthampton County Sheriff David Dalrymple said Menzo Santoro had obtained a protection-from-abuse order against Moser, which was served to him last Monday. \nAuthorities said none of her four children were in the home when she was killed. She had two elementary school-age children and two older children, ages 17 and 21. \nFriends of Menzo Santoro started collecting donations for her children Saturday. \n“This is a horrible situation for them,” Kerri Ludwig said. “She was a wonderful, beautiful person.” \nNeighbors described the victim as a nice woman, who after walked her dogs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T10:34:08.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
