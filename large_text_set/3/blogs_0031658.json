I understand this but we sorted it internally. \n“He knows it was not a good response. It is always better to give good answers on the pitch.

Dusan has come back on a good level and the last four or five games was interesting with his stats and his work on the pitch and in training. \n“He needs to continue the good work and my response is just to play 90 minutes.” \nMeanwhile Puel has admitted crocked captain Virgil van Dijk might not play again this season – but insists he has not kicked his last ball for the club. \nThe £50million rated Van Dijk, wanted by Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City, has been sidelined with an ankle injury since January.

He is an important player for us, our captain and it is important he takes this role with good quality, good attitude and good spirit. \n“For me he is one of the best defenders in the Premier League but he can play with us and we can give him good maturity for the future.” poll loading Will Southampton sell Virgil van Dijk this summer? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T10:55:26.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
