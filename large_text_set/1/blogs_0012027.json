Advertisement - story continues below \nThe New York Times coverage of the deployment hints at how that’s going to be framed: \nThe American president-­elect, Donald J. Trump, enters office trailing a string of sometimes contradictory statements about NATO and insisting on a new era of chummier relations with Russia’s autocratic leader. \nSo there is considerable concern in Warsaw and other Eastern capitals about whether the troops will actually arrive in the numbers promised, and whether this desire for friendlier relations with Moscow will lead to a deal that undermines the whole effort. \nSo, in the Democrat storyline, Donald Trump is going to play Neville Chamberlain to Putin’s Hitler – with the usual assistance of the liberal media. \nUnfortunately for Democrats, The New York Times, and the Obama administration’s place in history, the effort is likely to backfire badly. \nAs John Adams once put it, facts are stubborn things. \nIt was Obama who betrayed Poland in one of his first acts as president, when he canceled a planned missile defense system for Central Europe. At the time, The New York Times reported it as a way to shift defenses to meet the threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran. (The focus of Obama’s biggest appeasement.)
