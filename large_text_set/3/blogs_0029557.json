They’re still standing.\nThe Gonzaga Bulldogs are a win away from their first Final Four appearance ever. \nThe Zags overcame a brutal scare from West Virginia and its pressing defense in a Sweet 16 game Thursday in San Jose. A team that had rarely trailed all season and spent nearly this entire NCAA tournament playing from ahead ran into serious trouble against WVU’s chaos-wreaking full-court press. The Gonzaga offense struggled to find its customary rhythm, and the Mountaineers almost capitalized. \nIn the end, though, they didn’t. The Zags prevailed in the nick of time, 61-58. They benefited from an awful final possession by WVU guard Jevon Carter , but that doesn’t minimize how hard Gonzaga had to work to stay dancing.\nA final defensive stand has Gonzaga moving on! #Sweet16 pic.twitter.com/tODe0vYZGM \n— NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) March 24, 2017 Don’t say Gonzaga just “escaped.” That doesn’t do the Zags justice. West Virginia is unlike any other team in college basketball. The Mountaineers have talent and experience, and those are valuable things in March. But what makes them such a brutal matchup is the way they play defense — specifically, the way they never, ever stop. They’ve caused carnage all season, and they did it again on Thursday. \nBob Huggins employs a more aggressive defensive scheme than any coach at any major program anywhere in the country. The Mountaineers pressure the ball all the way up the court much of the time, and when they don’t, they’re swarming to it as soon as it crosses halfcourt. \nThe Mountaineers force turnovers on about 28 percent of all opposing possessions, the highest rate in the country. They are now what Shaka Smart’s VCU teams were a couple of years ago, only they’ve got more talented players and better offense. They beat elite teams every year, because their risky style sometimes pays off big.\nIt paid off big on Thursday. Gonzaga had 16 turnovers, tied for their second-most in any game all year. But that doesn’t explain the breadth of the hell West Virginia put on the Zags. Their elite offense was never afforded time to click. They shot poorly, often while rushed and from low-percentage positions. Their 45.5 percent effective shooting rate was their worst in a game since December. \nGonzaga hadn’t seen anything like West Virginia, mainly because there isn’t anything like West Virginia. The Zags had played and beaten a couple of teams that are great at forcing turnovers, in Loyola Marymount and Florida. But those teams tend to get takeaways on about two in 10 possessions. WVU gets them on about three, and by playing a style of defense that’s harder to handle.\nNow, Gonzaga’s got a chance to bury some demons. Mark Few has been one of the country’s greatest coaches for the last two decades. He’s brought the Zags to March Madness in every single year of his tenure, a remarkable achievement. But Gonzaga still hasn’t gotten to a Final Four in any of them. Only Xavier or Arizona, on Saturday, now stands in its way.\nThere are good reasons to think this team could get there, aside from the obvious one that it now only needs one more win. As a game-breaking athlete, point guard Nigel Williams-Goss is miles ahead of Gonzaga point guards past. Big center Przemek Karnowski is a heart-and-soul player and a great talent, and because of freshman Zach Collins , he’s arguably the second-best center on the roster. \nOn Thursday, things didn’t work like they were supposed to work. Williams-Goss was not close to his usual self, scoring 10 points on 2-of-10 shooting. Only Karnowski and Johnathan Williams had strong, efficient scoring nights. WVU’s defense mucked the game up and made the Zags sweat profusely. They did, and they won. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:39:31.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
