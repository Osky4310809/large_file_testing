His opening show was a couple of days delayed but seemed worth the wait. Here’s what fans were treated to. 1. Drake has a lot of love for London \nDrake loves London almost as much as Time Out, and videos of last night show made that passion clear. He used London slang, told the crowd about spending time here with Westwood, walking through Hyde Park with Semtex (who was in the crowd) and how much he wants to move here. \nWhenever Drake said \"jheeeze, mudting, mud, shellings\"... Ah listen 😂 That guy loves London, word you keep feel it in his voice 😂✊🏽✨🇬🇧 — cute gang (@DOLLFACETANISHA) January 31, 2017 2. Loads of cameos \nYoung Thug was Drake’s support for the night and Kyla – who he samples on One Dance – came out to perform the track. Most of the chat on social media was about cameos from local lads Section Boyz... A video posted by djsemtex (@djsemtex) on Jan 30, 2017 at 3:42pm PST \n\n...and Giggs, who he's been teasing a new track with. When Drizzy bought out the Landlord... pic.twitter.com/30teRe8WLC \n3. He's still got a big old crush on Rihanna \nDrake played both ‘Work’ and ‘Take Care’ and before each unleashed a torrent of slush about BFF Rihanna. ’Rihanna is like the queen of the world,’ Drake apparently announced to the crowd. ‘You can’t have a party without playing Rih for the ladies’. drake did a massive shoutout to rihanna, claiming she is the queen of music.. and that london is his favourite place on earth \n4. The staging was big budget \nTickets to the Drake show were pricey, and it’s clear lots of that went on amazing staging. He played with a live band, plus dancers and fans declared the special effects were on point. The show finished in front of a giant boom that faded to Mars red, which is probably the most Instagrammed part of the performance. It’s a world away from his tour five years ago when he stepped onstage with just a mic and DJ. — KristaBrown BA(Hons) (@OriginalGucci1) January 31, 2017 5. There's a big finish \n(Stop reading now if you want the set list to be a surprise.) Drake opened with 'Over' and whizzed through old favourites like 'Crew Love' in 30-second bites, focussing more on his newer stuff. But he finished on the more trappy side of his career, leaning on big recent hits like 'Jumpman' and 'Legend'.
