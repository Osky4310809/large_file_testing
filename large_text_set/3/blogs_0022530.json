Ravioli might be synonymous with that ground-meat stuff that comes from a can, but it has been around for a long time. The earliest known ravioli come from 14th-century Italy and are credited to Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant from Prato. In 14th-century Venice, one manuscript described pasta stuffed with blanched, minced herbs, egg, and cheese. It didn’t take long before ravioli became popular in other countries, too. \nTraditionally, ravioli are filled with cheese and herbs, but today you might come across meat-filled pasta dumplings that are being passed off as ravioli. These are actually more similar to agnolotti, another type of Italian dumpling consisting of pasta dough stuffed with meat. Whether you like meat or cheese-filled ravioli, it’s easy to make it plant-based — and there are so many ways to make it. \nSo, since it’s National Ravioli Day, we’ve got 15 yummy, cheesy, ravioli recipes for you.
