These Bills seeks to establish the much needed legislative framework to free-up Nigeria’s gas deposits from the overarching concentration on crude oil production at the detriment of gas production. \n“The Bills are expected to propel the country to give gas development, production and marketing its pride of place. \n“If these Bills are eventually enacted into law, they will help create the enabling legislative order in which gas shall no longer be a footnote of crude oil with the attendant overriding benefits to the Nigerian economy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T09:41:24.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
