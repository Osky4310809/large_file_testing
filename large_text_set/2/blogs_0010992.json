But as new tech and materials come into play, every classic deserves an update. Step up the new ASICS Tiger GEL-Kayano Trainer Knit, dropping February 24 for the first time in a one-piece full-knit upper in a simple monochrome pack.\nFirst released in 1993, the GEL-Kayano’s calling cards are still in place: a slick muted cage envelops the lower-profiled upper with the knit construction giving the sneaker a more lightweight look and feel, as well as a sock-like fit on the ankle. Dropping first in all-white and all-black, the colorways also cater to current sneaker trends favoring simple mono makeups (so make sure you’re ready to cop).\nDesigned for the dynamic, modern urban life and the people that live it, ASICS Tiger’s new campaign film proudly highlights the diverse, global, forward-thinking community that wears their kicks. Like the knitted upper of the new Kayano, ASICS Tiger highlights a common thread of humanity that runs through us and unites us all.\nLock onto and follow the emerging campaign over on ASICS Tiger’s Instagram and via the #TigerKnit hashtag. The sneaker is available via the link below from February 24, click the link for older versions available now.\nShop Here New ASICS Tiger updates are coming thick ‘n’ fast with news of the ‘MT’ GEL-Kayano Trainer Knit version hitting earlier this year .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:16:13.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
