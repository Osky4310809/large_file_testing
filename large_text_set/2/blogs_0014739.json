A second bill would eliminate the term “copy” from the statute, eliminating the premise behind Healey’s actions. \nLast month, gun rights activists aided by the NRA filed a lawsuit targeting the state’s 1998 assault weapons ban. \nMassachusetts has some of the strictest guns laws in the country and the nation’s lowest gun death rate in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:38:38.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
