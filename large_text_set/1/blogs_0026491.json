Kanye, 39, is also up for eight awards, with insiders saying he too has no plans to attend this year's ceremony. Over it: While he attended the Grammys in 2013, Drake is one of many musicians planning on boycotting the ceremony this year His reason for boycotting this year's show however is racially motivated. Sources say while the Famous singer has picked up a total of 21 trophies in the past, he's never won when going up against a white artist.

It just doesn’t seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down,' the 29-year-old told the New York Times in an interview in November. 'I think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated. I’d rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience.' Not interested: Frank Ocean - seen picking up a Grammy in 2013 - says the 'system is dated' and claims there needs to be a better representation of the black community Read more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T05:52:54.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
