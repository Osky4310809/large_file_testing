During Trump’s inauguration speech, he said that we will buy American, and as he spit out those words, I’m sure Kellyanne clapped along while wearing a $3,300 Gucci coat that was made in Italy and inspired by the city of London. Neck-to-knee USA! via Net-A-Porter\nAlessandro Michele turned The Cloisters at Westminster Abbey into Gucci’s Resort ’17 runway – it was the first ever fashion show to be held at the historic church. Inspired by the city of London, this coat is tailored from royal-blue, off-white and red wool with a matte finish. It’s decorated with burnished gold feline heads and has a detachable belt to create an A-line.\nKellyanne described her look to reporters as “ Trump revolutionary wear , ” but some thought she was serving lady nutracker and others expected her to warble out Stars from Les Miserables . But for me, Kellyanne is done up like a soldier from the Hot Dog On A Stick army who is preparing to go into the battle in the Mall Food Court War. That ensemble also gives me a touch of “ Mary Tyler Moore after the spirit of Napoleon possessed her body .”\nAnd as Kellyanne brought the patriotic WTFness, Melania Trump wore Ralph Lauren. Melania’s outfit is like a look from a Project Runway challenge where the designers were asked to create a Jackie Kennedy-inspired ensemble using nothing but blue powdered-surgery gloves, surgical gowns and Snuggies.\nI really thought Melania was going to wear all-black and a veil, because starting today, she’ll have to spend her days giving boring speeches at boring events instead of sipping solid gold-infused champagne out of a diamond-encrusted crystal flute while lounging on a chaise covered with a leopard’s hide. RIP to that opulent lady of leisure life.\nPics : AP", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/voicesbysmn/status/822466499755593734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/share", "https://www.net-a-porter.com/us/en/product/803124/Gucci/embellished-color-block-wool-coat", "https://twitter.com/michcoll/status/822465706398744576", "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/multimedia/Kellyanne-Conways-Trump-Revolutionary-Wear-411310025.html"], "published": "2017-01-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T21:02:35.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
