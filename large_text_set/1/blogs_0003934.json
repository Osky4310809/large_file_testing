Fallon accused Scarborough of only being outraged when it hurt President-elect Donald Trump’s image, but not when it negatively affected Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \nScarborough defended himself, saying: Trump is dead wrong on Russia and I’ve always said it. What you state here is misleading at best. A lie at worst. Give up. #WisconsinNice https://t.co/NP4BK6WJ5X \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 6, 2017 \nFox News host Sean Hannity did not appreciate Scarborough’s criticism of Trump, unleashing an unhinged series of tweets lashing out against the MSNBC host on Friday, at one point even going so far as to accuse Scarborough of job hunting unbeknownst to his employer, MSNBC: Joe, what’s really repulsive is the pathetically low ratings you have on network that colluded with @HillaryClinton . https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 Joe if me asking @wikileaks questions is so repulsive why did you use that information on your low rated show? https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 Joe, Is it a betrayal and repulsive that you keep asking Fox to hire you without telling your current employer? https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 Joe, so did you go to @realDonaldTrump s New Year’s Eve party or not? Is lying “repulsive”? https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 Joe, you say you are a “real conservative”! Was NBC’s coverage of the election last year “repulsive” to you? Are you proud of MSNBC? https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 So Mr “repulsive Joe” why didn’t NBC go interview @wikileaks ? By the way at Fox (where u want to work) we let the audience decide!!! https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 The only thing that is really “repulsive” is you calling yourself a “conservative”. You are the poster child for “establishment”. https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 Ok enough for now “Repulsive Joe”. I have my radio show to do. How is your radio show doing? https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:11:24.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
