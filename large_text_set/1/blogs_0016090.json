Anti-Fascist Coalition,” part of a broader effort called “#DisruptJ20” (for January 20th, the date of the inauguration) had been captured on tape discussing plans to crash the Deplorable, disrupt the parade at the inauguration, and target specific individuals.\nAs PJ Media reported last week, #DisruptJ20 has been quite open about its goal of preventing the peaceful transfer of power.\nThe new Project Veritas video shows exactly what types of nasty disruptions the #DisruptJ20 activists had in mind. In part 1, we see them allegedly planning to set off butyric acid “stink bomb” devices at the party. As a backup plan, they also speak about triggering the fire sprinkler system, forcing attendees to evacuate outside into the cold.\nLuke Kuhn, of the D.C. Anti-Fascist Coalition, is heard on the video actually threatening the city government of Washington, D.C., and the police if they try to stop them:\n\"The message has to be, we do not recognize the city government either,\" Kuhn says. \"If you try to close us down we will look for your house, we will burn it. We will physically fight the police if they try to steal one of our places. We will go to war and you will lose.\"\nThe group's spokeswoman put out a memo to its members after they discovered they had been infiltrated.\nHalf your team has been compromised, @lacymacauley .

And, as he points out in the video, the actions planned by the activists could run afoul of anti-terrorism laws.\nO’Keefe and Project Veritas say that they shared the results of their investigation with the FBI, the Secret Service, and the D.C. Metro Police.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/16/project-veritas-catches-anarchist-group-planning-to-set-off-stink-bombs-at-deploraball/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/veritasiseverywhere?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/lacymacauley", "https://t.co/DquNIzewt5", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHZSfhd1X_8", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/tcot?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Project_Veritas/status/821081308323545090", "https://twitter.com/lukefromdc", "https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/821032883511033856", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/16/new-james-okeefe-video-leftists-planning-stink-bombs-deploraball/", "https://twitter.com/SmashRacismDC", "https://t.co/dJUs9X40Mm", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThatMomentWhen?src=hash"], "published": "2017-01-16T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:48:55.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
