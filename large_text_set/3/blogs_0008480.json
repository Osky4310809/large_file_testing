This food art crosses the uncanny valley share Instagram users all around the world are currently obsessing over Mukimono , the Japanese art of intricate fruit and vegetable carving . One Instagram superstar in particular, gakugakugakugakugaku1 , is attracting a lot of attention and racking up tons of “likes” for his intricate carvings. It’s clear that a lot of Instagrammers dig this type of food artistry, but an informal poll of around a dozen Eater editors also suggests that these carvings have the power to make you feel uneasy for some mysterious reason . These carvings creep people out in the same way that robots do when they cross into the uncanny valley. Here is a photo of a recent work from gakugakugakugakugaku1 followed by an actual conversation that happened at Eater this afternoon: A post shared by 岳 (@gakugakugakugakugaku1) on Feb 15, 2017 at 8:50pm PST Ellen : Makes me queasy. It triggers my mild case of Trypophobia . Whitney : It makes me feel like I’m on shrooms. I have to look away now. Brenna : Yuck. I saw this the other day. It makes me feel deeply uncomfortable in the same way that looking at lotus pods does. Erin : Omggg yes — I was not aware that Trypophobia is a thing but I 100 percent feel this way. Ellen : It is a THING and when I Googled to make sure I spelled it right, it brought up a bunch of horrifying hole-y images that legit make me gasp. Still shivering with disgust. Erin : Yeah they make me feel... itchy? But like in my soul. Serena : Oh my god, that broccoli is so disturbing. I hate it. David : It makes me subtly angry. Missy : I feel neutral when I look at it but I’m fascinated that it can repel like this! Whitney : That broccoli photo legit triggered waves of nausea in me. Serena : Is this something can we turn into a story?
