The caller says the victim missed jury duty or has unpaid fines, and there is a warrant out for their arrest from the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. \nThe scammer tells the victim to purchase green dot cards, PEK Cards, cash vouchers or other funding sources so that they can pay fines. \nThe Sheriff’s Office says they do occasionally make calls regarding low-level warrants, but they always direct people to the courthouse or the Manor Building, and payment is never accepted in the form of gift cards or other funding sources. \nA similar scam was reported back in November . \nAnyone who receives one of these calls should hang up and contact the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office at 412-350-4714 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:11:02.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
