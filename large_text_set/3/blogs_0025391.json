There is no legal basis for being there. Walang (There is no) holdover sa barangay. They are just there, I don’t know de facto, whatever,” the President said. \n“But the reason why I advised Congress, I talked to Senator Sotto, he knows the problem very well…because he has been fighting it.” \nThe Chief Executive has advised lawmakers “not (to) commit the mistake of calling for an election now.”   \nIf elections would push through this October, however, Duterte urged the public to ensure that they choose persons with integrity; otherwise, he will not have enough time to “kill all of them.” \nEarlier, Interior Secretary Ismael Sueno revealed that Duterte wants the barangay elections postponed, end the terms of the incumbent and appoint new ones. \nThe barangay elections were postponed last year and rescheduled this year. \nSince eradicating drugs has been the major program of his administration, Duterte reiterated anew his concern about narco-politics which has infiltrated the police, local government and barangay levels. \n“Because narco-politics has entered into the mainstream of Philippine politics… Either patayin muna natin ’tong mga yawa na ito kasi ‘pag ka hindi (Either we kill these devils first because if not), they will be elected again and you have the looming elections,” the President added. \nDuterte pointed out that pushing through with the barangay elections will bolster the status of the country becoming a full-blown narco-politics state. \nHe said he is awaiting the recommendation of lawmakers regarding his plans. \nDuterte has been expressing concern that the drug problem has infiltrated about 40 percent of barangay captains nationwide. \n“That’s my problem,” he said. ‘Encroachment into authoritarianism’ \nSen. Francis Pangilinan urged Duterte to reconsider his plan to postpone the barangay elections. \nPangilinan, the president of the Liberal Party, said that to further postpone barangay elections and to appoint barangay officials “means to impinge on the people’s right to vote and choose their leaders.” \n“It is worrisome that the President should even contemplate such a rash decision that encroaches dangerously into authoritarian ideologies reminiscent of those harbored and exemplified by the former dictator Ferdinand Marcos,” Pangilinan said. \n“Let the people choose who they wish to serve them.” \nHe reminded Duterte that the foundations of the Philippine government lie in its roots, specifically the barangay as the smallest unit of governance in the country. \n“Barangay officials are comprised of men and women who are the people’s neighbors, faces that they know best,” Pangilinan said. \n“These officials know the heart of their towns more than any public servant of the country simply through sheer proximity and familiarity, and this affords them a kind of connection other leaders could never forge with their constituents,” he added. \nSen. Paolo Benigno Aquino IV said that he would want to see the barangay elections push through this October. \nHe recalled that in the last discussions the senators had on the postponement of barangay elections last year, there was an agreement that it would be the last time it would be postponed. \n“Our barangay elections [is] also a way for us to exercise our democracy,” Aquino said. \n“It’s important that people are given that choice and I think our people are capable of determining who is good or bad,” he added. Obedience to laws \nAmid Duterte’s pronouncements, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) said it cannot just postpone the upcoming barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) elections. \nComelec spokesman James Jimenez said the poll body is aware of the President’s position on holding the October elections, but the commission cannot give in to the latter’s desire. \n“The Comelec also wants a clean and honest electoral process, but we must also understand that the Commission is obedient to the laws, which means that if there is an electoral exercise scheduled in the law, we must prepare for it,” Jimenez explained. \nAt this time, Jimenez stressed that there is still no law postponing the coming elections. \nThe decision whether to postpone the elections or not, Jimenez said, must be left with Congress and not the commission. \nThe Comelec is thus set to start preparations for the elections. – With Marvin Sy, Mayen Jaymalin, Cecille Suerte Felipe, Gilbert Bayoran", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T09:23:55.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
