And so to pop one of his movies into the DVD player is to hang out with him, and I can do that whenever I need that Bill hang,” Goodwin told ET . Whenever we’re looking to hang out with Bill, that’s exactly what we’ll be doing as well, because he’s had a special place in our hearts since Titanic. \nvia GIPHY Along with Goodwin, Paxton’s friends, colleagues and fans are paying tribute to him.\nBill Paxton was, simply, a wonderful man. A wonderful man... Hanx.\n— Tom Hanks (@tomhanks) February 26, 2017 Bill Paxton could play any role, but he was best at being Bill - a great human being with a huge heart. My thoughts are with his family.\n— Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 26, 2017 God bless Bill Paxton. May he Rest In Peace. He was so kind and generous to all he worked with- an eternal child about creativity and life.\n— Val Kilmer (@valkilmer) February 27, 2017 At Sunday night’s Oscar ceremony, Jennifer Aniston mentioned Paxton in the In Memoriam section that she presented — it was too late to officially include him in the video segment, but he was honored alongside others who we tragically lost.\nJennifer Aniston remembers Bill Paxton, who passed away today at the age of 61 https://t.co/YN5vKbdGiW #Oscars pic.twitter.com/WnUsjygSse \n— ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 We’re sending all our love to Paxton’s family, friends, and loved ones.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:01:46.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
