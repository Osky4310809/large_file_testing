Whether you&apos;re creating website mockups or designing individual site elements, Photoshop is a great option.\nHere are some web design tips that you maybe didn&apos;t know that Adobe&apos;s venerable photo editor was capable of – and may prove very useful for your next project.\n01. Use grid systems \nThere are a number of tools to help you use grids in Photoshop Grid systems can save a lot of headaches in web design. Try using resources like Cameron McEfee&apos;s GuideGuide Photoshop extension to make custom grids easy and accurate.\n02. Get it all out One of the best practices for successful web design (and time management) is to place all your elements on your Photoshop canvas before you start getting dirty with design.\nWeb designers often jump right into one particular area without considering the rest of page and the weight of content. Getting the rough framework into place early on will help you make smarter decisions and avoid larger edits later.\n03. Explore custom document presets \nPhotoshop comes loaded with a number of web-focused presets. Check them out! Hit cmd+N to open the New Document window. The Preset menu contains basic web and mobile presets but is missing many common dimensions for a variety of grid systems, banners, iOS and Android devices. Take a few moments to fill the missing areas.\n04. Customise default type Close all open documents. Open the Character palette to select your preferred font family, weight, spacing and colour. No more default Myriad!\n05. Make your vectors crisp Keep your vector objects crisp. With the Rectangle tool ( U ) selected, open the Geometry options menu in the options bar. Check the Snap to Pixels option.\n06. Create dotted lines \nCreat dotted lines in Photoshop. It's one of those things you'll always have to do. Select the Brush tool ( B ), then open the Brush Presets palette, followed by the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner. Select Square Brushes and hit Append.\nNow select the Hard Square 1 Pixel brush. Switch to the Brushes palette and hit Brush Tip Shape, adjusting Spacing to 300%. On your canvas, hold Shift while dragging the brush horizontally or vertically to create a crisp dotted line.\n07. Wrap text easily Using a quick workaround, Photoshop can apply Text Wrap functions similar to InDesign&apos;s. Select the Rectangle tool ( U ). In the Options bar set the fill to Paths, set the shape to Rectangle tool and select &apos;Add to path area&apos; (or press + ).\nOn your canvas, draw a large rectangle over the content area. Back in the Options bar, change the &apos;Add to path area&apos; to &apos;Subtract from path area&apos; (or press - ). On your canvas with the outline of the original rectangle showing, draw an intersecting rectangle where the text will wrap.\nSelect the Type tool ( T ), and click inside the large rectangle to convert the shape to a Type Work Path to fill with type. You can further refine the Type Work Path dimensions with the Rectangle tool ( U ) and the Direct Selection tool ( A ).\n08. Create quick colour fills \nCertain key commands come in useful over and over again. Quick fill is one of them Hit alt+Delete to fill text, shapes and layers with the selected foreground colour. Press cmd+Delete to fill an area with the selected background colour. Hit D to revert to the default black and white, and press X to swap the foreground and background colours.\n09. Stay organised Use cmd+G to group layers and help you stay organised and focused. Grouping your content areas and components – such as navigation, featured content areas, supporting components and footers – separately will save you headaches throughout the design and development process of a project.\n10. Get smart Using Smart Objects (go to &apos;Filter > Convert for Smart Filters&apos;, and ctrl or right-click &apos;Layer > Convert to Smart Object&apos;) wisely can really boost your workflow throughout the design process. Converting larger photographs and vector objects into Smart Objects retains original image quality after scaling, rotating, and skewing.\nNext page: 10 more web design tips for Photoshop... \n11. Master shortcuts The key to Photoshop stardom is efficiency. It&apos;s not just knowing how to do something, but how to do something quickly so you&apos;re not using valuable time executing a function. \nSome specific shortcuts to know? Start with Save for Web ( cmd+opt+shift+S ), Image Size ( cmd+opt+I ), Canvas Size ( cmd+opt+C ). Don&apos;t forget Levels ( cmd+L ) and Hue/Saturation ( cmd+U ). Head here for more Photoshop shortcuts .\n12. Be subtle \nAdd filters such as noise and drop-shadows with caution As designers, we tend to discredit our audience's ability to perceive the effect we're trying to achieve. So our response is to add too much noise, make harsh gradients and use too much contrast. The perfect blend is when you use effects with some grace, and, more importantly, self control.\n13. Use masks intelligently Globalising masks makes for some sweet Photoshop efficiency. For instance, if you have five slider images in your design, group them and put a mask on the folder instead of on each individual layer. It&apos;s a far superior solution than sifting through 20 masks, not knowing which ones do what.\n14. Use refine masks for easy hair silhouetting \nUse the Refine Mask tool instead of spending countless hours silhouetting by hand Who doesn&apos;t loathe having to silhouette hair? Here&apos;s a trick that works well on various sizes of images, no matter how crazy the hairdo. Make a rough mask of the person, then go to &apos;Select > Refine Mask&apos;. Play with the Radius and watch the magic unfold.\n15. Create realistic drop-shadows Piggybacking on the last tip, the sign of an amateur designer is when you see drop-shadows that are far too dark. It makes it look like the object is under a spotlight – probably not the case. Be sure to decrease opacity, or better yet, opt for a darker shade of the background colour of using black.\n16. Teach yourself the pen tool \nPSDTuts has a very comprehensive tutorial on how to master the pen tool It&apos;s worth taking the time to get good at using the Pen tool. It&apos;s one of those things we tend to avoid, but if you want to pull off some crisp masks or add illustration to your designs, the Pen tool should be your weapon of choice. Brush up your skills with this tutorial .\n17. Sharpen photos using high pass Ready for some Photoshop magic? So, you&apos;ve received a low-res photo from your client, and it&apos;s just too blurry to use. Duplicate the layer, then go to &apos;Filter > Other > High Pass&apos;. Choose a low value (around 2.0) and then set that layer&apos;s Blending Mode to Overlay. If it&apos;s too crisp, decrease the opacity. Results may vary.\n18. Be consistent \n0 to 255 help you kind variations of any colour Five different blues, and none of them are the one from the brand guide? Be sure to check the colours being used, especially when exporting images. Another handy tool for colour accuracy is 0to255.com , which provides hex values of shares that are harmoniously lighter and darker than any given colour.\n19. Don't default to default settings \nWork those settings every time One of the hardest things to ward off is Photoshop autonomy. If you&apos;re treating the Effects panel like a checklist of desired styles, you&apos;re most likely not crafting them into their best state. The default settings are generally harsh in order to emphasise their effect. Soften the values and change the angles.\n20. It's in the details An integral part to perfecting your craft in Photoshop is to make your design &apos;pixel perfect&apos;. Go back through your PSD, looking for blurry edges on rounded rectangles or inconsistent line weights. It pays to take the time in Photoshop perfecting your layout (rather than in HTML/CSS).\nRelated articles: \nReview: Adobe Project Felix 10 free Photoshop brushes for painting skin and hair Digital painting with Photoshop CC for beginners ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:03:42.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
