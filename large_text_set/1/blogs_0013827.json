Virdee meeting the Queen \nHe faces up to 15 years in jail for alleged fraud and evasion of 125 million euros – £109million – in VAT, if found guilty. \nVirdee, a visiting professor at Manchester Metropolitan University, denies the allegations. \nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said: “Peter Singh Virdee, 43, a UK national, was arrested on Tuesday, January 10, at Heathrow Airport. He was arrested on a European arrest warrant on behalf of authorities in Germany, where he is wanted in relation to tax evasion.” Virdee appeared before Westminster magistrates court last week and was granted bail. \nCarter-Ruck, the legal firm representing Virdee, said: “Our client categorically denies these allegations; he has never been involved in carbon trading let alone any kind of fraud. He poses with Al Pacino \n“While he is happy to co-operate with the authorities he intends to defend himself fully against these allegations and the attempts to extradite him.” \nThe firm said the investigation was six years old and Virdee was “surprised” German authorities wanted his extradition. It said the only basis for the allegations was “a statement given by a convicted fraudster who entered some form of plea bargain in return for implicating other people”. \nVirdee’s firms made five separate donations to the Tories between 2011 and 2014. Party records show Virdee was one of the “Major Donors who attended a Leader’s Group event featuring a meal and with a Minister in attendance” between July and September 2012. \nThe senior Tory ministers who attended the events in that period were David Cameron , George Osborne and Greg Barker, the former Prime Minister, Chancellor and Energy Minister. \nVirdee’s website details his charity work and features a series of photos of him meeting the Queen and Prince Philip, athlete Usain Bolt, singer Rihanna and actors Al Pacino and Mickey Rourke.
