But what if you hooked a boom mic up to a wireless transmitter? In this video from Indy Mogul , Knoptop talks about various advantages the wireless boom audio setup can have in different phases of a film project. Check it out below: \nIf you're one of those \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" kind of people, I'm right there with you. I've never once considered connecting a boom mic to a wireless transmitter, but Knoptop brings up some intriguing points in the video that piqued my interest. \nFor one, using this kind of set up will take out the moderately frustrating task of synching sound in post, because it records it directly into your camera. Second, your talent can feel free to move around, touch their shirt, etc. without worrying about causing any noise issues. The third and probably most obvious benefit is that not having to deal with any super long audio cables is pretty damn convenient. \nIf you're thinking of using this setup, just make sure that your mic is compatible with your transmitter/receiver. (If your mic has an XLR connector, make sure your transmitter/receiver has the same outputs. Or make sure you have an adapter.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T16:42:51.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
