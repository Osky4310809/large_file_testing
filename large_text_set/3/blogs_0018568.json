She told the BBC yesterday that “we might only be a matter of weeks or months apart.” \nBut she will also warn Mrs May that defying the Scottish Parliament would “shatter beyond repair any notion of the UK as a respectful partnership of equals.” \nMs Sturgeon blinked first in the constitutional standoff over the referendum’s timing after the Prime Minister rejected her plan for an early vote, saying “now is not the time” as she is about to embark on highly complex Brexit negotiations. \nInstead, the Tories set a series of test that could see another vote being delayed for up to six years, including Brexit having bedded in and there being political and public consent in Scotland. \nMs Sturgeon yesterday insisted that she had “various options” if no deal was reached but refused to disclose what they were. \nHowever, the Unionist parties said she must rule out trying to unilaterally hold an advisory referendum, warning this would not stand up to legal scrutiny and make Scotland “the laughing stock of the world.” \nDowning Street made clear that the necessary powers were reserved to Westminster.

Holyrood has a nationalist majority of SNP and Green MSPs. \nMs Sturgeon will say today: “At that point a fair, legal, agreed referendum - on a timescale that will allow the people of Scotland an informed choice - ceases to be just my proposal, or that of the SNP. \n“It becomes the will of the democratically elected Parliament of Scotland. To stand in defiance of it would be for the Prime Minister to shatter beyond repair any notion of the UK as a respectful partnership of equals.” \nCalling on Mrs May to think again, the First Minister will say: “If her concern is timing then - within reason - I am happy to have that discussion. But she should be in no doubt. The will of our parliament must and will prevail.” \nBut, if they tried to unilaterally hold an advisory vote, the Nationalists would face the embarrassing prospect of Holyrood's authorities ruling that their referendum bill was not competent. \nAs constitutional affairs are reserved, she could also face a battle in Scotland’s courts and it would probably result in a mass boycott from Unionist voters, fatally undermining the result’s legitimacy. \nIt is thought that the First Minister is more likely to pursue an intense campaign to whip up public opinion in favour of another referendum, including mass protests, marches and petitions. \nHer spokesman rejected holding a snap Holyrood election to break the impasse, arguing it would be pointless as Mrs May could continue to ignore any fresh SNP mandate.

Well I will share them with the people of Scotland and the people of Scotland will have the right to know them once we are at that stage.” \nShe added: “I don’t think I should be getting into Plan Bs at this stage when I am putting forward a Plan A that has such a strong cast iron mandate.” \nBut Ian Murray, Scottish Labour’s Westminster spokesman, said: “The SNP must immediately withdraw the threat to impose an illegitimate and divisive referendum. Scotland is divided enough already without the Nationalists seeking to divide us even further.” \nJackson Carlaw, Scottish Conservative deputy leader, said: “The 2014 referendum was legal and fair, but a wildcat version – as so many SNP members seem to want – would be anything but. It appears Nicola Sturgeon's half-baked SNP's referendum plans are descending into chaos.” \nA Downing Street spokesman said that calling a referendum “is a reserved power and the PM has been clear that now is not the right time.” \nJohn Lamont, Scottish Tory Chief Whip, added: “Nicola Sturgeon said as late as Thursday that a referendum after April 2019 would be 'too late'. Now she has changed her mind and appears to be trying to engage in some kind of horse-trading with the UK Government.” Watch | Chopper's Brexit Podcast Episode 3 35:56", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:07:13.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
