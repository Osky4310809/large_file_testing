So many fantastic ladies are nominated, including Michelle Williams, who joked about wearing a protest t-shirt as her ideal Oscars look. Seriously, we love her.\nMichelle is nominated for Best Supporting Actress in Manchester by the Sea this year, which is her fourth Oscar nomination. Previously, she was nominated for Blue Valentine and My Week with Marilyn , and in 2006, she was nominated for her very first Oscar. Michelle made her first appearance on the Academy Awards red carpet for her nomination for Brokeback Mountain , along with a very special actor that we all miss.\nMichelle Williams attended her first Oscars with Heath Ledger, her co-star and then-boyfriend. Frazer Harrison / Getty We’re not crying, you’re crying! These two looked so sweet together. The couple began dating in 2004 after meeting on the set of Brokeback Mountain and had daughter Matilda together. The couple split in 2007 and then Heath passed away in 2008, and we are still not over it.\nLook how sweet the two were together. Heath even adjusts Michelle’s dress for her. Dan MacMedan / Getty Their glowing smiles say everything. Frazer Harrison / Getty This stunning couple gave us total #RelationshipGoals, and we miss them. KMazur / Getty But we’re so excited that Michelle will be attending yet again. We know she’ll have a fabulously classic look. And we imagine Heath and this magical first red carpet will be in her thoughts.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:54:09.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
