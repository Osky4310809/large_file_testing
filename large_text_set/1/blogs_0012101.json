And I was like, 'Im Irish!' And then I was just drinking loads of it. \n\"And they're like, 'No, no, no, no, no!' And then suddenly I was like, 'Woooh.' \n\"So yeah, that was a crazy, crazy experience because I just ended up being kind of comatose for about six hours, just kind of sitting in a corner.
