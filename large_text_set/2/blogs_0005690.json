And if it is red, the general rule is you do not give them an honour.” \nBeckham had been recommended for a knighthood in November 2013 by Olympics chief Lord Coe . \nIt followed his service for the England football team, tireless charity work over many years and key role in the success of the 2012 London Olympics. \nThe source said senior officials on the committee believed Beckham “deserved an honour” and went to “personal lengths” to try to solve the impasse.

And the general view of the committee was that people in the ‘red’ category do not get an honour.” \nLabour and Lib Dem MPs hit out at what they called a “bend it for Beckham” culture at the honours committee, raising concerns that officials had discussed Beckham’s tax affairs with his agent. \nRosena Allin-Khan, Labour’s shadow culture minister, said: “It’s incredibly worrying if people who make the decisions on honours are offering advice to high profile celebrities.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:42:29.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
