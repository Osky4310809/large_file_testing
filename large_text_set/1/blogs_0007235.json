NASCAR via Getty Images Sean Gardner Statement from NASCAR Chairman & CEO Brian France on Carl Edwards “Carl Edwards has made an indelible mark on NASCAR. His hard-charging driving style has led to memorable moments that will live forever in the history of our sport. Carl’s passion and personality will greatly be missed – as will the signature backflips that NASCAR fans have come to expect following his victories.
