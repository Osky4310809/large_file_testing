Debt \nThis effectively takes away a significant portion of money from equity investors’ benefits in the quoted banks. \nImpact on the Banks \nBased on the Full Year 2016 PAT estimates put together by Cardinal Stone Partners, a Lagos based investment house, on their coverage banks, total exposure will amount to N29.3 billion. The Cardinal Stone Reports also indicated the relative exposure of each of the banks. \nAccording to the report, in absolute terms, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GTB) has the largest exposure with an expected contribution of N7.1 billion (24% of total sector contribution) whilst Diamond Bank Plc will be the least exposed with an expected contribution of N0.4 billion (1% of total sector contribution). \nNigerian banks have consistently paid dividends, with top tier banks such as GTB and Zenith Bank Plc paying as much as 45% of PAT. \nAt the backdrop of this the analysts at Cardinal Stone stated: ‘‘After incorporating the impact of this development on FY’16 expected dividends, we estimate an average 5% drop in dividend per share, translating to an average expected dividend yield of 12% for FY’16. \n‘‘Finally, the policy’s impact on our valuation is immaterial as our recommendations remain largely unchanged. \n‘‘However, Access Bank Plc and Ecobank Transnational which previously had “BUY” recommendations have been downgraded to a HOLD. \nBriefing journalists at the end of the January 2017 NBC meeting, Alhaji Ahmed Abdullahi, Director, Banking Supervision Department, CBN, said the initiative was to support the federal government’s drive to create and deepen a non-oil economy. \nThe Bankers Committee considered it necessary “to support the effort of the government in diversifying the economy by coming up with an initiative that will help with export drive and import substitution,” he said. \n“Therefore, the committee has decided that we will be contributing 5 percent of each bank’s profit after tax in a pool of funds that will be kept at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and it will be used to finance eligible bankable projects that are meant for export or import substitution. \n“The scheme will be controlled by the members of the Bankers Committee. There will be a project review committee that will review submissions from entrepreneurs that require funding. The committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees of the Bankers Committee,” he explained. \nHe said each bank has an equity holding in the scheme based on its annual contribution from its annual profits. \nAbdullahi said the scheme will start from the 2016 financials. “Banks have submitted their 2016 statement of accounts and they are to be published not later than April, 2017. So we are starting the programme this year using 2016 financials of banks. Any industry that is going to be export driven will benefit. Similarly, any industry that will provide import substitution will also benefit,” he said. \nBased on the banks’ last three years profit and loss accounts, we estimate about N25 billion will be contributed annually by the banks,” he said.
