James Harden is having an absolutely ridiculous season with the Houston Rockets . For the first time in NBA history, James Harden has recorded two 50-point triple-double games in one season. \nDecember 31st: 53 points, 16 rebounds, 17 assists vs Knicks \nJanuary 27th: 51 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists at 76ers \nTo break it down even further, there have only been two 50-point, 12 rebound, 12 assist games in the NBA since 1983 total. Harden has both of them in this season alone.\nWe can break it down even further than that.\nJames Harden has two 50-point triple-doubles in last 28 days. \nThe entire NBA went 15,258 days (from 1/19/75 to 10/28/16) w/o any such games\n— Ben Golliver (@BenGolliver) January 28, 2017 This is Harden's 14th triple double this season. Before this season, the Rockets franchise record for triple doubles in a career was 14, by Hakeem Olajuwon.\nTonight was also Harden's fifth 40-point triple-double this season, tying Oscar Robertson in 1963-1964 for most in one season.\nWHEW ... and there’s more.\nAll five of those 40-point triple-doubles have come in the last 28 days.\nDec. 31 53 points, 16 rebounds, 17 assists vs Knicks\nJan. 8 40 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists at Raptors \nJan. 10 40 points, 15 rebounds, 10 assists vs Hornets \nJan. 17 40 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists at Heat \nJan. 27 51 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists at 76ers\nJames Harden is making a hell of a case for MVP this year.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T06:41:12.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
