Let's take back our country and restore democracy. Feb 7 Recall The DNC Stopped Bernie From Debating Tim Canova, Chair, Progress For All Dear Friends, Tonight, Senators Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz will debate about the future of Obamacare, otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) at 9 pm on CNN. This comes at an important moment. Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration have promised to abolish the ACA, yet the reality of cancelling health insurance for millions of Americans may finally give them pause. Meanwhile, Bernie is in the difficult situation of arguing for a health care law that he has acknowledged many times needs fixing. Under Obamacare, nearly thirty million Americans remain uninsured or underinsured. Millions more are seeing significant increases in their premiums, deductibles and co-payments. Of course, that’s why Bernie and many others, myself included, have supported a single payer Medicare for All system. When Bernie takes the stage tonight, many of us will be reminded that this is not the first time he agreed to debate a Republican with presidential ambitions. Recall that a year ago, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) she headed scheduled very few debates between the Democratic presidential candidates. And the few they had were scheduled for times when many Americans would not be watching. Of course, this was all designed to help the Hillary Clinton campaign and to undermine all other candidates. Please also recall Bernie’s response to this infuriating debate schedule. In fact, he challenged Donald Trump to debate. For a while, it seemed like it might actually happen. That is, until Wasserman Schultz came out with her edict that any Democrat who participated in an unsanctioned debate would be disqualified from participating in any DNC-sanctioned debates. And that effectively put an end to Bernie Sanders debating Donald Trump. I wonder what our country would be like right now if Wasserman Schultz had not been head of the DNC last year, if President Obama had removed her from the DNC after the Democratic Party’s disastrous mid-term election losses in 2014, or even if Bernie had debated Trump a year ago. All the polls have shown that if voters had been given a choice between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, the Democrats would have won the largest landslide in fifty years. We would be looking at a Bernie Sanders administration, instead of Donald Trump. We would be talking about single payer Medicare for All, instead of abolishing Obamacare. We would be talking about strengthening labor unions, instead of Right to Work for Less laws. We would have an Education Secretary committed to rebuilding our public schools, rather than committed to privatization and for-profit charter schools. We would be moving in the direction of solar energy and other sustainable and renewable energy sources, rather than moving forward with more pipelines, more fracking, and more climate change denial. We have our work cut out for us in resisting the new Republican agenda. But we also need to have honest discussions about the failures of the Democratic Party establishment to respect its own voters and protect our democracy. For too long, that party establishment has been rewarded for electoral failures, including the fiascos of 2010, 2014, and 2016. Unfortunately, too many establishment Democrats would rather remain corporate-funded than give up their corporate cash addiction to try to become a majority party that represents all the American people. A great many grassroots Democrats have had enough of business as usual. We recall the days when the Democratic Party was not corporate-owned, when it stood for humanity over greed. But when we stood up to challenge the corrupt status quo, as Bernie Sanders did last year, the response of establishment Democrats like Wasserman Schultz was to tell us to “shut up and sit down.” This contempt for democracy has resulted in the stunning defeat to Donald Trump and a Democratic Party in its weakest position in Congress and state legislatures and governorships since 1920. When we watch Bernie Sanders debate Ted Cruz tonight, we will be listening attentively to Bernie’s ideas about Obamacare. We will also remember how the DNC prevented any such debates a year ago and we will stiffen our resolve. We will not be silenced the next time the failed establishment calls for party unity over speaking truth to power.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:25:49.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
