When you score your first international goal... And then your second just 15 mins later! â€” #WCQ (@FIFAWorldCup) March 25, 2017 \nWith Blind coming increasingly under fire, the coach admitted responsibility for the latest chapter in Netherlands' sorry recent history. \n\"We had a very poor performance, that is obvious,\" he told NOS . \"I do not know why we started so poorly. \nWhat can you say? This is a nightmare - Robben \n\"We hardly created any chances. I blame myself. In hindsight it was not good for De Ligt to start, but that's hindsight. He is a great defender. This was my responsibility. \n\"Whether I will still lead the team? I need to think about it. I do not throw the towel in here. I'm incredibly disappointed, especially since I had a good feeling about this match. \n\"It makes sense that I put myself in front of the mirror.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T03:19:02.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
