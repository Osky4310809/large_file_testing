Trump, apparently, was not a fan of the photo choice, tweeting on Monday : \"@CNN just released a book called Unprecedented which explores the 2016 race & victory. Hope it does well but used worst cover photo of me!\"\nThe cover for the initial run of the book, which was published shortly after the election, featured a collage of photos including a smaller picture of Trump, taken during the campaign.\nAs it happens, the new portrait was taken on Nov. 21, just a couple of weeks after Trump's election night victory, according to sources. It was also taken minutes after Trump tore into TV news executives, including CNN president Jeff Zucker, in a high-profile meeting at Trump Tower that same day.\nAs POLITICO reported at the time , Trump called out Zucker and NBC News president Deborah Turness in the meeting, saying their reporters were \"liars\" and \"dishonest.\" After the meeting, Trump returned to his office, where Kennerly shot the new cover photo for CNN.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/815989154555297792", "http://www.cnn.com/interactive/unprecedented/book/"], "published": "2017-01-02T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:01:25.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
