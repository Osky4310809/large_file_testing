Bernie Sanders is expected to articulate his vision for responding to a Donald Trump presidency and a Republican-controlled House and Senate in a CNN town hall in the nation’s capital Monday night. Sanders, who vied for the Democratic nomination for president with Hillary Clinton, will sit down with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo at George Washington University, beginning at 9 p.m. EST. \nWhile he failed in his presidential bid, Sanders has been one of the most prominent voices on the left since Trump’s victory in November’s election. Along with Democratic members of Congress, he has called for a day of action on Jan 15, just five days before Trump takes office, to oppose planned changes to Obamacare and other healthcare programs. \n“Not only is the Republican plan immoral and bad economic and social policy, it violates numerous promises that Donald Trump made to the American people during his campaign,” Sanders wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post Monday . \nDuring his campaign, Sanders strongly advocated for universal public health care. \nAt the town hall, where he will take questions from the audience in Washington D.C., Sanders is also expected to outline how the Democratic Party should move forward from its election defeat and hold Trump’s administration to account. \nFormer Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks to reporters as Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (2nd R) and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (R) stand with him following their meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama on congressional Republicans' effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Jan. 4, 2017.

However, the independent senator has since repeated his criticisms of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party for its focus on big-money donors. \n\"Look, you can't simply go around to wealthy people's homes raising money and expect to win elections,\" he told NPR Friday . \"You've got to go out and mix it up and be with ordinary people.\" \n\"The Democratic Party swallowed the bait. They became hooked on big money.\" \nBernie Sanders CNN Town HallStart Time: 9 p.m. EST TV Channel: CNN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:39:56.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
