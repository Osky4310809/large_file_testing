What exactly \"in talks\" meant was not clear (more on that in a minute). But by midday Tuesday, the White House cited a \"scheduling conflict\" to say it would not happen. \nFYI here's the statement from the Nats about Trump not doing the first pitch pic.twitter.com/hkiILrlE7P \n— Dan Steinberg (@dcsportsbog) March 28, 2017 \nThe last time a sitting president threw out a first pitch, per CBS Sports , was when Barack Obama did so at a Nationals game on Opening Day in 2010. \nTrump, meanwhile ... well ... \nHe's thrown out first pitches before. \nAnd awkward-looking photos from those ceremonial tosses have become go-to fodder for internet people looking to make fun of him. \nReviewing the images, it's not terribly hard to see why. \n\nAt a Boston Red Sox game in 2006.\nImage: Cj Gunther/EPA/REX/Shutterstock\nThis next one's not quite as bad, but still — pretty awkward. \n\nAt a New York Yankees game in 2004.\nImage: WILLENS/AP/REX/Shutterstock\nMeanwhile, it will probably come as no surprise that Trump once boasted on Twitter about being the \"best bball player in N.Y.\" back in his day. \nI played football and baseball, sorry, but said to be the best bball player in N.Y. State-ask coach Ted Dobias-said best he ever coached.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2013 \nSo was it, in fact, a \"scheduling conflict\" that stopped Trump from throwing out the first pitch at next week's Nationals game? \nOr is that simply one of so many \" alternative facts \" to emerge from the White House since Trump took up residency there two months ago? \nPerhaps his handlers were worried about another meme-worthy photo opp. Or more tangibly, there's another possibility.\nWashington, D.C., voted 90 percent for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Nationally, Trump's approval rating just hit a new low . So it's not hard to imagine him being pelted with boos while taking the mound at Nationals Park, a scene White House handlers would surely love to avoid. \nBaseball writer Molly Knight reports that every single U.S. president has thrown a ceremonial first pitch at a Major League Baseball game while in office since William Taft started the tradition in 1910. We'll see if Trump gets another invite — and if he accepts. \nWATCH: A reusable sponge could be the latest solution to effectively clean up oil spills", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:02:31.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
