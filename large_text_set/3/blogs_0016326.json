But their opposition will run headlong into a GOP majority united in their enthusiasm for Trump's nominee. \nAs the confirmation hearings begin Monday, here are some of the players to watch: JIM WATSON / AFP - Getty Images \nSen. Dianne Fein stein, D- C ali. — The highest ranking Democrat on the committee will help set the tone for how the eight other members of her caucus question Gorsuch. She has called the nominee \"a very caring person\" and \"legally very smart,\" but also sent him a letter the week before the hearings to ask for more information from the nominee. She specifically asked for documents relating to his work for the Justice Department under President George W. Bush and his \"role in important litigation about executive power.\" Alex Wong / Getty Images \nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa — The chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee will be running the show when Gorsuch sits down for his anticipated grilling. He's had one high-profile warmup already when attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions appeared before the committee. Grassley is well liked on both sides of the aisle but earlier this month sparred with Democratic Sen. Al Franken over the senator's now noteworthy question to Sessions about whether he had contact with Russian officials. Those tensions may still linger if Franken or other Democrats push Gorsuch on the defensive about Trump's controversial comments and executive orders. \nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Co nn. — The Connecticut senator drew the president's scorn when he said Gorsuch privately told him the judge was \"disheartened by the demoralizing and abhorrent comments made by President Trump about the judiciary.\" Play Blumenthal: Attacks on the judiciary are dangerous 12:15 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/873433155818\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nThe comments came after Trump slammed a \"so-called judge\" for halting his original travel ban from seven Muslim-majority countries. He then criticized Blumenthal for being dishonest about his service in Vietnam and accused him of misrepresenting what Gorsuch told him. Other senators, however, said Gorsuch expressed similar sentiments to them. \nLike many Democrats, Blumenthal has said he is still angry Senate Republicans failed to hold hearings on Merrick Garland after Justice Antonin Scalia's death last year. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images \nSen. Mitch McConnell, R- Ky. — The Senate Majority Leader has vowed that Gorsuch will be confirmed before the Senate goes on recess in April. And he has not ruled out using the so-called \"nuclear option\" which would eliminate the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the nomination under current Senate rules, saying only that he is confident Gorsuch will get the required votes. In 2013 Senate Democrats used the maneuver to advance some of President Obama's nominees, but it did not apply to nominees to the high court. \nTrump has encouraged the use of the nuclear option if Gorsuch's nomination stalls. \"If we end up with that gridlock, I would say, 'If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,'\" he said last month. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nSen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. — The highest ranking Democrat in the Senate has been previewing his case against Gorsuch, painting the judge as an ideological extremist beholden to special interests. He said members of his caucus will come to their own conclusions about how to vote but he will make his views \"very strongly known to them\" after the hearings. Eight Democrats would need to vote for cloture for McConnell to avoid invoking the nuclear option. \nThe Red State Democrats — Ten Senate Democrats face re-election next year in states Trump won, and the president won 56 percent of voters who said the Supreme Court appointment was important, according to national exit polls. It puts Democrats in those states in the unenviable position of having to choose between trying to block the nomination or face a potential backlash from their Democratic base by at least voting for cloture. Most have so far remained mum on how they will vote saying they will wait for the hearings to play out.
