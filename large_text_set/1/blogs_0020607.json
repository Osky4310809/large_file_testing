Libya, for example, was exempt because its oil industry has been marred by months-long civil unrest. The state-owned oil company recently reported that production has risen above 700,000-barrels a day for the first time in three years. \nOfficial OPEC January production data is expected to be be released in mid-February. Other analysts said that if producers continue to adhere to the production limit, the oil market may encounter a supply shortage later this year, pushing Brent prices to the $60 a barrel range, despite expected slower growth in global demand. The world’s energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, now forecasts growth in global oil demand to ease to 1.3 million barrels a day this year, from 1.5 million barrels a day in 2016. \n“The prospect of higher product prices assuming that the cost of crude oil rises in 2017, plus the possibility of a stronger U.S. dollar, are factors behind our reduced demand growth outlook for this year,” the agency said in its monthly report. Another potential threat to OPEC’s plan is intensifying oil-digging activities in the U.S. The more oil the U.S. produces, the less it will need from the Middle East. Data from industry group Baker Hughes shows the number of working oil rigs in the U.S. climbed by 29 in the week ended Jan. 20 to a total of 551. The oil rig count stands at its highest level in 14 months, according to Price Futures Group’s Phil Flynn. \n“Assuming the U.S. oil rig count stays at the current level, we estimate U.S. oil production would increase by 315,000 barrels a day between fourth quarter 2016 and fourth quarter 2017 across the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara Shale plays,” Goldman Sachs said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:29:07.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
