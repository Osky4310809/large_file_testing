In gugudan I’m part of the dongsaeng [younger sibling] line, and my unnis take care of me.” \nThe name gugudan, Jellyfish Entertainment’s first girl group, garnered a lot of press when it was first revealed. “One day the CEO told us we were debuting and bought us a meal,” she said. “We were so excited we were shaking. He said he wasn’t sure what would happen with the team name in the end, but when he told it to someone, that person still remembered it a week later. He told us he was pretty decided on ‘gugudan’ as the name.” \nKim Sejeong added, “It’s important to make a memorable impression, but I remember wondering if it was okay. The meaning is very good. The cross between nine different charms and nine young girls is the meaning. But I think we are still lacking to live up to that meaning. We will work hard in the future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T20:49:13.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
