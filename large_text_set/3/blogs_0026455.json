We still lost Â£11m this year so we've still got a long way to go with the running of the club but deep down, it is about how hard you work for your money. \n\"Our fans know that's what I want, that's what I'm about and the players look to be more than earning their wages at the moment. \n\"It's about belief and building and trying to get to the other end of the table which does take consistency.
