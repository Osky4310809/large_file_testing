Gianotti \n  \nGeorge Martin’s Grillfire on Berry Hill Road in Syosset has closed. The restaurant, which opened in 2014 where Mim’s was, will be succeeded by one that mirrors the popular American-style bistro George Martin The Original in Rockville Centre. The new spot will be called George Martin 1989. \n“1989” reflects the year that George Korten opened his first restaurant, in Rockville Centre. Now designated “The Original,” its menu features dishes as varied as Buffalo-style chicken tacos, buttermilk-fried chicken, steaks and burgers, cauliflower ravioli, sesame tuna and mustard-and-pretzel crusted salmon. The Syosset menu will be similar but has not been finalized. Korten’s team is aiming for a mid-March opening.
