But in the last few decades its writers featured the real-estate tycoon as Ronald Grump, a heartless and unsympathetic character looking to trick residents out of their homes so he could built his lavish “Grump Tower” project. \nNow, the episodes featuring Grump are being resurfaced just as the man who inspired them is threatening to defund PBS, the network which airs the show (it also airs now on HBO.)

The deal eventually falls through. \nGrump’s second-ever appearance — this time as a human — was in 1994 for the show’s 25 anniversary special. \n“It may be the end of the road for ‘Sesame Street,'” says an ominous Barbara Walters as she introduces her “25/25” report about Grump’s announced plans for his new luxury apartment complex. \nPortrayed by a toupee-wearing Joe Pesci, Grump can be heard telling Sesame Street residents they have two weeks to “pack up and get out.” \n“In a stunning turn of events, it looks like ‘Sesame Street’ may be no more, due to one man, Ronald Grump,” says reporter Kathy Lee Kathy in a line that now seems eerily prescient. \nDespite pushback from teary-eyed residents, Grump won’t budge. But after Oscar reveals that his trash can is government property, Grump eventually decides to drop his plans.
