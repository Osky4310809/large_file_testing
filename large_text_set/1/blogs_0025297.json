But as the expensive sticker prices on those vehicles underscore, their greater cost of manufacturing is just one of many hurdles to overcome before these vehicles become more than a narrow subset of the green-car niche. \n-To address this problem, General Motors and Honda are teaming up to manufacture core fuel-cell hardware together at GM’s Brownstown Township, Michigan, facility, which will mass-produce components beginning around 2020. Each company is investing $42.5 million into the venture, which effectively will function as one company with fully shared development teams. It is anticipated that the effort will create nearly 100 jobs.\n-The components made at the Brownstown facility, which already assembles battery packs for a number of GM plug-in hybrids, including the Chevrolet Volt, will include a downsized next-generation fuel-cell stack.\n- Although several automakers have already partnered as groups to share in research-and-development costs for hydrogen fuel cells—Toyota and BMW, for one example, and Mercedes-Benz, Ford, and Nissan/Renault, for another—this is touted as the first fuel-cell-related manufacturing joint venture. The agreement will address manufacturing cost concerns through greater economies of scale and common sourcing.\n-Fuel cells harness a chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen (with the hydrogen stored typically in carbon-fiber tanks, at high pressures of 10,000 psi), producing electricity, water, and some heat. The fuel-cell “stacks,” where this reaction occurs between membrane-like layers, rely on very precise manufacturing and metallurgic techniques and have until now depended on the precious metal platinum.\n- The Path to Making Hydrogen Mainstream? \n-Dan Nicholson, GM’s global powertrain vice president, noted the millions of miles covered in both of the automakers’ efforts and said that it has all helped set a starting point for something bigger. The establishment of the facility, according to Nicholson, “officially marks the arrival of fuel cells. They’re not a science project anymore; they’re a mainstream alternative-energy choice.”\n- Although that’s an overstatement at best, both automakers have a long history with hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle development. GM mentioned its first Electrovan test vehicle from 1966 (shown above) and has demonstrated fuel-cell powertrains in a number of innovative vehicle forms over the years. One recent example is the military-grade Chevrolet Colorado ZH2 —although it has been nearly 10 years since it built 100 Chevrolet Equinox fuel-cell test vehicles. And GM’s E-Flex powertrain technology , later renamed Voltec, in the Chevrolet Volt was originally conceived to accommodate fuel cells.\n-Honda aims for two-thirds of its global sales to be electrified vehicles by 2030—with fuel cells an important part of that effort. It also builds on several decades of fuel-cell-vehicle development. Its FCX minicar was originally tested in Japan in 1999 and in a few U.S. fleets beginning in 2002. Its FCX Clarity was offered as consumer lease on a limited scale, and Honda will soon launch its Clarity Fuel Cell, a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle that will go 366 miles between refueling stops. Honda has announced a $369-per-month 36-month lease for the Clarity Fuel Cell, while Toyota is offering its rival model, the Mirai, at $349 a month.\n- - Chevrolet Colorado ZH2 Fuel-Cell Vehicle Is Basically Made for “Halo” - Honda Will Re-Enter the EV Race in 2017 with an All-Electric Version of Its Clarity - Honda Clarity: Photos, Info, Pricing - -While manufacturing costs have been one major drag on hydrogen-powered vehicles until now, the GM-Honda announcement didn’t address the second stumbling block: infrastructure. Hydrogen refueling stations have typically cost $1 million or more per station, and while costs continue to decline somewhat, establishing more hydrogen refueling points is a far more expensive and daunting endeavor than, say, electric-vehicle fast charging.\n-For now, because of the extremely limited number of refueling locations, fuel-cell models are largely constrained to California, where the state’s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) program has encouraged such vehicles. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center , there are 33 publicly accessible hydrogen stations in the United States, with all but three of those in California.\n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:43:44.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
