Howell \nAlex Anthopoulos the vice president of baseball operations for the Los Angeles Dodgers joins Prime Time Sports to talk about the Toronto Blue Jays signing J. P. Howell. Mike Johnston @mikeyj_mma January 31, 2017, 6:58 PM • J.P. Howell considered outstanding guy in clubhouse • Possible set-up man or late-inning option • Struggled against left-handed batters in 2016 \nWhen reports surfaced Tuesday evening about the Toronto Blue Jays agreeing to terms on a one-year deal with J.P. Howell , Blue Jays fans scrambled to their Google machines to see what they could find on the left-handed reliever. \nCall it a coincidence or call it kismet, but minutes after the report first surfaced, former Blue Jays GM and current VP of baseball operations for the Los Angeles Dodgers Alex Anthopoulos was a guest on Prime Time Sports. Howell had spent the previous four seasons with the Dodgers and Anthopoulos got to know him well in 2016 in his first post-Blue Jays season. \n“He’s a great guy,” Anthopoulos said . “The first thing that comes to mind is outstanding guy in the clubhouse. Great influence to the guys in the bullpen. One day whenever he’s done playing–which is hopefully a long time–I could see him being a coach and doing some things in the game but great competitor, not afraid at all. I remember seeing him out of the draft [in 2004], so I’ve been familiar with him for quite some time.” More from Sportsnet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:53:47.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
