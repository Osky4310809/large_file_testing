Don’t do this.\nThis is why we can’t have nice things. Last summer when Kevin Durant decided to leave the Thunder for the Warriors , Russell Westbrook posted an Instagram photo of cupcakes that was meant to be a shot at Kevin Durant . Then when Durant returned to OKC for the first time, the arena was full of cupcake jokes , including someone dressed up in a cupcake costume. \nWell the Warriors are back in OKC and the cupcake is back too. But this time with crutches.\nCome on now. The cupcake jokes are more than fine but finding a way to make fun of his injury ruins the fun. Durant is out for Monday’s game, but he did make the trip with the team after suffering a sprained MCL at the end of February.\nLet’s just go back to the regular cupcake jokes without the crutches, OKC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:44:56.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
