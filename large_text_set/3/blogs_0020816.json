He says that if the president is under investigation by the FBI, that constitutes a “major constitutional crisis” that “could do severe damage to this country.” Oops. I mean, he said that about Hillary Clinton: Sean Hannity: A president under FBI investigation would present \"a major Constitutional crisis\" pic.twitter.com/KwdAk4zpjP \n— Media Matters (@mmfa) March 21, 2017 \nThink about the magnitude of all of this for a second. Hillary Clinton could be sworn into office while still being under investigation from the FBI, which would then put this country into a major constitutional crisis. Now Clinton says Donald Trump, oh he’s not fit to serve in the oval office, but she and she alone has created a situation that could do severe damage to this country and the office of the presidency, and prevent this country from solving problems. \nBut in fact, it was Trump who entered office under an FBI investigation, which has been going on since July of last year. But Trump himself was saying that you shouldn’t vote for Clinton because she wouldn’t be able to get anything done with an ongoing FBI investigation. But now that we know it’s actually Trump under investigation, suddenly there’s no crisis at all and no problem and this is all fake news anyway. If you expected consistency, you haven’t been paying attention.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:57:55.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
