Photo: Buster Hein/Cult of Mac \nApple quietly updated the iPad mini 4 today, making 128GB of storage available as standard. It’s a significant upgrade over the 32GB of storage previously offered, but at $399, it’s a total ripoff. \nAside from the storage bump, the iPad mini 4 hasn’t changed one bit. You still get the same A8 chip that originally made its debut inside the iPhone 6 in 2014, the same 2048-by-1536 display, and an aging 8-megapixel iSight camera. \nIt’s certainly a nice storage bump, and without a price increase, it seems like a good deal. Until you consider that the new 9.7-inch iPad, which offers a bigger and sharper display, a faster A9 chip, and a still-impressive 12-megapixel iSight camera makes it a total ripoff. \nThe new iPad starts at just $329 — $70 cheaper than the iPad mini 4. Admittedly, you only get 32GB of storage for that, but even the 128GB model is just $30 more than the iPad mini. It makes us wonder why the iPad mini is still available at all. \nIf you buy one (it’s available to order today), you’re wasting your money. If you really must have that smaller screen for whatever reason, do yourself a favor and look for a used model in good condition, which will cost you a lot less.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:18:56.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
