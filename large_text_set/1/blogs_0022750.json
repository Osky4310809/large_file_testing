That the hard-charging Mr. Brock — polarizing even among Democrats and identified chiefly with Mrs. Clinton — could summon a broad array of progressives was an indication of the energy coursing through the left. Strolling by the pool and talking about how to rebuild, in between presentations with titles like “What the Hell Just Happened?,” the donors expressed a determination to fight back. “There’s a real urgent energy,” said Susie Tompkins Buell, one of Mrs. Clinton’s top fund-raisers. “This is bigger than women’s rights, this is bigger than human rights, this is bigger than the environment. This is the future of the entire world.” \nAdvertisement Continue   Mr. Brock said he would ask for $40 million this year for his constellation of research and advocacy groups, increasing the individual budget of each. A host of other progressive groups are broadening their ambitions, as well, including the Center for American Progress, a research group, and Priorities USA, which served as the primary “ super PAC ” for Democratic presidential candidates in the last two elections. Some liberals who are part of the Democracy Alliance, a progressive umbrella group, are irritated that Mr. Brock staged the event, fearing that he is creating a competitor to their conferences.

Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Such jostling for organizational supremacy was also a feature of the conservative landscape when the right formed its resistance to Mr. Obama. But Democrats are already contending with challenges that Republicans never fully confronted after 2008. There was something close to unanimity on the right in its opposition to Mr. Obama’s agenda. The Affordable Care Act did not win one vote from a congressional Republican. But Democrats are at odds over whether they should oppose Mr. Trump across the board or selectively work with him where they have common interests. Putting his marker down in that debate, Mr. Brock told donors that the “coming divide” in the party would be “between those who resist and oppose and those who accommodate and appease.” A debate over Mr. Trump’s first 100 days broke out at a session here, with Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago pressing for accommodation at times and Ron Klain, a veteran Democratic operative, urging total opposition. “My attitude is, there will be things that in the interest of the country we’re going to work on, and things we’re not because it’s not in the best interest,” Mr. Emanuel said. The debate pointed to a more fundamental difference between the political right and left, which could make Democratic unity more difficult: While conservatives are glad to reap the political benefits from halting or undermining an expansion of government, liberals are invested in a well-functioning state. “You’re going to have a harder time getting Democrats to say, ‘We don’t want government to work,’” said Mr. Schneiderman, who was a panelist at the event. \nFollow The New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:29:49.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
