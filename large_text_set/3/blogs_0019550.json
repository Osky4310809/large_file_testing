El Clasico was coming to Manchester, or so it seemed.\nThat understandably meant that Antonio Conte’s appointment at Chelsea went under the radar somewhat, but how’s he got on since then?\nStart of season expectations It’s fair to say that, after last season, these will not have been *too* high at Stamford Bridge. A return to the top four would certainly be acceptable, and picking up one of the two cups a nice little bonus.\nMostly, however, it seemed clear that a major rebuilding job was needed at Chelsea – old players and egos needed clearing out, and the team spirit that was lost last season badly needed reviving.\nConte's full Chelsea record \n\nWins 28.00 Draws 3.00 Losses 4.00 Share\n\nOthers had tried and failed with this task before, so a transitional season at the Bridge seemed a very realistic prospect.\nAchievements so far Where to start? Despite barely making any significant changes to personnel, everything Conte has touched has turned to gold.\nChelsea summer signings N’Golo Kante – £32million\nDavid Luiz – £30million\nMichy Batshuayi – £33million\nMarcos Alonso – £24million Chelsea have a ten-point lead at the top of the Premier League table with just ten matches to go. At the same stage last season they were 30 points worse off and all the way down in 8th in the table. In short, the Italian has his side well ahead of schedule.\nPerhaps all the more impressively, he’s achieved this without making enemies at every corner, without going out of his way to alienate a big name in his squad just to make a point, and whilst actually playing some fast, free-flowing football, even if some definitely-not-biased people don’t agree with that last point.\nNot a bad appointment in the end (Picture: Getty) As much as anyone at Chelsea would loathe to admit it – part of Conte’s job description would undoubtedly have been to improve the club’s ‘brand’, and the former Juventus boss can put a very big tick in that box indeed.\nGone is the unambitious, cynical football; gone are the days when youngsters and loanees are an afterthought; and – whisper it – gone are the days when Chelsea were the team we all loved to hate.\nI mean, come on, you’d have to have a heart of stone not to like this guy…\nAntonio Conte knows how to party. #CFC pic.twitter.com/o6ijLTC2Hg \n— Jared Weiss (@JaredWeissNBA) March 18, 2017 \nLow points \nNot many of these, though losing 3-0 to Arsenal earlier in the season seems inexcusable, especially now that we’ve seen quite how good Chelsea are.\nIn the end, that result ended up being beneficial for Conte as it was the catalyst for his change of system. Even when Arsenal win, they lose.\nHonestly, what kind of Chelsea manager loses 3-0 to Arsenal? (Picture: Getty) If we’re being super critical, we could take the opportunity, like aforementioned definitely-not-biased-or-bitter people have done for much of the season, to point to the club’s lack of European action as a low point.\nArsenal star highlights major flaw in Arsene Wenger's set-up While Chelsea’s failure to qualify for Europe is not Conte’s fault, it has certainly helped Conte get that extra time on the training ground with his players between games, allowing him to fine-tune his system in a way that other managers simply haven’t been able to.\nChelsea fans won’t care, but one has to wonder how differently things might’ve gone if, say, his and Pep Guardiola’s situations were reversed at the start of the season.\nNo European football AND this guy? We should’ve seen it coming a mile off (Picture: Getty) Plus, let’s face it, it’s already been shown that literally anyone could win the league with N’Golo Kante in their squad, so that has to go down as essentially cheating as well.\nTactical reputation While most members of the Managerial Super League have only seen their reputations suffer this season, Conte’s has gone up and up as the campaign has gone on.\nArriving with the image of a loud Italian man who won three titles in an easy league by simply shouting and gesturing from the touchline, Conte’s 3-4-3 system is now the talk of the town, with top clubs around Europe already starting to copy it.\nConte’s most used Chelsea XI this season (Picture: Metro.co.uk) After an unspectacular start, Conte changed to a back three and wing-backs after losing to Liverpool and Arsenal in back-to-back games, and the result was a 13-game winning run that more or less killed the title race by Christmas.\nThe difference in players like David Luiz, Cesar Azpilicueta and Pedro has been notable, but most of all it’s the rise of Victor Moses as one of the world’s finest wing-backs that confirms to you for sure that you’re dealing with a tactical genius of the highest order.\nYes, there is plenty of shouting and gesturing, but there’s a method to the madness. Full marks, Antonio.\n\nObjectives for the rest of the season Pretty simple really – finish the job in the Premier League (Conte thinks it’ll take 21 points , we’ve calculated that it’ll probably be less than that ) and make it a double by grabbing the FA Cup as well.\nRumour Mill: our round-up of football gossip, rumours and speculation This looks pretty easily achievable. Chelsea can afford a few slip-ups in the league in their more difficult games, while the rest are sufficiently easy-looking on paper that the final ten fixtures of the season should be a formality.\nConte’s Chelsea look a good shout for the double at the moment (Picture: Getty) In the cup, a semi-final with Tottenham awaits, and that could be the biggest hurdle. Spurs are one of only three teams to beat Chelsea this season and did so convincingly with a 2-0 victory at White Hart Lane in January. Mauricio Pochettino’s men also caused them a lot of problems in the fixture at Stamford Bridge, which they were unlucky to lose 2-1.\nEven if they get past them, it’s either Arsenal or Manchester City in the final, and while the Blues would certainly be favourites, you’d have to bill that as a game that could go either way in a one-off.\nChelsea's remaining games Crystal Palace (H) – Sat 1 Apr\nManchester City (H) – Wed 5 Apr\nBournemouth (A) – Sat 8 Apr\nManchester United (A) – Sun 16 Apr\nSouthampton (H) – Sun 23 Apr (currently postponed for FA Cup semi-final) \nEverton (A) – Sun 30 Apr\nMiddlesbrough (H) – Sat 6 May\nWest Brom (A) – Sat 13 May\nSunderland (H) – Sun 21 May Job safety Surely not an issue. Yes, we know it’s Chelsea, but barring one of the biggest collapses in Premier League title race history, Conte is surely sitting more comfortably than most managers in the world right now (Arsene Wenger doesn’t count).\nMORE: Video: David Luiz does a brilliant Antonio Conte impression \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:24:26.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
