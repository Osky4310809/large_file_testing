The play unfolded with Dwyane Wade running out on a fast break with Cousins trailing. While it doesn’t look like Cousins touched him, Wade missed the dunk and it’s likely the referee assumed there was contact. Wade made 1-of-2 free throws which ultimately put the Bulls ahead for good.\nTie game only seconds remaining DWYANE WADE FOR THE WIN!!!! pic.twitter.com/B4Ph437NDy \n— #GonzoForLonzo (@World_Wide_Wob) January 22, 2017 The referee was in the correct position to make this call so it does appear that Cousins was called for contact he did not make. Needless to say, Cousins was not happy.\nDeMarcus Cousins rightfully irate after one of the the worst referee calls in recent NBA history pic.twitter.com/mU7h9yy4W8 \n— #GonzoForLonzo (@World_Wide_Wob) January 22, 2017 Cousins made a mess on his way back to the visitors locker room in Chicago, turning over trash cans in the hallway. He was rightfully angry over the situation.\nBoogie was not happy about that call. pic.twitter.com/9jagzuwAxw \n— Sean Highkin (@highkin) January 22, 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T07:13:45.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
