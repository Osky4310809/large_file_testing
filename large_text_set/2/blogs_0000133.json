Hashtags like #TrumpBlackHistory are why I love twitter sometimes. \n— Matthew A. Cherry (@MatthewACherry) February 1, 2017 \nNot only are they hilarious, but these predictions are honestly kind of scary because it’s totally possible to imagine President Trump saying and doing some of the things discussed in these tweets. Twitter users created the hashtags #TrumpBlackHistory and #TrumpOnBlackHistory to try and predict Trump’s words and actions during Black History Month. Dr. King was a real hero, believe me. Great doctor. Healed a lot of patients. Not convinced he was born here. #TrumpBlackHistory \n— John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) February 1, 2017 Users had some pretty good guesses. “The underground railroad is terrific—you can take the 5 straight to Trump Tower. America needs to build things again.” #TrumpBlackHistory \n— Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) February 1, 2017 It’s funny, but also kind of sad no one would be surprised if Trump said or did any of these things. Have you done your research on this guy? \"I remember when Black people couldn't live in White neighborhoods. Like this morning — at Trump Luxury Apartments!\" #TrumpBlackHistory \n— Mrs. Betty Bowers (@BettyBowers) February 1, 2017 Malcolm X would NOT approve. And of course, who could forget the great Malcom X, founder of the X-Men. Superb professor. A terrific team. The best. #TrumpBlackHistory \n— Em Vee (@HombreDeTroy) February 1, 2017 This is the President Trump version of the typical “my best friend is black” response you usually get when someone is attempting to justify racism. I am the biggest fan of Black people. My Butler is Black. My maids are Black. Heck even my heart is Black. Bigly. #TrumpBlackHistory \n— Suhail Mohammed (@shadowwraiths) February 1, 2017 Of course, there had to be a few crowd size references in there! The 1965 March on Washington crowd was large, but it doesn't compare to my inauguration crowd. #trumpblackhistory \n— Tim Sanders (@Timthysanders) February 1, 2017 There’s always the chance DJT could claim to be a minority himself. I have deep respect for minorities because as the 1%, I myself am a minority. #TrumpBlackHistory \n— Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 1, 2017 What’s a Trump-related trending topic without a “HUGE” reference?! Rosa Parks was the first black woman to walk her dog in an integrated park. You should have seen the dog. It was huge! #TrumpBlackHistory \n— Matthew A. Cherry (@MatthewACherry) February 1, 2017 He could always disrespect the legends, too. Let’s hope not. #TrumpOnBlackHistory Harriet Tubman, didn't build any hotels. Just a railroad. Very little profit. Sad. I'm very rich. \n— Melissa (@omgwtfbbqsauces) February 1, 2017 Expect the worst. \"Denzel Washington even got a whole city named after him! The best honer! The biggest honer! He helped #MAGA \" #TrumpOnBlackHistory \n— Jules AF (@Julesaf0) February 1, 2017 Out of all of these great predictions, here’s one I would probably expect from President Trump the most… \"I got more votes from the blacks than Obama.\" – #TrumpOnBlackHistory \nNow, here’s to hoping POTUS doesn’t actually say ANY of these things throughout Black History Month.
