The Pine Tree State wants to ban the purchase of sugary drinks and candy with food stamps, while the Emerald City seeks a tax on sodas to help education. \nThe Maine Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) asked the federal government on Friday for a waiver to ban the purchase of soft drinks and candy under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, better known as food stamps). It is the second time that the LePage administration has sought such a waiver from the US Department of Agriculture. The USDA under then-President Barack Obama denied the request last summer.

We should all eat and drink fewer sugary products.” Maine welfare helpline surprises cardholders with sex line connection https://t.co/cAETMJ6rMR — RT (@RT_com) July 17, 2016 \nNearly two-thirds of Maine’s adult population is overweight or obese, and the state has the highest obesity rate in New England. It spends $700 million annually on obesity-related medical costs, according to Mayhew. \n“This [SNAP] money is supposed to help people in desperate straits,” Republican state Senator Eric Brakey told the Bangor Daily News. “If I was donating money to a charity for people in desperate situations and I found out that someone was using it for soda or candy, I would want my money back.” \nMeanwhile, in Seattle, Democratic Mayor Ed Murray proposed a 2-cent, per-ounce tax on sugary drinks on Tuesday. The expected $16 million raised annually would be invested in education “to eliminate the opportunity gap between white students and African American/Black students and other historically underrepresented students of color,” the mayor said in a statement .

In-store prepared coffee, 100-percent fruit juice and infant formula would be exempted. \nThe money would fund programs recommended by the Education Summit Advisory group. \nEducation advocates praised the announcement, which was made as part of the mayor’s annual State of the City address. \n“In addition to providing funding for early learning programs, sugary drink tax revenues can be invested in low-income communities disproportionately affected by health conditions caused by sugary drinks, while also raising revenue for crucial programs that improve health both directly and indirectly, like chronic disease prevention programs and public safety,” Mark Shrivers, the president of the Save the Children Action Network, said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:21:05.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
