The movie has managed to register an occupancy of just 10-15 per cent across India, which is very disappointing to say the least. Being the prequel to a hit film like Baby and having a superstar like Akshay Kumar in the movie, we expected Naam Shabana to perform well at the box office. But looks like it hasn’t started off as well as was expected. \nTalking about the opening occupancy of Naam Shabana , trade expert, Akshaye Rathi (exhibitor and distributor) analyses, “It has not been up to the mark. The film, during the morning shows, opened with an average occupancy of just 10-15 per cent across India.” With a niche release in about 1300-1400 screen, we expected the movie to at least open with an occupancy of 40 per cent, however the movie could not live up to our expectations.

Our reviewer, Sreeju Sudhakaran mentioned in his review how Taapsee and Akshay’s act was fabulous, but the movie did not live up to the hype. As he wrote, “Watch Naam Shabana purely for Taapsee Pannu’s fine performance and Akshay Kumar’s enjoyable cameo, and also if you loved Baby too much. Just don’t go into theatre expecting another quality stuff like Baby , even if the movie forces us to draw comparisons.” ALSO READ – Naam Shabana movie review: Taapsee Pannu and Akshay Kumar get a thumbs up from critics \nWith Akshay Kumar in the movie and a decent word of mouth publicity, we expect the movie to grow during the evening shows. But this will all depend on how much the audience likes the movie.
