Sampaoli maintains the highly-rated director's future will have no effect on his. \n\"I would like Monchi to stay, but it is not a condition for me to stay,\" he added. \"According to the football project that has Sevilla, one is here to help or not, I feel useful, loved and respected.\" \nAfter seeing his side eliminated from the Champions League at the hands of Leicester City in midweek, the former Chile boss admitted he was hurt but stressed his side will bounce back. \nChelsea stay cool to kill off title race \n\"After you fall down you must get back up and try again,\" he added. \"It is important that you never get too down or get too high either. \n\"The Champions League loss was a painful defeat for us but I don't consider it a great failure. \n\"It did cause me great pain that even meant I wasn't able to sleep but as I said, life must go on. \n\"People will think that we are in a state of depression but it won't be like that. I am really enjoying my time at the club this season so it is only natural that any defeat we suffer hurts me.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T10:46:52.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
