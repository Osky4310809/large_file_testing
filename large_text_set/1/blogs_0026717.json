While most relied on punchlines to soften the blow of the ban, James Corden shared a heartfelt video. James Corden, The Late Late Show \nCorden recorded a video showing how easy it is for him to get through Los Angeles International Airport despite Trump's immigration ban. \"Freedom of movement should be this easy for all legal immigrants,\" a message read at the end of the video. \"Not just the white and Christian ones.\" Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show \nFallon donned a perfectly coiffed wig and red tie to impersonate POTUS, addressing the immigration ban via his \"24/7 YouTube livestream from the Oval Office.\" \n\"When it comes to immigrants, you have two choices: Either get out of here or marry me,\" the late night host said. Seth Meyers comes for Donald Trump for 'lying' about illegal voters Seth Meyers, Late Night \nWhile taking \"A Closer Look,\" Meyers analyzed Friday's ceremony and claimed Trump \"read (the order) aloud like he was seeing it for the very first time.\" \n\"Hey, man it's not comforting to us when you seem shocked by the stuff you're signing,\" Meyers said. \"That's the way people look before they sign the injury waiver on American Ninja Warrior .\" Stephen Colbert, The Late Show \n\"Keep in mind, there are currently more refugees around the world than at any time since World War II, and Trump just slammed the door,\" Colbert said. \"Which explains why the poem on the Statue of Liberty now reads, 'Don't let it hit ya where the good Lord split ya.'\" Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Kimmel Live \nKimmel directed his attention to airport demonstrations that occurred over the weekend. \"People went to the airport to protest, which that's when you know people are mad,\" he joked. \"It's Sunday. They have no travel plans, and they go to the airport.\" \nThe talk show host also got on White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for defending the detainment of a 5-year-old.
