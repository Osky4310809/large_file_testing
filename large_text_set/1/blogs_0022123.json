But they weren’t expecting this duck to pay a visit like this! \n“This wild duck would have to be the bravest (or craziest) duck that ever lived, after it decided to play the most dangerous game ever of Marco Polo with Jalur, a 126 kg [277 lb] male Sumatran Tiger in the Tiger Sanctuary pool,” the park writes. \nThe duck goes for a swim in Marco Polo’s pool and almost seems to be daring the tiger to catch him as he repeatedly dives under the surface, dodging the tiger’s chase. Talk about an intense game of “cat and duck”! \nIn the end, the tiger amazingly gives up, letting the duck take over his pool! \nShare this amazing   family!
