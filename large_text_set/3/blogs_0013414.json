(ANI) \nIndia today once again slammed Pakistan at the United Nations for forcibly keeping a part of it forcibly and illegally. Speaking at the UN, it also said that Pakistan continued its support for terrorist groups in Jammu and Kashmir, which is a main challenge to protect the human rights of citizens in the state. It further said that apart from becoming terrorism factory, Pakistan also alienated it’s own people through continued mistreatment of minorities. \nEarlier this month, speaking at the United Nations Human Rights Council session in Geneva, Ajit Kumar, India claimed that in the last two decades the world’s most wanted terrorists found succor and sustenance in Pakistan. Kumar also said that while Pakistan has created terrorist outfits against India, the ‘monster’is now devouring its creator. \nFurther stating that the fundamental reason for the disruption in different parts of Jammu and Kashmir is the cross-border terrorism aided and abetted by Pakistan, Kumar said that the neighboring country’s unwarranted references to UNSC resolutions are misleading as Pakistan was required to vacate parts of Kashmir under illegal and forced occupation. \nThe tension between India and Pakistan has escalated since, in a reply to the Uri attacks, the Indian Army carried out surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC), destroying several terrorist launch pads. There had been several instances of cross-border firings and terrorist infiltrations within the country by official or unofficial armed forces from Pakistan. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nPakistan has been under tremendous global pressure to eliminate terrorism on its soil and the pressure has increased ever since Donald Trump took over as the President of United States. However, Ashraf said that Trump has been spreading Islamophobia.
