Burnley Combined Court (Photo: Press Association Images) \nWhen the accommodation manager of the complex in Clayton-le-Moors arrived the victim said: ‘Have you seen my head? She’s done that the me.’ \nKing, 46, pleaded guilty to common assault and arson and was jailed for nine months. \nStephen Parker, prosecuting, told the court how King and the victim had known each other for about 10 years and he ‘classed her as a friend’. \nThe court heard how convicted King ‘regularly borrowed’ money from him and did chores in return, however he was ‘concerned that she spent the money he gave her on both alcohol and drugs’.

He said she had ‘lapsed back into alcohol consumption and drug addiction’.
