Field happens to be the party spokesperson for gambling.\nHe told BuzzFeed News there were at least three people in TAB shirts handing out various materials, including the jelly beans.\n\n“I normally walk past anyone handing stuff to you at a train station,” he said. “But because I have the gambling portfolio I did a double take and thought, ‘What’s that about?’”\nThe packet has a sticker bearing the tab.com.au logo and the phrase “Nothing’s as sweet as a win”.\nField said the jelly bean packet was a violation of gambling advertising regulations.\nUnder Betting and Racing Regulation 2012 gambling advertising must not be published without the following warning:\nThink!

It’s really permeating all aspects of our lives at the moment… This is the next level of gambling and gambling messages in our lives.”\nA spokesperson for Tabcorp told BuzzFeed News the jelly beans were to mark the beginning of a NSW racing event.\n“The promotion targeted only people aged 25 or over and was carried out in central Sydney to mark the beginning of New South Wales’ premier autumn racing event, the Championships,” he said.\n“The material – stress balls, mints and jelly beans – featured only general TAB branding and contained no promotion of odds or direct encouragement to place a bet.”\nLiquor & Gambling NSW told BuzzFeed News it was aware of the jelly bean advertising and was looking into it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:56:00.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
