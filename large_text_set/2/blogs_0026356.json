Ready? We are Loving Ruth Negga’s Academy Awards gown . (We’ll see ourselves out.)\nThe actress is up for a Best Actress Oscar tonight for her role in the historical drama, and we couldn’t be more obsessed with her stunning ensemble that quite literally matches the red carpet.\nNegga looks like an IRL queen in a long-sleeved, A-line custom red Valentino gown, with lace embellishments throughout the sleeves and along the high neckline, broken up from the rest of the bodice by an illusion piece. A custom ruby-red headpiece by Irene Neuwirth and matching earrings completed the look — along with a red lip , because go big or go home, in our opinion.\nThe back somehow even adds the the exquisiteness, and we think this photographer agrees.

And maybe already scouring the internet for your dress to put on our Christmas lists…\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:26:48.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
