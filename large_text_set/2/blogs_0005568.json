Reds to change keepers again Karius is set to replace Mignolet once more (Photo: AMA/Getty) \nSimon Mignolet is set to be axed again by Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. \nGoalkeeper Mignolet, who was singled out for criticism by manager Klopp last weekend, will be a victim as the German gets tough with his out-of-form Reds, writes Mirror Football's David Maddock. \nLoris Karius is likely to be recalled in place of Mignolet, while Klopp looks certain to bring back Giorginio Wijnaldum in midfield and Divock Origi may also get a starting opportunity up front. \nMignolet's potential summer sale could finance a move for England No1 Joe Hart, although Liverpool have not so far considered the Manchester City star spending the season on loan at Torino as a target.
