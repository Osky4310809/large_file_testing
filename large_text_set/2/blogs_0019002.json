Trends Police brutality , Police-involved shootings \nRepresentative William Lacy Clay (D-Missouri) filed a federal lawsuit against the Architect of the Capitol, claiming that the painting‚Äôs removal violated the First Amendment rights of David Pulphus, its author and a former student at Cardinal Ritter College Prep High School in St. Louis. \nThe painting, \"Untitled #1,\" is an interpretation of the unrest that took place following the August 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, by police in Ferguson, Missouri. The painting depicts two police officers as pig-like animals with tusks. One is pointing a gun at a protester. Joining Rep. Lacy Clay at the E.

Jamie Raskin (@RepRaskin) February 21, 2017 \nThe suit names Architect of the Capitol Stephen Ayers as the defendant, the Post-Dispatch reported . The suit does not seek damages, but will ask for \"declaratory and injunctive\" measures, according to Clay's spokesman, Steven Engelhardt. \n\"Seven months after being displayed as part of a public exhibit, a deluge of alternative right media, aided by the unauthorized actions of certain reactionary members of Congress, deprived Mr. Pulphus of his constitutionally guaranteed 1st Amendment Right of Free Expression,\" Clay said in a statement, quoted by the Post-Dispatch.

Duncan Hunter (R-California), who removed the painting himself. Clay then returned the painting to the tunnel wall. The majority members then took their grievances to the Architect of the Capitol Ayers.

Brown's killing set off nationwide protests of police violence against minority communities. \nPulphus, who now attends college, has only discussed the controversy through an opinion piece that ran last month in the Post-Dispatch. \n\"Why would a young student with hope, promise and purpose perceive our community and the police in such a manner?\" he wrote. \n\"The officials did not take into account the role militarization of policing has played in African-American communities (including Ferguson and St. Louis) or the way 'stop and frisk' and pretext stops invade the privacy of African-American citizens. These are things that we have personally experienced.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:57:59.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
