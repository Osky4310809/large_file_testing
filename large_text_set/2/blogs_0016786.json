(Image: Â© Android Police) \nThe images show off the new symbol design for the supposed smartphone's virtual buttons - matching up with another recent leak claiming to be Samsung's yet-to-be-announced Galaxy S8 from Benjamin Geskin via Twitter . \nAlso interesting is that the lack of bezel has moved the fingerprint to the back of the phone, near the iris and flash components of the camera. This also lines up with past leaks , including a recent one from reputable first-look extraordinaire @OnLeaks.
