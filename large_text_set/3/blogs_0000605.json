Will he clarify comments he made earlier on Tuesday, in which he suggested that Jews themselves were to blame for the fresh wave of bomb threats in their cemeteries? I don’t know about you, but I’m not feeling too “optimistic.” Advertisement \nIf tonight’s address is like any of his previous speeches, Trump will spend over an hour describing democratic institutions as a “total disaster” and insist “believe me!” as he vows to fix everything that is “very, very bad” without much detail. \nDemocrats have invited Muslims, DREAMers, LGBT activists, and undocumented immigrants to the speech and the women in the House are wearing their finest Suffragette Whites.
