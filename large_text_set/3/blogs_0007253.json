Well I never! \n\n\n\nTalk about being on brand. Kevin Stallings just exudes dickheadedness. Not even saying I have a problem with it, I love tough love coaches. Bobby Knight is the GOAT. Telling a kid across the court to get the fuck back in the game instead of checking or even caring about the possibly injured player on the floor in front of your feet – I love that. \n\n\nWTAE – As Sheldon Jeter laid face-down on the floor during an injury timeout, the Panthers’ first-year head coach was caught on camera shouting profanities at Ryan Luther and expressing his displeasure with the junior forward. \nSome Pitt fans on social media voiced their objections to Stallings’ behavior. \n“I got on him,” Stallings admitted after Pitt’s 61-59 victory. “Maybe it was inappropriate how I got on him, but Ryan knows I care greatly about him and I want him to be better — and Ryan, of all people, wants me to coach him hard, so that’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to coach him hard. \n“And like I said, sometimes I should use better language. But sometimes, I don’t.” \n\n\nApologizing for trying to motivate these young men while one of them flops around faking an injury. Sad!
