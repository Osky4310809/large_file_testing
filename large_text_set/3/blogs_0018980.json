The actor, 77, intends to perform Shakespeare, “do a bit of Gandalf” and read from JRR Tolkien’s original novel. \nHe will also consider taking requests if audience members want to hear about a particular role from his five-decade career, which spans the film version of Richard III, the X-Men movies and, most recently, the live-action remake of Beauty And The Beast . Sir Ian, who is preparing to play King Lear at Chichester, said he wanted to put on a “free and easy” show which would be different each night. \n“It will be revisiting plays I’ve already done,” he added .“ Shakespeare doesn’t always lend itself to anthologising, you can take speeches out of context but it doesn’t always work. Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen share a kiss at Empire Awards \n“But if I can put them in the context of productions I’ve been in it will make it easier and it will be fun to go back to Richard II and Hamlet and other parts I can’t play any more. \n“I think most people who come will be enthusiasts for the theatre and I intend to entertain — but I don’t think I can be more specific than that.” There will be nine of the shows, called Shakespeare, Tolkien, Others & You, in July. \nThe run will be accompanied by an exhibition of posters, paintings and photographs from throughout his career, which has included stints with the National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company. Sir Ian is an ambassador for the Finsbury Park theatre and hopes to raise “a little pot of money” that will allow the theatre’s artistic director Jez Bond to put on more original work. Ian McKellen to play King Lear in new Chichester season \nHe said: “In a short time the theatre has established itself on both the theatrical and local maps. But with no public subsidy for core costs, they need to bring in donations of around £250,000 every year just to keep the doors open.” Tickets for the two-hour show cost £85. Some £10 tickets will be available on the day. \nBond said there no one was better placed than Sir Ian to “understand both the power and importance of smaller scale theatres”. He added: “Ian has been a staunch supporter since the building was a hard-hat site and I continue to be grateful for and humbled by his incredible generosity.” \nShakespeare, Tolkien, Others & You is at the Park Theatre from July 3 to 9.
