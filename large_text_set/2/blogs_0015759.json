(Photo: Getty Images) \nIf you’re applying to college, follow this golden rule of social media: Don’t post anything you wouldn’t want your parents to see. \nA new survey by Kaplan Test Prep released Feb. 10 found that out of more than 350 college admissions officers across the United States, 35% admit to checking an applicant’s social media profiles before making a decision. Sites such as Twitter and Facebook can be easily accessed by admissions officers, and the survey found nearly half of those who do check social media say it helps (or hurts) a students’ application. \nOne survey participant learned through an applicant’s Twitter page that the student ran an LGBTQ panel for her high school, which she failed to include in her application. The discovery of this missing piece sparked a deeper curiosity within the admissions committee, which boded well for the applicant. \nBut poor social media decorum can get a student removed from the pool of potential candidates. Students have been rejected from schools for posting nasty things about their peers or teachers or making racist remarks . \nBut that’s not a typical occurrence, according to Yariv Alpher, executive director of research at Kaplan Test Prep. \n“The large majority of admissions officers do not visit applicants’ social media sites. However, a meaningful number do, as many note that social media can provide a more authentic and holistic view of applicants beyond the polished applications,” Alpher said. \nPomona College actually has a policy against using students’ social media as a deciding factor for admissions. With an acceptance rate below 10%, Pomona College weeds out applicants based solely on the materials submitted. \nAdam Sapp, director of admissions at Pomona College, still cautions students to be careful of the message they put out on social media. \n“I think one of the things that students have to be careful about is really the idea that when you put information out there, anyone can see it. The reality is that being careful about what you put out in the world is always a good idea. You don’t know how it’s going to be interpreted,” Sapp said. Related: Why your social media presence should be professional \nKeith Nagy, a junior at Silver Lake High School in Silver Lake, Kan., plans on applying to the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago and Dartmouth College with hopes of pursuing a degree in political science. Nagy said he believes admissions officers should be able to use social media as a factor when making decisions, though he thinks there’s a limit to what that can accomplish. \n“I don’t think it’s a very effective way of assessing a potential applicant. A lot of people are different on social media than they are in reality, especially my social media. I’m kind of snarky and sarcastic,” Nagy said. “So, you’re not really grasping a person’s true personality simply by looking at their Facebook or Twitter profile.” \nUtah State University freshman Libby Pope already experienced the admissions process a year ago, and her thoughts on the role of social media in the admissions process diverts from Nagy’s. \n“I’ve always been aware of my presence on social media,” Pope said. “I have no problem with admissions officers looking at social media; they are trying to get a more clear picture of who you are. If they can do that through social media, they are using their resources well.” Cameron McGough is a student at the University of Kansas and a USA TODAY College digital producer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:49:43.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
