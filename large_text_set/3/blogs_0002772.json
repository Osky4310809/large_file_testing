The Justice Department says he had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors last year, including two with Russia’s Sergey Kislyak, in his capacity as a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Trump’s Attorney General under pressure to resign over Russia ties \nBut he failed to mention this contact in his confirmation hearing in January when asked what he would do if “anyone affiliated” with the Trump campaign had been in contact with the Russian government, and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said this amounted to “lying under oath” . \nJustice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores insisted on Wednesday night that “there was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer”. Some Democrats have said the omission is grounds enough for Sessions to be relieved of his post, while Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Mr Sessions “must” now recuse himself of any role investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia. \nThe Washington Post’s report was followed up by one in the Wall Street Journal , quoting sources as saying US investigators have already started examining contacts between Mr Sessions and Russian officials during the presidential campaign. \nWhether that inquiry was still going on, and what its findings were, wasn’t clear, the sources said.

Triple whammy! — John Cassidy (@JohnCassidy) March 2, 2017 \nMr Trump has denied having any knowledge that aides were in touch with Russian intelligence agents during the election, and such denials prompted Obama-era officials to rush to preserve any evidence to the contrary , according to the Times . \nOn Tuesday, White House lawyers instructed the president's aides to preserve any materials that could be connected to Russian interference in the election, three administration officials told the Associated Press. \nThe Senate intelligence committee, which is investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election, has also asked more than a dozen organisations, agencies and individuals to preserve relevant records.
