That's what counts.\" \nCompeting in his first event of the season, Manyonga produced a stellar leap of 8.46m, the furthest jump in the world this year, to miss Khotso Mokoena's South African record by two centimetres. \nIn the men's 110m hurdles race, De Vries charged to victory, setting a national record of 13.23 seconds to better the previous mark of 13.24 which was held by Lehann Fourie, thus improving his own personal best by 0.36. \n\"I just wanted to finish the race and go through the motions to get ready for SA champs,\" said a stunned De Vries, whose performance is still to be ratified. \n\"This is a qualifying time for world champs (in London in August), so I have to go there and give my best and see what happens.\" \nASA President Aleck Skhosana explained issues around the Men's 100m event: \"The transponder in the starting device did not react at the start. It's a new system and we will have to find out from the (private) company what caused it.\" \nAccording to Skhosana there is no reason at this stage to question the rest of the results. \n\"In the other races, we can't discredit the athletes until we know whether there was an issue with the times,\" said Skhosana. \nIn one of the greatest moments for an athlete, at the start of the Meeting, Van Niekerk received a golden plaque from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), in recognition of his world record performance at last year's Rio Olympics. \nThe plaque was handed to him by Skhosana in a significant ceremony on the track for which the athlete received an ovation from the crowds. \n\"We are tremendously proud of Wayde for all he has achieved, and it is great to have him here receiving the award and also competing in front of his home crowd,\" Skhosana said. \nThe third of four legs in the ASA Speed Series will be held in Potchefstroom on Wednesday, March 15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T15:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T08:25:04.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
