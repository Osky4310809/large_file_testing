Steve Beshear giving the rebuttal to the president’s speech? The supping folks behind him at the diner looked more like hostages than stage props, let alone ordinary citizens going about their night.\nAnd how is it that Beshear became the voice of a party in disarray? Perhaps that question answers itself. No offense to the former governor, but he’s 72 and out of office. This, for a rebuttal that often goes to an up-and-comer on the party’s bench.\nYes, Beshear’s message on ObamaCare is well-delivered. But “don’t go get rid of health care” is a generic, and far from aspirational, central message. Not to mention the defense of ObamaCare only reinforces the impression that the party’s focused on the past.\nSetting Beshear at a diner was also a transparent attempt at appealing to the “real Americans” the Democrats seemed to take for granted in recent cycles. But it was so hamhanded — and, in the event, downright creepy — as to demonstrate, rather than remedy, the party’s sins.\nRemember, it’s not just about losing in November. Since Barack Obama was sworn in as president in 2009, Democrats have lost 1,030 down-ballot races for seats in the US House, Senate, governors’ offices and state legislatures.\nFor a party that insists this White House is in chaos, Democrats need to look within before casting stones.\nYet the evening proved that Democrats in Washington don’t know who they are, don’t know what their mission is, don’t have any aspirational message that can take voters out of the past toward the future.\nThey remain as fractured as many suspected — perhaps more extensively than most observers realized.\nTrump, meanwhile, used his speech to reinforce the fact that while Democrats were speaking to these voters in the hopes of one day again speaking for them, the fact that he was standing there at the podium was proof that in November, the people had been speaking through him. Unlike Democrats, Trump didn’t need gimmicks.\n“In 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet,” the president said. “The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds — families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.\n“But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus — as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.”\nAnnie, a 39-year-old Western Pennsylvania Democrat who pulled the lever “sometimes reluctantly” (her words) for every Democrat on the ballot last November, now says that if her party wants to do something and reach people, it needs to start in small towns — and not just for photo ops.\n“Start working to get people at all levels elected who share your values — not the national Democrats’ [values], because they don’t know what their values are outside of opposition,” Annie said. “I’m fatigued and exhausted and bored with my party’s reaction, and it’s only been four weeks.”\n“Don’t just place someone in a diner and say ‘no’ to dismantling ObamaCare, and be satisfied that that is our message to voters,” she added. “The truth is there are hardworking, resilient people in this country that are suffering, and they aren’t learning anything from the behavior of our so-called leaders.”\nResistance movements tend to have short lifespans. Initially, they create anxiety and doubt among their targets, but unless they can expand interest in their cause, they lose steam.\nAnnie says she doesn’t think Democratic Party leaders “truly understand the visual contrast they created on Tuesday, because they are viewing it from a bubble, and they seem to forget that Democrat voters, who want to be supportive, live outside the bubble.”\nFor now, anyway.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:49:52.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
