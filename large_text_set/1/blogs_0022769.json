Tunisia - home \nVery Switzerland away in Pro Evo 4. And not in a good way. 27. Ivory Coast - away \nNot much to see here. Next. 26. Egypt - away \nPlain as plain can be. Quite possibly signed off on a sunny Friday afternoon when everyone at Adidas Towers wanted to get down the pub for Callum from marketing's leaving do. 25. Tunisia - away (Photo: AFP) \nThis one isn't winning any awards either. Strong number font helps drag up this uninspiring effort. 24. Senegal - home (Photo: AFP) \nIn the 2003 Britpop documentary Live Forever, Liam Gallagher was asked who his hero growing up was . \"The Incredible Hulk\", he replied. Why, asked the filmakers. \"I just liked his green-ness,\" the Oasis frontman sneered back. \nBeing green isn't enough to save this kit from being far too dull, despite the sneaky-good socks. 23. Gabon - home (Photo: AFP) \nI don't reckon it took the Adidas design department long to dream this one up either. Nothing offensive about this Sweden-Ukraine identikit number, but this doesn't exactly get the pulse racing. 22. Egypt - home \nAnother functional design from Adidas here. They've not got in the spirit. 21. Morocco - away (Photo: AFP) \nA tad busy on the top half, with the red armbands and green strip clashing with the Adidas stripes. Not a classic. 20. Algeria - home \nNot sure the v-neck goes with the coloured rectangle. Too many angles. Nice shorts, mind. 19. Burkina Faso - away (Photo: AFP) \nStraight out of turn-of-the-millennium Serie A. Made a mockery out of those who said you couldn't get 12 Kappa logos on a single pair of shorts. 18. Algeria - away (Photo: AFP) \nUnfussy, with the diagonal red line saving it from being boringly unfussy. But still a middle-of-the-pack effort. 17. Morocco - home (Photo: AFP) \nThe Atlas Lions (a moniker which will feature highly in our international nickname power rankings) have the benefit of a maroon and green colour scheme which works well and they've not upset to applecart too much here, correctly opting for a darker shade. 16. Zimbabwe - home (Photo: AFP) \nAnother kit where the socks are the best bit. The sweat-patch effect on the torso doesn't help, but the red piping works. 15. Uganda - away (Photo: AFP) \nA very good use of retro striping from the Cranes. A bit rough around the edges, but its distinctiveness makes up for it. 14. Zimbabwe - away (Photo: AFP) \nSuffers from the same sweat-patch problem the home kit does, but the strong collar game pulls it up a few places. 13. Guinea-Bissau - away (Photo: AFP) \nWhat started life as a Portugal home kit imitation has been clawed at to give a green shredded effect, which is a new one on me. Kudos. 12. Togo - away (Photo: AFP) \nSimple, but in a good way. Macron have come a long way since the 2004-05 Leeds United home kit. Pleasing shade of red and the higher-than-usual badges work well. 11. DR Congo - away (Photo: AFP) \nPlenty to like here. The blue stripe and the shirt is pleasingly thin and the shorts are good, too. Bonus point for getting the flag on there, as it's a good 'un. 10. Cameroon - home (Photo: AFP) \nThe 2002 sleeveless effort was the Kid A of international kits and while the Indomitable Lions have eschewed the innovative spirit of old, they're still left with a very easy on the eye kit. Nice detail on the collar. 9. Uganda - home (Photo: AFP) \nHard to look at without being reminded of 1980s Belgium teams, but that's not a bad thing. We're not used to seeing Uganda strut their stuff in global tournaments, but with kits like this, they can come again. 8. Guinea-Bissau - home (Photo: AFP) \nThe AFCON newbies have doubled down on their torn-to-sheds style home kit and it's paid off handsomly. 7. Togo - home (Photo: AFP) \nAnother strong effort from the Sparrow Hawks. No one's tried too hard to impress here, and it's resulted in a clean, simple and distinctive kit. 6. Mali - away \nNot seen such a strong Eagle game since Randall Cunningham was turning heads in Philadelphia 25 years ago. 5. Mali - home (Photo: AFP) \nThis is a team that are proud of their national symbol and aren't afraid to show it. Put French manufactures Airness on your one to watch list. 4. Senegal - away (Photo: AFP) \nHere we go, the tournament's big divisive number. You either love the multicoloured lion (of Teranga, presumably) that is roaring onto the Senegal shirt, or you hate it. \nWe'll take all of that you've got, thank you very much. 3. Ghana - home (Photo: AFP) (Photo: AFP) \nGhana have always had cool kits and this current vintage is of no exception. The black star takes pride of place and the triangular piping around the collar and sleeves is on point. \nAnd when the likes of Asamoah Gyan and pals turn around we get treated to a glorious name-number colour combo. Woof. 2. Ivory Coast - home (Photo: AFP) (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nIvory Coast's orange and green stylings always work well and Puma have absolutely nailed this one. This number has a distinct retro feel, giving off a 1970s NASL vibe. \nThe tusks below the names on the back is the icing on a very tasty cake. It's that attention to detail that puts the Elephants in the running for the title. 1. DR Congo - home (Photo: AFP) \nThis just works. The three colours of DR Congo flag are all present and correct and put together expertly without clashing in a distinctive kit that is not like any other. With strong socks and shorts it's the complete package. poll loading Which is the best kit at AFCON? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T13:49:54.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
