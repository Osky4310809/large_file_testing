An opposition supporter holds up a rubber duck at a rally in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Sunday. Valya Egorshin / Zuma Press \nThe protests follow allegations against Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev that stem from a high-profile expose published earlier this month by opposition leader Alexei Navalny. \nHis report alleged that one of Medvedev's estates features a duck house built in the middle of a pond. \nIt also painted the prime minister as a compulsive online shopper, ordering 73 T-shirts and 20 pairs of sneakers in just three months. \nThe demonstrators noted this alleged opulence by carrying ducks and sneakers during Sunday's marches. \nSome also painted their faces green in solidarity with Navalny, after unidentified attackers threw green antiseptic at him last week. The substance takes days to wash off and Navalny has been sporting a green face for some time. \nBut what will all this mean for Putin's government, an administration opponents accuse of being anti-democratic kleptocracy built on corruption and the silencing of dissenters? Here are seven key questions answered. 1. First of all, what happened? \nDemonstrators gathered in dozens of cities to protest against alleged corruption by Medvedev, who was once president of Russia and remains a close ally of Putin. \nThe liberal radio station Echo of Moscow estimated that 60,000 turned out across the country, with 10,000 apiece in Moscow and St. Petersburg alone. The bulk of the attendees were teens and people aged in their early 20s. \nAuthorities said the rallies were not authorized in many cities, including Moscow. The protesters, citing their constitutional rights and led by Navalny, marched anyway. \nRiot police intervened in several cities, most notably in Moscow, where witnesses and media crews documented a brutal crackdown on what was largely a peaceful protest.

What is Medvedev accused of doing? \nNavalny's report alleged the Russian prime minister controls vast estates in Russia, as well as other assets including two yachts and vineyards in the Italian region of Tuscany. \nNavalny claimed the assets were gifts from Russian oligarchs provided through charities established to funnel them to Medvedev. \nMedvedev's spokesperson has denied all allegations and there has been no criminal investigation. \nOn the day of the protests, Medvedev wrote on Instagram that he \"did some skiing\" in an undisclosed location. \nMeanwhile, most Russian households continue to be hit by the country's worst recession in two decades. 3. So who is Alexei Navalny? \nThe 40-year-old has been Russia's most successful opposition politician of the past decade. \nIn a country accused of industrial levels of corruption among officials, Navalny has made a name for himself with a series of scathing investigations. \nHe is currently mounting a bid for the presidential elections in March 2018, though the government insists he is not allowed to run because he has been found guilty in several criminal cases, including embezzlement.

Tatyana Makeyeva / Reuters \nNavalny says these charges have been fabricated to deny him a slot on the ballot. \nIn 2013, after one of the embezzlement charges was brought, the White House said it was \"deeply disappointed and concerned\" by the \"politically motivated\" ruling. \n\"Navalny's harsh prison sentence is the latest example of a disturbing trend aimed at suppressing dissent in civil society in Russia,\" then-White House spokesman Jay Carney told a news briefing. 4. Haven't the Russians protested before? \nSunday was the largest demonstration in Russia in at least four years. \nHundreds of thousands of people took to the streets between 2011 and 2013 in protest at Putin's decision to run for a third term, as well as his victory that was plagued by allegations of fraud. \nThe Kremlin responded to these demonstrations by cracking down on opposition leaders and activists, dozens of whom were jailed. \nOne rally in May 2012 ended in massive clashes with police in Moscow, though fewer people were detained then than on Sunday. 5. Does this mean Russians are angry with Putin? \nPolls say Russians have been enthusiastic about their president ever since he annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, a move condemned by the U.S. and its allies. \nBut pollsters have long complained that many people refuse to speak to them — which means no one, not even the Kremlin, knows what many Russians really think about the government. Protesters gather in St. Petersburg on Sunday. Dmitri Lovetsky / AP \nRussia certainly has a host of problems, including an economic downturn prompted in part by sanctions leveled after Crimea and the fall in global oil prices. \nThis has been keenly felt among the country's younger generation, Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist at Moscow's RANEPA academy, told NBC News on Monday. \n\"Russia is universally seen as a country of poor people, but what matters is not so much income level as the dynamics,\" she said. \nBefore the latest downturn, she added, \"people's disposable real incomes have been steadily growing for the last 15 years. We're not used to getting poorer when we were yesterday.\" \nSchulmann said that \"the web-savvy young are especially worried about the absence of career prospects and opportunities of social and political self-expression.\" 6. What is the Kremlin's next move? \nThe Russian government usually issues harsh dismissals of any political demands, but Sunday was different. \nPresidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn't write off the protesters' claims, instead saying Monday that \"the slogans, the proposals and criticism voiced will be taken into account.\" Play", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:23:04.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
