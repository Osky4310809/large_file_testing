Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester City's fifth goal in their enthralling 5-3 win over Monaco cost one unlucky punter more than £28,000. \nCity came from behind twice against the Ligue 1 leaders to earn a first-leg win in the last 16 of the Champions League. \nHowever, while most revellers were basking in the drama of the eight-goal thriller, one football fan was left feeling decidedly more glum after the match. \nThat's because they were due to scoop almost €34,200 (£28,900) after predicting City to win 4-3 and Atletico Madrid to win 4-2 away to Bayer Leverkusen. \nWith 10 minutes to go of both matches the bet was firmly on, with City leading 4-3 and Atleti winning 3-2 in Leverkusen.

He wrote: \"I read about it in the newspapers... sorry for that poor guy.\" \nHe wasn't that sorry though, as he accompanied the tweet with a laughing emoji.
