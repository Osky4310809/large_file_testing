Nothing against color tattoos ( we love color tattoos, too !), but there’s something especially stunning about black tattoos. And they go with everything! But these tattoos are *completely* black, and they’re seriously blowing our minds.\nCreated by tattoo artist @slumdog.tattooer, aka Slumdog, these black tattoos are truly like nothing we’ve ever seen before. They mostly create nature-inspired tattoos, like twists on traditional rose tattoos, and traditional tattoos of gorgeous pinups , but with a gothic spin.\nIf artsy, goth vibes are what you’re going for, these black tattoos are about to be your new favorite thing.

A photo posted by |SLUMDOG| (@slumdog.tattooer) on Jan 17, 2017 at 7:24am PST \nWe probably wouldn’t recommend one of these for your first tattoo, but seasoned tattoo-lovers may be ready to take on of these on.

A photo posted by |SLUMDOG| (@slumdog.tattooer) on Jan 12, 2017 at 12:54pm PST \nWhat makes these different from blackwork tattoos is the amount of ink used. They’re seriously filled in. A photo posted by |SLUMDOG| (@slumdog.tattooer) on Jan 16, 2017 at 12:19pm PST \nMuch of Slumdog’s designs are stunning, retro ladies. We dig it! A photo posted by |SLUMDOG| (@slumdog.tattooer) on Jan 13, 2017 at 9:02am PST \nRoses are also a popular design. We’re loving this twist on the traditional rose tattoo.

We’re definitely considering it!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:27:28.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
