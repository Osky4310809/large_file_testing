Xiaomi’s MIUI remains one of our favourite Android-based ROMs, offering a smooth, stable experience. The thing with MIUI is, that it’s quite simple to use (it even offers a Lite mode for newbies), yet comes loaded with a barrage of features power users would appreciate. Apart from a high degree of customisability (which includes extensive support for downloadable themes, tweaking the status bar, button behaviour etc), it offers useful features such as long screenshots, dual apps and second space. While Xiaomi was one of the first to bring these features into the mainstream, these are are now available on a few other smartphones as well. However, Xiaomi has implemented them quite well, and as we mentioned earlier, the overall user experience is smooth. Performance \nThe Redmi Note 4 utilises a processor which has fast become a 91mobiles favourite. The octa-core Snapdragon 625 inside the phone is a solid blend of grunt and power efficiency, and has been very consistent across all phones we’ve experienced it on. Right from the Asus ZenFone 3 ( review ), to the Moto Z Play ( review ), and even the Lenovo P2 more recently, the Snapdragon 625 chip has proven its capabilities in terms of performance, battery life and keeping the heat in check. The Redmi Note 4 does nothing to shake that belief, and comes across as a smooth performer – whether it’s day-to-day tasks, intensive games, or media consumption. Thanks to 4 gigs of RAM on our review unit, multitasking was a breeze too. And out of the ample 64GB storage, about 54GB is available for your own use. That should suffice for most, though one always has to the option to use the hybrid SIM slot to pop in a microSD card if required. Worth mentioning that the device also comes in two other variants – the base model offers 2GB RAM and 32GB storage, and there’s another option that offers 3GB RAM and 32GB storage. Note that there’s no 16GB model this time around, so that’s another plus point. Battery life \nThe Redmi Note 4 packs a sealed 4,100mAh battery (marginally more powerful than its predecessor), and thanks to the power-efficient Snapdragon 625, kills it in terms of the battery life. In our usage, we were able to eke out a full day’s use comfortably, even with heavy usage. The handset lasted for a good 17 hours in our video loop drain test, which indicates how good its battery life is. Verdict \nAt the end, it all boils down to this. The Coolpad Cool1 Dual ( first impressions ) is a worthy rival to the Redmi Note 4, and entices because of its dual cameras and overall image quality. However, it suffers from software issues. The Lenovo K6 Note also falls in the same price bracket, but comes with a less powerful Snapdragon 430 processor. The Moto G4 Plus ( review ) does offer better image quality, but offers a dated CPU and suffers from a few heating issues. The new Lenovo P2 ( review ) is unbeatable in terms of battery life, but is priced a tad higher and we’re not big fans of its shooting prowess. With its recent price drop , the Lenovo Z2 Plus ( review ) has become an attractive option too, especially considering it comes powered by a high-end Snapdragon 820 chip. However, it has its share of issues as well, such as a plain Jane design, so-so cameras and average battery life. In sum, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 does could do with a little bit of TLC in the camera department, but that niggle apart, comes across as very well-rounded, balanced (not to mention affordable) package… one you can buy without worry. So does Xiaomi have another blockbuster on its hands? We think so.
