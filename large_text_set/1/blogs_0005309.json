I don’t feel the same. We will use the opportunity. If we need to blame someone, we need to blame ourselves. \n“We are the guilty ones that we did not achieve the Premier League [title] last season for different reasons. It is true in our head it is to win and to get three points and close the gap — but not revenge for last season.” \nThe Argentinian instead wants his players to reproduce the blistering form that saw them demolish Chelsea 5-3 at White Hart Lane two years ago this week. \nHe added: “Two years ago, the team started to show what we really wanted to introduce and settle on.

But, like a professional, the most important thing is to get three points. \n“We need to, because we want to fight for the top four or to win the league this season and so to reduce the gap is key for us.” \nSpurs go into the contest on the back of five Premier League wins from their last six. \nThey have won only four of 49 league matches against Chelsea – drawing 19 – but all four of those victories have been at the Lane.

But you know that it is always tough to play at White Hart Lane and we will arrive in very good condition to challenge them. \n“If we review the game in November we deserved more at Stamford Bridge – the way that we played, we dominated the game. We created more chances than them, but you always need to be more clinical. \n\"We are now in that moment in the last few games that we scored a lot of goals. \n“When you play a big team like Chelsea you need to be clinical when you create chances. \n\"It will be a great game. \n\"We are excited.” What's your prediction for this one? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:52:12.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
