You have to inform yourselves, look at the evidence and tell the truth. We got together at half-time against Las Palmas, what we talked about did not leave there and I am glad of that,\" he explained to reporters. \n\"The other day I did not say Cristiano does not have to run, we all run here. We are all equals and the key is in our competitiveness. \n\"That was shown today with players who are not always in the first team and they are hungry, they press and they run. \n\"I will not reveal what was said, but it does annoy us. [Luka] Modric usually talks and the other he didn't, and right away it is said he gave Isco and [Alvaro] Morata an earful. Go and look for the informant. I understand you have to sell newspapers but credibility should come before everything.\" \nCrazy Alexis call backfires on Arsenal \nSaturday's victory was achieved without Ronaldo nor Bale, with the latter suspended following a red card midweek against Las Palmas. \nBut Ramos underlined that there was plenty of depth in the Madrid squad to ride out those absences. \n\"Everyone has their own tastes, some like Maradona and others Messi, football has a lot of players to choose from,\" he added. \nMadrid currently lie second in La Liga, one point behind Barcelona with a game in hand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T03:43:15.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
