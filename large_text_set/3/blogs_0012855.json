Those were the days weren't they? \n\"The problem is when we bail you for those offences you have to stick to the conditions.\" \nT he jovial tone of the message continued, with the force saying: \"You only have a couple of options now. You either pay a little visit to a police station, or you give us a call on 101 and we come and pick you up. \n\"It would save us all a lot of time and we would be really happy to see your face walking through our doors. \n\"We're a friendly bunch and just want to keep local people safe. I'm sure our followers will back us up on that.\" \nPeople who commented on the status thought it was a great way of trying to catch criminals. Jack Wilson is wanted for breach of bail after being arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation and criminal damage.
