Related ‘Baywatch’ Stars: Then and Now (Photos) \nIn the film, Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson), a forthright veteran lifeguard, goes head-to-head with a rash recruit named Matt Brody (Zac Efron). When the two discover that a criminal plot is in the works that is threatening their beach, they are forced to put aside their differences. \nIn the Super Bowl spot, they get into gear… very revealing gear, that is. When Efron tears off his pants to unleash an American flag-themed bathing suit, Johnson asks him, “What are you wearing?” Efron quickly answers, “Freedom.” \nThe film also stars Priyanka Chopra , who plays the lead antagonist of the film, along with Kelly Rohrbach playing C.J. Parker, the role Pamela Anderson played in the original television series. \nThe original “Baywatch” show premiered on NBC in 1989, but was canceled after only one season. Star David Hasselhoff and creators and executive producers Michael Berk, Douglas Schwartz, and Greg Bonann felt the show had potential, and revived it for the first-run syndication market in 1991, through which it garnered large success, especially internationally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:42:13.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
