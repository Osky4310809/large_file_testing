Nerfs to two of the game's most notorious cards, Spirit Claws and Small-Time Buccaneer, have been confirmed, and the Ranked Play ladder is also being changed with the introduction of 'Floors', which will prevent players from dropping ranks after hitting certain milestones. \nThe nerfs first: Spirit Claws will have its Mana cost increased to 2, up from 1 . In my eyes, it's a welcome change and will help to reduce Shaman's early-game board control power without completely ruining the card. With Spellpower on the board, it's still better than a Fiery War Axe, but at least now you can't play Spirit Claws on turn 1 and Hero Power for that 25% chance at a Wrath of Air totem on turn 2 as your opponent fills to the brim with salt. \nAs for the those pesky Pirates, Small-Time Buccaneer will have its health decreased to 1, down from 2. This is a massive nerf, as it opens up the minion to a wide new range of answers. Shaman's Maelstrom Portal or Warlock's Mortal Coil can now quickly trade with it and come out ahead, but more importantly Mage's hero power can now simply ping it off. This prevents pirate decks from being able to play Buccaneer on turn 1 against Mages without it being immediately killed, and leaves me wondering if it could end up being cut from aggro lists altogether. Meta problems \nWonder why the Hearthstone meta always gets so stale, or what Blizzard could do to break the pattern? Our expert has some thoughts on how Blizzard could take a more active approach to balance . \nBlizzard has been keeping an eye on pirate decks since early January", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:16:40.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
