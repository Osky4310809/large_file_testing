Saul did not trust in God. \nSaul looked like royalty: tall, handsome, noble. He became king when he was 30 years old and reigned over Israel 42 years. Early in his career, he made a fatal mistake. He disobeyed God by failing to completely destroy the Amalekites and all their possessions, as God had commanded. The LORD withdrew his favor from Saul and had Samuel the prophet anoint David as king. \nSome time later, David killed the giant Goliath . As the Jewish women were dancing in a victory parade, they sang: \n\"Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.\" ( 1 Samuel 18:7, NIV ) \nBecause the people made more of David's single victory than all of Saul's, the king went into a rage and became jealous of David. From that moment he plotted to kill him. \nInstead of building up Israel, King Saul wasted most of his time chasing David through the hills. David, however, respected God's anointed king and despite several opportunities, refused to harm Saul. \nFinally, the Philistines gathered for a huge battle against the Israelites. By that time Samuel had died. King Saul was desperate, so he consulted a medium and told her to raise Samuel's spirit from the dead. Whatever appeared--a demon disguised as Samuel or Samuel's true spirit sent by God--it predicted disaster for Saul. \nIn the battle, King Saul and the army of Israel were overrun. Saul committed suicide . His sons were killed by the enemy. King Saul's Accomplishments \nSaul was chosen by God himself to be the first king of Israel. Saul defeated many of the enemies of his country, including the Ammonites, Philistines, Moabites, and Amalekites. He united the scattered tribes, giving them greater strength. He reigned for 42 years. King Saul's Strengths \nSaul was courageous in battle. He was a generous king. Early in his reign he was admired and respected by the people. King Saul's Weaknesses \nSaul could be impulsive, acting unwisely. His jealousy of David drove him to madness and a thirst for revenge. More than once, King Saul disobeyed God's instructions, thinking he knew better. Life Lessons \nGod wants us to depend on him . When we do not and depend instead on our own strength and wisdom, we open ourselves to disaster. God also wants us to go to him for our sense of worth. Saul's jealousy of David blinded Saul to what God had already given him. Life with God has direction and purpose. Life without God is meaningless. Hometown \nThe land of Benjamin, north and east of the Dead Sea, in Israel. Referenced in the Bible \nSaul's story can be found in 1 Samuel 9-31 and in Acts 13:21.
