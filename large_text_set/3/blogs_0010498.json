Parsons will be out indefinitely as the team fully evaluates the appropriate course of action. \n“To suffer a setback like this after working so diligently to rebound from the injury to his right knee is obviously tough. That said, we know he will continue to work tirelessly to return to the court with his teammates and contribute,” General Manager Chris Wallace said. “Chandler has the full support of myself, Coach Fizz and the entire team and we are all focused on getting him healthy.” \nFurther updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
