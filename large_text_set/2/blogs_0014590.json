Prior to the skills challenge DNCE, Joe Jonas’ new band, played. It was a little bit lackluster on TV, but the crowd seemed to really enjoy it, particularly one special guest.\nOh hell yeah, our man Guy Fieri loves DNCE and he is HERE for All Star Weekend. \nMore like Diners, Drive-Ins and Dunks amirite? (I can’t take credit for that, my co-worker Eric came up with it.)\nThis GIF is like your dad after 2 and a half beers at the local 4th of July amphitheater concert.\nRock on Guy. Enjoy your weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:36:14.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
