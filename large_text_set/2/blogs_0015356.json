By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 20, 2017 4:58 PM IPL Auction 2017: Former Indian opener Virender Sehwag and appointed him as the Head of Cricket Operations and Brand Ambassador of Kings XI Punjab. (Source: PTI) \nIPL Auction 2017: Kings XI Punjab had a drastic season last year as the team managed to win just 4 out of their 10 matches and finished at the bottom of the table for the second consecutive season. The most disappointing part for the team was the failure to find a genuine leader and in the 9th season South Africa’s David Miller and India’s Murali Vijay shared the duties. With a hope to change their fortunes, the owners roped in former opener Virender Sehwag and appointed him as the Head of Cricket Operations and Brand Ambassador of the team. \nFast forward to the evening of 20th February, we are done with the Player Auction for the 2017 IPL season and hardly anything has changed with Punjab. Going into the auction with biggest purse, Punjab had the chance to rope in some big names and emerge as a powerhouse but they purchased 8 players and finished the day with Rs. 13.9 Crore, in their pocket. The explanation Sehwag had for this was the team didn’t want to invest in players and make them warm the bench. \nYou may also want to watch: \nHowever, when you look at the current squad, there are so many loopholes that even an average player might end up playing the game by the end of the season. While other teams like RCB (Chris Gayle, Shane Watson and AB De Villiers) and RPSG (Steven Smith, Faf Du Plessis and Ben Stokes) have at least 3 guaranteed overseas starters, even a star like Glenn Maxwell wasn’t able to keep his place in the Punjab side last year. \nWhen analysis the players Punjab bought today, you’ll get more disappointment. Except Eoin Morgan and Varun Aaron none of their signings make too much of sense. With David Miller, Glenn Maxwell, Shaun Marsh, Marcus Stoinis and Hashim Amla already in the squad, there is no chance that Martin Guptill will get a chance to play unless there are more than one injuries. \nDarren Sammy was bought for Rs. 30 lakhs but he is a player who would fail to make it to his national side without captaincy. So, the right strategy should have been to buy a couple of good Indian players to for with Eoin Morgan and probably someone like Corey Anderson or Ben Stokes but maybe Sehwag has other plans of using that money or its the demonetisation effect. \nYou may also want to watch: \nPlayers Bought: Eoin Morgan (2 Cr), Rahul Tewatia (25 Lakhs), T Natarajan (3 Cr), Matt Henry (50 Lakhs), Varun Aaron (2.80 Cr), Martin Guptill (50 Lakh), Darren Sammy (30 Lakh), Rinku Singh (10 Lakh) \nPlayers Retained: David Miller, Manan Vohra, Axar Patel, Glenn Maxwell, Gurkeerat Singh, Anureet Singh, Sandeep Sharma, Shardul Thakur, Shaun Marsh, Wriddhiman Saha, M Vijay, Nikhil Naik, Mohit Sharma, Marcus Stoinis, KC Cariappa, Armaan Jaffer, Pardeep Sahu, Swapnil Singh, Hashim Amla.
