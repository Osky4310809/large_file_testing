As a former national security specialist at the Department of Defense and a current member of the House Armed Services Committee, I can tell you the last place partisan politics belongs is in national security. It is reasonable and commonplace for presidents to decide who attends security meetings, but I strongly believe the Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should have a standing invitation to attend all Principals Committee meetings given their importance to national security and expertise. My bill will help depoliticize national security so that we never jeopardize the safety and security of the American people.\" \nWatch the congresswoman try to rally support for the bill (below)! \nYasss! \nRelated: Trump Really Just Changed The Name Of Black History Month \nSo far, she has more than 60 cosponsors: \nToday I introduced a bill that will instruct @POTUS to keep partisan politics out of Natl Sec & off the NSC.

Speaking of Bannon, you may have seen the following message copied and pasted all over your newsfeed: \"The Senate Committee on Homeland Security is taking calls about Bannon's appointment to the NSC. You can call 202-224-4751.\" Yeah, we'll just leave that there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:47:40.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
