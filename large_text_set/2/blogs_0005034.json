Bringin’ the speed that you can’t stop. @Migos @juliojones_11 #IWILL pic.twitter.com/QOz9HSlRVN \n— Under Armour (@UnderArmour) February 4, 2017 The city of Atlanta is ready for the Super Bowl. They’re so ready that Atlanta’s mayor is keeping bars open even later for people to celebrate. If only all of Atlanta could be in Houston to watch the Falcons play against the Patriots. \nNow thanks to Julio Jones, that can happen (sort of). His Super Bowl cleats embody everything about Atlanta, including himself. You have Georgia peaches, a Peachtree Street sign, and even Waffle House snuck into there. \nThe design is actually Migos’ latest album cover. And while Migos probably won’t be performing at halftime , now they’ll be on the field during the game. \nWhat’s your favorite Atlanta detail about these cleats?
