It's a f***ing wedding band! You can argue with me but still.\" \nAdele and Simon, who share four-year-old son Angelo together, have been together for over five years and got engaged in October last year. But who is he? Let's find out... Who is Adele's husband Simon Konecki? \nSimon is the 43-year-old CEO of drop4drop, the charity that helps supply clean water to developing countries. He's also the brains behind Life water, which donates to his charity. He was previously a investment banker but left because he felt sickened by the gap between rich and poor people. \nHe was previously married to fashion stylist Clary Fisher and had a daughter with her in 2007. They later separated and divorced. When did Adele and Simon start dating?

It's thought the couple were brought together by their shared passion for charity work. \nThere were reports at the time they started dating that Simon was still married when he met Adele, but the singer later confirmed in her blog that he'd been divorced for four years by the time they started a relationship. Who is Adele's son? They posed for pictures together in December 2013, 14 months after the birth of Angelo \nLittle Angelo James Konecki was born on October 19 2012, just eight months after Adele and Simon were reported to be a couple. Adele later opened up about having post-natal depression, saying she was \"obsessed\" with her baby and felt like an inadequate mother to him. She went on to reveal that her solution was to have one afternoon a week completely to herself, as that helped her feel more grounded. \nIn her acceptance speech at the 2017 Grammy Awards, after winning a gong for Best Album, Adele admitted having a child had made her forget a part of herself. \n\"Five years ago when I was last here, I was pregnant and I didn't know. I found out shortly after, and it was the biggest blessing of my life. \n\"And in my pregnancy and through becoming a mother I lost a lot of myself. And I've struggled – I still do struggle being a mum, it's really hard. But tonight winning this kind of feels full circle and like I've come back to myself.\" Is Adele married? \nThere was speculation towards the end of 2016 that Simon and Adele had tied the knot, but neither of them publicly confirmed the news despite numerous reports. However, at the Grammy Awards in February 2017, Adele gave the game away by thanking Simon in her acceptance speech. \n\"The Academy I love you, my manager, my husband, my son – you're the only reason I do it. Thank you so much to everybody,\" she said.
