Zlatan Ibrahimovic played the France international into the area with a clever flick, but his well-struck left-footed shot was blocked to safety by Eldin Jakupovic. \nJuan Mata spurned the best chance of the second half for the hosts, as the Spaniard's close-range half-volley from a headed Chris Smalling pass was denied by Jakupovic and cleared away. With full-time approaching, new Hull arrival Lazar Markovic found himself wide open in front of the United goal, but his shot hit a post and bounced away from danger and the match ended goalless. \nThe draw leaves Mourinho and United 14 points behind league leaders Chelsea and four points adrift of Liverpool in the final Champions League place. Three first-half goals from Man City saw them get back to winning ways in the Premier League with a 4-0 win over West Ham. \nManchester City handed down another thrashing to West Ham United at the London Stadium, running away 4-0 winners just weeks after winning 5-0 in East London in the FA Cup. \nCity handed a full debut to Gabriel Jesus he was involved as City took the lead after just 17 minutes, setting up Kevin De Bruyne to fire home a fine, arrowed shot from the edge of the box. \nIt was 2-0 just four minutes later as De Bruyne fed Leroy Sane on the left, who shrugged off a poor attempted challenge from debutant Jose Fonte to squeeze a pass through to David Silva to tap home. \nThe first-half rout continued in the 39th minute and it was all too easy for City as Raheem Sterling squared for the unmarked Gabriel Jesus to sidefoot past Darren Randolph. \nCity were awarded a penalty in the 66th minute when Sterling was felled by James Tomkins and Yaya Toure put the icing on the cake as they moved level on points with fourth-placed Liverpool. Peter Crouch scored his 100th Premier League goal as Stoke City and Everton played to a draw at bet365 Stadium. \nStoke City and Everton drew 1-1 at the bet365 Stadium in Wednesday's other Premier League fixture. \nPeter Crouch put the home side in front after just seven minutes, and in the process became the oldest player to reach 100 goals in the Premier League era. \nBut Everton took a point back to Merseyside after Ryan Shawcross scored an own goal six minutes before half-time. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:08:19.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
