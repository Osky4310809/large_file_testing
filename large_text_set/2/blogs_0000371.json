On the contrary, the tone was constructive.\" CNN claimed that the AP 's version of the call came from \"an official internal readout,\" rather than a word-for-word transcript. Instead, CNN reported, Trump actually said, \" You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with. We are willing to help with that big-league, but they have be knocked out and you have not done a good job knocking them out.\" Though Trump’s conversation with the Mexican president may have gone better than expected—at least according to the governments involved—his phone call with the Australian Prime Minister much rockier, according to senior U.S. officials briefed on the Saturday call. Trump reportedly told Malcolm Turnbull that an already-agreed-on US-Australia refugee resettlement agreement was “the worst deal ever,” and claimed Australia was looking to export the “next Boston bombers.” Officials told the Washington Post the president also bragged about his electoral college win before abruptly ending the call about a half hour early. Turnbull has neither confirmed nor denied the reports. “I'm not going to comment on a conversation between myself and the President of the United States other than what we have said publicly,\" he said during a press conference Thursday . “You can surely understand the reasons for that. I appreciate your interest, but it's better that these things—these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them.” Late Wednesday night, Trump tweeted about the refugee resettlement deal, calling it \"dumb\" and saying he would \"study\" it. He also referred to the refugees as \"illegal immigrants.\" Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! — Donald J.
