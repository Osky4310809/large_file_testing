It has made it easier for many of us to meet new people, and brought dating out in the open. For those of us who aren't looking for a relationship but want some sexy time, online dating apps have created ample opportunity. They have also helped in making sex less of a taboo. But, like anything else, the world of online dating isn't all violins and roses. While we're in favour of it, there are plenty of horror stories out there. So, we thought we'd bring some to you, just to show you the not-so-pretty side of trying to find love (or lust) on the Internet. The one who just wanted a job... Anonymous, 26 You know, apparently this happens a lot. People actually look for jobs on dating apps, man. So, in my bio, it says where I work, of course, which is at a digital magazine. This guy I matched with started off by telling me how cool he thought it was that I was a writer. Told me how he follows our work, and all that. He was also a writer, but scripts. Anyway, we met a couple of times, hooked up once, and I thought he was into me. He had been complaining about his job, so I offered to put in a word for him with my editor. I did. He got the job, and basically lost all interest in me. We were in different teams. Thank God for that! Because a week after he joined, I found out he had a girlfriend, and he had used me to get this job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:58:18.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
