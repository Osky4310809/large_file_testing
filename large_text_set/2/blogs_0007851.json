Here is what she shared with the mag:\nOn going back to work as a new mom : “When I went into [the show], and when I decided that I wanted to work consistently on something, I had criteria. I read other [scripts] too, but this was just the one. It was love at first sight.”\nOn her upcoming music : “I really have been missing writing, so I’ve been doing it on and off [for] the last year or so… I worked with awesome people when I released my first album in 2014. I’m hoping to do it again.”\nOn how she has changed throughout the past decade : “I think I’m different. I started Gossip Girl 10 years ago when I was 20, and I’m 30 now. I loved doing it, and now I’m doing something else that I love, and something new that’s a little bit more my taste as a 30 year old, something I’ve grown into… I feel so lucky that I can have such amazing fans and they either grew up with [the show] or they’re growing up with it now. I’ve also heard people say, ‘Oh we watch that as a throwback.’”\nFor more from Leighton , pick up the new issue of Rogue !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:59:33.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
