He originally knocked back a two-year offer from the Roos that was worth just over $1 million. \nMagpies director of football Geoff Walsh admitted on Tuesday afternoon that the Pies would be without the veteran on-baller for the MCG blockbuster. \n“Last week we said that we would reassess every seven days, and we are pleased with the way that he is progressing,” told the club’s website. \n“He is starting to get some good conditioning into his legs, but he won’t make Round 1. \n“We are all aware of that, but having said that, we are really pleased that he is going forward and he is starting to feel good, particularly in relation to his calf. \n“As he gets better and as he builds training, that will tell us when he is ready to resume.” \nHowever Walsh was optimistic on the Round 1 prospects of three players who sat out the club’s final JLT Community Series game against Richmond on the weekend. \nWalsh said he was confident both skipper Scott Pendlebury (Achilles) and Levi Greenwood (hamstring) would be fit for the Bulldogs clash, as their respective absences from the Tigers game were just precautionary. \nWalsh added that Jordan De Goey (quad) had “improved significantly” over recent days and should be fit for Round 1. \nLive stream EVERY game of the 2017 NAB AFL Women’s competition on FOX SPORTS.
