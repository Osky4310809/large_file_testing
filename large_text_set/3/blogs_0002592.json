Sure. There are some unwritten rules that apply to every set of friends. Most of these you already know as they are common sense items that people know from as far back as middle school . \nThe problem is, sometimes people don't know about these little tidbits, so I think it's high time the unwritten rules of friendship were written down.

Don't Steal Friends \nSome folks recommend stealing your friend's pals as a way to increase your social circle , but consider this scenario: You introduce two friends who up until then had not known each other. The three of you have a great time, but soon after, you can't get a hold of one of the friends. Your calls and emails are ignored, and you find out later that your friend has been hanging out with the other pal you introduced them to. Your friend is now doing things with your other pal that they used to do with you . \nWould that make you feel good? Probably not, which is why you'd never want to do this to someone else. It's a nice thing to introduce friends to each other and even encourage them to get to know each other, but you should include the friend who introduced you so they don't feel left out. \n  5 Ways You Can Tell It is Love A group of single, female friends enjoying their time together.

Take Turns and Let the Other Friend Shine \nIdeally, friendship is about sharing, which means that you each take turns deciding which activities to do , where to meet, and who should pick up the tab. But taking turns is about more than that . Friends need to share the limelight, give and receive empathy equally, and never take each other for granted. \nYou should go out of your way to: Split or pick up the check Step back when they receive attention Make sure you provide support when they need it (and not just when it's convenient for you) Listen during conversations (don't make it all about you) Guys hanging out together. Dan Dalton/Getty Images 3. Stand By Your Friends \nNothing is worse than a fair-weather friend , or someone who is by your side when things are good but bails when the going gets tough. Even when you don't agree with the things your friend is doing , you can still care about them. The true definition of friendship means that someone that accepts you as you are.

You want to demonstrate that you can be someone your friend will be able to count on for the small things (showing up for lunch) and the big ones (when they go through a divorce , lose a parent, or get fired from a job.) \nBy that same note, don't be the friend that cancels at the last minute or waits to RSVP until you're sure you have no other plans. Do the things you say you're going to do. If a friend breaks up with a guy, is it okay to date him?. Christopher Robbins/Getty Images 5. Don't Date a Friend's Ex \nIf your pal went out with someone, that person is now off-limits for you. This is true for a couple different reasons. First, you need to support your friend through their breakup. This means that when they are angry and hurt over something their ex did, you need to have their back, which includes listening to them , being empathetic , and standing up for them if need be. \nThe second thing is, when your friend is finally over an ex, it would be weird for them to see you with this person. More than that, it may bring up all those issues that your friend worked so hard to get over. \nAre there exceptions to this rule ? Sometimes, but only after enough time has passed that it wouldn't be difficult for your friend to see you with their ex. This can happen when they have fully moved on and wish both you and the ex well. If you're in doubt about dating a friend's ex, talk to them first.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T10:59:22.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
