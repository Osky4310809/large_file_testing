Its been 33 months and we have co-created 969 spirited events within our ever evolving Full Circle community! Today is our last day!” he wrote on Instagram last week.\nThe Rose Temple Courtesy Full Circle According to Keegan, who spoke to us via phone on Thursday, Full Circle “did close down, we did stop our organization as far as operations,” but now the community-focused organization has succeeded in securing funding to keep things going.\n“We’re reveling in some success with this … at the same time it continues to be a pretty dynamic workflow to take it to the next level,” Keegan, 38, explained.\nLast year, Keegan — best known for roles in films like “10 Things I Hate About You” and TV shows like “7th Heaven” — struggled to keep the group in its headquarters at the Rose Temple, a 111-year-old building, which, at the time, had been put on the market for $6.5 million.\nThe group plans to rebrand itself with a focus on wellness, continuing to offer “sound healing, educational, medical type practices, food and health,” Keegan said.\nWhile Full Circle plans to bring back its Sunday services come April, organizers are also working with Snap Inc. (formerly Snapchat) to hold a Venice town hall, where members of the community can gather to discuss the “rent and property increases” that the presence of the social media platform and other start-ups have resulted in.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:22:12.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
