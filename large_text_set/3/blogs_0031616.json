I like to stay in one place, one city, where the team fights for titles.” \nWenger emphasised he took Sanchez’s words in “a very positive way”. \n“Alexis said he wants to win the championship, that’s what everybody wants,” added Wenger. ‘Not sorted completely’ \nWenger was offered a new contract earlier this season but several ex-Arsenal players have stated his 21 years at the club are coming to an end in the face of mounting fan frustration at perceived underachievement. \nThe Gunners remain in the FA Cup but have exited the Champions League and sit sixth in the Premier League, form which has seen sections of supporters hold banners and sing songs asking Wenger to leave. \nHe promised clarity on his future “soon” less than two weeks ago, but on Thursday said: “It’s a subject that at the moment it is not sorted completely out. \n“I’m very clear in my mind. Do I stay two months or two years? My commitment will be exactly the same all the time. It does not influence my attitude.” \nArsenal have lost six of their last nine games but asked if the issue was creating a distraction, Wenger added: “I believe the priority in life is to focus on what is important, not to look for excuses.” \nMore to follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T13:12:12.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
