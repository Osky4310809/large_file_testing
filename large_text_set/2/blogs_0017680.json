Because of its kinky content , the book inspired many essays about BDSM , sexual power and contemporary, American ladies. It was even turned into a movie in 2015. \nSome argue that true feminists shouldn't enjoy being submissive , while others content there's not a damn thing wrong with it. Here are 3 damn good reasons spanking and feminism go hand in hand, and why every feminist can enjoy it . \n1. We like what we like. \nTenor \nSomewhere along the way, the neuron that says, \" spankings feel kinda good in a certain context\" gets flipped, and that's a wrap. It doesn't matter if you love Jesus, hate the board of directors for the original ping-pong paddles, or define yourself as someone who thinks men and women deserve equality in all things. \n2. Sex, even the gentle stuff, sort of hurts. \nTenor \nStretching out the most sensitive part of your body and vigorously slamming it back and forth can induce a few winces. Pleasure and pain — forgive me for being trite — aren't too terribly far apart. \nI've seen a few of you orgasm and it doesn't always look like you're experiencing bliss . (Although, in all fairness, my \"O face\" probably looks like I was just shot with a crossbow.) \n3. We don't know everything about women's sexuality. \nTenor \nSome ladies can only bust if they're laying in one particular direction while one particular act (or device) is pleasing her, and other ladies orgasm wildly from anal. For all we know, the tendrils we suspect traveling from a woman's clitoris to her G-spot could also slither further and farther. \nFurthermore, just because you're the person with the riding crop, it doesn't automatically make you the boss, as \"power bottoms\" can attest. I'd wager that spanking isn't usually the idea of the person doing it . It's nerve-wracking for the \"spanker.\" \nHow hard do I do it? What if I leave a hand-shaped bruise? Will this path end in a dungeon with some porkers masturbating to us hitting each other with soggy loaves of bread? \nIf you are in a \"Dominant/submissive\" position, you have more power than you'd expect. Even as a \"submissive submissive,\" you have a ton of power in that you can pull the plug whenever you please with your \"safe word.\" \nI don't think a woman's employment or social politics really has any influence of what she likes in the sack or how kinky she is. Frankly, I developed a theory that any woman who wants to hook up with me probably has daddy issues, likes to have her hair pulled or both. So far, so good, but it's a relatively small sample size and, at this point, probably an awful lot of self-fulfilling prophecy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:32:47.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
