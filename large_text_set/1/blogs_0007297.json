The Girl on the Train: A Novel (Unabridged) by Paula Hawkins \nOpen iTunes to Buy Description \nAudie Award, Audiobook of the Year, 2016 Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. \"Jess and Jason,\" she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost. And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good? Compulsively readable, The Girl on the Train is an emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut. Customer Reviews by CLB1213 I have no idea how this book became so popular or received such good reviews. The characters are all unlikable, the plot is predictable, and the end/big \"whodunnit\" reveal is yawn-inspiring. Do not waste your money or (more importantly) your time! Great book! by arsenicANDlace The book (audio) is well read and characters colorfully recreated by the three different narrators. The story line is great and complimented by well written and smart dialog. I loved listening to it, and am excited for more to come from Paula Hawkins! Made me want to cut my wrists by CommuterBlues I could only listen to 1.5 hours of this book before I became very, very sad. We learn about the first two narrators through their miserable negative inner dialog while we glimpse the pieces of the puzzle of the story. I do not know how these 2 characters can go on. I certainly couldn't go on.Big downer. So much so That I couldn't bear it long enough to make it through to what I would have hoped would have been a thrilling, interesting and hopefully a happy ending?If you would benefit from a pick me up, skip this.
