The Belgium international has been linked with a possible switch to Los Blancos, with their current goalkeeper Keylor Navas struggling for form as of late. When asked about the reports on Cadena Ser (h/t Adriana Garcia of ESPN FC) the Chelsea stopper shrugged them off: \nI don't see myself at Real Madrid. I see myself at Chelsea, the club that six years ago saw me playing in Belgium and gave me the opportunity to sign for them. \nThey also allowed me to be three years at Atletico, which helped me to be the keeper that I am now. I feel that I'm key to the team, I'm very happy at Chelsea, and I don't see myself anywhere else. Clive Rose/Getty Images It’s added that Courtois was asked directly whether or not he would play for Madrid next season, to which he responded \"no.\" Indeed, the 24-year-old suggested he would be keen to extend his stay with the Blues, although there has been no movement yet over a new contract. His current deal expires in 2019. Although Courtois struggled for form last term, he’s been back at his imposing best once again in 2016-17 under Antonio Conte. Indeed, the rangy 'keeper not only makes crucial stops, he’s assured in plucking crosses out of the air and is growing increasingly decisive in the way he distributes the ball. As these numbers from Squawka Football illustrate, Courtois has been part of the best defensive setup in European football this season: Squawka Football @Squawka Most clean sheets in Europe's top 5 leagues: T. Courtois (13) Y. Pele (13) D. Subasic (12) W. Szczesny (12) @marcelcalvinn #AskSquawka https://t.co/GI69BFZJFp Interest from Madrid would be understandable. Not only are the European champions renowned for putting the game’s rising stars on their transfer agenda, but the club’s current starting goalkeeper, Navas, has been in poor form recently. Navas been criticised for his recent form. Sonia Canada/Getty Images While he was exceptional as Madrid made their way to the UEFA Champions League final last term, this season the Costa Rican has struggled. Recently his poor positioning and indecision has cost Zinedine Zidane’s side goals against Sevilla , Las Palmas and Napoli ; in the recent win over Real Betis he was lucky not to be red-carded, before spilling a routine save into his own net. Per Dermot Corrigan on ESPN FC, there’s been plenty of speculation at the Bernabeu about a possible move for Courtois given Navas' troubles: Dermot Corrigan @dermotmcorrigan Either way, everybody around the Bernabeu sure this summer's 'galactico' will be a keeper, just to decide whether De Gea or Courtois. 2/26/2017, 7:09:26 PM It seems as though Madrid may have to look elsewhere if they’re to strengthen their options in goal, though, with Courtois seemingly content with life at Stamford Bridge. After all, under Conte the stopper has his swagger back, is challenging for titles and will be back in the Champions League again next season too. Courtois evidently appreciates the investment the Blues placed in his development, allowing him to spend three years in succession at Atletico and get regular game time. It’s clear now that he and the Premier League leaders are beginning to reap the rewards.
