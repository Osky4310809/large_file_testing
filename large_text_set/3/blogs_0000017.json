[Photo: Instagram/katyperry/Getty Images] More Katy Perry is making some major changes for 2017. It’s only March, and she’s already released a single , dyed her hair platinum blond , and announced her breakup from boyfriend Orlando Bloom . But the biggest beauty change? A new pixie cut with buzzed undersides. Perry shared her chop on Instagram with thanks to celebrity stylist Chris McMillan and colorists Justin Anderson and Melinda Miller-Rider . Though her bangs are pure white blonde, Perry’s brunette roots peek through the close-cropped sides. (Is anyone else getting serious Scarlett-Johansson -at-the-Oscars vibes?) Perry’s Insta Boomerang gives us a peek at how the style flows, but not how the cut looks in action. “This is my first snap, and guess what I’m going to do? I’m going to cut off all my hair. That’s right,” Perry told her Snapchat (and Instagram). The pop star also revealed that she and McMillan, who also does Jennifer Aniston and Miley Cyrus’s hair (doesn’t Perry’s new ’do give off major Miley vibes?), have been thinking of trying this style for a long time. “I’ve been wanting to do this since the day I met you,” McMillan said. “You remember?” Perry responded, “I remember … I wasn’t ready!” Opting for a drastic haircut post-breakup is a relatable move, both inside Hollywood and out. According to InStyle , breakups can trigger an instinct to make an external change in the hopes that the internal will catch up and feel better as well. “There is something about a drastic cut that can feel cathartic after a breakup, like you are cutting off the dead weight and becoming lighter and freer,” Dr. Laura Berman told InStyle. Judging by Perry’s new supershort look, she cut off a lot of dead weight. The silver lining is that “break-overs” have inspired some daring celebrity changes over the years. Remember when Gigi Hadid walked the AMAs red carpet in slicked-back chin-length hair right after her split from Joe Jonas? They can even birth classic looks, like Halle Berry’s pixie, which debuted suspiciously soon after her breakup with Gabriel Aubry. This isn’t even Katy Perry’s first rodeo: She went Finding Dory blue after her split from husband Russell Brand. Work breakups count too: When Vampire Diaries and Mad Men ended, Nina Dobrev and Christina Hendricks each got to switch up their trademark locks. But the queen of break-overs has to be Khloé Kardashian, who got an entire TV show out of her post-breakup look. Although Perry has stated that there are no “victims or villains” in her breakup with Bloom, might we suggest a TV show called Revenge Hair?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:49:46.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
