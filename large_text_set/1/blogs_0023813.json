The court believes most people, when they hear the words 'high-end escort' that describes a prostitute. There could be no more defamatory statement than to call a woman a prostitute.\" \nTarpley's attorney Danielle Giroux argued the blogger was simply reporting on rumors in his since-retracted post — rumors that were newsworthy for the public during the election: \n\"He did not say that Melania Trump was a high-class escort. What he said was there are rumors about that. He's writing about the rumors and that, itself, is newsworthy.\" \nTrump's attorney Charles Harder — who repped Hulk Hogan during that whole Gawker Media debacle — fired back by arguing that Tarpley endorsed the so-called \"rumors\" by referring to them as \"widely known,\" explaining: \n\"That's not how the law works. You can't print a rumor if it's not true and it damages or harms someone's reputation. That is textbook defamation.\" \nWhile the court is allowing the Tarpley case to continue, it's TBD where the Daily Mail suit will fall, as the judge is trying to determine if Maryland is the appropriate jurisdiction for the lawsuit since the site is based in London. \nWe'll of course keep you updated as we learn more. \nWhat do U make of all this, Perezcious readers??
