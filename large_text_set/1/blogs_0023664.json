Denver Mayor Michael Hancock joins CBSN to to explain why he find... \nSpeaking to The Miami Herald, Mayor Gimenez put the shift in stark financial terms. Last year, Miami-Dade declined to continue detaining approximately 100 undocumented inmates wanted by federal immigration. Keeping them would have cost $52,000, The Miami Herald reported. In contrast, Miami-Dade is set to receive $355 million in federal funds in 2017, the newspaper noted. \n“I want to make sure we don’t put in jeopardy the millions of funds we get from the federal government for a $52,000 issue,” Mayor Gimenez told The Miami Herald. “It doesn’t mean that we’re going to be arresting more people. It doesn’t mean that we’re going to be enforcing any immigration laws.” \nPresident Trump took to Twitter to celebrate the mayor’s decision: Miami-Dade Mayor drops sanctuary policy. Right decision. Strong! https://t.co/MtPvaDC4jM — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2017 \nHoward Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, criticized Mayor Gimenez’s decision to reverse course. In a statement , he argued that a court warrant is required to detain someone in jail, “not merely a request from a federal official.” \n“We will resist every attempt by our government to punish immigrants, regardless of their status. Today’s decision by Mayor Gimenez flies in the face of Miami’s long history as a city of immigrants. It also flies in the face of the advice of professional law enforcement that policies like the one Gimenez embraced today serve only to drive a wedge of distrust between law enforcement and our immigrant community,” Simon said. \nThere are 140 “sanctuary” jurisdictions — states, cities and counties — across the country, according to a May, 2016 Justice Department report . That list includes cities like Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, counties like Cook County, Illinois and Clark County, Nevada, and states like Connecticut and California. \nMr. Trump’s executive order on Wednesday took direct aim at those jurisdictions. \n“Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States,” the president’s executive order stated. “These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.” \nMoina Shaiq holds a sign at a rally outside of City Hall in San Francisco, Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017, after President Donald Trump signed an executive order threatening to cut federal dollars from immigrant-protecting “sanctuary cities.” AP Photo/Jeff Chiu \nImmediately after Mr. Trump’s executive order, several mayors of so-called sanctuary cities vocally doubled down on their commitment to undocumented residents. \nIn Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh said he would use “City Hall as a last resort” to provide protection to his city’s immigrants. \n“We will not back down from our values that make us who we are as a city,” Walsh said Wednesday hours after Trump’s executive order. “We will fight for our residents, whether immigrant or not, and provide the best quality of life for Bostonians.” \nIn New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that “turning our police into a deportation force will make us all less safe” and stressed that New York immigrants should not fear that cooperating with police will put them at risk of being separated from their families. \n“We are not going to tear families apart. We are not going to leave children without their parents,” De Blasio said Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T04:50:33.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
