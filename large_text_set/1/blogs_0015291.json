Even though the President is a noted White Sox fan, it was the perfect way for Obama to kick off the final week of his time in the White House.\nTo celebrate the occasion – both the Cubs going to Washington and Obama winding down his time as the most powerful person on earth – Jordan Brand decided to hook Obama up with a special pair of sneakers. They’re incredible and, as you can see, they came in this special box that included the Presidential seal, the Jordan logo, and the Derek Jeter “Re2pect” logo.\nToday, @DexterFowler is visiting the @WhiteHouse with a custom @Jumpman23 gift for @POTUS .\nFollow on IG for more: https://t.co/TUIZSZ7n9q pic.twitter.com/WzRCeuwBxq \n— The Players' Tribune (@PlayersTribune) January 16, 2017 \n\nAs for the shoes themselves, they were apparently delivered to Obama by Cubs outfielder and Jordan Brand athlete Dexter Fowler. They’re black kicks with white soles and a white tongue that feature the Presidential seal. The coolest aspect, though, is that the shoes include Obama’s signature.\n\nVia PlayersTribune \nObama and Jordan are mutual fans of one another – especially POTUS, who has been known to crack jokes about His Airness every now and then . It’s pretty cool that Jordan decided to hook Obama up one last time before his presidency reaches its conclusion.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T05:08:59.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
