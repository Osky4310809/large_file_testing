Later, more videos documenting the same actions for INFINITE and Block B were also discovered. \nIn regards to the case, a police source revealed, “Lee Se Young did not come into physical contact with the B1A4 members. She just made the movement. Seeing as how B1A4 testified that they did not feel offended, we could not confirm the suspicions [of sexual assault]. Lee Se Young was also not investigated separately.” \nMeanwhile, B1A4 , Block B, and INFINITE were all previously called in to be questioned for the case. \nWhat do you think of the decision?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T06:02:25.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
