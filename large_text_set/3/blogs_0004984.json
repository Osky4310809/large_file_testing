It’s a shame for our FedEx team.” \nBut even before the parts failure, Hamlin didn’t have the speed he wanted. \n“We had a decent car – top-10 car – and it’s up here hanging out around seventh or eighth all day,” said Hamlin, who was allowed to return to the race after a lengthy stay in the garage because he was behind the wall for mechanical repairs. “We kept gaining on them, which is a good thing, but just had a mechanical failure here.” \nHamlin’s return to the track was short-lived anyway, as he went back behind the wall again with 62 laps to go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T01:23:02.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
