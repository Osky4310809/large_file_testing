The Road Warriors snapped a disastrous five-game losing skid and improved to 2-5 while the KaTropa saw their two-game winning run stopped as they slipped to 4-3 joining Phoenix in third place. NLEX held off TNT comfortably in the early parts of the fourth quarter resting on a 93-87 lead courtesy of Sean Anthony’s layup. ADVERTISEMENT Jayson Castro, however, took over and capped off the KaTropa’s 7-0 run to give TNT a 94-93 lead at the 6:13 mark of the fourth quarter. The Road Warriors then retaliated and gave Guiao, a native of Pampanga and was once the province Representative in the Philippine Congress, a show in the form of a 13-2 run that put them at 106-96 with 2:04 left in the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T14:18:13.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
