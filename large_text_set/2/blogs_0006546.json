Medicinal plants are currently being evaluated as source of promising anticancer agents. In this paper, we have investigated the anticancer potential of plant Allium wallichii , a plant native to Nepal and growing at elevations of 2300–4800 m. This is the first study of its kind for the plant mentioned. Methods The dried plant was extracted in aqueous ethanol. Phytochemical screening, anti-microbial assay, anti-oxidant assay, cytotoxicity assay and the flow-cytometric analysis were done for analyzing different phytochemicals present, anti-microbial activity, anti-oxidant activity and anti-cancer properties of Allium wallichii . Results We observed the presence of steroids, terpenoids, flavonoids, reducing sugars and glycosides in the plant extract and the plant showed moderate anti-microbial and anti-oxidant activity. The IC 50 values of Allium wallichii in different cancer cell lines are 69.69 μg/ml for Prostate cancer (PC3) cell line, 55.29 μg/ml for Breast Cancer (MCF-7) cell line and 46.51 μg/ml for cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line as compared to Doxorubicin (0.85 μg/ml). The cell viability assay using FACS showed that the IC 50 value of Allium wallichii for Burkitt’s lymphoma (B-Lymphoma) cell line was 3.817 ± 1.99 mg/ml. Conclusions Allium wallichii can be an important candidate to be used as an anticancer agent. Separation of pure compounds with bioassay guided extraction, spectrometric analysis and subsequent cytotoxicity assay of the pure bioactive compounds from Allium wallichii is highly recommended as the crude extract itself showed promising cytotoxicity. Keywords Allium wallichii FACS MTT assay Cancer cell lines Cytotoxicity Anticancer agent Background Medicinal plants are considered as potential source for drug development and many novel products have reached clinical trials. Scientists are investigating properties of medicinal plants in order to develop novel drugs against disease like cancer, from natural products. Medicinal herbs have profound scope and have been used to find potential anticancer compounds in them [ 1 ]. Use of phytochemicals from the medicinal plants in cancer treatment, may reduce adverse side effects and help to treat cancer and they have in recent years, shown promising anticancer efficiency against different cancers like human mouth epidermal carcinoma (KB cell line), murine leukemia (P388 cell line), human colorectal cancer (BE cell line) and prostate cancer (PC3 cell line) by various mechanisms like up-regulation of p16INK4A, preventing inhibition of MRCK-kinase targeting multiple gene products and targeting mitotic processes [ 2 – 8 ]. Many medicinal plants found in Nepal are also found to have cytotoxic effects against different cancer cell lines. For example, Cell viability assay of plant extracts from Berberis aristata ; showed a significant cytotoxicity to MDA-MB-231 and U-87 MG human cancer cell line; Withanone from Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) has been identified to have p53-activating tumor-inhibiting property. Ashwagandha leaf powder was non-toxic and anti-tumorigenic in mice assays and caused an abrogation of mortalin-p53 interactions and reactivation of p53 function and it is also established that the different extracts of plant Juniperus recurva possess anticancer properties against Breast Cancer (MCF7) cells [ 9 – 12 ]. Allium wallichii (AW) Allium wallichii is a monocotyledonous plant falling in order Asparagales, family Amaryllidaceae and Allioideae subfamily. It has been used as traditional medicine and spice in Nepal. Recent research papers deal with the genetic diversity and relationship of two species of Allium by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis [ 13 ]. The phylogenetic and biogeographic investigation of Allium sp. based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer and chloroplast ribosomal protein S16 (rps16) sequences implied that genus Allium comprises more than 800 species, which defends its place among the largest genera in monocotyledons [ 14 ]. Use of plant resource and traditional medicine in Nepal has also been documented for millennia and they are still the most significant health care source for bulk of population [ 15 ]. There have been reports of trnK-gene-based molecular phylogenetic studies of plants of genus Allium [ 16 ]. 1, 2 bis (methylthio) ethene, 2, 4 di-Methiophene, di-Methyl disulfide and di-Methyl trisulfide were established to be the most important volatile constituents of Allium wallichii [ 17 ]. Diosgenin and Tigogenin are reported as steroidal sapogenins from bulbs of Allium wallichii. Kunth, that shows encouraging pharmacological potentials [ 18 ]. Neuropsychopharmacological utilization has also been conferred in the studies of the action of Allium sp. which shed light to its diverse use [ 19 ]. Extracts that includes Allium sp . is found to exhibit analgesic and fever relieving effects and can be used for the treatment of inflammation, ulcer, viral infection, cancer, eczema, diabetes, senile gangrene, herpes zoster and most importantly Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) [ 20 ]. In this paper we have investigated the presence of different phytochemicals in Allium wallichii and also established the anti -microbial, anti-oxidant activity of the crude extract of the plant. More importantly this paper is focused in establishing the anticancer potential of the extracts of Allium wallichii by in-vitro cytotoxicity assay against Prostrate, Cervical and Breast cancer cell lines and Flow-cytometric analysis for viability assay against B-lymphoma cell lines. This is the first study of its kind for the plant Allium wallichii. Methods Collection of plant material Allium wallichii (AW) whole plants were collected from Kathmandu University campus area of Kavrepalanchowk district, Nepal. The plant material was identified by Dr. Rajendra Gyawali, Botanist, Assistant Professor of Department of Pharmacy, Kathmandu University, Nepal. A voucher herbarium specimen is deposited at the herbarium of the Department of Pharmacy, Kathmandu University, Nepal and the voucher specimen number is DoP-H-211. The plant samples were then dried in shade, left over for 15 days and macerated and powdered with the help of kitchen grinder. Preparation of plant extract The dry powder of Allium wallichii (100 g) was dipped in 80% Aq. Ethanol for three days stirring twice a day. The solution at the end of third day was filtered and then concentrated in high vacuum-rotary evaporator and finally all the solvent was evaporated using freeze dryer to get the semi-solid plant extract. The same procedure was repeated three times and the freeze-dried extract was mixed together. The extract was then kept in glass vial with airtight caps and stored at 4 °C. Phytochemical screening The phytochemical screening was done using the standard protocols [ 21 – 28 ]. Test for Alkaloids: 5 ml of extract was concentrated to yield a residue. Residue was dissolved in 3ml of 2% (v/v) HCl, few drops of Mayer’s reagent was added. Appearance of the dull white precipitate indicated the presence of basic alkaloids. Test for Coumarin: 4 ml extract solution was taken; 1–2 drops of water (hot) was added. Volume was made half (UV fluorescence). 10% NH 4 OH was added to another half volume (strong fluorescence). Presence of green fluorescence indicated the presence of Coumarin. Test for Saponins: 2 ml extract was shaken vigorously for 30 s in a test tube. Persistence of thick forth even after 30 mins indicated the presence of saponins. Test for Glycosides: 2 ml of extract was dried till 1 ml.1-2 ml NH 4 OH was added and shaken. Appearance of cherish red color indicated the presence of glycosides. Test for Reducing Sugars: 0.5 ml of extract was taken and 1ml distilled water was added. 5-8 drops of Fehling’s solution (hot) was added. Presence of brick red precipitation indicated the presence of reducing sugar. Test for steroids: 1 ml extract was dissolved in 10 ml chloroform. Equal volume of conc. H 2 SO 4 was added by the side of test tube. Upper layer turned red and sulphuric acid layer turned yellow with green fluorescence. This indicated the presence of steroids. Test for Quinone: 1 ml of extract was taken.1 ml of conc. H 2 SO 4 was added. Formation of red color indicated the presence of quinone. Test for Terpenoids: 5 ml of extract was taken and mixed with 2 ml of chloroform. 3 ml of conc. H 2 SO 4 was added to form a layer. Reddish brown precipitate formation at the interface formed indicated the presence of terpenoids. Test for Tannins: About 0.5 g of the dried powdered samples was boiled in 20 ml of water in a test tube and then filtered. Few drops of 0.1% Ferric Chloride was added and observed for brownish green or a blue-black coloration. Test for Flavonoids: A portion of the powdered plant sample was heated with 10 ml of Ethyl Acetate over a steam bath for 3 min. The mixture was filtered and 4 ml of the filtrate was shaken with 1 ml of dilute Ammonia solution. A yellow coloration was observed indicating a positive test for flavonoids. DPPH free radical scavenging assay DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical), is a dark-colored crystalline powder composed of stable free-radical molecules. DPPH has major application in laboratory research most notably in anti-oxidant assays. The DPPH assay is typically run by the following standard procedure [ 29 – 31 ]. The hydrogen atom or electron donating abilities of the corresponding extracts/fractions and standards were measured from the bleaching of the purple-colored methanol solution of DPPH. 10 mg DPPH was dissolved in 100 ml methanol (MeOH) to obtain a concentration of 100 μg/ml. The stock solution of the fractions/extracts was prepared by dissolving 25 mg in 50 ml MeOH. Dilutions of the stock solutions of the crude extracts were prepared to obtain concentration of 1 μg/ml, 2 μg/ml, 3 μg/ml, 4 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml while the control was prepared by dissolving 1 ml DPPH in 4 ml MeOH (without sample). 1 ml DPPH was added to each solution and the solution were kept in dark and allowed to stand for exact 30 mins. The UV absorption of each solution was recorded at 517 nm. The reaction was allowed to progress for 30 mins at 37 °C and absorbance was monitored by microplate reader, SpectraMax340 at 517 nm. Upon reduction, the color of the solution fades (violet to pale yellow). Percent Radical Scavenging Activity (% RSA) was determined by comparison with a DMSO containing control. The concentration that causes a decrease in the initial DPPH concentration by 50% is defined as IC 50 value. Scavenging of free radicals by DPPH as percent radical scavenging activities was calculated as follows. % RSA = Control absorbance – extract absorbance X 100/control absorbance. The IC 50 values of compounds were calculated by using the EZ-Fit Enzyme kinetics software program (Perrella Scientific Inc. Amherst, MA, USA). Ascorbic acid was used as the reference compound. Agar plate diffusion method for anti-microbial activity Medium was dissolved and autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min, cooled up to 45 °C and then 40-50 ml media was poured in sterile 14 cm diameter Petri plate, and then allowed to solidify and kept at room temperature as stated in the protocols [ 32 – 34 ]. Preparation of plant extract Stock solution of 400 mg/ml was prepared by weighing 200 mg of plant extract in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and 0.5 ml of DMSO was added by micropipette. Extract was completely dissolved by vortexing for 5–10 min. Test solution of 200 mg/ml, 100 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml and 25 mg/ml concentrations was prepared. Preparation of inoculums Each culture to be tested was streaked onto nutrient agar plate to obtain isolated colonies. Overnight incubation was done at 37 °C. Then isolated colonies were transferred by the help of sterile loop onto Muller Hinton Broth. Overnight incubation was done at rotary shaker at 37 °C. Inoculation For inoculation, swabbing was done with the help of cotton. Sterilized filter paper discs were dipped into the desirable concentration of the plant extracts and then applied to the plates; incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the diameter of the Zone of inhibition was measured. MTT/cytotoxicity assay against cancer cell lines Cytotoxic activity of plant extract was evaluated in 96-well flat-bottomed micro-titer plates by using the standard MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) colorimetric assay [ 35 ]. For this purpose, MCF-7, PC3, HeLa cells were separately cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Sigma Aldrich, Germany), supplemented with 5% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma Aldrich, Germany), 100 IU/ml of Penicillin and 100 μg/ml of Streptomycin in 75 cm 2 flasks and kept in 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 °C. Exponentially growing cells were harvested, counted with hemocytometer and diluted with a particular medium. Cell culture with the concentration of 1x10 5 cells/ml was prepared and introduced (100 μL/well) into 96-well plates. After overnight incubation, medium was removed and 200 μL of fresh medium was added with different concentrations of plant extracts. The stock solution of the extract was first prepared (50 μg/ml) in DMSO and was serially diluted up to the concentration of 0.78125 μg/ml. After 48 h, 200 μL MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated further for 4 h. Subsequently, 100 μL of DMSO was added to each well. The extent of MTT reduction to formazan within cells was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm, using a micro plate reader (Spectra Max plus, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The cytotoxicity was recorded as concentration causing 50% growth inhibition (IC 50 ) for the cell lines used. The percent inhibition was calculated by using the following formula: % Inhibition = 100-[(mean of O.D of test compound – mean of O.D of negative control)/(mean of O.D of positive control – mean of O.D of negative control) X 100]. The results (% Inhibition) were processed by using Soft-Max Pro software (Molecular Device, USA). IC 50 was calculated using EZ-Fit Software. Cell viability analysis using PI-On flow cytometry B-lymphoma cancer cell line was a generous gift from Switzerland, Raji (Burkitt’s lymphoma) (ATCC Catalog. Number: CCl-86). The cell line was maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 environment in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 (Caisson, Oklahoma) with 1% L-Glutamine, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen, Germany), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (PAA laboratories, Austria). The cell viability analysis using PI-On Flow cytometry was performed at Panjwani Centre for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research, International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi, Pakistan using standard protocol [ 36 ]. Cell cytotoxicity assay was performed using florescent dye Propidium iodide (Excitation wavelength = 536 nm) (Emission wavelength = 617 nm). The dye has the property that it can’t cross the intact plasma membrane and as a result of this, live cells cannot be stained using this dye. However, the dead cells in which cell membrane integrity is lost, the dye penetrate inside the cell and thus intercalate the DNA of the cell as a result of that only dead cells will fluoresce and could be read in FL2 or FL3 channels/filters in flow-cytometer. In order to generate dose response curve of standard and test compounds against the cell line, cells were seeded in round bottom 96 well plate in such a way that each well contain 1.3x10 5 cells per well with 200 μl final reaction volume. Negative control wells were given media containing cells only while in positive control wells 0.5% of the total reaction volume of DMSO was added. Results The yield percentage of plant extract from the cold extraction was calculated. Yield percentage was calculated by using following formula: Yield = (Weight of the extract obtained)/(Total weight of the sample loaded) x 100% $$ Yield\\%=\\frac{12.07}{100}\\times 100\\%=12.07\\% $$ In the phytochemical screening, as shown in Table 1 , we observed the presence of different phytochemicals like steroids, terpenoids, flavonoids, reducing sugars and glycosides. Anti-microbial assay was performed with the plant extract of Allium wallichii by agar plate diffusion method. Five different antibiotics were used as standard drugs. Eight different microorganism B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, E.coli, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, Rhizopus, A. flavus and B. subtilis were used for the assay.
