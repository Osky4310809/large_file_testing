To recap, the projector has two depth cameras that can scan a room and detect where the main display is.\nOnce it knows the size of the room and the position of the main gaming screen, the fisheye lens kicks into action and projects an extended field of view around it, creating a more immersive gaming experience.\nSo games feel larger than they really are:\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nWords can't do Ariana justice, so here are two videos that show Ariana in action:\nRazer's Project Ariana puts gaming on your walls #CES2017 #MashCES pic.twitter.com/CE1hnAu7ij\nâ€” Raymond Wong ðŸ“±ðŸ’¾ðŸ“¼ (@raywongy) January 5, 2017\nRazer Project Ariana in action IRL â€” protector extends gaming onto your walls! #CES2017 #MashCES pic.twitter.com/cyEwJbLNEm\nâ€” Raymond Wong ðŸ“±ðŸ’¾ðŸ“¼ (@raywongy) January 5, 2017\nIf that doesn't make you giddy like a schoolchild, nothing will.\nImage: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE\nRazer only showed me what gaming looks like with Ariana, but movies can also work with the projector.\nImage: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE\nThat's Project Ariana mounted up on the ceiling.\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nBONUS: This ridiculous laptop is the portable Batman command center you've always dreamed of", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/u7w8pNvT9_Jny_4T9TtW6dmXP1A=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F338322%2Fe4b11bbf-71aa-4a89-a3f2-da8758069452.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2017?src=hash", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hqx6vKLQKsa4iairp4NPOEYder4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F338318%2Fd9e71080-a7c6-40ba-97ee-b3c88d7bc2bf.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2FJsJ9eDCxrOpQpDmWEif7nnNuk=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F338316%2F37946aa8-1f9d-48d7-bf88-c665dc4085f0.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-uPyxZ7_bbO4mtWW88WCGy1P0fo=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F338312%2F8b5225a1-8419-4b48-ab1e-f34c004027d1.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ndm84Aqg5XZi0PjoP9g5XJxei_E=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F338322%2Fe4b11bbf-71aa-4a89-a3f2-da8758069452.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/x4ByyZqwJLXDqecAOHLjf2sHZh4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F338324%2F858ddd18-7326-4238-99c9-98ed1520c729.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MashCES?src=hash", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bfI-WrKiPMaYq5c8xR8P7mMHdhE=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F338312%2F8b5225a1-8419-4b48-ab1e-f34c004027d1.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bkF76RagFH9SKB36kqSxFSE-Iac=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F338316%2F37946aa8-1f9d-48d7-bf88-c665dc4085f0.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/V3kYRI8G.jpg", "https://t.co/CE1hnAu7ij", "https://twitter.com/raywongy/status/817087416271896576", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_v70UAhk_95mbPlb-2GY5NKC9z0=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F338318%2Fd9e71080-a7c6-40ba-97ee-b3c88d7bc2bf.jpg", "https://twitter.com/raywongy/status/817072335031144448", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ElyOdImq5mVPLLSx6WQddPoXH2I=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F338324%2F858ddd18-7326-4238-99c9-98ed1520c729.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/V3kYRI8G.m3u8", "https://t.co/cyEwJbLNEm"], "published": "2017-01-06T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T03:30:06.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
