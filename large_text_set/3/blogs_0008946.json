All the successful Brazilians begin with the letter ‘R’.” \nWhile discussing a potential heir to his former throne, Kaka has also discussed his international future. \nNow 34 years of age and turning out in MLS for Orlando City, the World Cup winner has not figured for his country since May 2016. \nNeymar certain Messi will re-sign \nKaka, who has 92 caps to his name, said: \"My relationship with the national team has always been good. \n\"Now, at my age, it'd be a mutual agreement if it were good for me and the team.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T18:49:59.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
