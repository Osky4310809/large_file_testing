Every single situation where we were supposed to switch or execute a certain thing defensively, we just went out to lunch. I don’t know what happened. We were playing such a good game mentally, but we just got shot. Offensively, there was one set that I recall out of the timeout that we couldn’t execute, and our brains were just where we started making mental mistake after mental mistake. That’s really what happened in the Spurs game. That’s what they force you to do. They’re going to keep doing what they do over and over again to chip at you and tinker at you to see if you’re going to break down. Both teams got us. We made mistakes that cost us late. -- Coach Fizdale On how they need to finish the road… Desperation. We’ve got to be desperate. There’s no other way to describe it. You go 0-for-3 on a road trip. You have a chance to be in the game late against the two best teams in the West. If you’re looking for moral victories, that’s a moral victory, but we’re not into that. We really need this next game, so we’re going to go in there and just give it a great, desperate effort. -- Coach Fizdale On what went wrong in tonight's game... There’s a lot of things, miscommunication basically, just communication on the offensive and defensive end. Me personally, a couple switches we didn’t switch on, that’s all part of communication. I’ve got to be better at that and within that you know, guys like Klay Thompson got open, Stephen Curry got open shots. They made shots more for every mistake that we made on the defensive end and I don’t know. Like I said, we had to be better communicating, it had been a tight one all the way down the stretch and that’s what we had on this half through fourth quarter. -- Tony allen On whether Marc Gasol's absence made a difference on the game… It ain’t no excuse for us to play. As far as his health, praying I hope he gets better, come back. Obviously we need him. As far as today, we had every opportunity to win that game and you could see there was a little out of whack today as far as what we had came with defensively but like I said, it bore down to a lot of communication and we got to get better at that every night. -- Tony Allen On the level of concern heading into the playoffs… Well as much as we want to find that consistency with winning, with the outcome being a win, I think that our level of play hasn’t been that. I think that we’ve shown a lot, we’ve competed in a lot of these games. We’ve had some tough opponents these last couple games so I feel like if we play with the same effort we played with tonight, we’re going to beat a lot of teams and the team we lost to tonight was better than us so they got the win. -- Mike Conley", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T10:02:43.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
