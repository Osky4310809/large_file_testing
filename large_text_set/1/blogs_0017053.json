But the Princeton University–educated, South Side Chicago–born lawyer was the first woman of color to occupy such a role of vast influence and impact. Seemingly without hesitation, Mrs. Obama enacted a tactic that cut across racial, class, and political lines: indisputable style. Whether she was wearing budget-friendly J.Crew or the more daring designs of Alexander McQueen, she used exuberant, progressive fashion to make multiple generations of Americans feel decidedly modern and part of a political system that for so long appeared far too insular. \nIn a pop of canary yellow or holding court in regal purple, there was a sense of optimism that combated, say, a tenuous economic recession. Intuitive to the customs and traditions of our international allies, the First Lady welcomed heads of state in inviting and thoughtful fashions: rose-gold chain-mail Atelier Versace to dine with the Italian Prime Minister; a red Alexander McQueen gown for the Chinese state dinner. To be sure Mrs. Obama’s look was consistent—but always surprising—she mixed in clothes by younger American designers with fashion-forward pieces that instantly became headline-making news. With such growing traction, FLOTUS used her position to bring awareness to the causes dear to her: women’s rights, child obesity, and military families. Michelle, as President Obama said just last week in his already historic farewell speech, took on a role “[she] didn’t ask for” but made it her own with grace and grit. \nIt’s perhaps why it’s difficult to see Michelle Obama leave the White House this Friday. Her tenure as First Lady, quite simply, was a game changer, upending the rules and rewriting them entirely. But luckily, her legacy remains a template we can all follow—from our wardrobes to the kind of political impact we’d like to make in the next four years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:00:30.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
