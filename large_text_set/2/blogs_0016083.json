Here are the six traits to look out for in a partner: 1. Flirtatiousness \nIt makes sense that someone who once enjoyed flirting might not like the fact that they’re expected not to do so when in a monogamous relationship. A lot of cheaters flirt with everyone, even when they’re with their partners. \nThey get a rush out of the exchange, and according to the experts, “this need for validation and feeling desired can eventually lead them to cheat on you.” Being friendly and charming is one thing, but flirting is another, so watch out. 2. Greed \nAlways thinking there's something - or someone - better round the corner is a problem often blamed on dating apps, but this could also be a sign that someone is likely to cheat on you. \nIf they think they might be able to “strike a better deal” for themselves with someone else, they’re more likely to be tempted to explore other options.

Self-absorption \nExperts believe that adulterers are often narcissists and the two tend to share many of the same qualities. \nIf your partner struggles to empathise and is always thinking about themselves, experts believe this may signal they’re more likely to have an affair because “the attention and admiration they will get from a new love interest will be more important than your feelings and needs.” Ouch. 4. Deception \nAs the saying goes: once a cheater, always a cheater. So if you’ve caught your other-half cheating on you before, you already know what type of person you’re dealing with. \nHowever experts believe lying says just as much about a person’s morals: “Not all liars are cheaters but cheaters are always liars.” So if your partner’s lied to you before, be on your guard. 5. Insecurity \nAmers and Levancuka say insecurity is a common trait amongst cheaters: “Unfortunately their need to feel loved and have their other half’s constant attention can be what leads them to cheat.” \nSo it’s actually because they’re worried about their partner leaving them and ending up alone that they feel the need to have a back-up plan. 6. Accusation This is how to work out if your partner is cheating on you \nIf you so much as look at someone else (let alone pay them a compliment), a cheater is likely to get paranoid because they’ll presume you have the same urge to cheat as they do. \nThe experts explain that a partner who is honest and reliable won’t doubt or accuse you because they don’t doubt themselves. \nLevancuka told The Mail Online : “Even though spotting the person who is more likely to cheat can be tricky, there are certain subtle traits that that set cheaters apart from loyal partners. \n“The sooner you can identify these traits, the sooner you can take steps to move on and protect yourself from getting hurt.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:15:42.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
