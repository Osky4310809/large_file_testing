Message sparks fear of incoming costs Facebook to START CHARGING users on Saturday? Message sparks fear of incoming costs A FACEBOOK message has been sent out warning users that they are about to be charged for using the popular service from this weekend. PUBLISHED: 21:06, Thu, Jan 5, 2017 | UPDATED: 21:36, Thu, Jan 5, 2017 GETTY Facebook users are being targeted by a fake message \nFacebook users have been left shocked today after a message appeared stating they'll soon be charged for using the service. \nThe message states that, from this Saturday, Facebook will become chargeable. \nFans of the service are then urged to send the note on to 10 of their contacts to prove they are an avid user and the charge will be waived. \nIt claims that once you've forward on the message to your friends, your Facebook logo, which is usually green, will turn blue and your messages will remain free. EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS The fake message claims users will be charged for Facebook \nHowever, if you receive the note don't panic as it's a simple hoax. \nHaving given advice on how to dodge such hoaxes, Facebook suggests users avoid interacting with posts that instruct you to forward things on, those which promise rewards or any which claim to be from Facebook itself. \n\"We always advise you to block the sender, disregard the message and delete it,\" the company said. \nFacebook has often had to remind users that the service will always remain free with a recent blog post stating: \"Facebook is a free site and will never require that you pay to continue using the site.\" \nFacebook users were targeted last year with another scam , where payday loans are taken out in their name – thanks to stolen details. \nBritish social network users had their accounts hacked, with crafty cybercriminals then posting on the Facebook users' timelines to trick their friends into revealing personal details. \nThese details – including mobile phone numbers volunteered by friends – have been used to take-out payday loans. \nNorthumbria Police highlighted the scam on their website, noting \"never pass any personal details online to strangers.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:14:53.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
