The Detroit-born rapper kicked things off way outside of his home turf, in New York City. Even though dedicated merchandise pop-up’s are currently the grassroots marketing pitch en vogue, it marks a first for Sean, who previously hasn’t thrown his gauntlet into the “fashion merch” ring like Kanye West, Travis Scott, Justin Bieber and Future.\nExpect to find the typical fare: themed t-shirts, hoodies, dad hats and bombers. You can also expect the typical range of slightly inflated prices – but it’s all about the memories, right? Signature dad hats are the least pricey offering at $30 a pop while the “I Decided” bomber will run you a cool $200.\nIn keeping with the theme of the album and the listening party Sean hosted last week in New York, the space features plenty of moody, neon lighting and buzzy phrases – like the giant neon sign that proclaims, “Take No L’s”.\n“Sean’s album was partly inspired by the idea of an old man who got a second chance of life,” explains his creative director, Mike Carson. “The space basically uses light and color to explore themes of life.”\nThe pop-up is hosted in partnership with Spotify and will make stops in L.A., Toronto, and Sean’s hometown, Detroit. As for the New York leg, you can buy all the I Decided hoodies you want through Sunday, February 5.\nBig Sean ‘I Decided’ Pop-Up \n127 Grand Street \nNew York, NY \nStream Big Sean’s entire I Decided project right here or below. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:43:45.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
