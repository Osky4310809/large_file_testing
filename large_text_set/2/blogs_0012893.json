During the inspection, agriculture specialists found that the women were carrying 42 pounds of horse and other ruminant meat, 13 pounds of horse genitals and three liters of yak milk — all hidden inside juice boxes.\nOne of the women claimed the genitals were needed for medicinal purposes.\nSEE ALSO \nHave you ever eaten any of these illegal foods? 0:0 Rich, velvety chocolate cake, deep-fried anything, a good cocktail —... Horsemeat is prohibited from entering the U.S. if it’s not accompanied by an official government horsemeat certification from the country it came from, according to the statement.\nHorsemeat from Mongolia, specifically, is forbidden on concerns of introducing diseases to U.S. livestock industries.\n“Customs and Border Protection takes no pleasure in seizing and destroying travelers’ food products,” Wayne Biondi, Customs and Border Patrol Port Director for the Area Port of Washington Dulles, said in the statement. “We’re in the business of protecting America’s agriculture industries, like the livestock industry, from the potential introduction of animal diseases posed by these unpermitted food products.”\nAll of the meat was incinerated.\nNeither woman faced criminal charges and both were released to continue their visit.\nThis isn’t the first time officials made odd discoveries inside travelers’ baggage at Washington Dulles, officials said in the statement. They’ve also found charred full monkeys, voodoo ceremony tools, cocaine concealed inside the cavity of fully-cooked chickens, live sea horses and giant African land snails.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:42:34.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
