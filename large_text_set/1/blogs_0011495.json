The info is streaming in fast. It’s a real pisser of a story. Nonetheless, the fact of the matter remains that Trump is set to be inaugurated in just nine days, and he’s yet to nail down even a C-list musician willing to perform. \nWhile Trump himself has promised “an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout for the inauguration, and there will be plenty of movie and entertainment stars,” his team is beginning to downplay expectations. Tom Barrack, who is heading up Trump’s inauguration committee, told Buzzfeed that they’re instead focusing on the “soft sensuality” and “poetic cadence” of the ceremony. \n“We’re fortunate in that we have the greatest celebrity in the world, which is the president-elect; side by side is the current president. … So what we’ve done instead of trying to surround him with what people consider A-listers is we are going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place. It’s a much more poetic cadence than having a circus-like celebration that’s a coronation.” \nNo word if said soft sensuality includes an exclusive screening of the video Trump made at Ritz Carlton Moscow.
