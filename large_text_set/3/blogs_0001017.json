The others were James' brother John and Simon Peter . \nWhen Jesus called the brothers, James and John were fishermen with their father Zebedee on the Sea of Galilee . They immediately left their father and their business to follow the young rabbi. James was probably the older of the two brothers because he is always mentioned first. \nThree times James, John, and Peter were invited by Jesus to witness events no one else saw: the raising of the daughter of Jairus from the dead ( Mark 5:37-47 ), the transfiguration ( Matthew 17:1-3 ), and Jesus' agony in the Garden of Gethsemane ( Matthew 26:36-37 ). \nBut James was not above making mistakes. When a Samaritan village rejected Jesus, he and John wanted to call down fire from heaven upon the place. This earned them the nickname \"Boanerges,\" or \"sons of thunder.\" The mother of James and John also overstepped her bounds, asking Jesus to grant her sons special positions in his kingdom. \nJames' zeal for Jesus resulted in his being the first of the 12 apostles to be martyred. He was killed with the sword on order of King Herod Agrippa I of Judea, about 44 A.D., in a general persecution of the early church . \nTwo other men named James appear in the New Testament : James, the son of Alphaeus , another apostle; and James, the brother of the Lord, a leader in the Jerusalem church and author of the book of James . Accomplishments of the Apostle James \nJames followed Jesus as one of the 12 disciples . He proclaimed the gospel after Jesus' resurrection and was martyred for his faith. James' Strengths \nJames was a loyal disciple of Jesus. He apparently had outstanding personal qualities that are not detailed in Scripture, because his character made him one of Jesus' favorites. James' Weaknesses \nWith his brother John, James could be rash and unthinking. He did not always apply the gospel to earthly matters. Life Lessons from the Apostle James \nFollowing Jesus Christ can lead to hardship and persecution, but the reward is eternal life with him in heaven. Hometown Referenced in the Bible \nThe Apostle James is mentioned in all four Gospels and his martyrdom is cited in Acts 12:2 . Occupation \nFisherman, disciple of Jesus Christ .
