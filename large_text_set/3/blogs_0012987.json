Mohammed disclosed this while presenting the appointment letters to the beneficiaries on Tuesday in Kano. He said the 66 beneficiaries were among the 765 youths recently employed by the Kano State Government to work under the state Internal Revenue Service (KIRS). “The effort to secure the employment for the constituents is part of my assignment as their representative at the State Assembly. “I will use all the necessary means to ensure that the people of my constituency also enjoy the dividend of democracy in the state”. he said. According to him, since his inception as a member representing Tarauni Constituency in 2015, he had secured employment for over 250 members of his constituency in government and private organisations. He called on the beneficiaries to make the best use of the opportunity by being honest while carrying out their assignments. Some of the beneficiaries commended Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje and the Legislature for their efforts towards reducing unemployment in the state. One of them, Idris Hudu , called on the lawmaker to continue with the initiative as a way of influencing other politicians to do likewise, especially in the area of education. “We want our politicians to focus more on the education of the youths because if we were not educated, we would not have been offered this employment”, he said. Another beneficiary, Malam Ibrahim Muhammed, said he graduated from University for over 10 years but was not able to secure a job until now. He promised to justify the confidence reposed in him by working hard to move the state forward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:32:23.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
