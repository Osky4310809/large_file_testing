Eventually, he decided to share his skills with the world, starting local workshops to teach other dads how to do the same. The movement exploded, garnering world-wide attention and prompting Morgese to start Daddy Daughter Hair Factory , which has now gone international with over 70+ libraries and community centers throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico hosting classes under the DDHF name. \nAlways humble, despite being dubbed “The Braidfather” by his fellow hairstyling instructors, Morgese is quick to point out that throughout everything he has accomplished, it all comes back to spending time with his daughter — “it’s about the bond, not the braid” — and challenging the negative way fathers are often portrayed. \nNow, Morgese is hosting what may be the most adorable hairstyling competition ever: fathers competing to transform their daughters into their favorite Disney princesses. \nThe only rules? Photos have to be taken by the contestants (no professional photographers allowed) and … have fun! Although the only prize is the admiration of, um, everyone … this year’s winner will get to pick next year’s contest. \nMorgese kicked off the competition by turning Emma into Princess Leia. (And I have to say, girl’s pulling it off in a way that I think would make Carrie proud.) Image Source: Philippe Morgese \nFor Morgese, the contest is a fun way to show his daughter “that she can be anything she wants to be.” And we hate to say it, but Emma’s got some serious competition from the other entries. Colin Gorman, 33, & Victoria, 3, as Moana | Nevada Image Source: Colin Gorman \n“We’ve been watching a bunch of Cinderella and Moana recently, and Victoria couldn’t decide between the two,” said Gorman. “I put some thought into it and felt like Moana was a perfect fit for her look. We did some overnight curls to match Moana’s beautiful wavy hair, added a little product to keep it managed and topped it off with a tropical flower.” \nAs a single father, Gorman confesses that he can be a little “goofy” and embarrassing at times, but that his heart is always in the right place. He works extra hard to teach his daughter life skills and the two work as a team on everything from hairstyles and fashion, to cooking dinner, cleaning, and even working on cars and motorcycles. \n“I work hard to encourage her beauty, yet equally as hard to show her that beauty also comes from within,” Gorman explained. “Intelligence, kindness, thoughtfulness, and forgiveness are all just as important as feeling beautiful.” Image Source: Colin Gorman Daniel Morrison, 43, & Alana, 6, as Cinderella | Central New Jersey Image Credit: Daniel Morrison \nAfter his daughter donned her first Ariel costume for Halloween when she was three, single father Daniel Morrison made a vow to always match costumes with her, even packing matching costumes when he surprised her with a Disney cruise in 2015. (He made his own Prince Charming suit.) \nThe creative dad, who is now a hair instructor with DDHF, welcomes the opportunity to give back and hopes to teach his daughter to look beyond external beauty. “Although beautiful on the outside, the Disney princesses also eloquently demonstrate compassion and internal beauty,” he noted.

She has shown me what it means to conquer life with a ‘brave spirit.'” \n“I am who’s supposed to be the one teaching her how to be brave,” Wickherst continued, “But she, at her young age, has actually taught ME.” Image Source: Greg Wickherst Jason Blackmon, 42, & Phoenyx, 7, as Belle | Brookshire, Texas Image Source: Jason Blackmon \nJason Blackmon, also a single dad, started doing Phoenyx’s hair a little over a year ago when she started school. “I saw all the little girls with their hair done by Mommy, and I didn’t want Phoenyx to feel like she was missing out because she lived with her dad,” he explained. \nBlackmon also added that he relates a lot to the Disney character Goofy — “He was a single dad and never really let the world get him down.” Image Source: Jason Blackmon Patrick Wittman, 28, & Sylvia, 5, as Belle | Rochester, New York Image Source: Patrick Wittman \nFull-time single dad Patrick Wittman calls getting involved with the Daddy Daughter Hair Factory “such a joy.” \nAfter his daughter underwent heart surgery at 15 months old on Valentine’s Day, due to an inlet ventricular septal heart defect, he became determined to do anything he could to help his little girl reach her full potential — and he admits he’ll do anything to make her smile, right down to standing on stools. \n“When Sylvia saw the scar on her chest from heart surgery and cried, I vowed from that day on to tell her and show her how beautiful she is from within,” said Wittman. “She has learned to see people from not who they are from the outside but from the inside and that scar will be a constant reminder of how strong and capable she is and will always be.” Image Source: Patrick Wittman Shawn Watson, 37, & Lilly, 8, as Cinderella | Clearwater, Kansas Image Source: Shawn Watson \nWhen he’s not moonlighting as a Fairy Godmother, single father Shawn Watson encourages his daughter to be curious, read books, and never be afraid to be herself. “I relate most to Maurice from Beauty and the Beast ,” he added. “Half of the time I feel like I’m bumbling my way through fatherhood, but I continue to do my best.” \nFor the record, we think you’re doing just fine, Shawn.
