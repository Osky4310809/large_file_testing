City Bark, which is pet-friendly, is opening in a storefront in the Albert at Capitol Park this weekend. The retailer will have 15 different types of dog and cat food, plus a freezer section to serve raw bones and pet treats. City Bark will partner with local businesses to host vaccination clinics, grooming services, training, and pet owner education classes. The store will also host adoption events on a regular basis. “Owning a pet should be convenient and enjoyable, and that’s what City Bark and our selection of pet products are meant to promote,” says City Bark owner Jamie Judson. “Our product line has been expanded for our new location, and our delivery service provides our customers with easy access to food and supplies for their pets, delivered directly to their home or office.” The Grand Opening Friday, February 24 at 11 a.m. will have beer from HopCat and treats for guests and pets. Pets who visit this weekend will get a free bandana. City Bark is located at 1214 Griswold. The Albert is a 127-unit, 12-story apartment complex renovated a few years ago and run by Broder & Sachse.
