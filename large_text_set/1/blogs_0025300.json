Spicer emphatically retweeted it.\nYou nailed it. Period! https://t.co/AUmS1C222b \n— Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) January 29, 2017 \n\nThe video goes on to call Spicer’s speaking style as “defensive” and gives him props for “nailing the pocket square” on his suit jacket. “Snowy white, quarter inch of clearance — you better believe he does.”\nhttp://www.theonion.com/video/5-things-know-about-sean-spicer-55139/v/5109 \nSo, is Spicer’s sense of humor even more twisted than The Onion, having a laugh at his own expense? Or is it just selective reading and he didn’t make it far enough down the sentence — to, you know, the punchline?\nHas Sean Spicer even heard of The Onion? Did he just admit to intentionally misinforming the country? Or is it, like any new job, something that just takes a little getting used to?\nNevertheless, this is the same guy who apparently tweeted out his password twice in two days .\nSean Spicer just tweeted something that looks an awful lot like a password https://t.co/puPaUA2lqF pic.twitter.com/nPrdtCYA9D \n— Gizmodo (@Gizmodo) January 26, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T06:06:18.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
