On Passover, Jews also celebrate the birth of the Jewish nation after being freed by God from captivity. Today, the Jewish people not only remember Passover as a historical event but also celebrate in a broader sense, their freedom as Jews. \nThe Hebrew word Pesach means \"to pass over.\" During Passover Jews take part in a meal known as the Seder , which incorporates the retelling of the story of Exodus and God's deliverance from bondage in Egypt. Each participant of the Passover Seder experiences in a personal way, a national celebration of freedom through God's intervention and deliverance. \nHag HaMatzah or the Feast of Unleavened Bread and Yom HaBikkurim or Firstfruits are both mentioned in Leviticus 23 as separate feasts. However, today Jews celebrate all three feasts as part of the eight-day Passover holiday. When Is Passover Observed? \nToday, Passover begins on day 15 of the Hebrew month of Nissan (March or April) and continues for eight days. Initially, Passover began at twilight on the fourteenth day of Nissan (Leviticus 23:5), and then the next day, day 15, the Feast of Unleavened Bread would begin and continue for seven days (Leviticus 23:6). See Bible Feasts Calendar for the actual dates of Passover. Passover Feast in the Bible \nThe story of Passover is recorded in the Old Testament book of Exodus . \nAfter being sold into slavery in Egypt, Joseph , son of Jacob , was sustained by God and greatly blessed. Eventually, he was put into a high position as second-in-command to Pharaoh. In time, Joseph moved his entire family to Egypt and protected them there. \nFour hundred years later, the Israelites had grown into a people numbering 2 million. So numerous were the Jews in Egypt that the new Pharaoh feared their power. To maintain control, he turned them into slaves, oppressing them with harsh labor and cruel treatment. \nOne day, through a man named Moses (great, great grandson of Jacob), God came to rescue his people. \nAt the time Moses was born, Pharaoh had ordered the death of all Hebrew males, but God spared Moses when his mother hid him in a basket along the banks of the Nile. Pharaoh's daughter found the baby and decided to raise him as her own. \nLater Moses fled to Midian after killing an Egyptian for cruelly beating one of his own people. There God appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush and said, \"I have seen the misery of my people. I have heard their cries, I care about their suffering, and I have come to rescue them. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people out of Egypt.\" (Exodus 3:7-10, paraphrased) \nAfter making excuses, Moses finally obeyed God and confronted Pharaoh. But Pharaoh refused to let the Israelites go. God sent ten plagues to persuade him. With the final plague, God promised to strike dead every first-born son in Egypt at midnight on the 15th day of the month of Nissan. \nThe Lord provided instructions to Moses so that his people would be spared. Each Hebrew family was to take a Passover lamb, slaughter it, and place some of the blood on the door frames of their homes. When the destroyer passed over Egypt, he would not enter the homes covered by the blood of the Passover lamb. \nThese and other instructions became part of a lasting ordinance from God for the observance of the Passover Feast, so that the generations to come would always remember God's great deliverance. \nAt midnight, the Lord struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, and that very night Pharaoh called Moses and said, \"Up! Leave my people. Go.\" They left in haste, and God led them toward the Red Sea. After a few days, Pharaoh changed his mind and sent his army in pursuit. When the Egyptian army reached them at the banks of the Red Sea, the Hebrew people were afraid and cried out to God. \nMoses answered, \"Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today.\" \nMoses stretched out his hand, and the sea parted , allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground, with a wall of water on either side. And when the Egyptian army followed, it was thrown into confusion. Moses then stretched out his hand over the sea again, and the entire army was swept away, leaving no survivors. Jesus Is the Fulfillment of the Passover \nIn Luke 22, Jesus shared the Passover meal with his apostles saying, \"I have been very eager to eat this Passover meal with you before my suffering begins. For I tell you now that I wonâ€™t eat this meal again until its meaning is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.\" (Luke 22:15-16, NLT, emphasis mine.) \nJesus is the fulfillment of the Passover. He is the Lamb of God , sacrificed to set us free from bondage to sin. (John 1:29; Psalm 22; Isaiah 53) The blood of Jesus covers and protects us, and his body was broken to free us from eternal death (1 Corinthians 5:7). \nIn the Jewish tradition, a hymn of praise known as the Hallel is sung during the Passover Seder. In it is Psalm 118:22, speaking of the Messiah: \"The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone.\" (NIV) One week before his death, Jesus said in Matthew 21:42 that he was the stone the builders rejected. \nGod commanded the Israelites to commemorate his great deliverance always through the Passover meal. Jesus Christ instructed his followers as well, to continually remember his sacrifice through The Lord's Supper or Communion. More Facts About Passover Jews drink four cups of wine at the Seder. The third cup is called the cup of redemption , the same cup of wine taken during the Last Supper . The bread of the Last Supper is the Afikomen of Passover or the middle Matzah which is pulled out and broken in two. Half is wrapped in white linen and hidden. The children search for the unleavened bread in the white linen, and whoever finds it brings it back to be redeemed for a price. The other half of the bread is eaten, ending the meal.
