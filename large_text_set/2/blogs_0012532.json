We can be more predictive and it allows us to create more experiences; a few are magical and feel like 'Oh, Twitter is showing me something I wasn't expecting and it's great.” \nWhile Twitter users have not been overly welcoming of algorithms and systems that might change their Twitter experience, the data shows that such measures are working – Twitter increased their daily active user rates by 8% over 2016 . \nUsing this, and their renewed focus on more live content, expect Twitter to keep showing you more video content it believes to be aligned to your interests in 2017. \nThis will also mean there’ll be more marketing opportunities tied into such efforts – we’ll keep you updated on such as their offerings evolve.
