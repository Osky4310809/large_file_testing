Cory McCartney @coryjmccartney FOX Sports South Mar 30, 2017 at 9:48p ET 0Shares \nATLANTA — Hitting coach Brian Seitzer rolled a ball down the first baseline, then another, and another. Meanwhile, Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman simply stood watching, noticing the way the ball moved along the dirt. \nIn the outfield, Ender Inciarte and Nick Markakis threw balls off the right-field wall, seeing how it played off the exposed brick. \nHow, exactly, SunTrust Park will play is a mystery. But the Braves took the initial steps in getting acclimated to their new digs Thursday during their first workout. Fun Fact: @DatDudeBP is now best friends with Mickey Mouse. #Braves pic.twitter.com/V4ojvpWwuy \n— FOX Sports: Braves (@FOXSportsBraves) March 30, 2017 \n“Coming out here and seeing the new SunTrust Park, this is a great landmark for Atlanta,” said newly acquired second baseman Brandon Phillips, who is a Stone Mountain product. “They really needed this. Turner Field, it was really nice also, but for them to move this stadium out there I see why everybody is bragging about it. It’s a beautiful thing.” \nThe team took in that scene the first time Wednesday night after arriving in Atlanta following their final Grapefruit League game. \n“(Wednesday) night was astonishing,” shortstop Dansby Swanson said. “The only lights that were on were the accent lights and the scoreboard. It lit it up in a different way. I didn’t want to even take pictures or videos or anything because it wouldn’t do it justice. Then today, it doesn’t really get any nicer, if we’re being honest. It’s pretty special.” \nThe Braves’ first real action at SunTrust Park comes Friday in an exhibition with the Yankees, while it will officially open April 14 against the Padres. \nIf Thursday’s batting practice was any indication, the new stadium figures to lean toward offenses. \nNick Markakis connected on the first home run of batting practice, a shot into the seats above the 375-foot mark in right field. But expectedly, Freddie Freeman and Matt Kemp provided the bigger blasts with the former planting one in the water feature in center field, while the latter sent one into the second deck in left field. \n“It’s baseball, and it’s a new stadium,” said manager Brian Snitker. “I don’t care how much money they’re making or how long they have been in the game — it’s a fun thing. We’re all little kids playing this game, so something like this is fun.” First #Braves BP homer at SunTrust belongs to Nick Markakis. Followed Freeman, Kemp and Flowers in cage. \n— Cory McCartney (@coryjmccartney) March 30, 2017 \nSwanson likened an infield he said played fast to a pool table, and as for that brick that adorns the right-field wall, Inciarte points to how crucial it will be for the center fielder and right fielder Markakis to be backing each other up. \n“If that ball bounces and nobody is backing up, it is going to be an inside-the-park (home run) for sure,” he said. \nThe spacious clubhouse drew rave reviews for its room and amenities, which include a pool table, sleeping areas and large weight room. \n“Everything in there you can think of,” Phillips said. “It’s like a kid in the candy store. I hope we don’t get real comfortable in the clubhouse and can keep our focus on the field.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:19:24.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
