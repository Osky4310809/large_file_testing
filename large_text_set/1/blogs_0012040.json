That question has stymied writers and filmmakers for years, because there's simply too much story to tell: about the rise of Colombia (and specifically Escobar's Medellín cartel) as a chief exporter of narcotics, about police corruption and political influence, about cocaine culture in Miami and around the United States, and about the drug war that continues to metastasize across the Mexican border and beyondThe narration wisely pauses for Escobar's introduction and yields the floor to the actor playing him, Wagner Moura, who was the lead in \"Elite Squad\" and \"Elite Squad: The Enemy Within,\" the high-impact (and highly controversial) crime films on which Mr. Padilha built his reputation. The scene has Escobar and his trucks, all brazenly packed with contraband, getting stopped by agents from the D.A.S., Colombia's intelligence agency. The authorities make it clear that they're well paid and incorruptible, unlike the poor cops in Medellín, but Mr. Moura plays Escobar as absolutely relaxed, to the point of near indifference. Escobar knows the officers' names, knows the names of their family members and knows they'll do the smart thing. Mr. Moura suggests a man who has thought through every aspect of the business and has the requisite lack of empathy to defend it. To him, human bodies are a matter for accounting.overall great acting Wagner and perfect direction the episode moved so fast in my opinion it was one of the best pilots... 23 of 25 people found this review helpful.
