Getty Images 3 Wembley season tickets are going on sale for the first time ever \nClub Wembley has launched the new Southview Season Ticket, which will offer seats for an average of nine matches a year including all England games, the EFL Cup Final and both FA Cup semi-finals. \nPrices start at £999 per season, with a matchday programme thrown in, but anyone buying the season ticket will still have to fork out more if they wanted to watch the FA Cup Final. Getty Images 3 The season ticket for Wembley promises a seat for all the biggest matches – except the FA Cup Final \nIt works out at an average of £111 per game, and food is not included in the offer. \nWembley officials claim they have provided the deal in response to calls from fans who wanted to watch all the high profile matches at the stadium. \nBut whether supporters will be happy that they don’t get a guaranteed seat at the biggest game of all remains to be seen.
