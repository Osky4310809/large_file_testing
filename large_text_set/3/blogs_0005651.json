I don’t know what it was, but I broke down uncontrollably after the game. \n“That was the weekend I did try to take my own life.” \nBut Tonga intervened and saved his friend’s life.

Source: News Corp Australia \nMaitua says he tries not to think about that night too often, but there’s one thing that still burns him. \n“That was a burden that I have to carry, putting my friend through that sort of thing,” Maitua said of Tonga. \n“Putting my family, friend and peers through that kind of thing. But how it effected Willie was what effected me the most. \n“I look back at it now and my job is to make sure that doesn’t happen to anyone else.” \nMaitua is happy to leave the past behind him and look to the future. \nHe’s started offering his services to rugby league clubs as a speaker or player adviser, hoping younger players can learn the mistakes he made. \nMaitua was axed by Canterbury in 2008 for his attitude towards training, then in 2009 was served a two-year ban from the NRL after testing positive to illicit drugs. \nIt was the Eels who threw him a lifeline when he returned in 2011, and he retired with 174 NRL games to his name.

I feel like I underachieved in my career,” Maitua told On The Couch With Sterlo . \n“I never got to put the Blues jersey on, I was only 18th man once and that’s something that every player wants to do, play the pinnacle of league and that’s Origin to me. \n“There’s things that I put my family through, and my friends and teammates, so I definitely have regrets in my life and career. \n“Not many people get the opportunity to play 170 odd first grade games and I’m grateful for that, but I know I could have done a lot better. \n“My job now is to pass on what I know about the game, pass on to players who might be going through the same thing and educate whoever I can on what could be that crossroad in your life.” \nIf you or someone you know is struggling with depression, support is available at the following numbers: \nLifeline 13 11 14 \nBeyondblue 1300 22 46 36  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T12:32:09.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
