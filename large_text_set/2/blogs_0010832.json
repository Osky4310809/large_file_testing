After warning us on social media over the past week or so, Adam Levin & Maroon 5 release their new single “Cold,” featuring ATL rapper Future. \nBringing the title to life, “Cold” is a catchy, midtempo break-up record that finds both Adam & Future addressing past woman who’ve been so “cold” to them. Highlighted by Adam’s melodic vocals & infectious production, don’t be surprised if “Cold” picks up serious momentum on the airwaves & clubs moving forward. \nLook for the single to be performed on Ellen tomorrow (Wednesday). Hit play and let us know what you think. \nQuotable Lyrics: \nNever thought that you were like thisI took the tag off and made you pricelessI just spent the half a mill' on a chandelierNow you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeahTrying to stay, and I leaveSaying that you need some time to breathThinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter wordBut the four letter word don't sleep \n- Future", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:06:48.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
