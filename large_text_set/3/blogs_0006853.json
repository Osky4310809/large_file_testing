Not only that, the TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer proved you could kick vampire ass and STILL have time to shop at the mall . Buffy’s journey as the Chosen One began 20 years ago , on March 10th, 1997, and lasted for seven seasons — all filled with that late ’90s/early aughts-style we’ve seen return as fashion trends today.\nBuffy was not only stylish, she was incredibly strong. The flip in roles was a major component of the Girl Power movement in the ’90s. A post shared by WhoElseButWizZ (@whoelsebutwizz) on Mar 2, 2017 at 1:27am PST \nThough we probably aren’t getting a Buffy reboot anytime soon , you can still have fun rewatching the series for the 400th time! Buffy was played Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is still a gorgeous badass IRL. Instead of skewering vamps, she spends her time skewering fruit for her two kids with hubby Freddie Prinze Jr . Our romantic ’90s hearts are melting.\nGetty Images / Stringer While the fictional small town Sunnydale was a little outside of Los Angeles, it didn’t mean that there was any lack of fashion sense. Throughout the duration of the show, Buffy’s look teetered between wholesome schoolgirl, sexy slayer, and business babe.\nA post shared by Dave (@davesc84) on Mar 8, 2017 at 1:00am PST \nThough fans may remember her wardrobe often bore neutrals, Buffy actually wore a variety of colors. From sweater sets and tanks to even the occasional sundress, The Slayer wore her fair share of pastels — especially green and lavender. While the original show used high-end brands like Prada, a lot of the same styles can be found secondhand in thrift stores or online.\n20th Television In honor of the show’s 20th anniversary, here is a look back at some iconic Buffy outfit pieces with tips on how you can recreate them for yourself! \nvia GIPHY \n1.
