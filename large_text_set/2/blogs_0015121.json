The bill, spearheaded by Democratic Assemblyman Ash Kalra , would compel the group to sell off shares in Dakota Access LLC and Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the company behind the 1,178-mile-long project. It would also have to sever relation with 11 other banks associated with DAPL. \nKalra said he was impressed by CalPERS’ stance – yet he still intends on pushing forward on legislation forcing the fund to purge its investments in the line. \n“As a significant investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline, it is important that California continues to take steps to respect the sovereign rights of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and raise awareness on the environmental impacts the Dakota Access Pipeline would have on its lands,” Kalra told reporters in a statement. \nDemocrats have targeted CalPERS’ fossil fuel investments in the past. Democratic Congressmen Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier, for instance, sent a letter to the fund’s CEO Anne Stausboll in March 2016 suggesting the pension fund’s decision to invest in Exxon Mobil is “morally suspect.” \nThe fund, meanwhile, maintains that staying involved in ETP gives CalPERS the ability to force projects like DAPL to change direction – the group’s staff argued Monday that there is “considerable evidence” that divesting is a fool’s errand, because it’s merely a transfer of ownership from one institution to another. \nOpposition to 1,172-mile-long pipeline ratcheted up recently after President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders in January approving the construction of the DAPL and Keystone XL. The Army Corps of Engineers, through the Obama administration, rejected the route Dakota was supposed to take across Lake Oahe. \nKalra’s legislation, and activists’ belligerency in general, may be all for naught, however, because the pipeline is nearing completion. In other words, it might be too late to back out now. \nETP expects the remaining feet of the 1,172-mile long line will be finished and put into operation by the end of June , meaning anti-DAPL hordes face long odds convincing any court to halt the long-delayed project. \nFollow Chris White on Facebook and Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
