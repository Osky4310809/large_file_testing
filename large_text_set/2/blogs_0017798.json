Taking cues from the cafe racer styling of the Thruxton R, the 2017 Triumph Street Cup retails for RM65,900, including GST. \nBased on the Bonneville-series 900 cc SOHC, eight-valve, parallel-twin engine, the Street Cup produces 54 hp at 5,900 rpm and 80 Nm of torque at 3,250 rpm. Fuelling is by multipoint EFI, and power gets to the ground via a five-speed gearbox. \nStyling for the Street Cup is very much based on the cafe racers that tore up the ring road outside of London in the sixties, with “Ace” bars and single-seat cowl. If you’re curious as to why they’re called Ace bars, the name is taken from the legendary Ace cafe, located on North Circular road just outside Wembley, where bikers have hung out since 1938, and street races would start and end. \nDesigned to be approachable and easy to ride, the Street Cup comes with a torque assist clutch system the lowers lever effort, and the ride-by-wire throttle ensure precise control and fuelling. ABS is standard, and liquid-cooling is now practically compulsory for Euro 4 compliance, despite how loud the purists might scream. \nSwitchable traction control is also standard, something of a rarity for most manufacturers in what might be considered the “beginner” area of a model range. Aiming to make ownership as fuss-free as possible, service intervals have been extended to 10,000 km. \nA nice touch is the underseat USB charger, which is, today, something of a necessity for everyone. The Street Cup has over 120 accessories available from the official Triumph catalogue, and we assume the after-market will not be far behind. \nThere are two colour options for the 2017 Triumph Street Cup – Racing Yellow/Silver Ice (pictured) and Jet Black/Silver Ice. Priced at RM65,900, including GST, but excluding road tax, registration and insurance, the Street Cup is now available at Triumph Malaysia’s Petaling Jaya showroom.
