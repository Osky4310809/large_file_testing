Over one million bank employees in India toiled relentlessly over eight weeks till December 31, 2016, to accomplish the herculean task of demonetising over Rs 15 lakh crore worth of currency notes.\nThe whole world watched in awe. In the chaos of the process, the bankers may not have fully appreciated the significance of their karmic reward. No other head of government anywhere in the world has ever launched a payment app or urged the general public to use electronic modes of payment.\nPM Modi has done for Indian banks what would have taken them more than a decade to do—made the common man and common merchant try digital payment methods. Even the most unlikely bank customers—roadside hawkers, drivers, labourers—have tried some form of digital payment: a card, a wallet, etc. Inducing trial is the holy grail of the digital world.\nAsk the e-commerce players who invest millions of dollars in the form of huge discounts and promotions to get customers to try them once, in the hope of getting the customer hooked after the first trial.\nE-commerce players have deep pockets of private equity to fund the losses arising through such trial induction. Banks have no such funding to create the powerful monetary incentive for their customers.\nIt helps to have the PM pitch in. Indian banks have been making steady but a very slow progress on digital adoption by customers. The common man was not really bothered with digital payments.\nA study by BCG in 2014 showed that only about 13 per cent of India’s banked population was using digital payments of any type. This was just about 23 per cent of the people with Internet access.\n‘Less cash’ banks can do with less staff in branches and will need smaller branches.\nBCG had predicted then that this number would go up only to 25 per cent by 2020, as a large number of people would start using the Internet, thanks to rapidly falling telecom and device costs.\nBut the banks were not able to convince customers to move banking online at the same pace. In the post demonetisation world, we predict that by 2020, the number of people using online banking could be anywhere in the 50-70 per cent range, depending upon how zealously banks build upon the disruption. There is a collective action problem. It is not enough if one bank’s customers adopt digital methods.\nGiven that most banks have less than 5 per cent market share in India, payments mostly go from one bank’s customer to another bank’s customer. If the receiving bank’s customer is not ready to receive payments digitally, cash will have to be taken out and handed over.\nSo the sending bank will not see the full benefit of its efforts. The disruption of demonetisation has forced all banks – large and small, public or private – to act. This is a unique advantage of this development.\nA step jump in systemic digital adoption by customers is a major bonanza for banks in four powerful ways: First, it entails an immediate revenue benefit. Notwithstanding the huge inflow of fresh deposits in the banks, customers who transact digitally keep higher balances in their CASA accounts. Most seasoned bankers know that CASA is the real and ultimate driver of bank profitability.\nSecond, cost reduction can accrue over a period of one or two years. Over 40 per cent of the banks’ establishment costs is related to cash. ‘Less cash’ banks can do with less staff in branches and will need smaller branches, less number of currency chests, less security paraphernalia, less number of ATMs, lower refills in ATMs, and so on.\nLeaner banks can share the benefits of cost reduction with their customers in the form of better rates. Third, the market expansion that could play out in the next two or three years.\nWe all know that there is a huge banking market at the bottom of the pyramid. This market has hitherto been unviable due to the costs of cash transactions. If these costs dramatically reduce as customers adopt digital means, we will have a huge viable market opening up for expansion for banks to tap.\nFourth, a slightly medium-term benefit but a game-changing one.\nAs customers do transactions digitally, they create a digital footprint. Banks can capture this data to do better marketing and risk assessment. Their cross-sell ratio, and hence profitability, can improve.\nOn the other hand, higher unsecured lending to retail customers and small businesses may be possible with better risk assessment. This opportunity—of structural shift in profitability—is too big to be squandered. Banks should persist in their efforts to create digital habits in their customers.\n(Saurabh Tripathi is the Senior Partner in BCG India)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T11:20:41.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
