It’s the second longest component of the ‘Triple Crown of Hiking’, and with most hikers covering 20 miles/day on the hike it takes a LONG time to traverse.\nPrior to embarking on the Pacific Crest Trail , most people will put their belongings into a storage unit and get rid of their apartments, or sublet their houses, because it takes the better part of a year for some to complete this hike. It appears as if this bro was looking to lifehack his return to society, and upon returning back to everyday life he dumped all of his belongings into a storage unit where he then lived while he got back on his feet.\nFrom what I’ve seen in this video, it looks like his storage unit is infinitely better than my first NYC apartment, and I think this bro might have a career in outfitting small/livable storage units for others. This is definitely a service people would get on board with.\n(h/t r/videos ) \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T14:50:27.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
