As defined, a crisis is “an unstable or crucial state of affairs,” and “the period of strain following the culmination of a period of business prosperity when forced liquidation occurs.”\nHints abound that the status quo is exhausted and the crisis of liquidation approaches. Indeed, it has already begun.\n“ macro dollar ” ( CC BY 2.0 ) by Cubosh Debt I don’t know whether you caught the story about the sale of the Galleria shopping mall at Pittsburgh Mills. The property was worth $190 million in 2005. It sold on January 18 to Wells Fargo in a foreclosure auction for $100. That is not $100 million or even $100,000.\nThat is $100. A single Ben Franklin.\nAccording to CBS Pittsburgh, the remaining balance on the mortgage was $143 million. Even with a Macy’s store taking up a lot of space, the mall was nearly half empty. So much for the vigorous recovery.\nThe Wall Street Journal in January reported the revised Education Department numbers now show the level of student loan paybacks is far worse than previously stated. No, they did not “lowball” the total owed — that has now hit $1.4 trillion.\nAn amended analysis showed that of more than 1,000 higher-learning institutions, half or more of the students failed to pay down even $1 over the last seven years. This not only speaks of a staggering problem of bad student loans, it also reflects the fallout from the end of growth.\nSimply put, growth in the U.S. and all the developed countries has dwindled to the vanishing point.\nWashington Whistleblower Exposes: Political Corruption at the Highest Level \nHe has been the secret man behind some of the biggest movements and most successful companies in America today. Now he’s back with his most controversial video presentation in decades. A video where he dares to expose political corruption at the highest level … Click here to see it now . \nThe end of growth, initially only a slowdown in the early 1970s, was patched over by the greatest explosion of credit in the history of the world. This amounted to a complete perversion of capitalism.\nAll the advanced countries followed our lead into a system in which central banks create unlimited money to subsidize activities that no longer pay their way.\nAmerica’s Debt Problem Over the past four decades, the economy has been propped up by ever-increasing emissions of debt.\nKarl Marx rightly derided this as “fictitious capital.” The mushrooming “fictitious capital” is both a cause and consequence of the end of growth.\nFor better perspective, roll back the clock to 1957, the year President Eisenhower started his second term in office. In those long-lost days, when America’s economy was unquestionably great, public and private debt amounted to about $5 trillion, or 186% of national income.\nIn Eisenhower’s time, a dollar of debt produced $0.54 of additional income. No longer. Debt has increased more than twice as fast as the growth of the economy.\nAnnual growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita over a decade dwindled to 0.5% in 2016 — just one-seventh the GDP per capita growth rate over 10-year periods from four decades ago. Real per capita GDP growth has fallen by 86% since those days. Over the years, households tried vainly to maintain living standards in the face of stagnant or falling income by borrowing vast amounts. That worked until it didn’t.\nGrowth is destined to fall into negative territory, as debt compounds to its unhappy limit.\nIf this is not obvious, it is because too many economists formulate their views of the economy without consideration of our position in the debt supercycle.\nIf you wonder what the debt supercycle is, let me explain. In simple terms, it is a consequence of the buildup of government intervention in the economy.\nYou see, the government lives by this theory that if it simply spends money when the economy is doing poorly, even if that money is borne of debt, things will improve.\nThe consequence?\nThese automatic stabilizers by the welfare state prevented (or perhaps merely postponed?) severe declines in activity while permitting a continued buildup of debt.\nAs debt increases over time, the ratio of added GDP to added debt deteriorates. In other words, the power (or what is known in econospeak as “marginal productivity”) of debt to act as a stimulus plunges.\nFor example, years ago, a dollar of debt may have led to 85 cents of real economic activity. But as more debt was piled on, a dollar of debt leads to less real economic activity.\nIn other words, debt loses its power to juice the economy.\nThe reason why this happens is easy enough to understand: As debt grows, it costs more to service. It hinders both the production and consumption side of the economy.\nAfter all, if more cash must be used to pay off principal and interest, then there’s less money for increasing production or hiring more workers.\nAs debt grows, output slows or declines. Hence, the drop in the marginal productivity of debt. We get more debt, but less economic activity for each dollar borrowed.\nThe result is stagnation as interest payments due on old debt overwhelm the income earned from the diminishing amount of growth stimulated by new debt.\nWelcome to Hyperdeflation As of December 31, 2015, total public and private debt in the United States hit $63.5 trillion (a conservative estimate) in an $18 trillion economy. There were 3 1/2 dollars of debt burdening each dollar’s worth of economic activity. If the average interest rate payable on the outstanding debt was only 2.5% (check your credit card statement for comparison), the nominal growth of the economy would have had to be 8.8% to prevent it from crumpling under the burden of escalating interest payments.\nIn fact, in dollar terms, the nominal growth of the U.S. economy in 2015 was just $439.2 billion — less than a third of the $1.587 trillion that would have been required to break even on interest payments.\nThis implies that the growth-stunted economy is under ever-greater pressure to contract.\nIn the decade since 2007, nominal economic growth in the U.S. averaged just 2.92%, implying a widening gap between the liquidity earned from economic growth and the compounding interest due on mushrooming debt.\nContrary to what most economists and investors suppose, ever-expanding debt is deflationary. We can’t just go merrily along spending ever-greater sums out of an empty pocket. The cost of even attempting that has been grossly underestimated.\nLook at the record. Growth has slowed from decade to decade as debt soared like the trail of a rocket headed into space. But the rocket is destined to fall back to earth.\nA New Opportunity Looking forward, the results to be expected are growing illiquidity and debt distress culminating in a corrective deflation that unwinds the debt supercycle. In other words, as I outline in my book, The Breaking Point , even with the lowest interest rates in 5,000 years, we face an “inevitable crisis.” That is a term coined by F.A. Hayek in the 1970s — about the time when American economic growth ceased to be “great.”\nIn a world that is past the point of no return in the debt supercycle, the conventional view would be to expect a\nThe post We Have A Debt Problem appeared first on ValueWalk .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:17:33.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
