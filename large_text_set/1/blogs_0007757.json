While Ryan Gosling was in the media room with his co-stars and cast, someone asked him and Emma Stone to discuss “the love fantasy the film presents.” #RyanGosling says he's \"had too much champagne to answer\" a question about love #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/W37MZl7kG8 \nIn the video above, you can see the actor and actress struggling to understand WTF the speaker is asking. The entire time, Emma Stone is literally thinking, “Can somebody strangle me???? PLZ????” Twitter Ryan Gosling also looks like he’s about to pass out. He’s definitely eight glasses deep at this point. Twitter \nAfter a brief pause, the actor leaned into the microphone and said, \nI’ve had too much champagne to answer that question. \nUH, CLEARLY. I recognize those glazed-over eyeballs. He looks like every man I made out with in college (except Ryan is a million times hotter and is prob still sober enough to remember my name). Also, lmao, look at this guy. Twitter \nAnyway, Ryan Gosling wasn’t drunk during the ENTIRE awards show. When he received the award for Best Actor, he delivered an emotional and touching acceptance speech and thanked his partner, Eva Mendes.

So, sweetheart, thank you. \nThis is so cute and everything but let’s just replace “my lady” and sweetheart” with “Katie.” \nHaha, that’s me. My name is Katie. \nLove you, Ryan. Thanks for always making me smile. HEHEHE. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
