But the world has changed! What started as a revolution in the 1960s which is when women starting wearing pants more regularly, is not even the least surprising anymore. In fact, every year, with changing fashion trends, we keep oscillating between a huge variety in our wardrobes. From so-called, â€˜skinnies' to the likes of boyfriend jeans, from the ripped to the embellished ones, we're literally wearing the pants now. \nCurrently, the leading ladies of Bollywood have been obsessed with what we would like to call, \"big girl pants\". There a number of things you can do in these, like strut like a Bollywood heroine. Give fashion advice that people WILL take seriously. Do hair flips. Hide a sword. Or a 12 inch sub. Not care about your hairy-leg situation. Trip, because let's be honest, there is a big possibility you might. But come on ladies; let's not forget about the good things we just mentioned. \nSo before any further ado, here they are ... the glorious (mostly high-waisted) pants from Bollywood. \n1. The take-me-seriously pants by Kangana Ranaut. \n2. The don't-show-your-ugly-feet pants by Amy Jackson. \n3. The Mithun-da-ki-fan pants by Deeika Padukone. \n4. The polka dots-are-so-fancy pants by Anushka Sharma. \n5. The stolen-from-dad's-closet pants by Sanya Malhotra. \n6. The giant's-pants by Kriti Sanon \n7. The I-am-black-so-I-work-with-everything pants by Kiara Advani \n8. The rich-girl pants by Jhanvi Kapoor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T17:40:04.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
