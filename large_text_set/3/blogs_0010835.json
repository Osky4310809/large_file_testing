Emma Watson (Photo: Rex Features) \n\"['Beauty and the Beast'] wasn't a movie I could just sort of step into. I knew I had horse training, I knew I had dancing, I knew I had three months of singing ahead of me and I knew I had to be in London to really do that. \n\"This wasn't a movie I could just kind of parachute into. I knew I had to do the work, and I had to be where I had to be. So, you know, scheduling conflict-wise, it just didn't work out.\" The stunning Elie Saab gown came with a detachable cape (Photo: Rex) \nHowever, Emma had nothing but praise for the movie. \nShe said: \"I'm so thrilled that musicals are so celebrated at the moment! They seem to be back in the zeitgeist and people are kind of celebrating and loving music and singing and dancing again. I thought ['La La Land'] was wonderful. It's lovely.\" Wearing an Oscar de La Renta jumpsuit and Burberry shoes (Photo: Splash) \nIt was previously claimed that the Harry Potter actress made a series of \"crazy demands\" and whilst producers \"jumped through hoops\" to give her what she wanted, she ultimately decided she wasn't right for the role. \nOne insider said: \"Watson was offered the lead female role, but she initially wouldn't commit. Then she began making all these crazy demands, like rehearsals for the film must be done in London - for a film called La La Land! \nThey jumped through hoops to make it work with her, but she just didn't feel the film was right for her. Producers finally cast Emma Stone - and once she was on board, Ryan Gosling jumped at the chance to work with her again.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T02:29:08.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
