Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports \nThe New England Patriots said all the right things after hearing Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin call them a bad word. \nBehind the scenes, however, it sounds like the Patriots aren’t happy about being called “a–holes” by Tomlin in a postgame locker room speech that Steelers receiver Antonio Brown broadcast on Facebook Live on Sunday night following Pittsburgh’s AFC divisional-round win over the Kansas City Chiefs. \nThe Patriots toed the company line in responding to the comment that was never meant for them to hear, but Bleacher Report’s Mike Freeman reached out to several Patriots players via text, and he shared some of those responses. \nOne Patriots player, according to Freeman, “responded within minutes” and had his own NSFW work response. \n“F— Mike Tomlin,” he reportedly said. \nAnd another: “Why are we a–holes when he’s doing the name-calling?” \nFreeman said he reached out to several players, and while unsurprisingly none of them lent their name to their comments, it’s clear the Patriots are getting added motivation for Sunday’s AFC Championship Game vs. the Steelers … as if a Super Bowl berth wasn’t enough motivation already. \n“Caught my attention, that’s for sure,” a player told Freeman. “I don’t think I’m alone. (The tape) will add some edge to our preparations.” \nAgain, Tomlin never meant for the Patriots to hear what he said, and in the grand scheme of professional sports trash talk, calling your next opponent that word just minutes after winning an emotional playoff game really isn’t a big deal. Furthermore, Freeman also indicated some players didn’t really care, and as we mentioned, it’s probably pretty hard to add much motivation when a trip to the sport’s biggest game is on the line. \nBut it’s another interesting wrinkle to what should be a fascinating game Sunday at Gillette Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T20:09:12.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
