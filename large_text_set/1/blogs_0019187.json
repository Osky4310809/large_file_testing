By Jeffrey Matulef Published 20/01/2017 \nPortal lead designer Kim Swift has joined Assassin's Creed executive producer Jade Raymond's new EA studio, Motive , as a design director. Visceral's Star Wars game was teased for a few second at E3 2016. \nSwift and Raymond will be collaborating with another EA studio, Visceral Games (Dead Space, Battlefield: Hardline), on the still unrevealed Star Wars game being directed by Uncharted creator Amy Hennig. \n\"We've devoted much of the past year at Motive to building a team of amazingly talented people to work on our new IP and Star Wars projects. I could not be more excited to welcome an all-star like Kim, who shares our enthusiasm for building exceptional games,\" Raymond said in the company's announcement. \nAside from Portal, Swift has worked on a variety of other games like Left 4 Dead 1 & 2, Quantum Conundrum, and Soul Fjord. \nLittle is known about Visceral's Star Wars game other than it's due in 2018, will likely feature multiple protagonists , and is apparently \"in the style of Uncharted\" , according to that series' star Nolan North.
