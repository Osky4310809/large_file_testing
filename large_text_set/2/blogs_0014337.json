Contrary to UFC lightweight champion Conor McGregor’s claim that a super fight between him the boxing icon is “very, very close” to happening, Mayweather candidly denied the rumors through an Instagram post. A post shared by Floyd Mayweather (@floydmayweather) on Feb 14, 2017 at 3:26pm PST \n“Although there has been several rumors circulating thru media suggesting that I will have an upcoming fight, I’d like to set that record straight and state that there has been no deals made on my behalf in regards to a bout with any fighter at this time,” the 39-year-old undefeated fighter wrote on on Tuesday (Wednesday in Manila). \nMayweather continued: “I am happily retired and enjoying my life! Rest assured that if any changes come about, I will be the first to let the world know!” \nShortly after Mayweather’s post, UFC president Dana White, as per ESPN, supported the sentiment confirming that: “No deal is even close to being done.” \nTalks of the of the potentially blockbuster fight ignited once more when McGregor arrived in Las Vegas to meet up with the Nevada State Athletic Commission. This was regarding the sanctions he received for his behavior in a recent UFC news conference. \nThe 28-year-old Irish man tweeted a photo of himself sitting on a throne, with the caption, “I am in Las Vegas. Floyd has retired on my arrival.” It’s a clear jest to Mayweather, who currently resides and trains in the city. \nI am in Las Vegas. Floyd has retired on my arrival. pic.twitter.com/z9EcxBJaDr \n— Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) February 15, 2017 Furthermore, both sides have gone back and forth in the headlines regarding a potential crossover fight for nearly a year now, prompting an online debate among fans and pundits as to who would win. Still, despite the seemingly endless teasing, neither parties have reached a mutual agreement regarding the specifics of the match. READ: McGregor says he’s going to break Mayweather’s face On the other hand, McGregor seems to be the more eager of the two to get the match done, even hinting that he’ll go through with it even without the UFC’s blessings. As expected, White was livid with the idea and promised dire consequences if McGregor chooses to go that way. “He came out and said, ‘I can do this without them.’ I guarantee you, he can’t do it without us,” the UFC executive told ESPN. “What I then said was, ‘I’ve always been respectful of Conor, the things he wants to do and everything else. If he wants to go down that road it will be an epic fall.'” White said. “Everybody knows exactly what that means.” Khristian Ibarrola/ JB RELATED STORIES:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T11:27:54.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
