After arriving at Atlanta Sunday, he was subject to additional screenings and detained, before eventually being allowed to re-enter the country.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that Tawfeeq has since filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security challenging the legality of Trump’s order. Tawfeeq’s lawyers argue in particular that applying the order to lawful residents violates both the U.S. constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n“The executive order has greatly increased the uncertainty involved in current and future international travel for returning lawful permanent residents like Mr. Tawfeeq,” the lawsuit argues. They note that Tawfeeq’s work with CNN requires that he regularly travels abroad.\nUPDATE (9:55 AM ET): In a statement to Mediaite, CNN stood by Tawfeeq and lent him their support. “This is a basic request to clarify and assert his rights under the law. We support him in this effort and hope its resolved quickly,” a CNN spokesperson said.\n[Image via screengrab]\n—\n>>Follow Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) on Twitter\n ", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/HashtagGriswold", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Ftv%2Fcnn-producer-files-lawsuit-against-trump-executive-order-after-being-detained-at-airport%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-05-at-1.51.10-PM.jpg&description=CNN%20Producer%20Files%20Lawsuit%20Against%20Trump%20Executive%20Order%20After%20Being%20Detained%20at%20Airport", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Ftv%2Fcnn-producer-files-lawsuit-against-trump-executive-order-after-being-detained-at-airport%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "http://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/cnn-producer-detained-atlanta-files-lawsuit-against-immigration-order/dWQqxhufKIuOi8W4nsUWdM/", "http://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2017-02-01T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T18:19:22.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
