(AP) More Tony Romo is in line to get his bonus for playing time in the 2016 season, and, well … it’s about enough for a decent steak and a glass of wine. But no side dishes. The NFL distributed $3,995,000 to each club for performance-related bonuses, to be distributed based on how many snaps each player played in 2016. The bonuses are also meant to offset larger contracts and reward players with smaller deals who outplayed expectations. Romo does not fall into either category; his contract neared $21 million in 2016, so he didn’t exactly line up for a significant performance-related deal. He went 3-for-4 with a touchdown in the Cowboys’ final regular-season game, totaling 0.47 percent of the team’s snaps. That entitled him to a check of $64.11, not even enough to buy a doggone copy of Madden ’17 in Texas. [ Fill out your NCAA tournament bracket here | Printable version ] Other notable bonuses included Reggie Bush ’s $14,615.83, earned even though he’s the only running back ever to finish with negative yardage with 10 or more carries in a season (minus-3 yards for all of 2016). At the other end of the spectrum from Bush and Romo was Dak Prescott , the dude who took Romo’s gig, and earned $354,544.57 for his efforts, the largest of any offensive player. The biggest check overall went to Atlanta cornerback Brian Poole , who pocketed $371,783.11. As tiny as Romo’s bonus was, it still wasn’t the smallest. That dubious honor belongs to Chad Henne , who got a princely $35.28 for the one snap he played for Jacksonville this year: a kneel down to end the half in a November loss to the Detroit Lions . Thirty-five bucks to take a knee? Folks, I think we’ve found a job in the NFL that would suit almost all of us. ____ Jay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports and the author of EARNHARDT NATION , on sale now at Amazon or wherever books are sold.
