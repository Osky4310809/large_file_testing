Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWho wouldn't want to stay in the Scottish Lowlands? In a quaint village near a forest? Where the Gulf Stream keeps the climate pleasant, and whisky and salmon are everywhere? \nIn The Open Book, an upstairs studio let in Wigtown, you can live this Scottish Dream for just £28 a night. Sounds too good to be true. \nAnd it is, in a way. Guests, while afforded the charm and tranquility of rural Scottish life for the same price as half a tank of petrol, are required to play bookkeeper. Yes, those who stay are tasked with running the bookshop downstairs. You can book a holiday for £28 a night (Photo: airbnb) \nThis won't be for everyone – but for those willing to recommend Harry Potter to visiting kids and ring through a few sales, a remarkably low-cost holiday is possible. \n“The first ever bookshop holiday/residency experience, Scotland’s National Book Town welcomes you to play-bookshop for a week or two. We’ll give you your very own bookshop, and apartment above, supported by a team of friendly volunteers and bookshop sellers to make your trip as lovely as possible,” The Open Book explains.\" Very charming (Photo: airbnb) \nThe idea is the work of the Wigtown Festival Company. It's about celebrating literature and encouraging education. \n\"The setting for many literary classics, beauty, history and adventure await you,\" chimes the description on Airbnb . It's not very taxing work (Photo: airbnb) \n\"Sea, ancient woodlands, crumbling castles, a whisky distillery, 7 Stains Cycle Trails, nature preserves, farms, the Southern Upland Way, Scotland's Art Town, Food Town and the home of Burns are just on your doorstep...\" \nIt does sound nice. Apparently, locals are inclined to invite guests round to dinner, too. Which helps. As do the pubs about the place, Galloway Forest Park, the nearby coast, and golf – no, nothing to do with Donald Trump . It all sounds very cosy. Wigtown is the literary capital of Scotland...sort of (Photo: airbnb) \nBut the main draw of Wigtown is books. The town is home to Scotland's second biggest second-hand bookshop, as well as many others, and is often compared to Hay-on-Wye in Wales, where the famous festival takes place. \nBut unlike its Welsh equivalent, Wigtown's status was planned – the proliferation of books came following the closure of its creamery and distillery, which were by far the main employers for locals. \nBooks have helped regenerate Wigtown. It's worth mentioning that a new distillery called Bladnoch has opened, though. Everything's fine. All bases are covered.
