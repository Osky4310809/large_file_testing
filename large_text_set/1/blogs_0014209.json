I mean, no seriously! Ahead of OK Jaanu that hit the screens today, I got the couple to play a candid relationship quiz EXCLUSIVELY on BollywoodLife – just to know what are their expectations from a relationship? When do they plan to get married? Do they ever want to have babies? And boy, while Shraddha was upfront on saying she loves babies, Aditya surprisingly quipped, “I hates babies” In fact, that’s not all. Even when I threw a question about romance or say getting pampered with gifts – Aditya took a step back to say how he would rather prefer useful gifts over memorable ones while Shraddha still stuck by her opinion on being all lovey dovey and wanting her partner to send her flowers, gifts every now and then.

Probably the only few things they agreed on was when I asked them about marriage as both of them were clueless about it and when I quizzed them about what’s their definition of sex. If you watch this video, you’ll exactly know what I am trying to say. \nFor the longest time there were rumours about Shraddha and Aditya’s link-up. But after watching this video, you would get a clearer picture if the couple was ever in love, still in love or are planning to get back together in the future. Nevertheless, if not off screen, Shraddha and Aditya are killing it as lovers in OK Jaanu right now. Have you watched the film?
