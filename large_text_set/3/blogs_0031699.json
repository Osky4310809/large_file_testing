Here is what it says so far about his death. \nIt is with extreme sadness Oak Island Tours Inc. confirms the passing of Drake Maxwell Tester, younger son of Craig Tester, best-friend and brother of Jack Begley. Known for his wonderful smile, infectious laugh and warm hugs, Drake will be missed by many family and friends. The Tester family appreciates everyone’s condolences and asks for privacy during this difficult period. \nAs of right now, the page is not sharing what happened to Craig Tester’s son, but everyone would love to know details. They did share a few pictures of the family. Drake Tester always seemed happy in the pictures with his dad Craig and like they were enjoying themselves. He was seen on the show Curse of Oak Island several times. If the show comes back again, they could end up sharing some about what happened.

The Inquisitr shared about how things are looking good for Season 5 of Curse of Oak Island , but so far it has not been confirmed. Producer Kevin Burns shared his thoughts on if the show will be back or not. \n“We are not set to come back for another year, take of that what you will. Every year the brothers are very reluctant to agree to do any more. This was always a hard sell for them. They did not approach us. They are not eager television personalities. I think they’re great on TV but they were very wary, which I understand. They were not big reality show people, they didn’t want celebrity, they didn’t want fame. They really didn’t. They’re very humble, particularly Rick. Four or five months a year away from their families and the conditions can be very gruelling, and Marty and Rick are wonderful guys….Do I think there’s more of the story to tell beyond this season? Yes. I think you could do 10 years on this show and you could find lots of things and lots of treasure, and I would still not be convinced that’s all there is to the story. I think Oak Island has many, many, many stories to tell.” \nAt this time, there is not very much information out about the passing of Craig Tester’s son. The fans would like to hear more information and are already sending well wishes and prayers to the family. Tributes has an obituary up that might be for him . It says that “Dake was born on July 17, 2000 and passed away on Sunday, March 26, 2017. Drake was a resident of Grand Rapids, Michigan at the time of his passing.” There is no information about what happened to him. It does sound like his death was unexpected, and the Tester family needs their privacy at this time. Drake will be missed by many. \nAre you shocked by the death of Craig Tester’s son from Curse of Oak Island ? Do you hope that Curse of Oak Island returns for another season?
