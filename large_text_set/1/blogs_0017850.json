On the show, Ellen asked Deepika about her rumoured romance with co-star Vin Diesel. The leggy lass replied, \"Well, there is no smoke without fire! But, it’s all in my head! So yeah, I mean in my head I think, we are together and we have this amazing chemistry, and we live together and we have these amazing babies! But it’s all in my head.\" The comment raised many eyebrows in India, given that Deepika is rumoured to be in a relationship with Ranveer Singh. When a popular daily asked Deepika for her reaction to the backlash she received for that comment, the actress said, \"I don’t take such talk seriously. I would rather talk about the experience of meeting an amazing and powerful woman like Ellen. For me, that was the exciting part! Meeting Ellen was a very enlightening moment for me rather than anything else.\" Interestingly, everyone had expected Deepika to deny the link-up and clarify. Instead, she made the controversial statement. On being probed further about it, Dippy elaborated, \"No regrets. I don’t have anything more to say about that. Fact is, I received tons of messages from people all over saying how much they have enjoyed the show. The morning after, I was flooded with compliments saying what a fun and candid show it was as people felt I was being myself and I sounded like myself.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T13:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T08:12:42.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
