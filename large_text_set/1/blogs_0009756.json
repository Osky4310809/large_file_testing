I do it. … I go through and shake hands and do what I have to do, and people like me and I like them. In Iowa, I must have shaken 2,000 hands — and those were only the ones that were next to me.\" \nWell, there you have it. Either he was lying then, or he was lying now. \nAnd we aren't the only ones calling BS on his excuse! Hollywood germaphobe Howie Mandel pissed all over Drumpf's defensive argument, telling a TMZ paparazzo: \n\"I don't know if that's a good excuse of why that didn't happen, because they say urine is very antibacterial. It's sterile. If you get something on you you're supposed to urinate on it. … It's urine, which is good for killing germs, and it's also a shower, which is important to every germaphobe. That's the golden rule.\" \nNice zinger, Howie! LOLz! \n[ Image via FayesVision/Dennis Van Tine/Future Image/ WENN . ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:44:54.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
