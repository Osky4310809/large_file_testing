Barcelona 1992 Was Her Rookie Olympics \nDominique Dawes qualified to her first Olympic team in ’92 at age 15. She wasn’t yet one of the stars of the team but was a solid competitor who earned high scores. Led by Shannon Miller and Kim Zmeskal, the U.S. team earned bronze. Dawes and teammate Betty Okino became the first African-American female gymnasts to win an Olympic medal. 3. She Gambled At The 1993 World Competition — And Lost \nIn 1993, Dawes was quickly becoming one of the best gymnasts in the world, and at the World Gymnastics Championships that year, she led the all-around field after three events. Knowing that she needed a very strong vault to win, she gambled on a new vault — a 1.5 twisting Yurchenko — and lost. She fell on her second attempt and ended up fourth overall. \nTeammate Miller took the all-around title, but Dawes served notice that she would be an all-around force in the coming years. Dawes also grabbed two silver medals in the event finals on bars and on beam. 4. She Had Another Agonizing Near-Miss One Year Later \nThe all-around at the 1994 worlds was again a heartbreak for Dawes. Just like in ’93, Dawes competed on the vault last, and once again, she fell on one of her attempts . She ended up fifth in the all-around and was further disappointed in the event finals, finishing fourth on bars and sixth on beam and floor. 5. But Also She Made History in 1994 \nAt the 1994 U.S. nationals, Dawes showed that she could, in fact, beat the top gymnast in the world. Dawes bested two-time world all-around champion Miller on every event and the all-around. Dawes brought home five gold medals from the competition and became the second woman after Joyce Tanac-Schroeder to complete a sweep of every event and the all-around at U.S. nationals. 6. She Was a Member of the Mag 7 \nDawes qualified to her second Olympic team by winning the Olympic Trials (with the absence of ’96 national champion Miller and ’95 national champion Dominique Moceanu). The team, nicknamed The Magnificent Seven , was heralded as the best U.S. Olympic team ever assembled, and the squad lived up to its name. The U.S. gymnasts became the first American women’s team to win Olympic gold. \nDawes had another disappointing all-around competition, however. She was leading the competition after two events when an uncharacteristic fall on floor knocked her out of the medals. Dawes came back strong in the individual event finals, winning a bronze on floor and placing fourth on bars. 7. And She Was Named to Three Olympic Teams \nDawes retired after the ’96 games but returned to compete in 2000 to try for an unlikely third Olympic team. After a seventh-place finish at the Olympic Trials, Dawes was named to the team. In Sydney, the team took fourth place, just out of the medals, but later was awarded the bronze when China was retroactively disqualified from the competition. 8. All the Kids' Names in Her Family Start With 'd' \nDawes was born on Nov. 20, 1976, in Silver Spring, Maryland, to Don and Loretta Dawes. She has an older sister, Danielle, and a younger brother, Don Jr. \nDawes began gymnastics at age 6 and trained her entire career with Kelli Hill at Hill’s Gymnastics. \nShe retired from the sport after the 2000 Olympics and graduated with a bachelor’s degree from the University of Maryland in 2002. Dawes served as president of the Women’s Sports Federation from 2004 until 2006 and was a commentator for Yahoo Sports at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. She also works as a motivational speaker and hosts clinics for young gymnasts throughout the United States.
