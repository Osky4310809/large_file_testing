Just look at these spy photos of the new Cadillac presidential limousine, dwarfing the Chevrolet Suburbans alongside during final tests of the big rig for the bigwigs in the White House. A Suburban is nearly 19 feet long, and the last one we tested weighed more than three tons, but these two look like ordinary hatchbacks next to the president’s new set of wheels. \n- The existing presidential limousine , known colloquially as the Beast, was used for Donald J. Trump’s inauguration earlier this year; it debuted for the inauguration of Barack Obama in 2009. Or, rather, “they” debuted. We know for sure that there’s more than one because they can appear at both ends of a presidential field trip aboard Air Force One, and we’re pretty sure it can’t outrun an airplane. The feds admit to having “about a dozen” of the limos in service. We can also assume it has an engine—a big, powerful one that can move several tons of armored fortress at high velocity. Does it burn gasoline? Diesel? Jet fuel? Is it supercharged? All classified information, sorry.\n- \n-We can see through the camouflage that where the first generation of the Beast, as it’s known, was designed to resemble Cadillac’s DTS and STS sedans of its era, the new one seems to draw inspiration more from today’s CT6 and Escalade, especially on the nose. It’s bulletproof, we’re sure, and may be armored up enough to withstand attack by grenade or rocket launcher. The U.S. Secret Service put out an invitation for bids for this replacement vehicle in 2014 and General Motors won the contract, one it has held for more than 30 years. Lincoln last provided the Town Car–based Presidential State Car (its official name) from 1989–1993, for George H.W. Bush. The last presidential limo that really resembled a production car was a Cadillac again, during the George W. Bush administration, when it looked a lot like a DeVille but was actually built on a General Motors SUV chassis.\n-The Beast 2.0 that now chugs toward Mar-a-Lago appears to be built on a medium-duty truck frame like its predecessor and may not be significantly larger. Interior seating is in a 2-3-2 configuration, and while updated communications and electronics abilities are to be expected, these cars aren’t really mobile offices—presidents rarely ride in them over long distances. We might also anticipate an adjustable suspension to raise the ride height, considering the embarrassment that ensued when the Beast got high-centered during a state visit to Dublin in 2011.\n- - Getting a Job Driving in the Presidential Motorcade - Own a 1988 Trump Series Cadillac Limo! - Research Cadillac: Reviews, Pricing, News, and More for Every Model - -We’re really just guessing, though, because the veil of secrecy surrounding the vehicle, in the name of national security, is nearly impenetrable. Even its cost fits into a wide estimate range that tops out at $1.5 million. Each. (The best estimate on the previous model was $300,000 to $1.5 million.) When Jerry Seinfeld went for a ride with Obama in the Beast for an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee , the former president told him it weighs 10 tons, but we can’t be sure that wasn’t one of his attempts to be a comedian. Perhaps the new president will tweet his own alternative facts about this new machine.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T16:32:25.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
