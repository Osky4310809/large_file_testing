That’s doubly true when it comes to meat. But put aside your prejudices for a moment and embrace this chicken’s unlikely hue. This recipe by Michelle Tam of Nom Nom Paleo isn’t just for people following the putative diet of our prehistoric ancestors. RECIPE: Fiona’s Green Chicken It’s just a straight-up roasted chicken smothered in a bright, tangy herb sauce, which gives it its Seussian color. The marinade—made with basil, cilantro, mint, and garlic—gets an umami hit from fish sauce and just a touch of sweetness from some apple juice. And if you’re still craving a taste of summer, skip the oven and take the chicken out to the grill, hitting it with some lime juice once it’s perfectly done. You’ll never look at green meat the same way again.
