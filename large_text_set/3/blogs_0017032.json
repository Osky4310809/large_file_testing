Of course, due to Very Reasonable Contractual Concerns, this is not the same conservative pundit Stephen Colbert from the Colbert Report . He has a different favorite sandwich! \n“Stephen” brings back The Wo—sorry, that was close. He brings back “The Werd” to skewer Trump’s budget and provide a suggestion for those who lack the “compassion” to take food away from the needy: Go to House.gov , find out how to call your Congressional Representatives, and tell them to exercise a more traditional brand of compassion when they craft the government’s actual budget. \nYou could be a regular Robin Hood—you know, that storied, heartless villain. \n(image via screengrab) \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
