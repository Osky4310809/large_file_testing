Romeo scored 13 points, had seven rebounds and eight assists in 35 minutes. ADVERTISEMENT \nStar started out slow and trailed after the first quarter. But once the Hotshots got going there was no stopping them as they joined idle Alaska and defending champion Rain or Shine in second spot, just a win behind the league-leading Meralco Bolts. \nMeanwhile, the Elasto Painters are tipped as the solid picks to win a third straight game when they clash with the depleted Blackwater Elite in the 4:30 p.m. contest on Sunday at Ynares Center in Antipolo. \nWith Shawn Taggart giving them a reliable presence underneath, the Painters look formidable as they try to successfully defend a title for the first time in franchise history. \nBlackwater, which will be without the injured sophomore big guard Art dela Cruz for the rest of the conference, is reeling from two straight defeats and would need to get a lot out of Greg Smith and rookie Mac Belo to try to thwart the Painters. \nIn the 6:45 p.m. game, title contender TNT KaTropa and Phoenix Petroleum slug it out with the Texters trying to bounce back from a conference-opening loss two nights ago. \nLou Amundson, the NBA veteran who is playing a pinch-hitter’s role for the Texters, will suit up for possibly his last game before relinquishing his spot to Donte Greene. \nThe Fuel Masters are set to welcome back prized rookie Matthew Wright ahead of schedule. Wright had surgery to remove bone spurs in his foot. —MUSONG R.
