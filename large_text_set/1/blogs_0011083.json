The airline has just completed a fleet-wide rollout of its free Fly-Fi, and the system operates gate-to-gate. That means that high-speed internet service is now available on all 227 of JetBlue’s aircraft (A320s, A321s and Embraer 190s), and passengers don’t have to wait until cruising altitude to log on; you can tweet, post and check email as soon as you push back. \nThis definitely adds to the carrier’s solid onboard offering, which includes free movies on all aircraft, 36 channels of free DirecTV on seat-back screens on all E190s and A320s, more than 100 channels of free DirecTV and on-demand video on A321s and more than 100 channels of SiriusXM Radio and access to The Hub (JetBlue’s entertainment portal) at all seats. \nAnd if passengers can’t find what they want, there’s always Amazon Prime. JetBlue’s partnership with Amazon supports free video streaming using Fly-Fi (and allows TrueBlue members to earn 3x points while shopping on Amazon.com both on the ground and in flight). \nAnd there are more upgrades to come. JetBlue has announced that its entire fleet of A320s will get new, larger touchscreens along with slimmer seats. \nFeatured image courtesy of JetBlue . \nWill you be taking advantage of gate-to-gate connectivity?
