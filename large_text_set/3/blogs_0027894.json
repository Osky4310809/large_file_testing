The 30-year-old has started 72 games in his career but just 10 in the previous three years combined. \nThe former fifth pick from the 2009 draft hasn’t found much success after leading the Jets to back-to-back AFC title games his first two years in the league. \nFor the first time 2008, the Bears won’t have Jay Cutler under center after releasing him earlier this month. Chicago also opted to let quarterbacks Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley walk in free agency after its 3-13 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T06:12:10.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
