If there's a live rocket ship launch on his runway , you can bet on a bunch of moon suits. Standout elements include sparkling tweed, glittering space boots with Coco's signature contrast toe, and playful little planet bags and backpacks to become must-have accessories . \nBut all space references aside, Karl did tone down the mood, offering little '60s-inspired minidresses, notable outerwear, and feather-finished red carpet gowns (these in a different category entirely than the chiffon astronaut dresses and sets, which double as memorabilia from the Fall 2017 season ). While there's a lot that can be expected from a classic Karl lineup — a neutral color palette, save for a few pops of red, indigo, and sapphire, strands of pearls, and feminine inspired tailoring — more men than ever walked the RTW show in luxe-looking sweaters we'd add to our closets too. \nAs you scroll through, don't miss the full sequined jumpsuits and biker pant and blazer pairings that belong on the Cara Delevingne, Rita Ora, and Lily-Rose Depps of the red carpet — the faces of the brand who know a true Chanel look is mastered only when it combines Karl's edge with Coco's elegance .
