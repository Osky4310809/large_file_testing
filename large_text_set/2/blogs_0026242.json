Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLeicester City take on Liverpool in a potentially do-or-die game at both ends of the Premier League this evening. \nAhead of the clash, we dug out our crystal ball to predict the eight things bound to happen during the game. \nBut we've got to admit - we didn't see this one happening. \nAs fans prepared for their first game without Claudio Ranieri in the dugout - the man who won them the Premier League title last season - a HEARSE paid a visit to the King Power Stadium. \nYep, that's right. This is what we've come to. \nDisplaying a large floral wreath spelling out \"RIP FOOTBALL\" in the window, the sombre protest was led by a funeral director wearing a half-and-half scarf and drove through the city before arriving at the ground. \nIt comes after Ranieri said his \"dream died\" when he was sacked following their 2-1 defeat to Sevilla in the Champions League last week. \nThe stunt was carried out by cheeky bookmakers Paddy Power - who reckon tonight's game \"very much feels like a wake\" - with some Leicester fans following behind the procession. \nIt's certainly one way to make your feelings known. We reckon some of those fans may be rebooking that very hearse for the club should they go down this season... poll loading Does Claudio Ranieri's sacking mark the death of football? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:15:22.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
