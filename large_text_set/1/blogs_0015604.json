In terms of action he is strong - I would like a player to come back to Man City and the fans to respect him but I'm not concerned. \nCity unlikely to sign in January - Pep \n\"Hopefully they can respect him. Everton have a lot influence on him but he will try and play as well as possible for Man City. \n\"I think when all former players come back they want to show how good they are. They don't have regrets or complaints, completely opposite.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:26:47.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
