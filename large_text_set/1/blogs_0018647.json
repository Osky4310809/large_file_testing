Fitness blogger Chinae Alexander just shared some cold, hard truth: Losing weight hurt her confidence . In fact, her whole fitness journey is sort of to blame. The difficulty with #fitspo and smoothie bowl porn is that it ignores a fundamental truth: That whole correlation between weight and healthy habits is kind of BS. It‚Äôs all well and good to track your progress ‚Äì who doesn‚Äôt love hitting a goal? ‚Äì but it‚Äôs dangerous when we focus on the numbers. In fact, research shows an inverse relationship between self-esteem and how often you weigh yourself .\nA photo posted by Chinae (@getfitbrooklyn) on Dec 29, 2016 at 1:01pm PST \nAlexander says that before losing weight, her confidence came from within ‚Äì but once she started her fitness journey, it was fueled by the positive feedback she got from others.\nIn an Instagram post from earlier this week, Alexander writes:\nA photo posted by Chinae (@getfitbrooklyn) on Jan 16, 2017 at 7:45am PST \n‚ÄúThe difference between this photos isn‚Äôt my level of happiness or contentment with myself. Or what measure of beauty I relate/d to (FYI I thought I was hot shit on the left) . It‚Äôs not my confidence. Or the affection I feel for myself. ‚ú®The ONLY thing different is a number of inches, some discipline, and time. ‚ú®If you don‚Äôt believe you are worthy of love at 225 lbs, you won‚Äôt grasp it 70lbs later. It won‚Äôt matter if you see your ideal body in the mirror, your confidence doesn‚Äôt come from smaller sized yoga pants‚Ä¶it has to be soul-deep. And it has to be foundational to be transformational. You don‚Äôt need to have rock solid abs, or free-flowing air between your thighs, or a marathon under your belt to find your value. It exists within you ALREADY, my dear. Dig deep and find it. ‚Äù Alexander makes SUCH an important point here. If you‚Äôre starting a fitness journey, you need to do it for the right reasons. If you don‚Äôt already love yourself, weight loss isn‚Äôt going to change that. There are so many benefits to exercise and eating well: better sleep patterns, more energy, glowing skin, stronger joints. Weight loss is just a side effect ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt happen for everyone, so you‚Äôd better be ready to get the most out of your healthy lifestyle either way.\nü§îI mean... I *hear* you saying muffin top like it's a BAD thing...but tbh I've never met a muffin I didn't like Consider this your \"Fuck Your Beauty Standards...Christmas Eve edition\" ‚ú® {sorry I said fuck on Christmas mom} #bebetter #fuckyourbeautystandards #oholythighs #jigglebells \nA photo posted by Chinae (@getfitbrooklyn) on Dec 24, 2016 at 3:17pm PST \nIf you‚Äôre working out and you‚Äôre not happy, take a leaf out of Alexander‚Äôs book. She writes : ‚ÄúI stopped obsessing over the number stitched on the tag of my pants. Or how I compared with everyone else, both on social media and in life. I put away the food scale. I let myself have that extra glass of wine. I spent more of my time helping others and less time thinking of myself. ‚Äù\nNow that sounds like a pretty great philosophy to us.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T01:51:13.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
