Photo: Liz Hafalia/The Chronicle \nThe Riddler , Hayes Valley’s new champagne bar, officially opens Sunday , Jan. 15. \nThe bar comes from first-time restaurateur Jen Pelka (Magnum PR) , and has a beverage menu with over 100 Champagnes. It’s also funded entirely by women. \n“We’re on schedule. All we’re doing now is the last minute stuff — final tastings and little, smaller tweaks on the space,” Pelka said. \nThe Riddler’s concept is one that skews from chic-hip (they’ll serve caviar) to playfully relaxed (your Miller High Life could come in a champagne bucket). Sparkling wines will also be available starting at $10. \nThe bar has very limited kitchen space so the food is going to be simple, but fun. Expect tater tot waffles, cheese, charcuterie, and desserts. Or just get the a food/drink hybrid order that comes with bumps of caviar and shots of champagne.
