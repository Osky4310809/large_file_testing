A roadmap revealed by Samsung Turkey suggested that this handset would receive Android 7.0 by mid-March and that has turned out to be true. Samsung has rolled out the Nougat update for the Galaxy Note 5 in several additional markets since then all of which have been listed below. \nIf you own a Galaxy Note 5 (SM-N920C) in the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Libya, Iraq, Israel, Iraq, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan you should have received the over-the-air update notification for Nougat. Samsung has rolled out firmware version N920CXXU3CQC7 for the Galaxy Note 5 in these countries. \nNot only does this firmware update bring everything that’s part and parcel of Android 7.0 Nougat but it also includes the latest security patch for the month of March. Those who haven’t received an over-the-air update notification on their handsets as yet can head over to our firmware section and download the relevant Nougat firmware files for the Galaxy Note 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T11:53:46.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
