Political events, wars, new music, new stuff to spend your money on — there’s more distractions than ever out there. That’s why, to save you time and energy, we’ve wrapped up the week’s best lookbook submissions in one handy space, so you can feast your eyes on them all in one.\nBelow you’ll find a selection of the week’s dopest lookbooks.\nSeason: Spring/Summer 2017\nKey Pieces: The embroidered dad cap emblazoned with flags and the color-block hoodie.\nEditor’s Notes: 10.Deep’s offshoot sportswear line VCTRY offers another familiar mix of sportswear staples including hoodies, sweatpants, and crew necks. Standouts included the pull-over rain parka and the punchy polo shirts.\nFind Out More Season: Fall/Winter 2017\nKey Pieces: The cotton canvas dungarees, orange crew neck, and the wide-leg denim are all wearable wardrobe staples with a real focus on simplicity rather than statement excess.\nEditor’s Notes: London-based label OTHO has already courted the likes of Opening Ceremony as stockists, and for Fall/Winter 2017, the fledging brand continues to refine its distinct take on workwear for the feminine form.\nWhile there’s plenty of pieces in rugged fabrics and strict silhouettes, it’s the playful elements that lend Otho’s collection a softer edge. Standout details include halter necklines on technical fabrics.\nFind Out More Season: Spring/Summer 2017\nKey Pieces: The zip-up track ensemble, off-white combat trousers, and logo hoodie are all staples pieces to co-opt into your spring wardrobe rotation.\nEditor’s Notes: Korean brand LIFUL returns with a gritty SS17 campaign, where industrial visuals contrast with more tranquil moments at sea. It serves as a solid lesson in how easy the brand’s pieces are to intermix in order to achieve superior spring style.\nFind Out More Season: NYC 2017 Lookbook\nKey Pieces: Every one of these unstructured caps featuring very subtle branding is easy to co-opt into your everyday arsenal.\nEditor’s Notes: Given that this underground Parisian label solely focuses on baseball caps, they’ve had the time to perfect an aesthetic formula and it’s quickly garnered a cult following. The blue wash denim cap that’s delicately embroidered with the brand’s logo is a real winner, though.\nFind Out More Season: Fall/Winter 2017\nKey Pieces: The mock-neck waffle knit in black, those neatly tailored sweatpants, and all of the minimal, tailored steez is seriously standout.\nEditor’s Notes: This Helsinki-based brand strikes the balance between casual comfort and sharp tailoring and the result is a robust collection of elevated staples.\nFind Out More Season: Fall/Winter 2017\nKey Pieces: It’s all in the details. Streetwear staples like sweatpants and hoodies are upgraded with distinctive detailing such as rope tassels and oversized pockets. The bulky outerwear is exactly what you want when winter is raging.\nEditor’s Notes: This London-based brand delivers a strong serving of conceptual streetwear, with a particular focus on statement basics. Everything is easy to wear but it’s the unexpected detailing like off-beat seam placements and proportion play that sets it apart. Thankfully, the brand’s expertly choreographed lookbook manages to shine a focus on those subtle finishings.\nFind Out More Season: Spring/Summer 2017\nKey Pieces: The black leather biker jacket paired with some rugged workwear pants, the red power suit, and that paint-splattered cropped jacket.\nEditor’s Notes: Italian brand Sunnei gets playful for its latest campaign, enlisting artsy photographer Andrea Artemisio to lens a group of “real people” wearing some of its latest pieces. The brand’s non-stylized, nonchalant approach to subverting the traditional campaign image is effective, to say the least.\nFind Out More Season: Spring/Summer 2017\nKey Pieces: Those wide-leg trousers in bubble-gum pink are delicious and the cut-out overalls featuring a playful version of the brand’s insignia is one for summer. As always, the brand’s affinity for killer graphic treatment remains on point.\nEditor’s Notes: South African menswear label 2BOP draws its visual inspo from a bygone era of arcade games and those vibrant references are all carefully distilled into a selection of very desirable, nostalgia-tinged wardrobe staples. The brand’s latest lookbook is a testament to their growth too, and they take a pared-back approach to spring/summer, reworking wide-leg trousers and overalls in easy, breezy linen and jersey.\nFind Out More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T11:04:41.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
