Instead, you are taken to an old building, made to lie down, your pants are pulled down, you close your eyes and feel something slicing you down there. You scream out, but are told that it's okay, this is normal. \nThat's Masooma Ranalvi's reality. \nFemale Genital Mutilation (FGM) or \"khatna\" as the Indian Bohri community refers to it, is one of India's best kept secrets. While most people do know that FGM is a harsh reality, not many can relate it to India, or to the bustling metropolitan cities of Mumbai and Delhi. But the fact is, it does exist and Masooma is out there to educate people and put an end to the practise. \nCircumcision for both male and female are a common practice in the Bohra community; the difference is that for a male child, circumcision is performed before the child turns one, and there are medical studies that prove that it is a good practice. For women on the other hand it is nothing but an age-old traditional practice, one that involved cutting the clitoris, usually at home with a sharp object. Most women who partake in this barbaric practice believe that despite not having any medical benefits, this process helps reduce sexual desire for women and prevents wives from straying from their husbands. Masoom's biggest job was to get people to realise that this was wrong. \n\"Young Bohra women continue to support the practice even though they may be ambiguous about the so-called benefits of the practice. Some elderly women call it \" haram ni boti \" which can lead young girls astray and say the process is needed to ensure they obey the wishes and commands of their husbands and don't lust for other men. FGM seems to be motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, linking procedures to premarital virginity and marital fidelity,\" she explains in her blog post . \nIn 2012, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling an end to female genital mutilation, and India was a part of this. However, the problem lies with the fact that this practice goes beyond fear of the law. People aren't afraid of the law here ( although a stricter law would really help ) \nHowever despite the fear and shame, Masooma has managed to get Bohri women to come out and talk about this publically, educating people about the harmful effects (it can lead to complications during childbirth, anaemia, the formation of cysts and abscesses, painful sexual intercourse and much more) and trying to educate religious leaders to end the barbaric practice. In 2015 Masooma started a movement called \"Speak Out on FGM\". The petition was signed by over 80,000 people and since then the group has become a rallying point for women who are willing to speak out, simply to put an end to this barbaric practise and stop it from getting carried to the next generation. \nFor a practice that thrives on religious beliefs, more than a law punishing the offenders (although that is also extremely necessarily), it necessary for a messiah like Masooma to tell people that it is okay to want change. The fact that she has raised her voice, has admitted that her own daughter wasn't subjected to this, is greater than any law. \"What happened to me years ago was an act of coercive violence without my consent, and I have chosen to speak out against it today and I sincerely hope others do so too,\" she signs off.
