What drove us to conduct the survey was curiosity about running and disordered eating and eating disorders. We felt anecdotally at least that this was a problem we’d seen among our runner friends and some of us had even experienced ourselves. Nearly 2,700 people completed the survey—1,940 women and 731 men. \nFor example, one question we asked was, “What are the reasons that you run?” \nThe No.1 reason among men and women was “to stay physically healthy,” followed by “to stay mentally healthy,” and “for fun and enjoyment.” \nThe fourth reason was “to manage or lose weight,” cited by 71 percent of our female respondents and 65 percent of men. \nOther ideas stood out from the survey: To the question: Have you ever run on a rest day or run hard on an easy day in order to burn more calories? 56 percent of women said yes, and 47 percent of men had done so. To the question: Have you ever increased your exercise beyond your normal routine specifically to burn off calories you consumed? 71 percent of women had done so, and 57 percent of men had. \nFollowing the survey, a group came together for an honest discussion on all of these topics and what people can do. Our roundtable was hosted by Executive Editor Tish Hamilton. \nPanelists for this roundtable include: Heather Mayer Irvine, Runner’s World food and nutrition editor; Hannah McGoldrick, Runner’s World social media editor; Rachele Shculist, a two time NCAA All-American runner at Michigan State University who recently shared her battles with food and weight while running competitively; and Rachel Presskreischer, a program associate from the National Eating Disorders Association . \nRELATED: What a Real Runner Looks Like?
