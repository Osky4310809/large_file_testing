Smith who made his Test debut against Pakistan six years ago at Lords back in July 2010 has amassed 4669 runs with an impressive average of 60.63. He has scored 17 Test centuries and holds the highest score of 215 which he scored opposite England at Lords.

He has also played 90 One-Day Internationals (ODIs) scoring 2880 runs at an average of 42.98 and 30 Twenty20 International (T20Is) scoring 431 runs with an average of 21.55. \nFull Cricket Scorecard: Pakistan vs Australia 3rd Test at Sydney \nThe third Test, Australia will be playing as the winning side as they have already won the previous two Tests i.e the first Test at Brisbane by 39 runs and the second at Melbourne by an innings and 18 runs. Australia will be looking for winning the Sydney Test and registering a comprehensive whitewash over Pakistan which should act as a confidence booster for Australia in the new year. Pakistan on the other end would be looking to win the final Test and gain some pride after already getting whitewashed at the hands of New Zealand in a two-match Tests series. \n(Rohan A.
