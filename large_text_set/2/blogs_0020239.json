I’ll always be grateful to this country. I don’t think I ever could give back as much as this country has given me,” she said.\n\"You want to share a spider?\" – Angelina Jolie cooks bugs in Cambodia 🕷 https://t.co/5mSi3VNErT pic.twitter.com/OZ12DjpyJD \n— BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) February 20, 2017 \n\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:38:36.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
