I’m just glad that it’s not my round Hell on earth? The Trout Inn, on the Thames at Wolvercote, near Oxford. Photograph: Peter Brown/Alamy     Close \nI wonder if the experimental psychology department at Oxford University is doing “Dry January”? \nOne assumes not, since they’ve just published a paper that shows regular pub visits make people happier and healthier. \nHmm. In my distant memory of Oxford University, regular pub visits certainly seemed to make the dons happier – I can’t speak as to healthier. I was amused to hear that these recent researchers conducted a rigorous “analysis of conversational behaviour in pubs”. \nI can believe that. \n“Ah, professor! What are you up to this afternoon?” \n“I am continuing my analysis of conversational behaviour in pubs, professor! I shall be hard at work until gone nightfall.” \n“Interesting work indeed, professor! Will you be analysing the conversational behaviour in the Kings Arms today or the Lamb & Flag?” \n“As a matter of fact, professor, I thought I might analyse the conversational behaviour in the Turf Tavern. I hear they have a new craft beer, which might inspire some interesting conversational behaviour for me to analyse.” \n“The Turf, professor? On a sunny day like this? Seems a shame. Wouldn’t it be more fruitful to analyse the conversational behaviour outdoors, by a river – say, the Trout at Wolvercote? I might join you for a quick spot of analysis myself. And a pickled egg.” \nI imply nothing about the noble anthropologists of Oxford University. All I’m saying is that my tutors, back in the day, were always conducting detailed, time-consuming research into pub habits – and they were in the English department. \nTo be fair, the scientists did not base their findings entirely on analysis of conversational behaviour in pubs. They also factored in a 2015 survey commissioned by the Campaign for Real Ale and “a questionnaire-based study of the clientele in a number of pubs”. \nSo: going to the pub; asking pub-goers to fill in a form; and Camra . Is it just me or was the result “You’re happier in the pub” a reasonably foregone conclusion? \nLook, I don’t want to sound bitter. Or lager. (Happy new year!) But I hate going to the pub. The suspicious timing of this paper, hitting academic journals on 28 December and the popular press in January, is perfect for undermining the one month when people try to do something else with their evenings. Something wholesome and healthy! Something productive and useful! Like playing poker! \nPeople really love the pub. I say people. I mean my husband. Nothing makes my husband happier than settling down in the corner of some reeky-carpeted local boozing house for a good old sit. Maybe a chat. And, obviously, a beer. A sit and a chat and a beer. Beer and a chat and a sit. Sit, chat, beer. Chat, sit, beer. Sit, sit, beer beer, chat chat chat, sit sit sit. \nSometimes no chat! Just a nice quiet beer. Nice quiet beer and a sit. A sit and a beer. A sit and a beer and a sit. Christ! As if we were immortal! \nBeer is revolting, I think we can all agree on that? Foul, sour, fizzy, fermented concoction; it tastes like the liquid that gathers at the bottom of a wheelie bin (or so I imagine). And yet, not only do people drink it, they drink pints of it! Vast quantities of this yeasty bin-juice; pints and jugs and tankards sloshing down into poor, stretched, windy stomachs. All night, people sit there. \n“Another?” \n“Go on! Stick one in there!” \n“My round!” \n“Your round!” \nUgh . \nAnd nothing else is happening! It’s a different matter if you’re having some lunch or playing a pub quiz; that makes sense. I’m happy if there are board games or a pool table. \nBut just sitting there, doing nothing , just slurping away at a beer and waiting for the occasional outbreak of chat: this is the pastime of choice for literally millions of people! \nNobody can possibly quibble with me if I point out that drinks parties are awful. Nobody likes those. Everyone stands there, self-conscious and embarrassed and shy, wondering what to do and what to say. \nAnd yet people claim to like the pub, which is exactly the same except you have to queue for your drinks one by one at a counter like it’s the Soviet Union, then sit on a hard chair at an upright table with the same three friends for hours. You can’t even mingle. You’re trapped. Trapped like a whale at a theme park. \nMy husband says I can’t enjoy pubs because my sense of “an awkward silence” kicks in before everyone else’s. \nSo, just when the old schoolfriends/work colleagues/grizzled surrounding fishermen are reaching happily for their pints, I’m nervously shouting: “Brexit! What do we all think?”, or “What would you rather be, a piglet or a bookshelf?”, or “Let me tell you about my first sexual experience!” in the teeth of baffled, sympathetic onlookers. \nPerhaps he’s right. That could be it. I just don’t see why anyone would voluntarily enter a situation where there’s so much pressure on conversation anyway. Nothing else to do, nowhere to hide. It’s not like I hate people or that I’ve never been lonely; I’d just go to casinos rather than pubs. Places of action, not contemplation. \nHaving said all that, I suppose I’ll be pleased if this academic paper tricks more people into using the pub. Pubs have faced an awful struggle, what with the recession and the smoking ban and cheap home-delivery alcohol; I don’t want them all to close down. They’re too established and historic; some of them too beautiful; and too nice on those days when you’re in there for a country lunch or a challenging quiz. \nAs for the daily grind of pub culture, I do want it to exist – I just don’t want to have to go myself. Now I come to think of it, I feel exactly the same about opera.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:18:44.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
