Sadly, the final episode of The Vampire Diaries is already being filmed , and the pictures from set are SO bittersweet.\nThis week marked the beginning of filming for the very last episode of the hit vampire series. Creator Julie Plec along with many of the cast members have been sharing photos from their final scenes, and we’re so sad.\nLuckily, fans don’t have to say farewell to The CW show until March — thank goodness — but the cast is already well on their way.\nIn happy news, Nina Dobrev is officially back in Mystic Falls, which is awesome. The bad news is that it’s the last episode ever for the vampires, werewolves, hybrids and humans.\nI know it's Thursday, but this is not a TBT. #BackOnSet #TVDForever \nA photo posted by Nina Dobrev (@ninadobrev) on Jan 26, 2017 at 9:19am PST \nThroughout this week, Plec has shared a few sentimental moments and we’re sure there are going to be even more coming our way.\n“Last first take of the series. #tvdforever,” the series creator wrote on her first goodbye picture on Thursday.\nLast first take of the series. #tvdforever \nA photo posted by julieplec (@julieplec) on Jan 25, 2017 at 8:19pm PST \nThe cast and crew then said their goodbyes to Damon’s house — on his bed of course!\nLast scene in Damon's bedroom. #TVDforever \nA photo posted by julieplec (@julieplec) on Jan 26, 2017 at 9:03am PST \nDamon himself, aka Ian Somerhalder, also shared a few photos from the Georgia set as he began his journey to the end of TVD with his TV brother, Paul Wesley, who plays Stefan.\nCount down to the end starts now... with these two guys \nA photo posted by iansomerhalder (@iansomerhalder) on Jan 23, 2017 at 9:26am PST \n“Caroline, Stefan & Damon on a warm winter day…” Somerhalder wrote on another cute picture.\nCaroline, Stefan & Damon on a warm winter day... \nA photo posted by iansomerhalder (@iansomerhalder) on Jan 24, 2017 at 11:13am PST \nSeriously, these are giving us all the feels. We can’t let go, we won’t let go…well, we will, but we won’t be happy about it.\nThe adorable Candice King, who plays Caroline Forbes, also gave a shout out to her TV house after they wrapped shooting there on Thursday. Again, this is all so sad.\nThat's a wrap on Caroline's house #tvdseason8 #tvdforever @julieplec \nA photo posted by Candice King (@craccola) on Jan 26, 2017 at 3:58pm PST \nWatch the final season of The Vampire Diaries on The CW every Friday to get your fix before it’s gone.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T03:34:26.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
