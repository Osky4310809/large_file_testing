But in the first week in office, President Trump issued an executive order to revive the project .\nTwo days later, TransCanada submitted its new application for approval Jan. 26.\nTrump’s State Department concluded the crude oil pipeline would “serve the national interest” and would benefit “foreign policy; energy security; environmental, cultural, and economic impact,” according to the department.\nThe 1,700-mile pipeline would carry 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta, Canada, to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast.\nEven with a presidential permit, the pipeline’s exact route is uncertain, as Native American tribes and landowners continue to oppose it in the courts.\nWith Post Wires \n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:05:36.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
