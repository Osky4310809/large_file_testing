Mick and Mairead Philpott dramatically broke down at a press conference after their children's death (Photo: PA / Channel 5) \nThe couple wept at an extraordinary press conference as they appealed for witnesses to the fire in the following days. \nIt was then that experts spotted clues that pointed to their guilt, a TV documentary reveals tonight. \nIn two-part series 'Faking It: Tears of a Crime', experts in body language, linguistics and psychology offer their insights into criminal behaviour by analysing the words and actions of four high-profile criminals and reveal the telltale signs. Read More Moment Ann Widdecombe thought child-killer Mick Philpott was going to attack her after she called him 'coward' Experts say the couple's crocodile tears gave away their guilt (Photo: PA / Channel 5) \nProfessor Dawn Archer, a specialist in linguistics at Manchester Metropolitan University, told the Derby Telegraph : \"We have to remember this was a public appeal which was understood to be taking place to try help find those responsible for the fire which killed six children and we would look to see if he behaves like we would expect. \n\"There are many channels of communication and we would look at a person's body language and facial expression and see if they are saying something different to the words they use. \n\"In the press conference, Philpott holds his sad expression and emotion too long and his sobs appear fake.\" The body language of Mick Philpott and wife Mairead betrayed their guilt, say professors who analysed footage (Photo: PA) Mick Philpott was found guilty of the manslaughter of his six children \nShe added: \"In most people, emotion comes and goes and, when someone says something positive, like when he said something good is going to come out of this in the case of the family donating Dwayne's organs, he holds the sad expression. \n\"Often, a person who is sad will drop their shoulders and hold themselves different and this will make their voice low â€“ but, in Philpott's case, he continues to be loud and vocal. Mairead is the same with her eyebrows held in a triangle shape looking sad throughout the whole conference, unless she puts her face to the table. \n\"Also, the only child he mentions by name is Dwayne and that is when he is talking about donating his organs, no other child is named but he does name neighbours who helped. This suggests psychological distancing and Philpott could be doing this because he is sad but also he could be doing it because he is guilty.\" The fire-scorched window of the house following the blaze in 2012 (Photo: Getty Images) The front room (Photo: CPS) \nProf. Archer features in the programme as The Listener - a specialist in linguistics who can detect manipulation. \nThe other experts are known as The Watcher, who reads micro-facial expressions and body language and can detect deception, and The Profiler, a psychologist who explains inexplicable human behaviour. \nA spokeswoman for the programme said: \"Unknowingly criminals offer clues to guilt and the experts decode the clues in the series. \n\"For example, the face has 43 muscles and is capable of 10,000 different expressions and if you learn to read the muscle movements and these conflict with the story the person is telling, you know they are lying. \n\"The muscles can't be suppressed and you can tell when someone is faking sadness. The pitch of the voice and the language they use/ or didn't use can also give the game away and be used to separate fact from fiction.\" Read More \nThe Philpotts conspired to burn down their home to frame Lisa Willis, Mick Philpott's live-in mistress, after she left the family home with her four children a few months before the fire. \nA custody hearing over the children was scheduled to take place on the morning of the fire. \nPhilpott hatched a plan with wife Mairead and Mosley to incriminate Willis while posing as a hero who saved his children.
