In video of the incident, an unknown person can be heard yelling “piece of shit” in the background. \nMoments after the yell is heard, the highly-criticized Twitter troll is struck with what was allegedly a piece of dog poop. #MartinShkreli getting what looked like dog poop thrown at his face after someone yelled \"You piece of s**t\" Vid by @Captain_Hooks @ABC10 pic.twitter.com/zYCiVhzNdb \n— Frances Wang (@ABC10Frances) January 14, 2017 \nShkreli has denied that any poop — dog or otherwise — was thrown, telling Mashable , “There was no poop thrown, unfortunately. This is what they call ‘fake news.’ There was something thrown — my security determined it to be leaves, which I brushed off. The lack of smell, stain or other obvious findings eliminates the possibility.” \nWhether the protester was upset with Shkreli over his decision to hike up the price of the HIV/AIDS drug Daraprim or was ticked off at his trolling of the Hip Hop community is unclear. \nAdditionally, Shkreli’s claims of ownership of Tha Carter V led to a feud with social media personality DJ Akademiks . \nIn a video addressed to Akademiks late last month, Shkreli offered a few choice words for the social media star. \n“While my temper is presently under control and I view you as a laughable social media persona, I assure you that further prodding will lead to serious and direct consequences,” Martin Shkreli said in a video uploaded to YouTube. \nThe two later settled things in an interview where Shkreli explained how he got his hands on the album.
