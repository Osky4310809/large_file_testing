But he has attended three separate events with Kenny - it's unprecedented that he'd give over a full day like that.\" \nYesterday, Mr Trump held a far more frosty meeting at the White House with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \nSeparately, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer reiterated the administration's intention to strengthen its ties with Ireland. \nMr Spicer also stressed how the White House \"looks forward to meeting with whoever the Irish people choose as his [Mr Kenny's] successor\". \nBut Mr Kenny is now suggesting he will not be dealing with the leadership issue when he returns from America and plans to cling to power for longer. \nMeanwhile, Mr Kenny last night suggested he would refuse to sign off on any Brexit deal that involved a return to a hard border with the North.
