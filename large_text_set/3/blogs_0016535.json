BJP’s decision to confer UP’s chief ministership on is a political experiment that could swing both ways. With the sobering responsibility of having to provide a clean and efficient administration that upholds law and order, it could serve to incorporate fringe elements – with whom the official BJP position has often been in tension in the past – into the mainstream. On the other hand it could mean a Hindutva lurch on the part of BJP itself, with radicalising effects across the country that would mobilise both Hindu and Muslim fundamentalism. The latter development could also lead other parties to gang up against BJP, forming a mahagathbandhan at the national level that would jeopardise BJP’s hold over the Centre.\nAt present, UP is one of India’s most underdeveloped states. Yogi Adityanath himself hails from eastern UP’s Gorakhpur, located in perhaps one of the poorest regions of the state. His administration must therefore place development front and centre and not let other issues distract it. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly invoked sabka saath, sabka vikas BJP president Amit Shah has stressed, rightly, that UP has the potential to propel India towards a double digit growth rate if governed properly.\nBut the state of UP’s economy is dire. Labour ministry data indicate as many as 148 among 1,000 young people are unemployed at present in the state (compared to the national average of 102 per 1,000). UP’s annual industrial growth is among the bottom five in the country. The agricultural sector, which accounts for more than half the state’s workforce, also desperately requires succour. Among other things, the government must prepare a long-term plan to revive UP’s ailing farm economy.\nHowever the 44-year-old Adityanath, the second youngest chief minister UP has ever had after his predecessor Akhilesh Yadav, has energy and youth on his side. He appeals to both upper and lower castes, and his new-look cabinet appears to have worked out the caste arithmetic well by accommodating upper castes, OBCs and Dalits. But Muslims, who have been the target of Adityanath’s ire before, are hugely under-represented. To put the economy back on track and ensure law and order, it’s imperative that UP’s new chief minister puts divisive issues aside. After SP’s misgovernance, he has both opportunity and potential to turn UP around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:25:01.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
