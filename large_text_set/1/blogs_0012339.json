She then stated Fabian had sex with (Victoria) while Jessica put her hand over (Victoria’s) mouth while she watched them,” the complaint said. The mother said Fabian then choked the child, and Kelley then stabbed the child in the torso and held out the girl’s arms while Fabian cut them off, the complaint alleged. \nWatch the police chief’s initial press conference here: \nWhen she was released from the hospital, Kelley yelled, “F*** you,” said KRQE . \nThe TV station said Kelley was injured by jumping off the balcony to escape the police.
