Kargil Martyr’s daughter Gurmehar Kaur is a student, let the debate be settled in the campus itself – everyone back off! Gurmehar's Facebook post, which has now gone viral, has been shared by thousands and has triggered extreme reactions. By: FE Online | Updated: February 27, 2017 12:15 PM She makes it clear that she is hitting out at ABVP and she is protesting strongly against the ”tyranny of fear.” Bravo! That’s the way to be. \nHaving lost her father Captain Mandeep Singh in the Kargil war when she was only two years old, Gurmehar stands up for what she believes is right and no, she’s not afraid of ABVP or anyone. At the age of six years, she tried to stab a burqa-clad woman whom she felt was responsible for her father’s death. Later her mother helped her understand that it is the war, not Pakistan, that killed her father. Gurmehar’s Facebook post, which has now gone viral, has been shared by thousands and has triggered extreme reactions. She makes it clear that she is hitting out at ABVP and she is protesting strongly against the ”tyranny of fear.” Bravo! That’s the way to be. \nNot just that, Gurmehar has asked students to join her by changing their profile pictures and hashtagging #StudentsAgainstABVP as a caption/message with it. Clearly, the fact that thousands of students are sharing her Facebook post points to one fact – there is no ”tyranny of fear” that prevents any student from expressing views freely. \nOnce upon a time, college students in the national capital took to holding a candlelight vigil to protest on issues that they felt strongly about. Those didn’t have a ”viral” effect though. Now with social media dominating daily conversations and creating news trends, angry students have more effective ways to protest on issues they feel strongly about. Changing one’s profile picture and using hashtags to send out a strong message is a sure way to way to grab eyeballs, create a virality to the post and make it trend on social networks. \nHere is her Facebook post: \nBut let us step aside for a moment from the student’s angry Facebook post and take a deep breath to figure this out. An angry student’s Facebook post isn’t a debate for everyone to jump into. \nReacting on social media rants do not necessarily pave the way for a balanced, constructive debate unless you are right there at the campus and you are aware of what’s really simmering beneath these statements and reactions that are pouring forth. So, here’s the thing, guys and girls – Gurmehar is a student, let the debate be settled in the campus itself – everyone back off!
