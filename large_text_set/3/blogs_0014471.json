He previously ran marketing for Target. \nRelated: Uber searching for a COO after crises \nJones headed Uber's ride-hailing operations, marketing and customer support, and was second in command to CEO Travis Kalanick. \nBut the task of telling a better story about the company's business has gotten more difficult in recent months. \nThe company, valued at $68 billion, has had a rocky few months. \nIn January, critics of the company began a #DeleteUber campaign after Uber turned off surge pricing at New York City airports. \nAt the time, taxi drivers were protesting President Trump's travel ban by calling for a stop to pickups at JFK, where two Iraqis were being detained. Uber's decision effectively lowered the cost of a ride on its service. \nRelated: Uber pushes back on Trump's order after #DeleteUber starts trending \nAnd in February, the company was hit with sexual harassment claims from a former engineer. In a lengthy blog post, the woman accused the company of systemic sexism that included being propositioned for sex. \nMarch also saw more controversy for the company. The New York Times reported that Uber had developed a tool that it used to deliberately deceive authorities in cities that had either banned the app or were trying to restrict its use. \nIn a letter to employees Sunday, CEO Travis Kalanick said that Jones made the decision after the company said it would hire a chief operating officer. Kalanick is looking for a new second in command that could help him steer the company's trajectory. \n\"Jeff came to the tough decision that he doesn't see his future at Uber,\" Kalanick wrote. \nJones did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nUber has already lost several big executives in recent weeks. \nUber's head of growth and product, Ed Baker, resigned from the company earlier this month. \nAnd Amit Singhal, its head of engineering, resigned in late February after Recode reported that he had left a previous job at Google because of sexual harassment claims.
