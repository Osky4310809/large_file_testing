As I said, you can't add an infinite number of terms together using traditional algebra/arithmetic. You can use limits to compute whether the sequence of partial sums of a series converges to a value, and we define the value of the series to be that value, if it exists. It isn't, however, truly a sum of an infinite number of terms in the traditional algebraic/arithmetic sense, as evidenced by the existence of the Riemann series theorem . – thrnio May 28 '16 at 2:25 Zeno's paradox. The motion is possible because we can cover (add up) infinite number of intervals (each half of the previous) in finite time. So you can reach infinity and add an infinite number of terms. – Andyk May 29 '16 at 19:52 2 @Andyk Zeno's paradox defends my point. In Zeno's paradox, the argument is that there is always further to go, so at no point will said person reach their destination, or even move at all, but we know that it is possible to move, so by reductio ad absurdum , one of our assumptions must be wrong. Since Zeno's paradox is based on our intuitions about the interaction between addition and infinity, our intuition must be wrong, which was exactly what I stated. – thrnio May 30 '16 at 2:14 up vote 19 down vote \nAs several others have pointed out, $\\infty$ is not a number. So you need to deal it with a bit of care. \nTo clarify your doubt, the way you have written is to look at $n \\times 0$ and then let $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. So it is true that $$\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left( n \\times 0 \\right)= 0$$ \nHowever, when people write $\\infty \\times 0$ usually it is a shorthand to denote the indeterminate form when some quantity tends to infinity and some other quantity tends to zero in a limiting sense i.e. expressions of the form $$\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\left( f(x) \\times g(x) \\right)$$ where $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x) = \\infty$ and $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} g(x) = 0$. \n(Note that $\\infty$ is not a number in the conventional sense. It is just a shorthand to denote that something grows unbounded i.e. given any number your function can take a value larger than that number.) \nFor instance, let $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ as $g(x) = x$, then $f(x) \\times g(x) = 1$, $\\forall x \\neq 0$ and hence $$\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\left( f(x) \\times g(x)\\right) = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} 1 = 1$$ However, $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x) = \\infty$ and $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} g(x) = 0$ and hence in this case, the indeterminate form evaluates to $1$. \nThe case which resembles what you have written down is when $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ and $g(x) = 0$. This again is an indeterminate form since $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x) = \\infty$ and $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} g(x) = 0$. However in this case, $f(x) \\times g(x) = 0$, $\\forall x \\neq 0$ and hence $$\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\left( f(x) \\times g(x) \\right) = 0$$ \nYet another example is to look at $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ and $g(x) = \\sqrt{x}$. This again is an indeterminate form since $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x) = \\infty$ and $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0^+} g(x) = 0$. Note that $f(x) \\times g(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}$, $\\forall x \\neq 0$ and hence $$\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0^+} (f(x) \\times g(x)) = \\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0^+} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} = \\infty$$ \nHence, you cannot associate a unique value to $\\infty \\times 0$. It depends on the problem at hand. You can read more about indeterminate form here .
