Red goes faster, right?” De Silvestro said. \n“It’s great to show off the Altima I will be racing this year, as well as announcing that Harvey Norman will be supporting me. Harvey Norman was with me at the last two Bathurst 1000’s, so it’s great to have them on-board again.” media_camera Simona de Silvestro’s Harvey Norman Nissan Supercar. \nHarvey Norman CEO Katie Page confirmed that the sponsorship deal is for all three years of De Silvestro’s current contract to race in Supercars. \n“Simona has raced Formula-E, IndyCars and has had a taste of driving Supercars as one half of the Harvey Norman Supergirls Wildcard team at Bathurst. We know she is seriously talented,” she said. \n“Harvey Norman seek out exceptional athletes — women who excel in their chosen sport; are driven to succeed; train both mentally and physically to be the best and make a contribution to their sporting community. On every measure, Simona is that athlete.” \n“I can’t wait to join 250,000 other fans and watch Simona race in the Supercars season opener next month at the Clipsal 500.” media_camera Simona de Silvestro with her Harvey Norman Nissan Supercar. \nThe car also carries backing from the South Australian government, as well as electronics consumer brands Lenovo and LG. \nNissan Motorsport is expected to reveal its remaining liveries for the 2017 for Michael Caruso, Rick Kelly and Todd Kelly in the weeks ahead of the Supercars test day at Sydney Motorsport Park on February 21. media_camera Simona de Silvestro’s Harvey Norman Nissan Supercar. media_camera Simona de Silvestro with her Harvey Norman Nissan Supercar. media_camera", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:23:53.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
