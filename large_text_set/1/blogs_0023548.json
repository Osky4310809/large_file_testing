I’d done all the interviews and checks, I did the medical exam and got the visa, but according to the last news I heard, it’s all over for us. \nI spent more than two years working on the paperwork, and this was after I spent more than three years working on the frontline with the US Army. \nTwo of my brothers were killed by terrorists because of my job. Iraq is too dangerous for people like us who worked with the US Army. I have people following us, watching my family, trying to get our address. My kids are 13, 9 and 6. It’s just not safe for them. One of my brothers, he also worked as an interpreter with the Army. \nWe filed our paperwork together and he moved to Seattle three years ago with his wife and three kids. Now they have Green Cards, but they can’t come see us here, and we can’t go there. We’re separated. I feel angry, disappointed, all the bad feelings. I trusted the Americans, I gave everything for them, and they let me down. The US Army has this thing they say, ‘we don’t leave anyone behind’ – but they left us.” Watch | Spicer: Trump's ban on Muslims is to 'protect' America 01:16 \nK inan Azmeh, Syrian musician who was allowed to legally immigrate to the US on account of his \"extraordinary\" abilities, and who recently toured with famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma \nAzmeh, a clarinet player who has called the US. home for 16 years, said Sunday he does not have a \"plan B\" if he is not allowed to return to his home in New York. \nAzmeh, who flew to China three weeks ago to perform with Ma, was caught in travel limbo after President Donald Trump issued an order last Friday to refuse entry to citizens of Syria and six other Muslim-majority nations, including travelers holding valid visas and residency permits. Credit: Youtube \nH e was granted a green card three years ago through an EB-1 visa, for applicants who can demonstrate \"extraordinary ability\" in science, business, or art. The 40-year-old is currently in Beirut on the last leg of his tour before he will attempt to return home later this week. He also performed with Ma in Denmark. \"I have my apartment. You know, 16 years is not a short time, you accumulate lots of stuff,\" he said. \n\"But what is not replaceable is all the friends who are incredibly supportive.\" Azmeh said he was \"positively surprised\" by the support shown by demonstrators at US airports. \"I am holding onto the optimist in me,\" he said. \nDler and Sahar Nader, an Iraqi Kurdish family of three. Dler worked with Coalition in Iraq and family is in Jordan, waiting for resettlement \n“I worked with the Coalition from February 2004 to November 2010. I worked with American companies and with the British Embassy in Baghdad. I was threatened several times by militias who saw me entering the Green Zone. After Sahar and I were married, I was working for the British as the supervisor of all the drivers. Someone from a militia told me, ‘Cut your diplomatic ties, or else’. I cut my ties and left Iraq. \nI filed paperwork with International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and with the US Special Immigrant Visa programme in 2010, and only eight weeks ago we were approved. We had so much hope, but now this Executive Order has taken all that hope away. Sahar is in a deep state of despair right now, and it’s harder still because she is pregnant. Life in Amman has been difficult, it’s very expensive here and I’m not legally allowed to work. But I’m here for my family. \nMy son Zahid is four. My wife and I decided not to tell him about our acceptance to America because we didn’t want to give him hope and then have him be disappointed. The most important thing for me was to not be a liar to him, to not misrepresent to my son. \nNow, to be honest, I regret the work I did with American companies in Iraq, because I thought I was doing good for them. But where we are now, the life we have, they’ve left us behind. I regret what I did for them. I’m so upset, deep inside, but at the same time I am the head of a household. I have to sacrifice for my family. So if they change the decision, even though it would be hard for me, I’d go for the sake of my family.” \nFiras Muqdad, a Syrian Sunni Muslim father of three; refugee living in Zarqa, Jordan \n“We had just finished the whole process, we were only waiting for our flight tickets. My wife’s whole family is in Houston, Texas. Four months ago my sister and her family went there too. They live near a lake, we talk to them every day. \nWe were going to join them there. It’s a very hard shock, this feeling, nothing can prepare you for it. I had dreamed of a life where I could use my law degree, instead of working as a barber. Where I could spend time with my children, three year-old Mohammad and our seven-month-old twins. \nOn Saturday when I told Mohammad there would be no America, he said to me, ‘No Dad, you are lying to me, you are trying to punish me’. I tried to tell him again, but he won’t hear me. He thinks he is being punished. \nOur family in Texas is upset that we’re not coming, but they are also afraid for themselves now. The worst part is, we were offered a place in Austria. A lot of my extended family took up the offer, and I wish now I had accepted it. \nI can’t believe this, America sending such a message of hate and racism, I didn’t think it was possible to get this message from America.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T15:03:56.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
