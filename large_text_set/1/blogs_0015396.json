The first, a powerful fable of the immemorial conflict between the individual and society, traces Okonkwo’s fall from grace with the tribal world. The second, as modern as the first is ancient, concerns the clash of cultures and the destruction of Okonkwo's world with the arrival of aggressive European missionaries. These perfectly harmonized twin dramas are informed by an awareness capable of encompassing at once the life of nature, human history, and the mysterious compulsions of the soul. Customer Reviews by jaylisap I am kind of suprised that most gave this book s lower rating. Though I found the first part of the book a bit dull. I found that it picks up pace in part two and three. I would recommend this book to those that appericiate African influenced literature as this is a superb read. Okonkwo by Venerator Growing up, Okonkwo was the character every kid wanted to be. It became synonymous with the identity of the igbo, strong and tough and willing to die for what we believe. Sadly, the political forces that curtailed Okonkwo's effectiveness still traps Igbos today! Combination of Aristotle's tragic hero and African culture by Katiekoolkatie Things fall apart is a masterpiece that works with ideas of human identity and post-colonialism and post-modernism. Beautiful in content and staying true to the African oral story it is full of plot but leaves the reader with valuable life lessons and ideas that come with parables. The book wins gold with its stunning use of Igbo words and completely changes the perception of Africa that western culture has retained since the publishing of Heart of Darkness. A must read.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T02:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T22:16:26.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
