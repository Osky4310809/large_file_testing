After all, it is one of the best places to travel this year , and a prime spot to catch the Southern Lights . \nIt’s also the most recent vacation destination for what might be one of our favorite travel trios yet: Reese Witherspoon , Mindy Kaling, and Oprah Winfrey . Ok, so it’s not really a vacation—they’re there to film their new movie “A Wrinkle in Time”—but it seems they’ve managed to find some time to explore the beautiful country. \nReese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling both announced this as their first trip to the New Zealand, as each actress posted Instagrams holding guidebooks with captions asking followers for recommendations. \nI am headed here for work and I could not be more excited. I even rewatched Lord of Rings as a primer. I usually play characters that work in American offices so this is big change! Plus so much stellar comedy from here. Any lovely Kiwis out there have recommendations for me? Your country is so beautiful and I am lucky to be able to go.#travel #newzealand #anIndianGirlinNZ \nA post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on Feb 9, 2017 at 10:46am PST \nI’m off to #NewZealand!!!
