After reaching the mid-40s Friday, highs are only expected in the 30s over the weekend, with lows in the teens and 20s. (Scott Dance) \nThat means the ground will be plenty cold when a large, intense system commonly known as a Nor'easter forms Monday, as meteorologists expect. The storm could bring ice and snow from Virginia to Maine over the first half of the week, likely passing over Maryland from late Monday through Tuesday. \nEarly forecasts from AccuWeather.com and the Weather Channel suggest Maryland will be on the icy side of the storm, but it's too early to make specific precipitation forecasts. \n\"Given the highly anomalous cold in place before the storm and potential phasing, this system bears close watching in the coming days,\" forecasters at the weather service's Baltimore/Washington office wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:29:41.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
