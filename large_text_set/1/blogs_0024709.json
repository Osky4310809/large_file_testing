You might think that there is nothing too strange in that given their predicament, until you realise that this is their ELEVENTH such change in two seasons! \nClub president Maurizio Zamparini is clearly not a man who likes to stand by his manager, and has made 60 changes over his 30 years as a club owners with various sides. Maurizio Zamparini: A man who likes to say \"you're fired\" more than Donald Trump \nAmazingly, he made EIGHT changes at Palermo last season alone. \nThey started with Beppe Iachini, who was replaced by Davide Ballardini in November. In January, Ballardini got the chop and was replaced by Fabio Viviani - who had been working in the club’s analytics department - and who came in as caretaker. \nViviani's first game saw Palermo thrashed 4-0 by Genoa… so he was instantly replaced by Giovanni Tedesco, who lasted three weeks and was replaced by Giovanni Bosi. Bosi took charge of one match, before Iachini was brought back to the club. Giuseppe Iachini, who must be a glutton for punishment as he came back (Photo: Tullio M. Puglia) Eugenio Corini is the latest to be sacked (Photo: Maurizio Lagana) \nThen in March, Iachini and Zamparini had a public bust-up which saw Iachini resign and Walter Novellino come in, and then out again. \nHe was replaced by Ballardini again, who lasted until the start of this season, before he was replaced by Roberto De Zerbi in September. De Zerbi got the bullet in November to be replaced by Eugenio Corini, who has now been replaced by Lopez, formerly the boss at Cagliari and Bologna. Wouldn't it be easier just to sack the players? (Photo: Tullio M. Puglia) \nGot all that? \nGood luck Diego, you're going to need it.
