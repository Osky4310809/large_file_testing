It makes you realize just how much you rely on Google products for your smartphone activity, especially the Play Store . The good news is that it's a super easy problem to fix. Let us show you how to fix this Google Play authentication error in three easy steps. Plus, we've added some of our readers' best suggestions . How to disable auto-install of Google Play apps 1. Simply remove your Google account \nThe error may simply be a sign-in issue, which sometimes occurs when the Play Store is updated. The first trick is to go into your phone's main Settings menu and then Accounts and simply remove the Google account you have registered (the one that's getting the \"authentication is required\" message). Once you've done this, you can re-add the account and it should work just fine. However, you may need to do this step along with the second step below.

Clear data from the Google Play Store \nTo clear data from the Play Store, you need to go into Settings and then Applications and find the Google Play Store. Tap it and than select Clear data.

Uninstall Play Store updates \nSometimes the problem is not with your credentials but the Play Store itself. Go to the Play Store in Settings > Applications and hit Uninstall updates . This will take you back to the original version of the Play Store that was installed on your device. Then, all you need to do to fix the error is install the latest version of the Google Play Store and sign in once again.
