That is exactly what I want in someone that I work with.”\nThe 36-year-old actress then joked, “I guess there is no competition between us — we’re not generally up for the same roles, so we can kind of keep that separate.”\nFROM COINAGE: The Cost of Beauty & the Beast’s Wedding Registry \n\nBell recalled the first time the couple fought: during a cross-country road trip on a motorcycle during their first year of dating.\n“We were fighting about the first year of our relationship because it’s a power struggle, and we were fighting about the playlist, and I got so mad at him at one point that I refused to hold onto him,” she said. “So I was on the back and just held onto the because I didn’t want to touch him.”\nRELATED VIDEO: Why Kristen Bell And Dax Shepard Attend Couples Therapy \n\nThe parents of daughters Delta , 2, and Lincoln , 3½, have been candid in the past about how they have made marriage work. \n“I said to Kristen, ‘We should try hard to police ourselves about becoming contemptuous of each other,’ ” Shepard said in 2015 . “If I ever see you roll your eyes at me, we need to hit pause and figure out what’s going on.’ ”\nAdded Bell, “I don’t mind advertising a healthy marriage . I’m trying, just like everyone else.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:44:44.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
