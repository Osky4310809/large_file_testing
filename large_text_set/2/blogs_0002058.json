Welsh listeners to BBC Radio 1 and 2 should hear news bulletins about Wales at certain times of the day, according to the assembly's culture committee. \nCommittee chairwoman Bethan Jenkins said it would \"better reflect Welsh life\" and AMs were pleased it was being considered by the corporation. \nThe committee also calls for Â£30m to be spent each year on BBC English-language drama and broadcasting about Wales. \nThe BBC said plans for more spending would be announced \"in due course\". \nThe broadcaster has previously conceded aspects of Welsh life had not been \"sufficiently captured\" by its TV services in Wales. \nDuring its inquiry into the state of the broadcast media industry in Wales, BBC Director General Lord Hall told the Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee that putting Wales-based news bulletins on Radio 1 and 2 was being discussed as part of a review.
