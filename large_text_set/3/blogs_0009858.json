Lincoln were a class act all the way through their amazing run to the FA Cup quarter-finals and a memorable clash at the Emirates The Sun 6 Lincoln City’s cup run brought in a lot of cash \nImps staff asked stunned Arsenal officials for a Hoover — they were given a brush — so they could get rid of all the mud on the floor. \nKeep up to date with ALL the FA Cup news \nThey also collected all their bottles into a corner. \nBoss Danny Cowley , 38, said: “We always clean the dressing room wherever we go. \n“We conceded at Braintree last season — a terrible goal in a pivotal game for us — and ended up drawing 1-1 but we still swept up. \n“The All Blacks call it ‘sweep the decks’. If it’s good enough for the All Blacks, it’s good enough for us. \n“We always make sure we clean up and leave the changing room as we found it.” \nCowley has proved to be an impressive character as well as a decent coach. \nYou get the impression that along with younger brother Nicky, 35, this is not the last time he will lead a side out in a big game.

It’s about the fourth time we’ve been 90 minutes away and keep coming up short. \n“This wonderful football club has never been to Wembley and you saw those supporters. \n“I did them a disservice in the week because I said they were Premier League but they’re world class.
