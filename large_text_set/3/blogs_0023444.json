This same organization runs the Satanic Temple in Washington state. \nJudicial Watch said in a statement: \nWhile the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) makes conservative groups wait years for tax-exempt status an “After School Satan Club” launched to hinder Christian-based counterparts got its nonprofit ranking in just ten days. The classification is offered to charitable, religious and educational organizations that operate as nonprofits. Under the Obama administration, IRS political appointees illegally targeted conservative groups, either making them wait up to seven years for tax-exempt status or denying their application altogether.” \nReason Alliance’s “After School Satan Club” was launched as a counter effort to an after-school program for Christians called the Good News Club. \nReason told The Washington Post last year, “If Good News Clubs would operate in churches rather than public schools, that need would disappear. But our point is that if you let one religion into the public schools, you have to let others, otherwise, it’s an establishment of religion. We’ve moved well beyond being a simple political ploy and into being a very sincere movement that seeks to separate religion from superstition.” \nBy starting a club for something you characterize as a red-horned devil with a spiked tail and pitch fork? That superstition? \nUnbelievable, yet, not surprising in the least in Obama’s America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T10:14:19.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
