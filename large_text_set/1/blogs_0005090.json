Hope everyone had as awesome of a holiday season as this couple from our Arizona Chapter, ChiveOnAZ ! 2 \nJohn and the crew have just stumbled back into the office from an amazing celebration in Key West with a fresh outlook on 2017 (full gallery coming shortly). \nThere is a lot in store for the greatest community on the planet this year (as John mentioned last week ), but before we dive into all of the positive antics Chive Nation has in store for the world this year, I thought it’d be a good idea to take a look back at what our Chive Chapters around the country did to close out 2016. 3 \nTis the Season for RAKs \nThe holiday season was very busy for chapters across the country, planting RAKs like Kevin McCallister planted traps for the wet bandits. Chive On Seattle had their Festival of Trees Toy Drive benefiting Toys for Tots and collected an abundance of toys along with $235 for the family of Officer Reginald “Jake” Gutierrez who was killed in the line of duty. 4 \nThe Charlotte chapter doubled dipped during their holiday party, holding but a Secret Santa event for chapter members while gathering stuffed animal donations for Levine’s Children’s Hospital. While partying with a purpose, the chapter brought in 90 stuffed animals for the hospital. One of our most steady, amazing chapters! 5 \nRAKmas 2016 \nIn a multi-state effort, five chapters (Chive Wisconsin, Chive Indiana, Michigan Chive, Cincinnati Chive, Chive on Chicago) put together a coordinated-Christmas-RAKing, adopting five families to buy gifts for. Included in the five families was Colton and the Darst family , a Chive Charities recipient! \nWith the evolution of Chive Nation, this is what we love to see – chapters coming together for massive efforts that make the country 10% happier. Fantastic job, all.

With the chapter’s help, the recruits were treated to meals, games and access to phones so they could face time with their families on Christmas Day. \nFrom our Chicago Admins:“ We want to thank our Philanthropic Team of Jeremy & Liz Forney for setting everything up, Cory Groom, Sam Goldburg, Dan Escobar, Tom Salata, Jessica Marie, Adolfo Garcia, Pearl Gannon (and Scarlett) and our newest member to CoC, Randall James. You guys made each recruit feel a little closer to home and feel the Holiday Spirit.” \nWay to go Chive On Chicago! 7 \nChive New England took part in the Hartford Santa Con. 175 crawl participants raised $2,500 for Chive Charities through ticket sales and donations at the door. 8 9 \nChive Minnesota Shows that Sharing is Caring \nChive Minnesota hosted their third annual clothing drive last month, benefiting Sharing and Caring Hands. The venue for the drive, Jersey’s Bar and Grill, hosted the chapter, generously offering discounts for anyone who donated. By the end of the day, the chapter collected over 500 bags and boxes of clothing for the shelter. 10 \nGreensboro Does One for the Dogs \nAfter Barry Seagraves of the East Spencer Police Department reached out to the Greensboro Chapter for assistance in starting up a K-9 unit, Chive Nation mobilized statewide to see it through. Admins and members from other chapters in North Carolina descended on Greensboro for a family-friendly (and service dog-friendly) bowling event! The police department even brought one of their K9s to demonstrate how they train.
