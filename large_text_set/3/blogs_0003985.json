When you check out all the files on your PC, you'll find more than just zipped documents and PDFs. There's a whole array of .gifs and .jpgs too — and most of them are memes. Old, lame memes, for the most part.\nSEE ALSO: The CIA is interested in hacking your car, WikiLeaks claims\nHere's a quick look at some of the memes that came along with the dump. You'll see they include everything from Boromir's \"One does not simply...\" warning to a pipe-smoking baby.\nThese memes are kind of lame.\nImage: Desktop screenshot\nThe leak sadly does not contain a reason why the CIA would want an enormous database of memes, but it can be assumed that the agency might have used them to translate all the civilian internetspeak that flew over their heads or even for interagency use. Many of the memes deal with cybersecurity and technological surveillance.\nThe memes probably hit about a two on the dankness scale, if we're being generous. The Philoceraptor seen below is an old classic, sure — but we'd expect some more profound philosophical struggles from the intelligence agency looking to hack our cars and TVs .\nCome on, guys. You're better than this.\nImage: The cia I guess?\nThere were some .gifs included too, most notably the one below of former President Obama. Let's hope his vacations are at least as fun as this looks.\nImage: um the Cia\nOne of the sections of the leak contained what was purported to be an entire directory of the \"Faces of the Internet,\" a guide of \"ALL THE FACES\" (the wording itself an old meme). Whichever operative took that task came up a bit short, though — the cache only included a list of \"Japanese style faces,\" aka kaomoji .\nImage: wikileaks/screenshot\nThat said, everything in the leak wasn't completely terrible. There was one Very Good meme in the bunch, seen below.\n12/10, very handy with that chain saw.\nImage: the one good cia meme\nWhile the revelations from Year Zero are sure to cause some major questions to be raised about our privacy and cyber security, there might be some good to come out of it: the CIA might be shamed into using better memes.\nWATCH: These tattoos conduct electricity, turning you into a very basic cyborg", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/n1J6i6ZWLqFGY4Oo1yEVrlBVGdc=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405922%2F696caaca-5873-43a9-b456-57447cca9dc9.gif", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/mwpryGKB.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tY77Tq6Wzb2ZzNOXUCaRgk3gxoE=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405926%2Ffbf8b717-6e57-4584-b911-158c1e9dfcf1.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Oc06No_zticMxFLyX0fnE1SxjK8=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405943%2F4e8de156-9d0d-4f2e-9abd-7984bb0da6c9.png", "http://japaneseemoticons.me/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jJxa_UCgxH4IRqklixw52BVRMZQ=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405943%2F4e8de156-9d0d-4f2e-9abd-7984bb0da6c9.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DC3daLFVRFsI6I6Etmv2ieXcPzU=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405955%2Fd1e116fb-1df1-463d-b2b0-52edd0d89da2.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kgwWygeMZ1DRtdvB55iG4-ODrCM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F406027%2Fddd33bbf-61e8-4062-9f7b-c7bc05b019e5.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dxAMgkkugRPiIrZPLtSBHz5muAc=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405955%2Fd1e116fb-1df1-463d-b2b0-52edd0d89da2.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gqusYJnSdVNdhdxlGO5iKSKNhtA=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F406027%2Fddd33bbf-61e8-4062-9f7b-c7bc05b019e5.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fUoPpiOC4prAfgQqynkQsn0kYYo=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405926%2Ffbf8b717-6e57-4584-b911-158c1e9dfcf1.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/mwpryGKB.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fOVGE_2OAdKjpJT-wzQbhUQ-jVU=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405922%2F696caaca-5873-43a9-b456-57447cca9dc9.gif"], "published": "2017-03-08T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:48:26.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
