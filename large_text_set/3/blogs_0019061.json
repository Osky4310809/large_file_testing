Watching her episode of Bates Motel in front of fans on Instagram live, as meta as ever, she cringed at the sight of past Rihanna playing Marion Crane on the A&E series, recoiling especially during her sex scene. The show serves as a prequel to the iconic Alfred Hitchcock thriller Psycho , and Rihanna’s character is the woman who is infamously stabbed in the shower in the original film. Check out Rihanna watching Rihanna below.\n\nIn addition to her killer acting career, including the hyped Ocean’s Eight all-female spinoff she’ll be starring in next summer, she released the most underrated album of 2016, ANTI (in case you’ve been living under a rock) and some of the most coveted sneakers and streetwear via her successful ongoing collaboration with Puma – FENTY PUMA . Hopefully with a second non-voyeuristic watch she’ll be able to fully immerse herself in her own acting genius.\nRevisit the NSFW “Needed Me“ below.\n\nIn other music news, check out our chat with Brooklyn DJ/producer Sango about his upcoming album ‘In The Comfort Of’ right here . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:59:21.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
