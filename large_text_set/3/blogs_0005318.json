The world is getting smaller — instead of choosing a mate from the pool of our college classmates or neighborhood friends, we’re now connected to everyone on the planet with a few taps of the thumb. \nThis means that dating apps rarely run short of people to serve up, which means that we’re playing a game of optimization. Folks looking for something serious rarely declare that on their profile, while folks looking for a hot night rarely explicitly state that. Profiles are, instead, an optimized version of ourselves, equipped with the photos and information that are most likely to receive the highest volume of inbound engagement. \nThis leads to a lot of swipes, a lot of matches, a lot of messages, and a lot of time spent talking to people that you probably won’t have a true connection with. There is no system in place to filter down people you are both physically attracted to and intellectually inspired by. \nThat’s where Sapio comes in. \nOn a surface level, Sapio looks a lot like Tinder. After signing up with the relevant information about yourself and what you’re looking for, Sapio serves up other users nearby with a photo-focused profile. Like Tinder, you can swipe right if you like someone and left if you’d rather pass. You can also expand the profile to read a little bit about the person. \nAlongside information like age and location, the profile also includes three questions that have been answered by that user. However, the answers aren’t displayed. \nThe only way to unlock answers to people’s questions is to answer those questions yourself. Or, use virtual currency. You acquire currency by answering questions, or purchasing them through in-app purchases. \nWhich brings us to the other half of the app. In a Questions section of the app, Sapio offers more than 300 open-ended questions across a wide variety of categories, including Personality, Hypotheticals, Dreams and Future Plans, Sex and Sexuality, and My Quirks. appstore-3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T20:01:16.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
