With thousands of players, TwitchRP is a hardcore community that has built a reputation as one of the most dedicated roleplaying communities around. Seriously, even breaking character once can result in a ban. \nFor several hours, I'll attempt to survive and interact with the locals completely in-character, a stranger in a strange land, to see what's so appealing about roleplaying in a survival sandbox. To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. Will the locals accept me with open arms? Or will Lazarus have to revisit his tortured and bloody past in order to live among those surviving in this jurassic jungle? TwitchRP allows PvP, so I'm expecting I'll have at least a little bit of blood on my hands before my journey is done. Whatever happens, I'll be finding out at 3 pm PST on Twitch . \nIf you're unable to join me live, don't sweat it. Later this week we'll be publishing an article recounting my experiences and exploring why the Ark roleplaying community has become one of the largest of its kind.
