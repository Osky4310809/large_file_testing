(Photo by AP) \nHAILEY, Idaho (AP) — Actors Bruce Willis and Demi Moore have donated the Liberty Theatre in downtown Hailey to a local theater company. \nThe Idaho Statesman reports that the formalized gift gives the Company of Fools a secure, permanent space where the theatrical company has performed since 1996. \nThe couple, who are now divorced, bought the historic movie house in 1995 with the idea of transforming it into a live-performance space. The next year, they encouraged friends Rusty Wilson and Denise Simone to relocate their theater company to Idaho to perform on the Liberty’s thrust stage.
