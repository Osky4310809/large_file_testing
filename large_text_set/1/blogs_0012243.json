Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2017 \nAs reported by Western Journalism , Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway challenged CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday to account for the network’s coverage of the unsubstantiated reports. \nWhen Cooper charged that the Trump team’s real beef should be with BuzzFeed, Conway noted that CNN ran the story first on air Tuesday night, which BuzzFeed then picked up on. \nThe outlet later headlined a story online , “Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him,” in which it directly referenced and linked to the BuzzFeed story. \nCooper denied it saying, “We’re not linking to the BuzzFeed report.” Fact-check: Ahead of my spirited interview with @AC360 , here is @CNN report linking AND discussing BuzzFeed report. pic.twitter.com/nVoKLTOKMz \n— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) January 12, 2017 \nBut as Conway’s tweet clearly shows, CNN, in fact, did link to the story.
