Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer View more sharing options   16.21 GMT Last modified on   16.32 GMT \nMomentum’s former vice-chair Jackie Walker has been formally referred to Labour’s highest disciplinary body for possible expulsion over comments she made about Holocaust Memorial Day. \nLabour’s national executive committee (NEC) also referred two other members suspended from the party over the summer. Paul Davis, the vice-chair of the local party in Wallasey, was referred over allegations of bullying and intimidation during the leadership challenge by local MP Angela Eagle. The other member was Marc Wadsworth, a party activist who, at the launch of a report into Labour and antisemitism, shouted at the Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth that she was working “hand in hand” with the media. \nWadsworth said he had not known Smeeth was Jewish and had not intended to offend her at the event. \nAll three will have their cases heard by Labour’s national constitutional committee, a quasi-judicial body which has the power to expel members from the party. People subject to the proceedings are allowed a defence barrister and all evidence is disclosed to both sides in the case. The committee must rule that offences have been committed “beyond reasonable doubt”. \nThe NEC held its disputes panel in London on Tuesday to consider the cases, and decided the allegations were serious enough to merit referral to the NCC. \nWalker was suspended by Labour in September after she questioned why Holocaust Memorial Day did not recognise other genocides, even though the day is set up to commemorate other atrocities, including those in Rwanda and Bosnia. \nAfter the video of her comments at a Labour conference training event appeared in the media, Walker said whoever leaked the footage “had malicious intent”, and that she was anti-Zionist, not antisemitic. \nWalker, who was removed from her position in Momentum , also said she was concerned about definitions of antisemitism used by the party, saying she had not seen a definition she could “work with”. \nThe long-time activist had previously been suspended from the party after she wrote on Facebook that Jewish people had been “financiers of the sugar and slave trade”. She was later reinstated. \nDavis had challenged Eagle to take a lie detector test after the MP said homophobic abuse had been heard at a meeting of the local constituency Labour party during the leadership crisis over the summer. He denied allegations of bullying and intimidation in the Wallasey CLP, which was also suspended. \nDuring the fraught contest, a brick was thrown through the window of a building housing Eagle’s constituency office. \nOn Tuesday, the NEC agreed steps would be taken to help lift Wallasey CLP’s suspension. New elections would be held for positions in the local party and all new officers would have to undergo equalities training and sign a pledge to abide by Labour party values. Meetings will be supervised by regional officers, and will only be permitted after the elections in May. \nKen Livingstone, the former mayor of London who was suspended for comments last summer that Adolf Hitler had been a Zionist, was referred to the NCC earlier this year.
