The Detroit rapper has been working on his craft for six years and has some major support behind him as he takes his music to the next level. \nThe 19-year-old rapper lists Lil Wayne, Blink-182 and The Beatles as his influences and explains why the Atlanta-based label fit his needs and vision. \n“I think it was a really good fit because they cherry pick their artists and their track record is solid,” Nate says. “I think Culture Republic was a really nice choice for me also because of how focused they are on each artist. They don’t have a humungous roster of people they’re forgetting about. They have the time to devote to me and that’s why I signed with Culture Republic.” \nNixen caught the attention of Jason Geter after building a following on the internet. Geter is a former exec at Grand Hustle and also put Nick Grant on everyone’s radar. \n“He’s one of the first people who came in and really tried to mentor me whose made some major plays in the industry,” Nate says. “He’s a great example of no matter how successful you get, remain humble. I’m always all ears with Jason.” \nGeter has high praise for the teenager and sees his drive as one of his greatest assets. \n“Nate is super talented,” he shares. “To meet a kid that not only raps but explores his creativity through producing music, recording himself and directing and editing his own videos is incredible. This kid is so dedicated to being better that the sky is the limit for him.” \nNixen is starting strong with the release of his “Phenomenal” video, a catchy track that shows off his lyrical ability and desire to enjoy life. For him, the song is not about everything being great all the time, but having the right perspective through the ups and down of life. \n“The song is a reminder to myself that no matter what’s going on, life is phenomenal,” he explains. “We’re alive and breathing, we’re winning. As a kid I thought there was nothing worse than a sore loser but then I realized it’s the sore winners that are far worse. If you’re winning, you’re winning, be happy. Be phenomenal.” \nBesides Geter’s support, Nixen also has Andre Drummond on his team. The Detroit Pistons star came across the teenage sensation through his #First59 video series on Instagram. He then joined the MC on one of the clips, which helped create even more buzz. \n“It was very big for me,” he says of the co-sign. “He’s done a lot for the city, he’s a star. I never would’ve imagined Drummond would’ve reached out. He just walked by the studio and it was real natural. He said ‘I fuck with your music.’ And I said ‘Let’s make something happen,’ and it turned out right. He keeps winning on and off the court, clearly. He’s a real laid back and successful person that’s still very humble and down to earth.” A post shared by Issa Nixen! ™ (@natenixen) on Mar 9, 2017 at 2:28pm PST \nNixen is confident that this is just the beginning of his rap career. Since he’s worked at his craft since the age of 13, he has a lot of music ready to show the world, but also has a lot inside of him that he wants to get out. \n“Everything is forward,” he says. “We have the songs in the vault so there’s a lot of material to work with. It’s just about choosing the right records and I don’t want to rush anything but I’m also continuing to work nonstop. Whether it’s a single, or another #First59 video or a whole new music video, it’s always going to be something I’m putting out. Keep watching to see what I put out next.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!
