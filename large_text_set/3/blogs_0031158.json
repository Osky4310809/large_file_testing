By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 27, 2017 12:29 PM Supreme Court has issued a notice against Jammu and Kashmir, Central government. (Source: AP) \nA notice has been issued against the Narendra Modi -led Centre government along with the Jammu and Kashmir state government by the Supreme Court. The notice has been sent on the issue of identifying minorities in the state and providing them with the benefits. It asks a reply from both the sides involved within four weeks. There was a twist in the state when Supreme Court took note of a plea that argued that Hindus in Jammu and Kashmir are the minority group and are unable to avail the benefits of central and state welfare schemes for minorities due to the lack of a proper mechanism. \nA bench was formed to look into the matter led by Chief Justice TS Thakur that issued notices asking a reply from the Central and state governments asking as to why no proper facilities are being established. The plea also alleged that no panel has been set up to identify any other religious and linguistic minorities in the country in India’s only Muslim-majority state despite repeated representations. \nYou may also want to watch: \n“It is unfortunate that minorities including Kashmiri Pandits, Sikhs, Gujjars, Shias and other such groups who are the victim of the ongoing unrest in the Valley are being ignored not only by the state government but also by the central government,” said Guru Manyo Granth Society chairman Rinku Singh last year. He said hundreds of Kashmiri Pandit employees working in Kashmir were forced to leave the Valley after their transit camps were attacked. \n“Sikhs are forced by protesters to come out and join them and if they don’t they are harassed that their houses would be burned. There are some self-proclaimed Sikh leaders, who have become stooges of separatist leadership and are speaking in unison with them for their vested interests,” he added. Speaking at an event, recently J&K Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said Kashmir needs a leader like Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is a man of courage. She said the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh couldn’t even muster courage to visit his hometown.
