That would be Tapster in Wicker Park, a beer drinker’s paradise outfitted with 62 taps of suds, draft cocktails, wine, craft soda and coffee drinks — all of them to be poured by customers themselves. Also of note: food. To recap, Tapster, 2027 W. North Ave., utilizes the Pour My Beer system that’s powered by “tapcards.” Customers buy or refill them at the host stand immediately to the right of the entrance, or choose to link credit cards and have their tapcards automatically refill akin to opening a tab. Then they’ll bring cards to whichever tap they like — each tap pours four options displayed on touch screens — before placing their cards in a holder, grabbing a glass from a ledge above the taps (there are many types to pick from), choosing their beverage on the screen, and pouring. Drinkers can pour as little or as much as they want — they’re charged by the ounce — although there’s a 32-ounce maximum that customers can pour at once, give or take, depending on ABV of what they’re pouring. Mixing and matching throughout your stay is encouraged by management, who hope the concept educates customers, expands palettes, and fosters guest interaction. Most of the taps line the left wall in the front room, opposite most of the tables. A second room, with more taps, a bar serving shots and other liquor options, more tables, and armchairs lie in a second room beyond that. A bright back room with a skylight, communal table, swings and a deli counter is where customers can order food, which consists of sandwiches, fondue, craft popcorn, cheese, and snacks. Read through the food menu and full taplist below, and click here for a photo tour of the space , which holds 70 seats and is decorated with local art. Ownership plans live acoustic music at times for additional entertainment. Although it was announced first, Tapster isn’t the first pour-all-your-own-beer bar in Chicagoland. That’s Red Arrow Taproom which opened in January in suburban Elmhurst, and another is coming soon to Logan Square . Other local spots have previously utilized pour-your-own-beer options at traditional bars — notably Public House in River North — but those are often tabletop taps and constitute only a portion their beer options. So Tapster is the first of its kind in the city of Chicago, and constitutes a big step towards tapping into the trend in the area. Customers can try it out for the first time beginning tonight. Tapster, 2027 W. North Ave., (773) 661-2182, opens tonight at 7 p.m. Regular hours are 4 p.m. until midnight Monday through Friday and 2 p.m. until 2 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
