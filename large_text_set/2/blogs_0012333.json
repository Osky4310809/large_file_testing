After announcing the Toyota Hilux 2.4G Limited Edition earlier today, the company’s Lexus division has now shown the Lexus NX 200t Special Edition on its Facebook page. \nAs seen above, this SE is based on the NX 200t and “the blacked out spindle grille and black accents on the Special Edition further enhance its bold appearance,” the company says. \nCompared to the regular 235 hp/350 Nm, 2.0 litre turbocharged SUV, the car pictured here sees the normally chrome side borders of the spindle grille blacked out. On the sides, the wheels and wing mirror caps have a similar dark theme; the latter apes the F-Sport and replaces body colour. \nWant a “sporty” look for the sharp-edged NX but don’t want to shell out top dollar (in this case, RM387,900) for the NX 200t F Sport ? This might be the compromise you can settle for at RM312,000, which is RM2,100 more than the RM309,900 sticker price of the base NX 200t. Our review of the Lexus NX here .
