At least that’s the lesson of Goop Clean Beauty, the new book from Paltrow’s lifestyle site. The self-described “ultimate guide to beauty” focuses on creating beauty from the inside out by ditching heavy makeup and focusing on your health, according to Jean Godfrey-June, Goop’s beauty editor and the former beauty director of Lucky magazine. “The message of the book is about beautifying your life and detoxifying your life and environment as much as possible,” she tells Motto in a phone interview. While Goop has taken some heat in the past for seeming out of touch with the ordinary consumer by recommending products at exorbitant prices , the primary beauty lessons of Goop Clean Beauty are accessible to the average woman. And Godfrey-June shared some of the book’s biggest beauty tips with Motto. 1. Know what’s in your beauty products Godfrey-June says that the book takes aim at the lack of transparency in the beauty industry about what chemicals are going into products. Only 11 chemicals in beauty products are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and products don’t need to get approval before they show up in retail stores, according to ABC . But lawmakers in Congress proposed new legislation last month to increase FDA oversight over beauty products, which Paltrow herself endorsed. “Our number one beauty tip is read the label. And even then, be suspicious,” Godfrey-June says . She adds that people should be particularly suspicious of products that contain the word “fragrant.” Women should also take advantage of the Environmental Working Group’s free online Skin Deep cosmetics database , which allows users to search for products and find out what chemicals are in them. The platform also has a list of verified beauty products , which are free of questionable ingredients, fully disclose all ingredients and follow good manufacturing practices. “There are products in the drugstore that EWG will give a great grade to. You don’t necessarily need to spend a lot of money,” Godfrey-June says. goop press/Grand Central Life & Style 2. Invest in skincare While Goop Clean Beauty favors all-natural products, which tend to be pricier than traditional drugstore products, Godfrey-June acknowledges that it’s not feasible for a lot of women to switch out all of their products at once. So, she says that women should start by investing in an all-natural sunscreen. “Women are putting on these daily sunscreens thinking that they’re doing something great for their skin, when they’re actually putting these irritating chemicals on them,” Godfrey-June says . “I feel really strongly about natural sunscreen… Sunscreen is the most important anti-ager that you can buy. It’s better than any miracle cream.” In addition to wearing all-natural sunscreen, Godfrey-June says it’s key to take care of your health if you want to keep your skin looking younger. That means infusing your diet with healthy, non-processed foods and adding regular workouts to the mix. “Our message about aging in general is that you can affect how you look by eating well, exercising and getting rid of toxins,” Godfrey-June says. “When you wake up in the morning, have a glass of water with fresh lemon juice squeezed into it. It’s great for your skin and it’s great for reducing inflammation.” 3. Makeup should be fun Another lesson of Goop Clean Beauty ? You probably need less makeup than you think. “We talked about the idea of ‘fear-based’ makeup where you’re covering up and trying to fix imperfections,” Godfrey-June says. “Makeup should be something that’s fun. And it’s an extra thing. Like I’m going to put on some eyeliner and go out tonight. Not, ‘I’ve got to put on eyeliner or I’ll look terrible.'” That means that you don’t need to slather your face with foundation and cover-up. Instead, the book advocates for showing off your natural skin. “Our approach is less about a mask and a big sack of rules.” Godfrey-June’s biggest tip? Find the least thick foundation possible and wear it only in the spots where you think you need some extra coverage, patting it in to blend. “You’ll have covered the thing that bothers you without covering your entire face,” she says . “Skin is beautiful. And feeling good in your skin is really important.” Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T03:11:35.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
