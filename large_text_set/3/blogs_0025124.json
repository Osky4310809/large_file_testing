Smith and you know what ... he might have won.\nI avoid First Take at all costs, but Stephen A vs. LaVar Ball was some of the most entertainingly terrible TV ever. pic.twitter.com/McwhRyhbr5 \n— Joon Lee (@iamjoonlee) March 23, 2017 LaVar is so adamant that he’d beat Michael Jordan 1-on-1 that it totally disarms Stephen A. Smith. This famous dad walked onto the set without any proof or evidence, said he’d beat the GOAT, insinuated that MJ is only good in a 5-on-5 game and somehow still comes out on top.\nThis is like someone standing with a sandwich board on a street corner proclaiming the end of the world and winning a physics argument with Neil deGrasse Tyson. \nStephen A. Smith is a rank hot-take amateur used to pitching softballs of molten steel compared to LaVar Ball who tosses takes the size of the sun like a medicine ball and all you do is get out of the way. Listen carefully as Smith can only offer a whimper as he begs “Would you stop it?” He knows this is no Skip Bayless, and he is at the altar of hot take greatness\nShoot, LaVar even re-named Los Angeles while he was there.\nLaVar Ball on First Take: “You know what LA stands for? LaVar’s Awesome.” I am dead.\n— Joon Lee (@iamjoonlee) March 23, 2017 Nobody has developed a better brand in the last three months that LaVar Ball. The man has gone from total obscurity to being a part of the sports lexicon just as quickly as the “Ice Bucket Challenge” or “planking” did. Let’s check the head-to-head on popularity.\nYou know this means LaVar is getting his own studio show soon -- and you know what, we’re all for it. There’s room in the sports landscape to take the hot take show so far that it becomes absurdist theater. We all need it. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:22:02.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
