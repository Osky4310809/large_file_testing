NOTHING . \nNick Viall , you’re lucky this girl is on the show or else “The Bachelor’s” ratings would be terrible this time around. Don’t boo me, it’s the truth . Corinne Olympios boasts about topless pool session with Nick To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nMy favorite part of last night’s episode was the dreaded two-on-one date, obviously. \nContestants Corinne Olympios and Taylor Nolan — who hate each other, by the way — had to go on a date with Nick at the same time, but one of them was sent home at the end of it. \nThe ladies and Nick went to New Orleans for a romantic date with a fortune teller in the woods. \nYeah, it was just as miserable as it sounds. \nThe entire time, Corinne and Taylor talked shit about each other, so that was interesting. \nWhile Taylor was having alone time with Nick, Corinne was hanging out with the fortune teller who decided to make her a Voodoo doll. \nCorinne didn’t explicitly state the Voodoo doll represented Taylor, but it became pretty damn obvious when she took her anger out on it. \nIn case you are wondering, Corinne still has the Voodoo doll and decided to whip it out last night in honor of the episode. \nWhile watching “The Bachelor” in a hotel room with her friend, Corinne posted a hilarious Snapchat story of her holding the doll. She added a few photos of the doll in her hand and the Snapchats are just as amazing as you’d imagine. Snapchat Corinne is literally my hero. Corinne for president . Snapchat Her entire story was of the Voodoo doll, and it was the best thing I’ve ever seen. Snapchat I’m not sure if the 24-year-old will win “The Bachelor,” but this girl better make it to hometown dates because I’ma be pissed off if Nick never meets Raquel. I'm not sure if I'd rather be Corinne's voodoo doll or her nanny \n— Katie Corvino (@kTc0rvin0) January 31, 2017 \nKeep shining, sweetheart.
