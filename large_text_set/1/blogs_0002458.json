Origins of Advent \nAccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia , Advent began sometime after the 4th century as a time of preparation for Epiphany , and not in anticipation of Christmas. Epiphany celebrates the manifestation of Christ by remembering the visit of the wise men and, in some traditions, the Baptism of Jesus . At this time new Christians were baptized and received into the faith, and so the early church instituted a 40-day period of fasting and repentance.Later, in the 6th century, St. Gregory the Great was the first to associate this season of Advent with the coming of Christ. Originally it was not the coming of the Christ-child that was anticipated, but rather, the Second Coming of Christ .By the Middle Ages, the church had extended the celebration of Advent to include the coming of Christ through his birth in Bethlehem, his future coming at the end of time , and his presence among us through the promised Holy Spirit . Modern-day Advent services include symbolic customs related to all three of these \"advents\" of Christ.For more about the origins of Advent, see the History of Christmas . Advent Symbols and Customs \nMany different variations and interpretations of Advent customs exist today, depending upon the denomination and the type of service being observed. The following symbols and customs provide a general overview only, and do not represent an exhaustive resource for all Christian traditions.Some Christians choose to incorporate Advent activities into their family holiday traditions, even when their church does not formally recognize a season of Advent. They do this as a way of keeping Christ at the center of their Christmas celebrations. cstar55 / Getty Images \nFor a brief explanation of the colors of Advent and what they symbolize, visit this page: What are the Colors of Advent?
