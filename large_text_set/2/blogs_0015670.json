As a rule, if you can’t see your new four-legged friend, he is either getting into something or pissing on it. You can crate the little guy and hope you don’t come home to a living sh*t stain, or if you’re lucky enough to work at BrewDog , just stay at home with the best decision you ever made. 2 \nThat’s right, good guys BrewDog give all employees adopting pups or bringing home a new rescue a week’s paid leave to spend at home with the little guy, teaching him to fetch your beer and slippers. No word on whether or not there is a limited on how many times you can apply this vacation or if it stacks, but I’ve got my eye on a whole litter… 3 \nThe beer company, which has offices in Aberdeenshire, Glasgow and London, is about as pup friendly as it gets. Their Aberdeenshire office has around 50 office dogs that come to work with their owners regularly. This strategy of being so pet centric is just one part of the company plan to be “the best company to work for, ever.” A beer company that gives pup-ternity and allows you to bring your dog to work? I’d say they have that sealed up. \nIf you’re interested and in the market for some new diggs, they’re opening a new “Dogtap” in Columbus, Ohio today. Go for the beer, stay for your dream job. 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:12:25.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
