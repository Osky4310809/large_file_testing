What really makes a student stand out at Johns Hopkins is a desire to unite their interests—academic, social, or personal—with opportunities they will find here as an undergraduate. \n\"Through their essays, teacher recommendations, activities, and personal statements,\" Kim said, \"it was clear that the students we admitted would capitalize on these connections at Johns Hopkins.\" \nMore about the Class of 2021: Gender: 46 percent male, 54 percent female Geographic diversity: Admitted students come from 48 states plus Washington, D.C., and 52 countries Shortest distance from home to campus: 1.13 miles Farthest distance from home to campus: 10,204 miles (Australia) Top states admitted students represent: California, New York, New Jersey, Florida, Maryland Top countries (other than the U.S.) admitted students represent: Canada, India, South Korea, UK, China Average GPA: 3.93 Students in the top 10 percent of their class: 99% (of students who reported) Total applications, both ED and RD: 26,578 Total admits, both ED and RD: 3,133 \nAdmitted regular decision students have until May 1 to accept their spot in the class.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:06:04.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
