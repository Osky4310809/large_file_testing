She should know that this has nothing to do with sex.”\nHe said the slippery toys, also used as stress relievers, in no way resemble lewd objects.\n“In your wildest imaginations, no adult could possibly view this as a sex toy. This is a water-filled bag,” the dad insisted.\nPastor David Gehne said the school board took up the issue – and sided with the principal’s actions.\n“We wouldn’t discuss the details of any situation regarding one of our children. They’re all minors,” said Gehne.\nBut now Milt is fighting to have his daughter’s name cleared.\n“The spirituality of that place is busted,” the dad said. “Something’s got to change there. And we’re powerless to do it.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:41:14.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
