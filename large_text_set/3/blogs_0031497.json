Okorafor also reiterated his call to all stakeholders to play their respective roles in ensuring a smooth running of the foreign exchange market for the benefit of the Nigerian economy. \nMeanwhile the naira further appreciated to N380 per dollar yesterday in the parallel market due to slow down in demand for dollars. This indicates 1.3 per cent appreciation when compared with the N385 per dollar closing rate for Monday. \nThe appreciation was driven by CBN intervention in the foreign exchange market via regular dollar sale for invisible and forward transactions, resulting to reduction in dollar demand in the parallel market. \nSince Monday February 20th 2017, when it announced new measures to boost dollar supply and forestall the declining fortunes of the naira in the parallel market, the CBN has injected $2.45 billion by intervening in the forex market 13 times as follows: Tuesday February 21st, $417 million; Thursday February 23rd, $231 million; Monday February 27th, $180 million; Friday March 3, $350 million; Monday March 6, N367 million; Tuesday March 7, $100 million; Thursday March 9, $170 million; Tuesday March 14, $190 million; Wednesday March 14, $150 million; Thursday March 16, $100 million, Monday March 20, $143 million; Thursday March 23rd, $100 million and Monday March 27, $185 million adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:34:56.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
