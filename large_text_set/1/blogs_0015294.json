Mayor Garcetti is a fixture of Los Angeles politics, a former city council member and the son of two-term city attorney Gil Garcetti, whose name became a fixture in the media during a tumultuous decade in the 1990's, which encompassed the O.J. Simpson trial, the Rodney King trial and the ensuing social upheaval that tore the city apart. \nSeen to be popular and a favorite to possibly run for governor when the 78-year-old Brown resigns, Garcetti's endorsement is as good an indicator as any that Gomez is the definition of a party establishment candidate. \nAnd perhaps a sign of things to come was an Assembly District Election Meeting recently held in Gomez's district that resulted in a strong slate of Bernie Sanders supporters as Assembly District Delegates (ADDs) , according to the popular insider political website at MayorSam . ADDs are local representatives that work with the community and act as an official party conduit between the constituents and state representatives, with important functional and representative roles that can heavily influence the future leadership of the district. \nAs such, popularity within the establishment may not be enough in CD34, with many displeased by the party's performance outside of California. Sanders became a favorite in CD34. The heavy Latino presence in neighborhoods like Boyle Heights and El Sereno along with a strong Asian presence in Koreatown and the posh enclave of Washington Heights made CD34 not only ethnically diverse but an economic beachhead for the Sanders campaign. \nArturo Carmona thinks this diversity is an asset to his campaign message. \"There's no question that this district is a very progressive district,\" he says, \"it's a young district with a changing Latino and white population that is going through a tremendous economic transformation; whether it's gentrification or wealth disparity, fighting the establishment is resonating here.\" \nUltimately, Sanders won Becerra's district against Hillary Clinton by a slim margin but was notably the only majority-Latino district that Sanders took from Clinton. \n\"If Carmona can swing an endorsement and L.A. visit by Sanders, that would be huge,\" said Barreto. \nThe campaign may ultimately be a race to claim the anti-establishment label against Gomez. When told that Hernandez was behind Gomez and Carmona, Arielle Yuspeh, Hernandez's campaign manager rejected the poll itself. \n\"This is a classic establishment tactic: cook up a meaningless early poll in an attempt to drown out other voices,\" she said. Instead, Arielle pointed to an anti-establishment message the campaign feels will resonate better with the voters. \"Voters aren't looking to play musical chairs with politicians, whose same establishment answers failed miserably against Donald Trump -- they want new, genuine leaders that fight for our neighborhoods like Sara Hernandez, a former teacher and non-profit leader who advocates for our community, not the powerful,\" said Yuspeh. \nThe Trump victory cut deep with Sanders supporters, who argued that Clinton was a poor candidate against the right populism of Trump. Many felt that the best counter to Trump was a similarly populist leftist like Sanders. \nThe Trump loss is surely to hang around the neck of anyone unfortunate enough to be labeled the establishment candidate, which may indicate why Brown has yet to announce a date for the special election. \nThe sooner the special election is held, the fresher the sting of Trump's victory will loom in the background of the campaigns. Whether that invigorates the party establishment more or less than the upswell of discontent by the hardcore party progressives is yet to be known. \nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
