Following this, he came out publicly in 2007 after realising he could not live a lie. \nSpeaking about his suicide attempt, he told Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young: \"I cried that night and realised, 'I need to grow up'. \n\"Refereeing that World Cup final between Australia and New Zealand in front of 85,000 people and the millions of people watching at home, scrutinising every single decision you make under a huge amount of pressure, was nothing compared to the challenge of accepting who I was. \n\"Accepting who I was then, saved my life.\" Struggle: Nigel Owens talked about his sexuality on Desert Island Discs (PA) \nThe 45-year-old was born and raised in the close-knit village of Mynyddcerrig in Carmarthenshire, Wales , but realising he was gay felt \"totally alien\" to him. \nHe said he \"would have done anything to be 'normal' in people's eyes\". \nMr Owens also revealed his health struggles. He tried to lose weight and became bulimic. At another point, in an attempt to gain weight, he started going to the gym, then became hooked on steroids. \nHe also described going to a doctor and saying: \"l do not want to be gay. Can I get chemically castrated?\" \nMr Owens eventually came out, at the age of 34, to his mother Mair. She had already guessed his secret. \nHe told Desert Island Discs: \"I was brought up to be honest, and here I was lying to the most important person in my life. It was affecting my life. \n\"Unless you are happy with who you are, you cannot excel and be the best you can be at whatever you are doing. You cannot enjoy life if you are not happy within yourself.\" \nHe said his father, Geraint, found the idea of having a gay son \"difficult at first\", but added: \"My love for him and his love for me has not changed one bit.\" \nComing out helped to turn around his stalling career as a rugby union official. His tough reputation saw him picked for the World Cup final and he went on to dedicate his appearance to his mother Mair, who died of cancer six years earlier. \nThere has also been huge support from the Welsh Rugby Union.
