In the past three years as a supply teacher, however, I’ve seen how headteachers use the threat of an imminent Ofsted visit to create a climate of fear and control.\nSecret Teacher: I see Ofsted for what it is – a purposeless farce Read more \nSenior managers prowl around with clipboards all day on learning walks, checking for anything that inspectors might criticise. Teachers are given new complex forms of assessment to complete, which often duplicate ones that are already in use (there must be a limit to the number of times a primary teacher has to confirm that a pupil can count from one to 20). Everyone is forced to take a rigid approach to planning and employ a particular style of teaching, because we’re told that Ofsted wants to see conformity.\nThis culture of fear doesn’t just affect staff, who are under constant pressure to meet unreal expectations for exam results and data. It also has a major impact on pupils’ anxiety levels, as their unhappy teachers struggle to cope.\nNo escape One of my placements was in a primary school where there was an obsession with pupils’ learning targets (because they were so important of Ofsted). Cards detailing pupils’ targets were hung from the classroom ceiling, alongside their photographs. The children’s weaknesses were literally hanging over them, for everyone to see.\nThis went wrong when the pupils achieved their targets and had to get new ones. The autistic children couldn’t cope with the change and started having meltdowns.\nI’ve also been in schools that pride themselves on wellbeing. But there is no point in promoting mindfulness in the classroom, painting the corridors calming pastel colours or holding yoga classes for staff if the school is constantly in a state of nervous exhaustion at the thought that the Ofsted monster could rear it’s head the following week.\nSecret headteacher: I am desperate for Ofsted to call to prove we're 'good' Read more \nSchools create their own Ofsted myths; it doesn’t matter how many times the inspectorate reaffirms that it doesn’t require a particular teaching style or lesson plan. \nI once visited a special school for children with profound learning difficulties and watched a teacher lead a plenary on the water cycle in a geography lesson. The only people paying attention were the support staff. I later found out that staff believed having a plenary was the only way you could be “outstanding”. And so vulnerable children with very short concentration spans and at a developmentally early stage were being given the wrong sort of education based on a pure fantasy of what Ofsted required.\nIn another school, the head made staff fill in a form if they were going to meet each other outside school hours. He said that this procedure would satisfy Ofsted’s health and safety requirements. His staff would probably be discussing school issues, so the thinking went, and he believed he would be responsible if we came to any harm. We had to disclose where and when we were meeting and any work-related points for discussion. How this worked for two teachers on the staff who were having an affair, I never found out. \nAs if waiting for Ofsted is not painful enough, some schools opt to bring in external “mockstead” teams. These businesses are paid to produce a report, so they end up being more critical than Ofsted. They are friends of the school, we are told, not inspectors. However, these so-called friends have torn lessons to pieces and have been the last straw that pushed some dedicated older colleagues to early retirement. \nThey are supposedly brought in to do a “health check”, but they end up raising stress levels to a dangerous point. Managers seem not to appreciate the effect that these outsiders have on staff. They seem to feel that the end result of being Ofsted-ready justifies the means.\nLosing out When the inspectors finally do come, the reports are usually filled with judgements that look like they have been cut and pasted from a comments bank, good or bad. And that’s it.\nSecret Teacher: schools turn a blind eye to bad managers as long as they hit targets Read more \nBut there’s no time to relax. There’s maybe a tin of biscuits in the staffroom as a thank you from the head, and then it’s off again, preparing for the next visit. The areas of improvement become the new focus of obsession.\nHowever, the schools that try so desperately to please can come a cropper. The one that tried to pin down staff’s private meetings ended up being put in special measures, for issues including the quality of pupil welfare. The school had focused on the wrong things in a bid to satisfy Ofsted. \nPupils are losing out and teachers’ morale is plummeting. It could be different, though. Older colleagues share memories of a dream-like time when inspectors came into school with a positive attitude, appreciated your lessons and what the school did well, and offered wise observations for improvement. It sounds like another world now. It seems that the current system is so embedded that managers are unable see another way – and fail to understand the damage they are doing.\nFollow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach .
