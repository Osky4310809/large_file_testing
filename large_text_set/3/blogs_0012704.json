The findings showed that this trend was exclusive to Americans. In Italy, for example, the report found the exact opposite. The Italians still perceive the amount of relaxation time you have as a symbol of higher class. \nSo what gives? The report thinks it has a lot to do with the rise of a \"knowledge-driven economy.\" Meaning, the belief that capital-minded people, or people that are competent, hard-working and ambitious, are the most in-demand people in the job market. Always being busy and having a full calendar gives the impression that we are highly desired, giving the impression that we are of high status. \nThe report conducted a bunch of different studies to prove it. One study had subjects rate how they perceived the status of a person wearing a headset versus that same person wearing headphones. Same person, same clothes, same everything except in one instance she was wearing a headset and the other she was wearing headphones. The subjects all rated the headset version as having higher status than the other. \nThese days, every hour not filled with work is an hour that you're falling behind. Of course, there is nothing wrong with being hard-working and ambitious. They're both admirable qualities. But the cost of being always busy comes with a hefty price. Everything from heart attacks , cancer and failed relationships have been directly linked to being stressed and constantly overworked. The lesson? Free up some time for yourself and the important relationships in your life. Being busy isn't going to make your life better. But actually enjoying the ride every once in a while certainly will.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T23:41:03.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
