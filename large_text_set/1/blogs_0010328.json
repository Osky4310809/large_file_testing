He will also remind lawmakers of the “strong connection between housing and health.” \n  Mr. Carson plans to speak to importance of “efficient” federal assistance, according to the prepared text. “Simply put, it’s difficult for a child to learn at school if he or she doesn’t have an adequate place to live. In these situations, government can and should help,” Mr. Carson will say. “However, I believe we need to ensure that the help we provide families is efficient and effective. It cannot, and should not, trap people in an intergenerational cycle of poverty. “ How will Democrats react? Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said he would prefer a candidate with more experience. But he suggested it could be worse. “He’s just, on the surface, better than most of Trump’s appointees, nominees,” Mr. Brown said. “That’s not a real high bar perhaps. But you be the judge.” Trump’s intelligence man Mr. Trump has repeatedly lashed out at the intelligence community amid revelations of Russian interference in the presidential election. Now he gets to install a team of his own. His choice to run the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, is scheduled to sit for his hearing on Thursday. Known as a bare-knuckled partisan, Mr. Pompeo will have to balance winning over the C.I.A. while keeping the confidence of the Trump White House. His confirmation hearing is the first test. Expect plenty of questions about cyberattacks and the election. Mr. Trump’s aides will be watching for signs Mr. Pompeo can be trusted. Democrats will look to draw out any differences between the nominee and Mr. Trump. Mr. Pompeo should expect to be asked to summarize his views on mass surveillance (good), Russia (bad) and waterboarding (not illegal, and not torture).
