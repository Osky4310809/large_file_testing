Anger toward Cory Booker and other Democrats for voting against Sanders’s proposed amendment is misplaced and potentially deadly. (Photo by Michael Dwyer, AP) Recently, progressive circles online have exploded in anger over Cory Booker and 12 other Dems voting against an amendment proposed by Senators Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar that would allow for medications to be imported from Canada. Twitter is aflame with my fellow progressives calling the 13 Democrats cowards, saying they’ll never support them again, and (in extreme cases) holding their vote up as an “example of what’s wrong with the Democratic Party.” This is an issue near and very dear to my heart. I’m on a form of chemo that, before insurance, runs $15k each time — and I take it every six weeks. Y’all, that’s $130,000 PER YEAR , just for the one medicine, before I even get to the dozens of other scripts I take in my big ol’ “keep Kendally alive” cocktail. So trust me when I say, NO ONE wants the ability to purchase their drugs cheaper — whether it’s from Canada or somewhere else —more than I do. And if this bill was well-written and protected the interests of ill Americans, I’d be the first one joining with Sen. Sanders to knock down Cory Booker’s door. But it doesn’t, and Sen. Sanders’s portrayal of these Dem’s votes as a result of being in the pocket of “big pharma” is disingenuous — and it is diverting attention away from ACTUALLY FIGHTING TO SAVE THE ACA , in favor of promoting the same tired in-fighting that’s been happening for over a year now. Here’s why Senator Sanders’s amendment really failed: Obviously, when importing items that Americans are going to put into their bodies (in my case, via a chemo port that is a straight shot to my heart), it’s pretty damn important that they be safe. To make sure their safe, we have a little agency called the Federal Drug Administration, or the FDA. Sanders’s amendment — which was a BUDGET amendment — did not include provisions for the FDA to do any quality control and compliance. Without that provision of funds, they cannot do anything to protect American patients, meaning people like me can no longer be sure that it’s our actual medicine we’re shooting into our veins, instead of pixie stix dust and water mixed together by some enterprising crook. Oh hey, here’s a bunch of Republicans sharing a hearty belly laugh immediately after signing legislation to repeal Obamacare. Remember when we were all united to fight THEM? I miss that, let’s do that again. ( Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) And sure, that’s a ridiculous example of the (very real) dangers of importing drugs without FDA oversight, but counterfeit drugs are a real problem, and they kill real people every year. Not that long ago, it was revealed a Canadian pharmacy website had smuggled millions of dollars worth of medications, largely composed of cancer drugs. Real people dying from real cancer were given fake drugs because of lack of FDA oversight — the same potential issue with Sanders’s amendment. And that wasn’t an isolated incident. There have also been documented cases of imported heart medication turning out to be rat poison, cholesterol medicine being filled with brick dust, and antibiotics being filled with (surprise!) paint and inkjet material . Nothing says “health and happiness” like accidentally taking rat poison. The anger directed at Booker and the other 12 Democrats is the equivalent of debating the color of paint for your walls — while your entire house burns down around you. This is especially an issue for patients who take medications manufactured outside of the US — again, like me. The medication that keeps me alive is made in The Netherlands, but thanks to the FDA, when it gets to my doctor’s office and then to me, I have the reasonable certainty it’s actually the drug to keep me healthy, not a placebo, or worse, a deadly counterfeit. With the passage of an amendment like the one Sanders proposed, a counterfeit version could make its way into the country by way of Canada, and the FDA would have no way to protect me. And before I even get the first angry comment telling me if I’m so worried, I can just not buy my drugs from Canada — I do not directly purchase my drugs. They are administered by my doctor, after they’re obtained by the hospital, who got them from their provider, and on up the chain. Sanders’s amendment didn’t just allow patients to purchase their medications from Canada — it specifically allowed for pharmacies and wholesalers to do the same. Every time you’re given an IV, does your doctor hand you a notarized document detailing the medicines path from creation to you? Mine sure doesn’t. Without FDA oversight, any patient ever given medication in hospitals, emergency rooms, and doctors offices across the nation would suddenly be at potential risk. Despite all this, since the amendment failed, Sanders has been publicly railing against the 13 Dems, and much of the conversation around healthcare from progressives has shifted from fighting to save the ACA in favor of tweeting angry messages at Cory Booker. This distraction is incredibly dangerous — and it could be deadly for Americans like me who need the ACA to stay alive. It is crucial that the attention turn back to the larger issue of saving the healthcare millions of Americans depend on. If that is eliminated, this one amendment isn’t worth much. The anger directed at Booker and the other 12 Democrats is the equivalent of debating the color of paint for your walls — while your entire house burns down around you. Senator Sanders — and his supporters — need to stop fanning the flames and stoking attacks toward his political allies. It’s imperative we all focus on what’s really in the best interests of ill Americans. So if you’re one of those people, next time you get the notion to angry tweet at Senator Booker, pick up your phone and call your senator instead. Demand that they not take away the health insurance of millions of Americans. Remind them that you’re watching — and that you’ll vote them out of office in 2018 if they do the wrong thing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T01:27:23.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
