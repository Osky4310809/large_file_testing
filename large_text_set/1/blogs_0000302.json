READ MORE: Living in fear under Pakistan's blasphemy law \nIn a video message posted on his Facebook page, Taseer, a Muslim, is seen wishing a happy holiday to Christians, and also asking for prayers for the woman and others victimised by what he called \"inhumane\" blasphemy laws. Thousands of supporters of Mumtaz Qadri came out on the streets after he was hanged for killing Taseer [EPA] \nTaseer said on Monday he had received \"very credible death threats\" from supporters of the hardline Muslim philosophy that inspired his father's killer, bodyguard Mumtaz Qadri. \n\"They are sending me Mumtaz Qadri's photos with messages that there are several Mumtaz Qadris waiting for me,\" he told Reuters news agency late on Monday. \nShahbaz Taseer, the other son of Salman Taseer, was freed last year after five years in captivity. Hardline groups \nTens of thousands people attended Qadri's funeral last March after he was hanged for killing the governor because they considered him a hero - showing the potential for this case to become another flashpoint. \nMore than 200 people in Pakistan were charged under blasphemy laws in 2015 - many of them minorities such as Christians, who make up one percent of the population. \nCritics say the laws are often used to settle personal scores, and pressure for convictions is often applied on police and courts from religious groups and lawyers dedicated to pushing the harshest blasphemy punishments. Pakistan blasphemy laws face scrutiny \nAt least 65 people, including lawyers, defendants and judges, have been murdered over blasphemy allegations since 1990, according to figures from the think-tank Center for Research and Security Studies and local media. \nA spokesman for the hardline Sunni Tehreek group said it was demanding police in Lahore to charge Shaan Taseer with blasphemy against Islam. \nPolice declined to comment and a copy of the police report on the complaint did not mention Shaan Taseer by name. \nThe police report did reference the Christmas message and opened an investigation under the blasphemy laws' Section 295-A, which bans hate speech against any religion. \nHowever, Sunni Tehreek has threatened mass street protests unless the younger Taseer is charged under Section 295-C - blasphemy against Islam or the Prophet Mohammad. \nProvincial Punjab government officials could not be reached for comment.
