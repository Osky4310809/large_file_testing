The doctors, who recently published their findings in The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences , caution that they have no idea what this means for our post-death life, especially because they’re looking at a sample size of one. They also speculated that the scan of the patient who “lived” as it were could be due to a mechanical error of some kind, though they admitted they have no idea what kind of error. \nThis comes on the heels of a 2016 study that suggests more than 1,000 genes can still function in cadavers days after the person has been declared dead. In previous studies , researchers have also noticed that rats’ brains sometimes experienced “death waves” — or a burst of brain activity — for up to a minute after being decapitated. However, researchers have not seen that phenomenon in humans. \nThe only thing this experience shows us is that we actually don’t know that much about what happens after death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:23:13.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
