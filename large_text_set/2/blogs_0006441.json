But that's all news we've heard before.\nThough the iPhone 8 will be the iPhone everyone will want, Apple will also release an updated iPhone 7 and 7 Plus with the \"7S\" naming convention, the report claims.\nThe iPhone 8 and all of its new features won't be cheap, though — it could cost more than $1,000.\nBONUS: You can now take selfies... with your feet?", "external_links": ["https://www.fastcompany.com/3068004/innovation-agents/heres-why-apples-10th-anniversary-iphone-will-likely-cost-more-than-1000", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/ouBql3iq.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/ouBql3iq.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-09T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:37:38.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
