Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTwo men who knocked out a woman cold after she tried to stop her boyfriend being attacked have been jailed. \nNickie Knowles and Richard Ashton chased innocent Guiseppe Nicotra and repeatedly punched and kicked him while he lay in the middle of the street. \nWhen the victim's girlfriend Polina Koshcheeva pleaded with them to stop Knowles punched her in the face and knocked her out. \nThe violence continued when a third victim, who tried to intervene, was floored by Ashton, report Devon Live. \nAll three victims said they feared for the lives during the unprovoked attack. \nJudge Geoffrey Mercer QC said: \"This was drunken, mindless, gratuitous street violence in the centre of Exeter at night. \n“It's the sort of incident which sickens the public and will not be tolerated. \n“You attacked a wholly innocent victim, essentially just for the sake of it and he was knocked to the ground and he was punched and kicked and stamped on to the body and the head repeatedly, as I've seen on the CCTV.\" The victim was kicked in the head and body as he lay in the road (Photo: http://www.devonlive.com/) \nExeter Crown Court was played film of the attack which happened at 1am on Monday, July 11. \nProsecutor Gordon Richings said Mr Nicotra was walking along South Street in Exeter with his girlfriend, Polina Koshcheeva, when they came across a group of four men. \n“One of the four men bumped into her,\" said the prosecutor. “The two defendants approached Mr Nicotra saying he should control his girlfriend.\" They didn't when the victim begged them to (Photo: http://www.devonlive.com/) \nMr Nicotra said nothing but was so frightened by the men that he started to run away. Knowles chased him and threw him to the ground. \n“While on his back he set about punching and kicking him to the face, head and back repeatedly,\" said Mr Richings. \n“Ashton joined in and the pair continued to assault him while he was on the floor.\" \nKnowles was seen in the CCTV kicking and stamping on the victim 18 times. \nAshton, 26, inflicted 20 kicks and blows to the face, body and head. The victim tried to run away after he was shouted at (Photo: http://www.devonlive.com/) \nWhile they beat him they screamed: \"Control your girlfriend\", as the victim pleaded for them to stop. \nWhen Miss Koshcheeva tried to stop the attack Knowles walked up to her, exchanged words and punched her once in the face. \nThe blow knocked her out and she was unconscious for about one minute. \nMeanwhile a member of the public, Callad Gayle, tried to reason with the men to stop. \nAshton felled him with punch to the face and when he got up he hit him again. His girlfriend tried to help but was knocked out (Photo: http://www.devonlive.com/) \nMr Gayle managed to flee the scene with his girlfriend. He later said: “I've never been so scared in my life.\" \nIn a statement Mr Nicotra said: “This was a completely unprovoked attack that could have happened to anyone. \n“I was so fearful that if I fell unconscious they would have killed me. \n\"I was grateful they didn't have a knife or they would have used it. The way they were stamping and kicking me they could easily have killed me if they landed on my temple. \n\"I had to watch my girlfriend being knocked unconscious. This incident has broken our relationship up.\" \nPaul Grumbar, in mitigation, said both men were normally \"sober, personable\" men \"who you would not imagine seeking out violence for the sake of it\". She was left unconscious in the road (Photo: http://www.devonlive.com/) \nKnowles, 29, has previously been jailed for causing grievous bodily harm after a fight between two groups of men ended with someone falling out of a window. \nHe said Knowles, a charity shop worker, had been a talented rugby player in Coventry where he was brought up but now suffered from mental health issues and should not have mixed his medication with drink that night. \nAshton, a builder who has previous convictions for battery and public order, suffered from epilepsy and on the night of the incident had got drunk because a visit to see a family member had been cancelled. \nAston of Codrington Street, Exeter, and Knowles, previously of Victoria Road, Exmouth but now living in Torre, Torquay, both admitted causing actual bodily harm to the Mr Nicotra. \nKnowles also pleaded guilty to ABH against Ms Koshcheeva and Ashton to assault by beating against Mr Gayle. \nThey were both jailed for two years.
