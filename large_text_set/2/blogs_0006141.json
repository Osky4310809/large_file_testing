They were set to try to keep one runway open throughout the storm, but said they would consider shutting down airport operations entirely. \n“For the rest of the day, there’s a significant amount of cancellations up until about 6 p.m.,” said Massport Director of Aviation Ed Freni. “The airlines are running their schedules later on this evening. They’re going to try to get a full compliment of airplanes in here tonight, after the storm subsides, to make up hopefully a full schedule tomorrow.” \n— Kim Tunnicliffe (@KimWBZ) February 9, 2017 \nAllison from Boston told WBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Kim Tunnicliffe she was trying to get to Utah to go skiing–though she said she’s afraid she’ll have to ski home from Logan if her already-rebooked flight is cancelled. \n“I’m not quite sure why yet, but they moved me to the next flight, so I’m getting in a bit later today,” she said. “I’m kind of hoping that I make the connection!” \nKeolis, the company that operates the MBTA Commuter Rail, posted a video of their snow-fighting equipment. Gov. Baker said Thursday that the company had much more of such equipment in place than they did during the record-breaking storms that hit the Boston area in 2015.
