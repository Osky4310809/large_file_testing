It is to consider whether there is the possibility of constitutional changes.” \nIt is unclear how many Orkland residents will support any movement toward greater independence. \nA 2013 poll found that only eight per cent supported leaving Scotland in the event of independence. \nIt comes as another opinion poll published on Monday found that nearly two thirds of Scots oppose holding another independence referendum this year.
