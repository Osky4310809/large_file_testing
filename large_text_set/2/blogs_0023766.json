Advertisement - story continues below Trump Promises Military Buildup To Send A Global Message \nIsraeli journalist Shlomi Eldar who is well informed on what happens in the Palestinian Authority and Hamas wrote in his column for al-Monitor that “the Palestinians were feeling optimistic after a series of discussions that Majid Faraj, head of the Palestinian Security Services, had in Washington the second week in February and a meeting between Abbas and CIA Director Mike Pompeo Feb. 14 at Palestinian Authority (PA) headquarters in Ramallah.” \nHowever, according to JOL that is not what actually transpired during Pompeo’s visit to Ramallah. \nThe intelligence cable that JOL obtained via an Arab intelligence official said Trump had put Jordan and the Palestinian Authority “on notice” over plans to launch a massive new Intifada because of the Administration’s plan to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Advertisement - story continues below \nTrump reportedly conveyed a message to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Jordanian King Abdullah that if they went through with their plan to launch a new Intifada “the gates of hell” would be opened for them. \n“A source associated with the Jordanian Opposition stated that both Abu Mazen and the Jordanian King know that the embassy move will bring about their demise,” JOL reported, using Mahmoud Abbas’ nickname. \nPompeo reportedly told Abbas that if he didn’t stop plotting the new Intifada he could forget about the establishment of a Palestinian state in parts of the so-called West Bank (Judea and Samaria), while Abdullah received a warning that he could lose U.S. support for his regime, which is generally considered the custodian of the Muslim holy places in Jerusalem. \nBoth Arab leaders were told that their threats to stir unrest in the Arab world over the embassy move were unacceptable and would backfire.
