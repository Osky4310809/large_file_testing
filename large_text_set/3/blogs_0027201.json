Its shade balls also will be history, she says. \nSilver Lake leaders are ecstatic. \"I think it's fantastic it's being refilled,\" says lifelong Silver Lake resident Anne-Marie Johnson , who's a member of the neighborhood council. \"Community pressure reminded the city of their assurances to refill it, and fortunately Mother Nature worked in everybody's favor.\" \nCatherine Geanuracos, founder of the year-old group Silver Lake Forward , which would like to see the reservoir become part of a park that has wider public access, says, \"There were concerns about how long it's been taking\" to refill the reservoir. \n\"The water coming back more quickly is certainly a good thing,\" she says. \"The big picture is that this is an incredible opportunity for access to public space in a city that's very park-poor.\" \nRusty Millar, a Silver Lake Neighborhood Council member, says the refill will likely bring outsiders to the community â€” but that's OK with him. \"It belongs to the entire city, not you or me.\" Upcoming Events", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:30:35.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
