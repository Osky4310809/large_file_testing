In it, a claymation person with a bulbous, almost baboon-like ass lolls in a seductive moment, whispering soft affirmations directly to you. They lovingly sketch your face through the computer screen, glancing upward and making the sort of direct eye contact that forces you to at first look away, then gaze back, deeply. You feel known by this stranger. The film is self-contained, raising many questions but requiring no answers. All that is left is you and the person, who, you eventually realize, is no stranger at all, but your friend. By the end, the unease in your stomach has been replaced with a sense of warmth, and you realize there’s nothing creepy about the video at all. \nMy apologies for not getting weird on a Saturday. And I don’t know if any of you are going to appreciate this like I did but the moment that thing goes “I like looking at you” and sensually rubs the floor cracked me the fuck up: \nHe came on a little strong at the end with the declaration of love but overall there was something incredibly creepy about it that made my hairs stand on end…but I also could see how people would watch this and be kind of soothed by it. I’m the type of person who if I’m getting a massage or something like that can’t relax at all, if anything the soothing new age music in the background only makes me more aware of how not relaxed I am. But a lot of people love it and I know I’m probably the one in the wrong here. \nSo hey if you find this animated dude’s pillow talk relaxing or comforting, I won’t judge you for it. I also won’t judge if you never click another blog of mine again when this dude sneaks into your dream and whispers “I love you” with his (?) taut butt cheeks up in the air every single night. It’s all on the table here when you’re being whispered sweet nothings by nude claymation characters. \n^definitely dressed up as a California Raisin one Halloween when I was a little kid. Maybe I need to keep more of an open mind to this weird naked animation man trying to holla at me.
