Full details Tamara Taylor will make her 100th appearance for England Women after being selected in an unchanged team to face Wales on Saturday. \nThe 35-year-old Darlington Mowden Park lock made her debut against New Zealand in October 2005 and was in the Women's Rugby World Cup-winning team in 2014. \nEngland recovered from 13 points down to beat holders France in their Six Nations opener. \nEmily Scarratt, who kicked 16 points in the win, is included in the centres. \nWing Amy Wilson Hardy, whose try wrapped up victory over the French, wins her fifth cap with Bristol's Sarah Hunter leading the side from number eight.

They are a tough side to play at home but we are confident in our preparation and the quality of the 23 players we are sending out on Saturday,\" he said. \n\"I was pleased with the way we refocused at half-time last week and the accuracy, discipline and execution of the game plan was far closer to the standards we are looking to achieve. It is essential this week that we don't leave that performance until the second half.\" England team to face Wales \nDanielle Waterman; Lydia Thompson, Emily Scarratt, Amber Reed, Amy Wilson Hardy; Katy Mclean, Natasha Hunt; Rochelle Clark, Amy Cokayne, Laura Keates; Harriet Millar-Mills, Tamara Taylor; Izzy Noel-Smith, Marlie Packer, Sarah Hunter. \nReplacements: Vicky Fleetwood, Justine Lucas, Sarah Bern, Zoe Aldcroft, Poppy Cleall, La Toya Mason, Emily Scott, Rachael Burford.
