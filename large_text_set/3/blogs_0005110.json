However, I think he’s right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney — of the Justice Department through the (Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act) court.” \nMukasey was referring, in part, to a FISA warrant reported on by The New York Times which dealt with a “mysterious back channel” between a Russian bank and the Trump Organization. The warrant was issued last October and the FBI found no evidence linking Trump to Russia.   \n“Now, what that means is this is part not of a criminal investigation, but of an intelligence-gathering investigation,” Mukasey said. “The FBI has got two functions. They investigate crimes and they gather intelligence. They started gathering intelligence in ’08 based on guidelines that we put in place.” \n“They tried to get — apparently tried to get a wiretap based on their criminal investigation function in June. That was turned down. They then tried to get, and got, an order permitting them to conduct electronic surveillance in October.” \nWhile Mukasey said the warrant could have been issued because there was “some basis to believe that somebody in Trump Tower may have been acting as an agent of the Russians , for whatever purpose, not necessarily the election, but for some purpose,” he said there might have been a more innocuous explanation. \n“(T)he FBI keeps track of people who act as agents of foreign governments,” Mukasey said. “They keep track of people who act as agents of the Chinese, the Russians, the Israelis, everybody.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T20:51:05.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
