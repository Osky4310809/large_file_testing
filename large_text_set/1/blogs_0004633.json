As a viewer, you may find yourself mouthing those exact same words upon watching her work her seductive moves. This is the resounding impact of Kangana. Can’t say for the movie yet, but the trailer of Rangoon rests generously on the national-award-winning actress’ shoulders. \nSet during the rule of the British in India (and a few wars that we’re still trying to make sense of), Rangoon strikes as a love triangle with two obsessive lovers on either side of Kangana, Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor. But we’re not interested in the male actors’ deewangi-driven antics. We’re here for Jaanbaaz Julie. Julie (played by Kangana) is an action star who dresses like an archetype of the 40’s swoon-inducing femme fatale. She has a possessive boyfriend, Saif Ali Khan, who bequeaths her with his privilege and sends her on a mission to Burma because war…Hitler…Germany (that’s the order in which Saif explains the scenario). Shahid is brought into the equation as her personal bodyguard. Predictable AF, his obsession towers over Saif’s love over the course of the next hurriedly-stitched 15 scenes, where he is willing to sacrifice his own hot bod for Kangana’s. And boy is Saif not pleased. He wants blood and, in few scenes, looks conniving enough to hand Shahid’s soul over to Satan. \nThe Vishal Bhardwaj directorial is brokenly funny. Some pee jokes are thrown in for good measure, ones that Kangana belts out in her Queen -like candour. Other times, the movie is spent in multiple wars. Action sequences and deadly explosions are aplenty. So is nudity. A scene where Shahid and Kanagana indulge in seriously-steamy beach sex made us want to applaud the growing-up that Bollywood has done. \n\nIn the lead up to the trailer, three posters (since it’s a love triangle, LOL) were also released that had nothing in common. Kangana and Shahid are seen kissing in one, other has Saif trying to smother Kangana against a Gatsby-like background, and the third is headlined by Kangana and, rightfully so. Because, honest to God, she looks spectacular in her daaku act. \nHere are the posters - He will fight against all odds for love.
