I’d rather you ask the most insane, disrespectful question in an effort to gain knowledge than you just walk around with a bias or prejudice that you really don’t understand where it came from.’” \nHis frame — 6-foot-5, 302 pounds — and name have shielded him from some discrimination, he said. \n“That’s why it’s so important for myself to make sure that people who have different names than me, who look different, who come from a different country are still given every opportunity to be a human being and be successful,” he said. \nAs a professional athlete, Harris has heard but not heeded the calls to “stick to sports” and keep politics out of his social media posts and discussions. The irony of receiving such calls less than a year after he and his Bronco teammates were honored by former President Barack Obama at the White House isn’t lost on him. \n“But I’ve began to understand hatred in a different way, especially in the last year,” Harris said. “I realized that people have hatreds that they grew up with, prejudices they grew up with, and then they find out that prejudice is really unfounded and they begin to hate themselves for it. And that comes out as even more anger and hate overall. But I think that’s also part of the process of them coming to forgive themselves for their prejudices and just joining solidarity with people who are different from you.” \nThis past season, the collective voice of NFL players and athletes at all levels seemed to grow louder as many, including Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall , protested social injustice by kneeling for the national anthem and meeting with community leaders. \n“I do know that myself and other people — not just Muslims, but people of color, young African-American males — when you see Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice, that was us,” Harris said. “That was us walking home with Skittles and headphones and playing in the park. And that’s our father, Eric Garner, who, doing whatever he was doing, did not deserve to die. So these are very real realities for a lot of the athletes. \n“But you also have to remember, our heroes — our Muhammad Alis, our Malcolm X’s, Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, who, as much as he is celebrated today, was one of the most vilified and threatened figures in America, specifically by the U.S. government. These are our heroes. My grandparents marched in the Civil Rights Movement. So we very much understand the realities of being a minority, of being a minority of thought, but we also understand that through solidarity, through white and black people, through Christians and Jewish people and Muslims, we’ve been able to overcome these monumental obstacles of hatred.” \nAmong Harris’ prized possessions is a framed photograph of the late Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, the former president of Notre Dame and chairman of the United States Civil Rights commission, joining hands with King in 1964. \nSaturday, Rev. John Jenkins, the current president of Harris’ alma mater, released a statement urging Trump to rescind the immigration ban: \n“The sweeping, indiscriminate and abrupt character of President Trump’s recent Executive Order halts the work of valued students and colleagues who have already passed a rigorous, post-9/11 review process, are vouched for by the university and have contributed so much to our campuses. If it stands, it will over time diminish the scope and strength of the educational and research efforts of American universities, which have been the source not only of intellectual discovery but of economic innovation for the United States and international understanding for our world; and, above all, it will demean our nation, whose true greatness has been its guiding ideals of fairness, welcome to immigrants, compassion for refugees, respect for religious faith and the courageous refusal to compromise its principles in the face of threats. \n“We respectfully urge the president to rescind this order.” \nTo Harris, the statement came as no surprise. His four years at the Catholic university, which held 330 masses a week, not only broadened his views but strengthened his own faith. \nNow, Harris says he lives not of fear but of reality. He and many others he knows and spends time with have contingency plans to leave the country and protect the wealth they’ve been able to build, if necessary. \n“What’s sad is being a victim and being a terrorist is the same today,” he said. \n“For people who have that hate in their heart, I just tell them: ‘Forgive yourself. We forgive you. I, personally forgive you. And even if you can’t do it to your group of friends or online, just support people in any way you can and forgive yourself of your hatred, because it’s unfounded. And, really, it is futile.’ ” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:14:54.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
