Namely, he had to take a random drug test, one of four NBA players receive during each season. NBA selected Kawhi Leonard for random drug test. So he's in the back waiting until he can produce a specimen. \n— Michael C. Wright (@mikecwright) March 7, 2017 \nGranted, this seems like standard business in the NBA, but the timing sure seems convenient. \nFormer NFL punter Pat McAfee knows the feeling . So does James Harrison. \nStill, we’re just glad to see Leonard getting some MVP hype, a cause our own Skip Bayless can surely get behind. KAWHI LEONARD DOES IT AGAIN. OUTPLAYS HARDEN IN 4TH QUARTER. SPURS HAVE GONE FROM BIG 3 TO BIG 1: KAWHI LEONARD. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) March 7, 2017 I said on Undisputed this morning that Kawhi is now more dominant than LeBron. He just proved it against Harden and the hot Rockets. UNREAL. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) March 7, 2017 No more dominating and clutch 4th-quarter player in the NBA – on defense as well as offense – than Kawhi. Late 3 then chase-down of Harden! \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) March 7, 2017 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T14:19:30.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
