Donald Trump Misspells ‘Hereby’ Two Different Ways on Twitter, Says Pelosi Has ‘Close Ties to Russia’ Published Updated 4:32 pm EST, March 3, 2017 4 Comments By Brendan Morrow 2.3k Share Tweet Follow Donald Trump delivers his first address to a joint session of Congress from the floor of the House of Representatives in Washington, DC, USA, 28 February 2017. (Getty) \nIn a series of tweets this afternoon, President Donald Trump repeatedly misspelled the word “hereby” while alleging that the U.S. House minority leader has “close ties” to Russia. \nTrump first posted a tweet at 3:47 p.m. Eastern Time linking to a Politico article which shows that Nancy Pelosi met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in 2010. Trump wrote, “I hear by demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it.” \nIn that tweet, Trump wrote “hear by” instead of “hereby.” Two minutes later, Trump deleted that tweet and posted it again. The word was still spelled incorrectly, but this time it was spelled a different wrong way; he wrote, “I hearby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it.” Tweeted, deleted. Tweeted again, it's still wrong. The word he's looking for is “hereby”. pic.twitter.com/bpABkSpf4Z \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 3, 2017 \nFinally, at 4:02 p.m., 15 minutes after the original tweet, Trump reposted this message a third time with “hereby” spelled correctly. I hereby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it. https://t.co/qCDljfF3wN \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017 \nDemocratic Senator Bob Casey immediately responded to Trump on Twitter with an animated GIF of Jed Bartlet from The West Wing slamming his head on the Oval Office desk. \n— Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) March 3, 2017 \nThis is not the first time that Donald Trump has had issues with spelling on Twitter. In February 2016 , he said that his opponent, Marco Rubio, was a ‘chocker’ immediately after saying that winning a recent debate was an ‘great honer.’ The Merriam-Webster dictionary subsequently tweeted out the definition of the word “honer,” as in a person or thing that hones. honer: one that hones ( https://t.co/76PlKG8PA6 )leightweight: We have no. idea. \n— Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) February 26, 2016 \nIn July 2016, Trump said that Hillary Clinton is a “lose” canon instead of a “loose” canon in a tweet that was never deleted. Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2016 \nIn December 2016, Trump said that China stealing a Navy research drone was “unpresidented.” The pool begins: not if but when “unpresidented” gets the entire wood at the Daily News, and for what event. pic.twitter.com/1OmPMZwhr7 \n— robert p. baird (@bobbybaird) December 17, 2016 \nThe day after his inauguration, Trump tweeted that he is “honered” to serve as president. Saving this for postority. pic.twitter.com/wmnanHjPWF \n— Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) January 21, 2017 \nAnd outside of Twitter, the White House recently released a list of terrorist attacks that they said the media did not do enough reporting on. In that list, the word “attacker” was misspelled 27 times. White House released list of 78 terrorist attacks it says were \"under-reported.\" \nIn 27/78, \"Attacker\" is spelled \"attaker.\" \n— Prof Dynarski (@dynarski) February 7, 2017 \nEarlier in the day on Friday, Donald Trump tweeted a photo of Chuck Schumer meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. This came after Attorney General Jeff Sessions was criticized for meeting with Sergey Kislyak at the Republican National Convention but then saying in a Senate testimony that he never met with any Russians during the presidential campaign. \nNancy Pelosi told Politico this week that she has never met with Sergey Kislyak, a claim which was immediately contradicted by photographic evidence of Pelosi meeting with Kislyak in 2010. She later said that she meant she had never met with him one-on-one. Brendan Morrow is a Heavy contributor who covers news, politics, professional wrestling, and more.
