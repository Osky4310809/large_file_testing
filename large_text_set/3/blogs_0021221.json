Glatze had been attracted to men at 14. He came out as gay when he was 20 and worked for a publication geared toward gay men. And at age 30, he declared himself straight. He wrote about it in an article for right wing website WorldNetDaily, expressing the fervency of an evangelical pastor. \nAs a leader in the “gay rights” movement, I was given the opportunity to address the public many times. If I could take back some of the things I said, I would. Now I know that homosexuality is lust and pornography wrapped into one. I’ll never let anybody try to convince me otherwise, no matter how slick their tongues or how sad their story. I have seen it. I know the truth. \nBy 2011, he was the subject of a profile in the New York Times Magazine , written by a gay friend of his who wondered if Glatze really had changed his sexual orientation. \nAnd soon, he’ll be the subject of a movie, I Am Michael , starring James Franco and Zachary Quinto : \nWhat’s especially interesting is that Glatze may not be the happy ex-gay he once claimed to be. One publication claims he (relatively recently) mocked Christians on a now-defunct blog, calls himself bisexual, and lives in a San Francisco apartment (for reasons). There’s no verification for any of this, so take it with a grain of salt. Needless to say, he doesn’t seem to be evangelizing gay conversion therapy. \nHis personal life shouldn’t be anyone’s business, but since he had the audacity to criticize gay people, he has a moral obligation to apologize if he no longer feels the same way. Any story about his life — including the movie that’s now available on-demand — is incomplete without giving viewers a thorough account of where he stands now. The story didn’t necessarily end when he found God and turned off the gay. \n(Screenshot via YouTube .
