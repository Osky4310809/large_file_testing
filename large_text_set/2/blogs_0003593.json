There is a very good case for a UK investigation as it affects British citizens.” \nAccording to his biography, Marclay director Jake Hockley worked “as an operational officer to disrupt significant threats to UK National Security”. He left public service in 2012 to form the company.

The Beckhams are standing united (Photo: Instagram) \n“[Marclay’s] background makes them ideal to try and sort out this mess and stem the flow of stolen information into the public domain.” \nMarclay Associates declined to comment. \nWe revealed how Beckham’s business advisors were victims of a blackmail attempt early last year. They were asked to pay up to a millions euros – close to £1million – or face the disclosure of the emails. \nHackers initially approached Portugal-based Doyen Sports, part of Mr Oliveira’s firm Doyen Global.
