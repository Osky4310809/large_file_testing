They've got quality all over the pitch and it's too important to just get focused on one individual.\" \nForster believes the key to getting a result for Southampton will be striking the right balance between defence and attack. \n\"It's always hard,\" the England international said. \"In the [semi-final] Liverpool game, we probably ended up sitting in more than we wanted in reality. \n'Ibrahimovic is playing?! Shit!' \n\"But when you come up against that calibre of team – Manchester United are similar with a lot of ball possession and a lot of quality players – if you go expansive, it gives them the opportunity and more space to work. \n\"Equally, it's hard to go the other way and defend for 90 minutes and try to hit them on the counter. It's the manager's decision what we do and we'll be 100 per cent at it when matchday comes.\" \nPuel's men were beaten 2-0 at Old Trafford in the Premier League in August.
