Star freshman guard Lonzo Ball went down with a bruised hip against the No. 14 seed Kent State Golden Flashes.\nBall suffered the injury while attempting to catch a pass in midair and getting his legs cut under him. He landed hard on the side of his hip and was in obvious pain for several minutes.\nBall is still playing, though, and trying to gut out the injury. Kent State is refusing to go away, but the Bruins still have a fairly comfortable lead at the time of this writing.\nOne of the leading candidates to be drafted top-five in the NBA Draft, Ball might be more famous for his father’s antics, but there’s no question that he’s a game-changing talent, setting UCLA’s freshman single-season record for assists this season. The Bruins absolutely need him on the court if they’re to make a serious run at the national championship.\nBecause when Ball is healthy, he’s capable of awesome stuff like this.\nLonzo Ball throwing it down! pic.twitter.com/2Ajlzcouio \n— LeadingNCAA ™ (@LeadingNCAA) March 18, 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T10:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T06:07:24.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
