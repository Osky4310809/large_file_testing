He made good on the promise this morning after news struck about Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds joining U2 for their 30th anniversary Joshua Tree 30th Tour . \n“I see all that brown nosing is finally starting to pay off. NO SHAME,” Liam tweeted shortly after the tour’s announcement. I see all that brown nosing is finally starting to pay off NO SHAME LG x \n(Read: Oasis’ Top 10 Songs ) \nNoel has called U2 one of his “favorite ever, ever bands” and described the time Oasis got to tour with them as a “dream come true.” In the past, Liam bestowed similar accolade on U2, declaring their 2001 concert in London “one of the greatest performances I’ve seen. This sets the standard for other bands.” \nHowever, during an interview last summer, Liam seemed to blame U2’s frontman as one of the reasons he and Noel no longer get along. “Put it this way, Noel lives in a £17 million house. That changes you, I reckon. You have appropriate furniture, appropriate kitchens, appropriate red wine that Bono’s recommended. And Damon Albarn becomes your mate. Fair dos, but not for me,” Liam told Q magazine. \nWhatever the reason for Liam’s disdain, it’s just the latest salvo in the brothers’ nearly two decades old public feud, during which Liam has even said he’d punish his children for going to see their uncle in concert. “If I ever caught them at one of [his] gigs, there’d be trouble,” he said. “I’d stop their pocket money, or I’d dish out loads of old photos of them with nappies full of shit and put that on the internet.” Artists", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T17:53:01.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
