They’re all seemingly endless reservoirs of storage. \nThe DataTraveler Ultimate Generation Terabyte (DTUGT) debuted at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in January , promising up to 2TB of storage. \nThat’s up to 70 hours of 4K video (or 531,344 MP3s, 1,792 compressed MP4 movies, or 96 PC games) in your pocket—safe inside a zinc-alloy metal casing. \nBut the tiny treasury comes at a cost : $1,650, to be exact. A 27 percent savings off the list price, that’s still an expensive piece of hardware. The 1TB model comes in at a slightly more reasonable $950. \n“We are always striving to create new and better storage solutions to meet our customers’ needs especially in an ever-increasing digital world,” Jean Wong, Kingston’s flash business manager, said in a statement. \nComplete with a five-year warranty with free technical support, the DataTraveler Ultimate GT runs USB 3.1 Gen 1, offering the same plug-and-play capability as any flash drive—with ten times the speed and better power management, according to Kingston’s website. \nIt is compatible with Windows operating systems 7, 8, 8.1, and 10, as well as Mac OS 10.9 and higher, Linux 2.6 and above, and Chrome OS. \n“Users can push the boundaries of their mobile storage needs and ensure that they have more than enough space to store their video, photos, and files in a small form factor,” Wong said. \nThe company’s customization program also means corporations (or self-indulgent people) can personalize the drives with a specific logo, art, casing, and content. \nThose who don’t need 2TB of space can opt for Kingston’s DataTraveler R3.0 G2 USB flash drive , featuring blue-and-black rubberized casing and three capacities: 16GB ($20), 32GB ($29), and 64GB ($50).
