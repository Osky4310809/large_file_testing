Advanced Facebook Page Insights: An Analysis Guide for Marketers by Jill Holtz on Social Media Examiner. Download Your Facebook Page Insights Files \nFacebook provides a wealth of data and analytics for your business page . Delving into your insights can help you refine your Facebook page content strategy and improve engagement . So it’s worth taking some time to familiarize yourself with what data is available and the key stats to look at. \nTo download Facebook Insights for your page, go to your Facebook Page Manager on desktop and click Insights . On the Overview tab, click the Export Data link . Go to the Overview tab to export your Facebook Insights data. \nYou’ll then see a pop-up box with three data types to choose from: Page Data, Post Data, and Video Data. To start, select Page Data to download key engagement metrics for your page. Choose the data type, range, file format, and layout for your Facebook Insights data. \nThe default time frame is the last 28 days, but you can change the date range by clicking the Date Range drop-down menu . You can also select different layouts for the file , which will affect the versions of data and analytics that are downloaded. Your layout options differ depending on which data type you choose. You can change the date range for the Facebook Insights data you’re downloading. \nAfter you pick your data type, date range, and layout, click Export Data to start the download . You’ll see the message “Your download has started.” The export process may take a little while depending on the date range you chose. \nBy default, the data will be saved in the Excel file format. Depending on the version of Excel you use, you may also get a message that the file format and extension of your filename don’t match. If you see this pop-up, click Yes to open your downloaded file in Excel. If you get an error message for Excel, click Yes to open your exported Facebook Insights file in Excel. \nSo that’s how to access and download your Facebook Insights data files. You might want to do a monthly download of your data to save a copy offline. After all, you don’t own Facebook’s data analytics and you never know if they’ll switch off free access. \nNow let’s take a look at the data you’ve downloaded and what metrics you’ll find there. #1: Analyze the Page Data File \nWhen you first open your Page Data file , you may wonder where to start. Every file you download from Facebook has a Key Metrics tab. Start with the Key Metrics tab because it summarizes the main metrics for your page. If you want more detail on any particular metric, click any of the other tabs to access additional sheets . The Page Data file provides insights about your Facebook audience. \nHere are a few tips to make it easier to view the data in your file: Freeze the top row so you can see the header and know what you’re looking at as you scroll. Add a total to all of your columns using the =sum() formula . Then copy this along your row so you have totals for the time period. \nFor starters, there are three key groups of page stats to look at. What you delve into beyond these depends on which metrics matter to your business. If you’re using Facebook to drive traffic to your website, for example, you should be looking into link click stats. If you’re focused on building a community , engagement can be a key metric to look at. \nLikes and Like Sources \nThe Lifetime Total Likes column shows the likes for your page for the time period you chose for the download. It’s interesting to see if there were any peaks in likes on certain days . This column shows the total number of likes for your Facebook page. \nIf particular days stand out, look at the posts you published on those days (you’ll be looking at Post Data stats later) to see if any posts received an especially good response . These posts may have earned you new fans. \nOr perhaps a certain channel is bringing you extra likes. To see this information, click the Daily Like Sources tab . On this tab, you can see how many new likes came from page suggestions (when Facebook shows users related pages or pages that might be of interest to them). You can also find out how many page likes you gained from your Facebook ads . \nAnalyzing the growth in likes and the sources of fans for your page can help you determine content and channels where you should invest more time to attract new fans. \nNew Likes vs. Unlikes \nNext, look at the Daily New Likes and Daily Unlikes columns on the Key Metrics tab . This data will tell you how many fans you’re gaining or losing. Find out how many Facebook fans you’re gaining and losing over time. \nTotal these two columns and then subtract the total unlikes to see the net gain or loss over the time period . You can also look at individual days to see if there were any spikes or drop-offs . Maybe there was a peak of unlikes one day and you want to understand what made people unlike your page. If you see a peak, look up the posts for that day and see if you can determine what turned people off. \nWhile you can’t stop people from unliking your page, understanding unlike behavior informs your page content strategy, helping you minimize fan loss. \nVideo Stats \nEach Page Data file has a ton of stats about video content and how users are interacting with it. Diving deep into your video stats can help you tweak your video strategy for your page. \nColumn BU (Daily Total Video Views) is the start of the video stats for your page. View video stats for your Facebook page. \nYou can access all sorts of information about organic and paid video views , as well as views over 3 seconds. In column CJ, you’ll find an interesting stat called Daily Total Number of Times a Video Has Been Seen Again. You can see a daily total of the number of times a video has been seen when it’s not the first play ; in other words, people came back to view the video another time. \nWhy is this interesting? It shows the stickiness of your video content. People were prepared to view it past the initial video play. \nIf you go to column CP (Daily Total 30-second Views), you’ll learn even more information about the people who viewed at least 30 seconds or to the end of your video . This data tells you how many people viewed beyond the initial 3-second time frame when they decide whether the content has value. Find out how many people watched at least 30 seconds of your Facebook videos. \nBy analyzing these stats for your page, you’ll start to see how page data insights can help you refine your page content strategy. Knowing what’s turning people on and off your page is key to sustaining your Facebook community. #2: Delve Into the Post Data File \nNow you’ll want to download your Post Data file using the same process outlined earlier. This time you need to pick a layout to download. You can choose from four layouts : Post Reach gives you basic post reach stats such as impressions, engaged users, consumptions, and video views. Post Engagement provides basic engagement stats such as engaged users, consumptions, and negative feedback. Legacy Layout combines reach and engagement with video stats. Legacy Layout With Viral and PTAT offers additional viral and PTAT (people talking about this) stats but doesn’t include video stats. \nAnalyzing the stats for individual posts will help you refine your post content plan. You’ll find out what content is resonating and why so you can develop a successful content strategy to engage your community. Choose a layout when exporting your Facebook Post Data Insights. \nAs before, it’s helpful to freeze the top row and add totals to the end of your data columns . Also minimize columns E (Countries) and F (Languages) , as those are usually blank. \nNow let’s look at three key groups of stats on the Legacy Layout version of the Post Data file. Which detailed metrics you look at will depend on your business objectives, but these are good ones to start with. \nPost Reach and Impressions \nWhen you look at the Key Metrics tab , you can see which posts had the best reach and impressions . “Reach” is defined as the unique users who saw your post, while “impressions” is the total views of the post. \nLook down your post list and identify peaks in the Reach column . Then look at the Type column to see which types of posts are getting those peak views . \nIn the example below, you can see that one popular photo post was seen by over 1.6M unique users. It also had 2.7M total organic views. The Key Metrics tab of your Post Data file shows the reach and impressions for your Facebook posts. \nIf you want to view the actual post , click on the permalink URL . This is handy if you’ve forgotten what the post is. Click the permalink in your Post Data file to view that post. \nBy examining the peaks in your post reach/impressions, you can see what type of content is popular, which helps inform your content strategy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:19:18.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
