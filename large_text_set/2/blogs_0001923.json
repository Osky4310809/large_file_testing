That’s the question raised by a new study from the University of Washington. The results suggest that negative biases can be conveyed through gestures, body language, and facial expressions—and that children pick up on these nonverbal cues to form their own biases. \nBut there’s good news, too: By knowing how prejudice spreads, we may be able to figure out how to avoid perpetuating it in future generations. Picking targets \nIn the study, researchers showed preschool children videos of two adult “targets”—one wearing a black shirt and one a red shirt—receiving either positive or negative nonverbal treatment from another adult actor. For example, the actor would smile at or lean toward one target to communicate positive bias. In order to show negative bias, the actor would scowl or lean away from another target. \nAfterwards, the children were asked to identify which target they liked better and which one should receive a toy. Then they were shown two videos with the same two targets. In the first, the targets each labeled a toy with a different nonsense word (calling it either a “snegg” or a “hoon”). In the second, one target put another toy on his head while the other pretended to drink from it. \nThe children, who were either four or five years old, were then asked to give the correct name for the first toy or to show what they could do with the second toy. \nResults showed that the children significantly preferred the target who’d received positive treatment from the adult to the one who’d received negative treatment, and were also more likely reward them with a toy. In addition, the children would imitate the preferred target’s behavior, calling a toy by the same nonsense name and describing how to play with a toy in the same way that the “good” target had. \nAccording to Allison Skinner, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington and the lead author of the study, these results suggest that children pay attention to nonverbal cues from the adults around them. This may explain at least one way children can unconsciously form biases. \n“Kids may be picking up bias from observing these subtle, nonverbal signals that we display when we interact with different people,” says Skinner. “Maybe we’re showing that we’re more comfortable interacting with some people versus others.” \nIn a follow-up study, Skinner and her colleagues found that the children’s negative or positive preferences for a red-shirt or black-shirt target also applied to other people wearing the same-colored shirt, though the degree of bias was not quite as strong. Still, it suggested a mechanism through which bias can generalize to an entire group. \n“Nonverbal behaviors may be responsible for not just interpersonal bias but for bias at the group level,” says Skinner. \nSkinner points out that the bad treatment shown by the actors was probably more exaggerated than what kids might see in the real world, especially from parents and teachers who consciously try to treat everyone with kindness. Still, Skinner believes even small gestures of preferential treatment—when multiplied over many interactions—are likely to make an impact on kids over time.
