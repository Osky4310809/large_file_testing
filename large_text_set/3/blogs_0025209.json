Ignore This Chart Mar 24, 2017 8:46 AM 0 \nDurable Goods Orders have gone nowhere for five years... \nA very different picture to the never-ending surge in the stock market. \nIt's the \"new economy\" stupid! You just don't get it! \nThe last two times that Durable Goods Orders slumped like this, the stock market collapsed... But, it must be different this time? Okienomics Stuck on Zero Mar 24, 2017 9:11 AM \n\"The last two times that Durable Goods Orders slumped like this, the stock market collapsed...\" \nThat chart looks to me like it's the opposite. I'm still long December SPY puts and plan to hold them, so don't misinterpret my comment; but why claim one is leading the other when the chart shows stocks dropped sharply just before durable goods dropped? \n\"The last two times the stock market collapsed, Durable Good Orders slumped.\" \nBTW, anybody recall what that giant spike in '14 was? BullyBearish Okienomics Mar 24, 2017 9:13 AM \n\"we control the money, we broke the system by stealing so much, we don't want to admit it or fix it so we'll make it look like everything is fine while we continue to steal more, fund our wars and others, amass more power because we know you won't do $hit about it...\" \nYou need to watch Stuart Varney, then you'd understand. \nTime to start the garden and get four more chickens.

You know the counter party market will get obliterated. \nHard to consider anything manufactured in China as a 'durable' good. \n\nYou've heard the old expression \"2 is 1, and 1 is none\" ... \n\nDid somoeone in the WH ask you write this nonsense ? \nWe are not impressed. \nDurable Goods Orders have gone nowhere for five years... \n\nmaybe they're just too darn durable (i almost couldnt type that from laughing so hard) we'll just have to wait for the next giant standard deviation report to bring orders up to the ES. Rebel yell spastic_colon Mar 24, 2017 9:12 AM \nHa! More like people are sick of replacing durable goods that endure for one year for several thousand dollars!
