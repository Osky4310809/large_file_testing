That means one in six Korean men will not be able to find a bride at home. \nIn 2029, when men born between 1994 and 2001 reach their prime marrying age, there will be 530,000 more men than women, hoping in vain to tie the knot. \nNormally the male-to-female ratio should be close to 1:1. Worldwide about 104 to 107 boys are born for every 100 girls, but that tends to even out because baby boys have a higher mortality rate. \nBut in the Year of the Tiger 1998, the Year of the Dragon 2000 and the Year of the Horse 2002, which are traditionally thought auspicious for male children, 110 boys were born here for every 100 girls. \nAlready this year is seeing a mini-drought, as the ratio of men born between 1981 and 1988 and women born between 1983 and 1990 stands at 117 to 100. \nAt matchmaking agency Duo, the proportion of male clients rose from 41 percent in 2010 to 52 percent last year, testimony that it is no longer spinsters who are desperate to get married but bachelors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:11:04.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
