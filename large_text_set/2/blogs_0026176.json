Bachelor contestant Corinne Olympios told Good Morning America ’s Michael Strahan on Tuesday, February 28, that she was “blindsided” when Nick Viall sent her home just days after he met her family (and nanny!) and asked her dad for permission to get down on one knee.

Paul Archuleta/FilmMagic Bachelor Nick Viall's Season 21 Contestants Revealed! \n“I definitely was surprised when I got sent home,” she reflected of her tearful exit. \"We had just had such an amazing hometown date, and things went really well with my family. I just thought we had a lot of fun. We talked about a lot of emotional things. [I was] just super-blindsided by going home.\" \nOn Monday’s episode, viewers saw the 24-year-old Miami native vow that she will “never kiss up to a man ever again” during her dramatic limo exit. That said, the bubbly blonde is happy she told Nick she loved him. “I really don’t have any regrets,” she said of her reality-TV experience. “I was fully myself, and I would have been really upset if I didn’t tell him how I felt. I would have regretted that, so I’m glad I said what I said.” Corinne Olympios and Nick Viall on 'The Bachelor.'

I never did anything vicious to anybody,” she said. “I was just doing me.” Although she admittedly has a “big personality,” she also revealed that she and Viall had deep conversations that weren’t aired on TV. “It wasn’t all so sexy and flirty all the time,” she added.
