Consent decrees often followed those investigations, including a final one just this month in Baltimore originally prompted by the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in 2015.\nBut future consent decrees are unlikely under Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump’s nominee for attorney general, who has called them “one of the most dangerous, and rarely discussed, exercises of raw power.” The Trump administration’s statement issued Friday appears to confirm that the federal government will largely halt its practice of investigating police departments that come under scrutiny.\nThe statement also takes aim at protest movements such as Black Lives Matter and others who have demonstrated against what they view as discriminatory police actions and other social and economic inequities.\n“Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter,” the Trump administration says, while adding that “supporting law enforcement means supporting our citizens’ ability to protect themselves.”\nRead more: The Same Donald Trump From the Campaign Spoke at Inauguration \nThe incoming administration’s statement echoed crime statistics that Trump often cited on the campaign trail, stating that homicides in the nation’s 50 largest cities increased by 17% in 2015. That figure comes from a Washington Post analysis of city-by-city crime data. Criminologists, however, routinely warn of making conclusions about long-term crime trends based on isolated snapshots. While homicides again increased in the nation’s largest cities in 2016, overall crime remains near record lows around the country and has been gradually declining for a quarter-century.\nThe statement also said that murders in Washington, D.C., have “risen by 50 percent.” In 2015, the nation’s capital saw a 54% increase in homicides from 2014. Last year, however, the homicide rate decreased by 17% .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T01:04:44.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
