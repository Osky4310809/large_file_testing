Though we were only given a brief teaser to go on, it already carried all the hallmarks of a truly great song of the summer. But now comes another teaser, and the knowledge that an extra-special guest is also involved. Listen below.\n\nThat’s right, it appears that this future-mammoth single will feature none other than Offset, one third of the Migos triumvirate. The latest teaser offers a few bars from the rapper, one that somehow gels with both Frank’s honeyed tones and Calvin’s manic electro. No word yet on when this track will surface, but signs are pointing toward it appearing on Harris’ as yet unnamed fifth album. As you can see, he’s excited about it.\nI worked with the greatest artists of our generation !!! I'm in the mixing stage now. I listen back and can't believe what we created \n— Calvin Harris (@CalvinHarris) February 15, 2017 \n\nRevisit Calvin Harris’ last video for “My Way” below.\n\nIn other music news, Lana Del Rey has shared a music video for her new single “Love”.
