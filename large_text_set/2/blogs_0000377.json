Your schedule goes nuts and then all of a sudden what you have left in your fridge amounts to little more than a quarter of a onion, a few eggs, and an open package of bacon. \nBut guess what? If you have those things, plus a little olive oil, you have dinner. Spaghetti Carbonara is basically bacon and eggs stirred into hot pasta. And, yes, itâ€™s as delicious as it sounds. Advertisement \n1 box (1 pound) spaghetti \n1/2 sweet onion, chopped \n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste \n3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese \n2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley \nHow to make it: \n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. \n2. While waiting for the water to boil, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until crisp. Remove to a plate lined with a paper towel. Set aside. \n3. Meanwhile, when the water boils, salt it and add the spaghetti. Cook according to the package directions. \n4. Return the skillet to the stove over medium heat (if there is more than 1 tablespoon bacon fat in the skillet, drain it). Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes or until the onion is softened. Set aside. \n5. In a bowl, beat the eggs with a fork. Season with the salt and pepper. \n6. Reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water, drain the spaghetti and peas in a colander and return to the still-hot pot. Immediately add the eggs, reserved cooking water, and onions. Toss well to coat the spaghetti (the residual heat will cook the eggs). Sprinkle with the Parmesan, bacon, and parsley, and toss well again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:36:42.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
