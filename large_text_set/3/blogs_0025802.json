But, at the same time, this is racing, it's not testing anymore, and anything can happen here. \n\"There are retirements that can happen here, so we need to enter the weekend with the mind of having some knowledge and some positive things from this weekend. Hopefully pushing a little bit more and finding the limits because in winter testing we were not able to push at any time.\" \nUnderlining the state of their preparations, McLaren chief Eric Boullier said earlier this week that they \"won't make any promises or predictions\" about their likely form this weekend, although Honda confirmed they have been able to make progress with engine mapping and other areas since the end of testing. The Sky Sports F1 pundits give their predictions on the 2017 Formula 1 season. \nBut asked if the troubles were such that the team had to already effectively write off their prospects in the season's opening four long-haul rounds, Alonso insisted: \"I'm not writing off anything. We are not here to wait for four races, six races, eight races to improve, we need to improve for tomorrow. \nWhen's the Australian GP on Sky? \n\"And if tomorrow is not going ok we need to improve for Saturday. And if Saturday we don't qualify in a good position we need to improve for Sunday. \n\"This is Formula 1, it's not a charity match where we can have fun here and there. This is Formula 1, we have to compete, we have to beat our opponents, and we need to be the best. This is what it's about.\" \nMcLaren have not commented on reports they have already sounded out former suppliers Mercedes about a future engine supply, although the team did say last week they were \"considering options\" with Honda. \nAlonso side-stepped the rumours when asked by Sky F1. \n\"That's a question for the team,\" he said. Obviously, I know and I'm aware about some speculation and some things that went out [in the press], but I will not enter [the discussion] too much. I will just drive at my best and hopefully the team can answer that question tomorrow.\" \nAsked if a switch to a more competitive engine would make him more likely to stay beyond the end of his current contract, which expires in December, Alonso simply replied: \"I don't know.\" \nWatch the start of the 2017 F1 season live only on Sky Sports F1 - and in Ultra HD for the first time!
