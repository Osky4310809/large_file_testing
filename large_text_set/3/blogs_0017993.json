Not that we weren't excited the first time we heard about it (read about it on our website, here ), every time we get a new piece of information about the project, we get even more impatient to see the finished product. \nFor example, when it was revealed that Ranbir Kapoor will be playing a younger Sanjay Dutt, we were floored. We couldn't wrap our heads around the uncanny resemblance! (Check it out on our website, here ). \nTurns out, that was just scratching the surface. You won't believe how well thought out the cast of the film is. Ranbir Kapoor as Sanjay Dutt Manisha Koirala as Nargis Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt Sonam Kapoor as Tina Munim Dia Mirza as Manyata Dutt \nYou can't ignore the resemblance between these people. There is one anomaly here, though, but we are just as excited to see it on screen. The anomaly is... Anushka Sharma as Satish Maneshinde, Sanjay Dutt's lawyer in the 1993 bomb blast case.
