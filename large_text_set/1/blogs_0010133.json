The background audio began to play an English message telling everyone there was a malfunction and we should all keep calm and wait for the machine to get fixed,\" a student, Xiao Wan, who was among the visitors stuck on the ride, was quoted as saying by the Shanghai Morning Post.\nEven though the machine broke down, fear did not sink in until the lights came back on, said Xiao Wan.\n\"It was then when everybody realised they had been elevated so high from the ground. Many people started to freak out,\" said Xiao Wan. \"Our legs were dangling, it was rather terrifying.\"\nOne visitor, Leo Hou, who was on the ride at the time, told the SCMP some people were hanging up to six storeys high when the ride broke down.\nLater, the hapless visitors were able to climb off the ride one group at a time with help from theme park workers who arrived with rope. The last group of people who got off the ride were very upset and many tourists said their travel plans were disrupted, said Xiao Wan.\nAffected visitors were later given a \"Fastpass ticket\" each as compensation.\nShanghai Disney Resort issued an apology statement on Wednesday (Jan 11).\n\"One attraction within the theme park stopped working briefly last night. We offer our deepest apology towards the affected visitors. The cast members on the ground rendered their services and assistance to the visitors in a timely manner.\"\nSince its debut on June 16, 2016, Shanghai Disney Resort has been marred by a string of malfunction cases. Its \"TRON Lightcycle Power Run\", a steel roller coaster attraction, broke down for one hour just one day after its opening.\nAnother attraction, \"Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken Treasure\", a water-based ride, malfunctioned on August 1, followed by wet adventure ride \"Roaring Rapids\" on August 6.\nTopics:  CHINA THEME PARKS  //str.sg/4WcS Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T11:52:14.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
