CONTRIBUTED PHOTO \nAgeless Glen Aguilar bucked a slow start to rout a field of young daredevil riders led by Davao pride Bornok Mangosong to rule the Pro Open class anew in the Diamond Motor Supercross Series on Sunday at Mx Messiah Fairgrounds in Taytay, Rizal. \nMangosong bolted to the front at the start before the 42-year-old Aguilar banked on his vast experience to wrest the lead for good in the third of the energy-sapping 25-lap race. \nThough he lacked sleep after competing in another race a day earlier, Aguilar of KTM Racing showed he could stand the rigors of a long, hot race.
