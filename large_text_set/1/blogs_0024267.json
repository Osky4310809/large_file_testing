The movie is currently shooting in Atlanta, and Marvel just dropped this first synopsis.\n“Black Panther” follows T’Challa who, after the events of “Captain America: Civil War,” returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T’Challa’s mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk”\nWe also got an updated cast list. From star Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa to director Ryan Coogler’s muse Michael B. Jordan as villain Erik Kilmonger to famous space insurgent Forest Whitaker as Wakanda statesman Zuri, we already knew most of these actors were showing up when we learned that Angela Bassett joined the cast as Queen-Mother Ramonda . However, we did find out a few new things.\nSterling K. Brown of The People v. O.J. Simpson is joining the film as N’Jobu. John Kani is reprising his role as the late ruler of Wakanda, King T’Chaka. Maybe he’ll show up in the one of the rumored 1990s flashbacks?\nBut fans of equal opportunity affirmative action should be thrilled to learn that famous foreign white men Martin Freeman, and Andy Serkis are returning to the MCU. Freeman played government official Everett K. Ross in Civil War (not to be confused with Secretary of State Thaddeus E. “Thunderbolt” Ross played by William Hurt” in Civil War) . Serkis plays arms dealer, the enemy of Wakanda, and one-time being of pure sound Ulysses Klaue, who first appeared in Avengers: Age of Ultron .\nIf we must have white dudes in Black Panther those are two pretty good picks. I just hope Bucky doesn’t get thawed out quite yet.\nBlack Panther hits theaters February 16, 2018. In the meantime, enjoy the excellent ongoing Black Panther comics .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T08:05:21.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
