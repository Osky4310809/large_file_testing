King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 15 hours ago 11 RHCP frontman Anthony Kiedis was recently asked to single out the \"bad habits\" each of his three bandmates have, telling Absolute Radio :\"Chad used to have an issue with punctuality.\"The first show ever that we played with him - we were around for five years before he joined the band - it was a pretty good gig, we were a club band, but we thought we were a stadium band; in our minds, we were anyways [a stadium band]. So the very first show, he showed up like 30 seconds before we were supposed to play the first song.\"As for Josh: \"Josh's bad habits are being way too thoughtful, kind, and considerate. He's just constantly gifting everybody exactly what they need.\"Finally, Flea: \"Flea, I can't even say his bad habits. It would wreak havoc with minds and the media, that goes to the grave with me.\"During the rest of the chat, Anthony was asked about the band's first-ever UK show, saying: \"We played Dingwalls, a bar near the [Camden] canal. We were so harsh and aggressive - dirty little bastards. We came out and insulted everyone there, which was maybe four people. We proceeded to think that we were God's gift to punk rock. It was fun, we had a good one.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T10:02:00.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
