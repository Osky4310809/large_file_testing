Your club’s most under pressure player for the 2017 season Staff writers, FOX SPORTS February 23, 2017 6:00am \nSPORT is results driven and when it comes to rugby league, it can be quite a cutthroat business. \nFans demand success, and at the end of the day, a lot of the responsibility falls onto the men out on the park. \nThis is your club’s most under pressure player ahead of the 2017 NRL season. \nBRONCOS : Ben Hunt \nHaving signed a lucrative deal with the Dragons for 2018, the spotlight is immediately on the little halfback. \nHis kicking game during the World Club Series was poor and an area of his game he’ll need to fix ASAP. \nThis is a player who has long been touted as a half with great promise and after missing out on the top prize in 2015, it’s now time for him to deliver. media_camera Ben Hunt in action for the Broncos. Picture: Peter Cronin \nIf he fails to fire he’ll be accused of checking out a year early and the critics will call for his axing. Dragons’ fans will be enraged that they invested so much coin on a dud. \nBut if he fires, he proves the Dragons hitched their wagon on the right horse and the Broncos made a huge error in letting him go. \nSEA EAGLES : Daly Cherry-Evans \nThe talk is the Sea Eagles’ star halfback is as fit as he’s ever been, which is a great sign for Manly fans because he’s going to need a huge year. \nThe common expectation is that Manly will need to red line to make a dent in the competition this year, with a tough task ahead to make the eight. \nIf Cherry-Evans plays to his price tag the odds will suddenly tip back in their favour. But if he’s even a little bit below his best, the pressure will mount, not just on him but on his coach. \nCOWBOYS : Lachlan Coote \nAfter having a career best season in 2015 as the Cowboys marched to the premiership, Coote dropped off a bit last year, particularly at the business end when his best was needed. \nNorth Queensland dominate when playmaking options other than Johnathan Thurston are firing, which puts responsibility on the shoulders of Coote and Michael Morgan. media_camera Lachlan Coote in action. Picture: Zak Simmonds \nSince his arrival in Townsville Coote has held sway as the superior No.1 in the squad. With rising star Kalyn Ponga breathing down his neck, this year things might be different. \nDRAGONS : Gareth Widdop \nHe’s one of the club’s highest paid players, he’s unsure of who’ll be his halves partner this season and he’s off-contract. \nTurning 28 this year, Widdop is an English international who should be at the stage of his career where can be the difference, but that hasn’t been the case for much of his time in the Red V. Dragons 2017 season preview 2:42 \nNRL: The Dragons are under intense pressure to improve on a horror 2016. February 22nd 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/NRL/ Dragons 2017 season preview \nThere’s no denying Widdop is a good player but the Dragons need him to be great. \nThis is his team and if he wants to keep it that way he’ll need to lead by his actions and his kicking game. \nIf he doesn’t he’ll find himself in the shop front wearing a ‘for sale’ sign around his neck. \nWARRIORS : Kieran Foran \nAfter almost 12 months in the spotlight for the wrong reasons, this fallen star is just a few weeks from a shot at redemption after being cleared to resume his career in round three. \nThe Warriors have taken their share of criticism for bringing Foran home and the club will be expecting their trust in the five-eighth to be repaid on the field. \nFor the first few weeks of his return at least, all eyes will be on Foran. media_camera \nROOSTERS : Luke Keary \nThe 2016 season was a disaster for the Roosters and one of their biggest problems was filling the playmaking hole left by the departure of James Maloney. \nThey were forced to market and Trent Robinson got his man, plugging the hole with want-away Rabbitohs star Luke Keary. Market Watch: Chook in demand 1:23 \nNRL: Emma Lawrence and Nathan Ryan present the latest edition of Market Watch including contract news at the Roosters and Broncos. February 21st 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/NRL/ Market Watch: Chook in demand \nThe club’s forward pack’s again looking mean and Robinson has plenty of options in the outside backs, so Keary looms as the difference maker to take the Chooks from finalists to genuine premiership contender. \nSHARKS : Valentine Holmes \nHe’s the young gun the Sharks couldn’t let go. Re-signed to a rich new deal, 2017 will be the first time the 21-year-old has been their first-choice fullback. \nReplacing Ben Barba, there’s no denying Holmes as some massive boots to fill. \nBarba kicked and ball played on top of his elusive kick returns. media_camera Valentine Holmes will be the Sharks’ fullback this year. Picture: Mark Cranitch. \nIn the running department Holmes will flourish but it’s the other aspects of his game that he’ll need to perfect. \nIf he can’t, they do have Gerard Beale on their books, he’s the man who’ll start the season wearing No.1 on his back if Holmes is still sidelined with a hamstring injury he picked up during the trials. \nPANTHERS : Te Maire Martin \nIf it ain’t broken don’t fix it. In the conservative world of NRL coaching, that’s an adage that is often relied upon. \nYet, despite an excellent season, halted in the second week of finals, the Panthers have made a significant off-season change to their spine, pushing Bryce Cartwright out of the No. 6 jersey and back into his favoured position in the second row. \nIt’s all to accommodate the undeniable talent of this young Kiwi five-eighth but if Martin doesn’t deliver in his partnership with Nathan Cleary it will be very easy for Anthony Griffin to switch back to what worked last year. \nBULLDOGS : Michael Lichaa \nThe Bulldogs were expecting big things when they lured the No.9 away from Cronulla and signed him on a three-year-deal worth around $900,000. \nThey let Michael Ennis go to get Lichaa to the club but the record books show Ennis went on to claim a premiership while Lichaa and the Bulldogs have experienced little more than heartache. media_camera Michael Lichaa in action. Picture: Jenny Evans \nWith the halves and coach under fire this season, the hooker is another under the spotlight. \nIt’s up to the 23-year-old to spark their attack and in an off-contract season, there’s never been a more important time to find form. \nTIGERS : Luke Brooks \nThere’s four exciting players off-contract at the Tigers and he’s been the least spoken about. \nOnce compared to the great Andrew Johns, Brooks has been surpassed by his halves partner Mitchell Moses as the half to watch. \nMoses is coming off a breakout year, while Brooks needs to show improvement if he wants the payday his teammates will attract. \nThird in missed tackle, sitting behind James Maloney and Ben Hunt, defence is another area the No.7 must address. \nHe’s a player with potential, in a team with potential. This season is the time to fulfil it. \nRAIDERS : Blake Austin \nThe Canberra playmaker recently admitted to foxsports.com.au that for the Raiders to go to the next level, he and halves partner Aidan Sezer both need to step up. \nThe Green Machine boasts a big, talented forward pack and some of the most lethal backs in the competition. media_camera Blake Austin of the Raiders. Picture: Mark Evans \nThey missed a grand final berth last season by a small margin, and with a top 17 which is almost the same as last year’s, Austin must lift his game if they’re to go all the way in 2017. \nIf he can stay relatively injury-free this season, there’s no reason why he can’t do that. \nSTORM : Cameron Munster \nGiven the way he’s performed over the past two seasons, it seems almost unfair to have Munster in this list. \nBut the fact is, he’s set for a shift from fullback to five-eighth this year so Melbourne need him to adjust quickly. media_camera Cameron Munster at Storm training. Picture: Annette Dew \nUnlike his predecessor Blake Green, the Storm have hinted they won’t restrict the 22-year-old to just one side of the field. \nThey’ll no doubt be giving him every chance to succeed in his new role. \nTITANS : Jarryd Hayne \nWith a big money deal comes a lot of expectations. That’s exactly what Gold Coast’s star fullback is faced with this season. \nThe Titans could have forgiven the code hopper for a slow start when he joined the club midway through last season, but there will be no excuses after a full pre-season. \nThe pressure is on with fans expecting a return on the club’s investment.
