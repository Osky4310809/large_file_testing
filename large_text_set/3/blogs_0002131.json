'Changing tastes' \nIn the past year, the company has introduced two new drinks - Irn Bru Xtra and Rubicon Spring - both of which contain no added sugar. \nIn a stock market announcement, AG Barr said its reformulation programme would see Irn Bru's sugar content \"reduced in line with changing consumer tastes and preferences\". \nChief executive Roger White said: \"Evidence shows that consumers want to reduce their sugar intake while still enjoying great tasting drinks. \n\"We've responded by significantly reducing sugar across our portfolio in recent years, through reformulation and innovation. \n\"Today's announcement builds on this progress and we are now expanding our successful sugar reduction plans to include our iconic Irn Bru brand.\" \nHe added: \"We will continue to respond to our consumers and adapt to their changing preferences, offering great tasting products that are right for this generation of consumers and the next.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T12:52:51.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
