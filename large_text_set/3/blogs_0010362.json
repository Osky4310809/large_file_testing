Ralph Recto said yesterday. \n“No ifs or buts. The government must have a ‘Benham Rise Protection Strategy.’ A comprehensive strategy – military, diplomatic, economic – in holding on to and developing Benham Rise,” Recto said. \nRecto made the call following reports that the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has sent a note verbale to the Chinese embassy to clarify the reported presence of a Chinese survey ship near Benham Rise, a 13-million hectare underwater plateau off the coast of Aurora province. \n“We cannot be caught unaware. There should be no Pearl Harbor moment that will surprise us that other countries have installed themselves on what by law is part of our territory,” he said. \nDefense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana had reported the Chinese survey ship was seen plying the waters of Benham Rise for around three months. \nWithout a protection strategy, Recto said the Benham Rise may easily fall prey not only to poachers but foreign countries interested in exploring the plateau’s marine and mineral resources.   \n“We have practically lost the seas west and north of us. We cannot be encircled. The eastern side of the country should be defended as well,” Recto said, referring to the Chinese reclamation in the South China Sea. \nRecto, however, was quick to explain that he was not referring to China. \n“I am not singling out China. But this goes out to all countries who might be tempted by the riches underneath the Benham Rise,” he said. \nAside from diverse marine life, Benham Rise is also believed to be a rich source of manganese and natural gas. \nRecto stressed the government must not allow the eastern side of the country’s territorial waters to be partitioned “like a frontier homestead or cut up into blocks to be controlled and exploited by others.” \nHe said the area is crucial to the country’s future as it is likely to have huge gas deposits and continues to be a major fishing area. \n“With large swathes of our western seas now declared a no catch zone to our fishermen, this will provide an alternative venue,” he said. \nRecto said the government must also focus its attention to other areas on the Pacific side of the country, which have lagged economically. \nThe senator pointed out the country’s eastern seaboard has always been the unattended portion of the archipelago. \nRecto said the Senate, for its part, should consider expediting a bill filed by Sen. Juan Edgardo Angara providing for the creation of a Benham Rise Development Authority (BRDA) – the lead agency mandated to conduct scientific research and exploration in the plateau. \nOnce equipped with such information, the BRDA shall take the lead in formulating and implementing a development roadmap for Benham Rise, ensuring that it is aligned with the Philippine Development Plan.
