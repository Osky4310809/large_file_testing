Written in 1991 by Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken, the original \"Beauty and the Beast\" song won the 1992 Oscar for Best Original Song. The song was originally sung by Angela Lansbury and then given a pop duet makeover by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. This time around, six-time Grammy award winner Ron Fair will be producing the song alongside Mitchell Leib, Disney's president of Music and Soundtracks. Beauty and the Beast will hit theaters March 17.
