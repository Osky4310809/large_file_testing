Prince William and Kate Middleton, parents to Prince George, 3, and Princess Charlotte, 22 months, announced the news Friday via Kensington Palace’s Twitter account: “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have announced that Prince George will attend Thomas’s Battersea School in London from September 2017.” The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have announced that Prince George will attend Thomas's Battersea School in London from September 2017. \n— Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 24, 2017 The little prince, who turns 4 on July 22, will attend the private school, which has 540 students between the ages of 4 and 13, costs $22,000 per year, and boasts the motto “Be kind.” Model Cara Delevingne and singer Florence Welch are reportedly former students. According to a story published by ABC News , principal Ben Thomas previously penned a letter to parents explaining Prince George’s arrival. “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have decided on Prince George’s next school,” he wrote. “We are delighted to let you know that they have chosen Thomas’s and that from September Prince George will be a pupil at Thomas’s Battersea.

We are honoured that the aims and values of Thomas’s reflect those that Their Royal Highnesses would like for Prince George’s education. We are deeply conscious of the trust that they, like all Thomas’s parents, are placing in us and we hope very much to live up to their expectations.” The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George, and Princess Charlotte. Prince George’s new preschool plans were announced this week. (Photo: Getty Images) More Thomas had previously shared insight into the Battersea community, according to the Sun , stating in the 2017 Tatler school guide , “The children are delightful — parents slightly less so.” The duke and duchess are known for their offbeat ruling style (skipping family holidays , posing for selfies with fans), so it’s not surprising they didn’t choose the Wetherby School near Kensington Palace, which William and Harry attended. The new school will be a big change for George, who is currently enrolled at Westacre Montessori, near the family’s 10-bedroom Anmer Hall country home. The $50-per-day nursery, which he’s attended since January 2016, enrolls only 30 students and, according to People , is “the ideal fit” for the prince, who has learned “ simple practical activities ” such as fastening buttons and learning to sit for story time. His classmates call him “ George ,” and apparently he’s learned a lot — in February, Kate Middleton told a fan that her son wasn’t with her that day because “he’s at his Montessori nursery today making pancakes.” The royal family has been busy — Kate and William recently moved from Anmer Hall to Kensington Palace after spending $6.5 million in renovations. The couple also just returned from a two-day trip to Paris, where they met President François Hollande and victims of the Bataclan Theatre and Nice killings, and attended a rugby game. And in July the family will head to Germany and Poland on a royal tour. Adorable school photos to come!
