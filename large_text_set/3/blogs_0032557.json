The show was huge at the time: student TV lounges were packed when it was on. The production team contacted the university to find extras; as a member of the drama group, I was very keen. I was told to turn up one morning at a hall in town where I would be fitted with a costume and given a role. \nI was going to be a peasant, but when another chap was too short to fit into John Cleese ’s Sir Lancelot the Brave costume (to be his stand-in while John played the role of Tim the Enchanter), we swapped parts. I’m 6ft 2in. There was only one costume as the film was shot on a shoestring. (They famously used coconuts to mimic hooves because they couldn’t afford real horses.) \nWe filmed this scene in a disused quarry near the Duke’s Pass in the Trossachs. We set off in a minibus about 8am: me, Eric Idle , Michael Palin , Terry Jones , a couple of crew and two extras. Graham Chapman was sitting in the front, drinking a can of lager. He was struggling with his drinking at the time. They were all hungover; they’d been in a pub the night before, and Graham had scandalously kissed every man at the bar and been kicked out. I was 20, a decade or so younger than them. \nJohn’s character was a wizard who emitted explosions from his hands and a staff; pipes carrying the gas were laid across the paths. I wore a helmet over my face and had to be careful where I walked. That was the only downside of taking John’s place – nobody can see my face. He starts the scene standing on a pinnacle, with a sheer drop either side. He was up there for nearly an hour, and it was pretty windy. The team kept shouting: “Are you all right?” The extent of my acting involved pretending my imaginary horse was rearing when the bangs went off. \nThere was a lot of sitting around in our knitted chainmail, waiting for the light to improve. But I was awestruck. I spent most of the day with Eric, Michael and Graham, doing the Guardian crossword . There were some surreal conversations. One concerned how the Pythons would survive if they were stranded in the jungle after a plane crash: who would make the best hunter, hut-builder – but the overriding dilemma was who they’d eat first if they ran out of food. ‘It captures a time before Dad became a public figure’: at home with Seamus Heaney Read more \nMy other scene was the last one of the film; I played one of the policemen who bundle the knights into a van. The last shot features me, standing behind another policeman who puts his hand over the camera, turning the screen black. Local kids who’d come to watch flicked me the V sign, thinking I was a real copper. \nThe following year, I went to see the film in Edinburgh in a double bill with Woody Allen’s Manhattan . I loved it, and was thrilled my scenes hadn’t been cut. Seeing myself standing with the Pythons still gives me a kick. \n• Are you in a notable photograph?
