For it's upcoming season it will visit somewhere a little closer to home: the 2016 election. \nCreator Ryan Murphy stopped by Watch What Happens Live ! on Wednesday night and told host Andy Cohen that the as-yet-untitled season will focus on \"the election that we just went through.\" When a clearly-shocked Cohen asked if that meant President Trump would be featured as a character, Murphy responded, \"Maybe.\" \nThe theme for American Horror Story 's sixth season, Roanoke , was kept under wraps until the premiere. Following its finale in November, the official social media accounts for the show shared a seven-second teaser that appeared to be about the forthcoming season, entitled \"Sweet Dreams.\" The teaser cuts images of waves with the stick dolls the spirits hung around the North Carolina farmhouse in Season 6. \"The monsters are all gone,\" the caption reads. Given Murphy's announcement, the teaser was likely a red herring, as the show has done before. In the lead up to Season 6, FX debuted multiple teasers displaying different potential themes for the season, that were intentional misdirects. \"We thought it would really be fun to keep it a mystery,\" Murphy told reporters in the lead-up to that season. The monsters are all gone. #AHSRoanoke pic.twitter.com/Ikj0bblc61", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:55:07.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
