Footballers spend four years doing their badges, spending a fortune and nobody gets a chance to manage at the top level. \n\"This is a good job. Hull are a good team, great stadium, some very good players. \n\"What's [Silva] know about the Premier League? What’s he know?\" \nHull City insist Phelan sacking a necessity \nFellow pundit Phil Thompson added: \"He's not got a clue ... It's another slap in the face to all our British coaches and managers, it's embarrassing.\" \nSilva, who has signed a contract until the end of the season, began his KC Stadium tenure with a 2-0 win over fellow Premier League strugglers Swansea City in the FA Cup third round.
