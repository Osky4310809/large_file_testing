I am asking you as mayor, help me,\" Van Duyne said. \"I need to get to the bottom and find out, are there people in my community whose rights are not being observed?\" \nRep. Kyle Biedermann, R- Fredericksburg, hosted the forum, which focused on strategies for \"defending against radical Islamic terrorism in Texas.\" Van Duyne spoke of the Islamic Tribunal, a group of Dallas-area imams that she famously opposed in a Facebook post in February 2015. She accused the organization of bypassing American courts by offering, for a fee, to mediate disputes among their worshippers according to an Islamic code called Shariah. \nRep. Briscoe Cain, R-Baytown, said he would call on Tom Vick, president-elect of the State Bar of Texas, to investigate the tribunal. Irving City Council backs state bill Muslims say targets them \nVan Duyne's opposition rests heavily on Shariah law's unequal treatment of men and women, she said. \n\"When you have a law or legal basis where women are not treated to the same respects or same rights as men, when you have women whose testimony is equal to half that of a man's, how can you defend that if that is happening in our country?\" Van Duyne said. \"And I couldn't, and I spoke out.\" \nRep. Valoree Swanson, R-Houston, said she supported Van Duyne for \"defending basic human rights for women.\" The Irving mayor also received thanks from panel member Rep. Mike Lang, R-Granbury, for her \"courage and strength.\" \n\"We want American law for American courts,\" said Rep. Tony Tinderholt, R-Arlington, who sat next to Biedermann on the forum's panel. Biedermann would not offer a timeline or specify what actions the legislature could take to fight radical Islam in Texas, but he called the forum a \"fact-finding\" mission to help make those decisions. \nThe forum also included speeches from both local and national individuals involved in combatting radical Islam. Biedermann did not offer a timeline on when he would have actionable items for lawmakers based on the forum's findings. \nAs Van Duyne began speaking at the forum, members of San Antonio's chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations held a news conference at the Capitol in opposition. Local religious leaders spoke out against the forum and on controversial letters they received from Biedermann. \nThe Fredericksburg Republican, along with two ideological organizations that claim to fight domestic Islamic extremism, sent mosque leaders documents asking them to reject \"institutionalized Sharia,\" pledge safety for those who leave Islam and support federal legislation that declares the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization. \nReligious leaders at the news conference said the letters were intimidation tactics promoting \"false patriotism,\" and vowed to vote representatives who promoted these tactics out of office. \n\"Such oaths inhibit the freedom of speech and association, single out vulnerable communities and provide no national security benefit,\" said Rebecca Robertson, legal and policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas. \"They are designed strictly to intimidate, but no Texan of any faith should be afraid to worship whom and how she pleases.\" Muslims and supporters call for understanding in 'friendship, not suspicion' \nVan Duyne closed her speech to the forum with a quote from her original Facebook post about the tribunal in 2015. \"Our nation cannot be so overly sensitive in defending other cultures, that we stop protecting our own,\" she said to applause. \nTensions ran high following the event. When a reporter asked Biedermann if he would hold similar forums on radical Christianity or radical Judaism, former Rep. Molly White, R-Belton, interjected, \"How dare you say that? How dare you say that, you low-life son-of-a [expletive]?\" \nWhite made headlines after she placed an Israeli flag on her desk and instructed her staff to ask visitors on Texas Muslim Capitol Day to renounce Islamic terrorist groups and publicly pledge allegiance to America and its laws in January 2015. Texas Muslim Capitol Day, which began in 2003, occurs Jan. 31.
