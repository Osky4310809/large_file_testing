When in the realm of depression, it can be dark, cold and numbing. But sometimes, a light can appear—a voice telling us, “It’s going to be okay.” \nSometimes that voice does not come from another, but it emanates from our own heart. May your heart always help the brave wolf inside you to fight the darkness and lead your beautiful soul into the light. \n~ \nYour heart is strong, brave wolf Your body a work of art Your soul glistens in the moonlight For you are the stuff of stars \nYour mind, so clear and still Your hands, so soft and warm Don’t be afraid, my love Should there ever be a storm \nYou are my shelter When I am with you, I know, we’ll never be alone \nLike a flower in spring, You long for the rain, So beautiful, yet frail You wish you could escape the pain \nBut my love, my brave wolf— You are important to me You are not weak You are simply wild and free \nYour eyes, so cosmic Your hair long and flowing You are special \nSo when you fall into the abyss Surrounded by a black sky Reach out your hand And hold your head high \nMy love, my brave wolf, I am always here You have no need to fear \nYour passionate nature is beautiful You could set the world on fire Hold faith in your heart Like those you admire \nBut that does not make you fragile It makes you brave You are powerful and agile \nMy brave wolf, my love— Though some may not understand, You are not alone— \nAs I lead you from the dark clouds Into the stars above May you leave your hurt behind And float with me, my love? \nYour heart is strong, brave wolf Your body a work of art Your soul glistens in the moonlight For you are the stuff of stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T01:35:14.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
