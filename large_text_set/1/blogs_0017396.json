Tim Scott (R-S.C.) offered a sharp response. \nIn a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the president pro tempore of the Senate, Obama wrote: “Of the nearly 800 detainees at one time held at the facility, today only 41 remain.” \n“There is simply no justification beyond politics for the Congress’ insistence on keeping the facility open,” the president wrote. “They have played politics above the ongoing costs to taxpayers, our relationships with our allies and the threat posed to U.S. national security by leaving open a facility that governments around the world condemn and which hinders rather than helps our fight against terrorism.” Obama sends letter to Congressional leadership on Guantanamo pic.twitter.com/EtiegLUHCY \n— Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) January 19, 2017 \nAs a candidate for president, Obama pledged to close the facility — nicknamed “Gitmo” — but wrote that “politics” and “members of Congress who obstruct efforts to close the facility” prevented him from fulfilling his promise. \n“Guantanamo is contrary to our values and undermines our standing in the world, and it is long past time to end this chapter in our history,” Obama added. \nWhen The Hill tweeted out the story of the president’s letter, Scott had a one-word response to the president’s plea: No. \n— Tim Scott (@SenatorTimScott) January 19, 2017 \nScott added that he doesn’t think arguments for closing the prison facility “add up.” In addition to recidivism rate, here’s why the arguments for closing #Gitmo don’t add up: https://t.co/1i6AlJoETW \n— Tim Scott (@SenatorTimScott) January 19, 2017 \nSen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) also reiterated his opposition to closing Gitmo. As I've said, not on my watch. https://t.co/Y2uJMHUC3o \n— Pat Roberts (@SenPatRoberts) January 19, 2017 \nRyan has also repeatedly expressed opposition to closing the prison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:33:34.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
