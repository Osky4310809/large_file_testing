Even we didn't imagine we will do it in months. Aadhaar enabled us to acquire a million customers a day, which is unheard of in the industry. \nAmbani expounded Jio's role in the smooth running of industries. \nJio was conceived at a time when the world was fast digitising. What the Jio platform offers is to partner with the next generation to solve problems for India to make sure our industries are more productive, he said. \nAccording to him, the digital play is sweeping the world as the fourth industrial revolution, adding that data is the \"new oil\". \nTo my mind, data is the new natural resource. In that sense, India is blessed with 1.3 billion people. For it to have real value it has to be processed into intelligence. Data is the new oil and its benefit is immense to society. India with its young population will have a competitive advantage, he added. \nPredicting that India will be a key player in this revolution, Ambani said the country's large talent base will give India a competitive edge. He expressed hope that Jio could help make India one of the top ten counties in terms of broadband access, elevating it from the lowly 155th position it held in 2015. \nDescribing the protectionist statements by US president Donald Trump as a blessing in disguise for the Indian IT sector , Ambani advised the industry to focus on the home market. Calling for looking at the larger picture of helping millions to resolve their problems with adoption of digital technologies, he said digitisation will continue to face challenges in terms of privacy, security and data theft.

We really have to adopt next generation technologies. \nlaunched on September 5 last year with cheap data services and free calls, the offer will now be extended till 30 June 2017, prior to its previous announcement of March 31. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:38:09.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
