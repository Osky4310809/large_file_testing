Lewandowski (@CLewandowski_) January 6, 2017 Congratulations to Jane Timken, just elected Ohio Republican Party chair https://t.co/bSUFOCBqV9 — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) January 6, 2017 \nTwo Ohio GOP sources confirmed that while Trump made his support for Timken clear when calling committee members, he didn't go so far as to bash Borges. Still, the calls followed a notably acrimonious relationship between Borges and Trump and his Ohio state team during the course of the presidential campaign. \nTrump's team had always eyed Borges with some suspicion because of his close ties to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, one of the most prominent \"NeverTrump\" holdouts in the GOP. Both Trump and Kasich allies acknowledged during the campaign that the governor's political operation largely sat the race out — with some in Trump's team expressing concerns that Kasich's network was quietly sabotaging the Trump campaign. \nOne Trump loyalist described it as \"the quiet conversations with county party chairmen saying, you don't have to help, you don't have to put your donors on it.\" \nAnd Borges was publicly critical of Trump, refusing for months to say whether he'd support the GOP nominee and calling his campaign \"on life support\" after one of the general election debates. \nHis comments prompted Trump's Ohio campaign director to publicly break with the state party in October, accusing Borges of \"duplicity.\" \nThe ongoing feud at the time was seen as a potentially damaging development for the Trump campaign in a must-win swing state, but Trump ended up winning Ohio by about 8 points — a striking reversal in fortunes for the GOP, after losing Ohio in 2008 and 2012.
