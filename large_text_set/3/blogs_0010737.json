Slot to Georgia Links \nNCAA Tournament hopes didn’t materialize for Georgia after its 19-14 campaign but the Bulldogs will get to play in College Basketball’s version of a consolation prize, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). \nThe Bulldogs have been selected by the NIT as a No. 2 seed and will take on Belmont on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET. It marks a rematch from the first round of last year's NIT when the Bulldogs, as a No. 3 seed took on the Bruins, who were a No. 6 seed. (Photo: UGA Athletics: John Kelley) Not a member?

Against the field of 68 the Bulldogs went 1-10 with a win versus Vanderbilt and losses to Kentucky (3), Florida (2), South Carolina (2), Arkansas (1), Kansas (1), and Marquette (1). \nThis marks the third time in the past four years the Bulldogs have made the NIT. The only time they didn’t was the 2014-2015 season when they made the NCAA Tournament. \nIf the Bulldogs win their first-round match up with Belmont they will take on the winner of Indiana (18-15) and Georgia Tech (17-15) in round two.
