They drive the fashion industry while raising their kids, building a home and taking care of everyone else around them. Because ... women. It also goes without saying that we obviously have a major girl crush on each one of them-for their style, their drive, their curated Instagram accounts and overall badassery. So, on International Women's Day, we bring you 5 style MVP's you should follow not just on Instagram, but in life, in general. 1. Anamika Khanna A post shared by Anamika Khanna (@anamikakhanna.in) on Mar 7, 2017 at 1:15pm PST \nWho: OG couturier \nPersonal style 101: Desi-meets-sporty \nBragging rights: This elusive designer is one of the few (and only) A-list women couturiers working in fashion now. She is known for her heavily copied \"Anamika\" Indian-wear designs (seriously, copycats, no one can do it like her, though, so don't even try). Think tiny cholis paired with sensually draped dhotis and sheer, embroidered capes. Anamika's style is eternal. Just ask super-fans, Sonam and Rhea Kapoor! 2. Rhea Kapoor A post shared by Rhea Kapoor (@rheakapoor) on Nov 12, 2016 at 2:30am PST \nWho: Producer and Stylist \nPersonal style 101: All-black-everything \nBragging rights: Long before airport style looks and #OOTD's, Rhea Kapoor with her sister, Sonam created the idea of actresses as fashion icons in India. And they didn't even have to try because her sense of style is so sound. She's an A-list producer, a fashion enthusiast, an influencer and a mega cool chick all wrapped into one. 3. Masaba A post shared by Masabs (@masabagupta) on Feb 17, 2017 at 11:11pm PST \nWho: India's #1 Millennial fashion designer \nPersonal style 101: Va-va-voom curves \nBragging rights: Masaba is always ahead of the curve. She understands her audience and delivers every time. She was also-at a very young age-responsible for creating the print phenomenon in India. 4. Pernia Qureshi A post shared by Pernia Qureshi (@perniaq) on Feb 19, 2017 at 6:15am PST \nWho: Entrepreneur \nPersonal style 101: Championing young designers. Legs for days. \nBragging rights: She was the mastermind behind Sonam Kapoor's career-defining, Aisha . But it was with Pernia's Pop Up Shop that Ms. Qureshi defined (and refined) the idea of shopping online in India. Think glossy images, shop by editorials, celebrity editors and beautifully curated collections. 5. Ami Patel A post shared by Ami Patel (@stylebyami) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:57am PST \nWho: Celebrity Stylist \nPersonal style 101: Classic \nBragging rights: She's one of those low-key celebrity stylists that believe in quality work. Ami is responsible for styling some of the biggest A-listers in town. Whether it's Kangana's stellar sartorial outings, Alia's girl-next-door vibe or Priyanka's breaking-the-internet-worthy appearances- she does them all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T10:44:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
