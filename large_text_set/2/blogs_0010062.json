The Bennet family in happier times \nMike, 57, succumbed to a brain tumour on February 6, surrounded by Julie and their children.

It was published as Julie lay dying in a Merseyside hospice herself. \nThey wanted the world to know how much they loved each other - and were together until the very end. \nFamily friend, Heather Heaton Gallagher, a spokesperson for the children, said: “Words cannot express our desperate sadness for such a beautiful family. \n“The Bennets are known to all for their generosity, their love for life, and their down to earth approach. An online campaign was launched to support the children \n\"Julie has kept the children in a normal routine whilst dealing with Mike’s illness over the past few years.

When faced with a devastating diagnosis, she never gave up, she was always focused on taking care of other people, I recall a rare moment of sadness she shared with me, saying: ‘My children don’t deserve this’ and that was Julie, no matter how upset she was personally her focus was on her kids.” \nAnyone who wants to support the family with raffle prizes for fundraiser events or to help in the campaign please contact Sue Wright on 07471030500 and go to JustGiving .
