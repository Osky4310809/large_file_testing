If you want to see a fight, go and watch wrestling. It’s not safe riding the subway, but I have to do it because that’s how I get to work.”\nSome of the assaults are related to hate crimes, said NYPD Transit Bureau Chief Joseph Fox.\nNot only are riders attacking each other more often, but the amount of hate-related graffiti — mostly swastikas — scrawled in the system has skyrocketed in the past year, he said.\nSEE ALSO \nNew Yorkers band together to clean Swastika-covered subway car 0:0 New Yorkers teamed up to remove swastikas and anti-Semitic messages... Those incidents are up from three at this point in 2016 to 19 this year through Sunday.\nFox said the subway crime numbers have climbed along with those throughout the Big Apple.\n“This is reflective of an increase in our city, which is also reflective of the national discourse,” Fox said at the monthly MTA NYC Transit committee meeting.\nRiders say they see more passengers getting picked on for being different.\n“I see gay people being disrespected all the time,” said Frankie Soto, 34, from Queens.\n“They’ll just be standing there or sitting down, then someone just comes out of nowhere and starts bothering them for no reason. They start talking bad about them, saying ,‘You f–kers.’ ”\nAdditional reporting by Shari Logan \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:15:53.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
