Then act like one.\" \nVoteVets , the largest left-leaning veterans PAC in the US, just dropped a new ad aimed directly at Donald Trump, and aired it on Morning Joe— which has already upped its ad prices because of Trump's known fandom — to make sure he sees it. \n\"President Trump, I hear you watch the morning shows,\" the ad's voiceover says, while the narrator does squats in his garage. \"Here's what I do every morning.\" \n\"Look, you lost the popular vote, you're having trouble drawing a crowd, and your approval rating keeps sinking,\" he continues, \"but kicking thousands of my fellow veterans off their health insurance by killing the Affordable Care Act and banning Muslims won't help. That's not the America I sacrificed for.\" \nAs the camera pulls out, we see that the Afghanistan vet only has one leg after losing the other in combat. \"You want to be a legitimate president, sir? Then act like one.\" \nA statement from VoteVets explains that the ad seems like the best way to speak directly to the president, since he took down the White House comment line and still has yet to launch that veteran hotline that he promised during his campaign. \n\"We're officially putting Mr. Trump on notice,\" the statement reads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:30:10.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
