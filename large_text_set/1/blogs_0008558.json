Slowly. George R.R. Martin responds to a fan's question on his blog, but the answer is less than definite. \nNot even Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) knows when the next \"Game of Thrones\" book will hit stores.

That's why it was so surprising on Tuesday when the author actually answered a reader question about \"Winds of Winter,\" the scheduled sixth book in the \" Song of Ice and Fire \" saga that inspired HBO's hit show \" Game of Thrones .\" \nThe fan certainly knew how to wheedle an answer out of the author, writing on Martin's blog : \"I respect you immensely and do not want you to rush or release anything until you are completely satisfied with it. That being said, it has been a whole year since we have received an update. You have placated our hunger with another superb sample and for that, we are grateful.
