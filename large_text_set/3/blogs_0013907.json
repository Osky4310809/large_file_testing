Arroyo Seco Weekend is described as “a world class culture event featuring three stages of live music along with curated menus from LA’s celebrated restaurants and chefs plus craft beer & wine.” \nTom Petty & The Heartbreakers and Mumford and Sons top the inaugural lineup. They’ll be joined by the likes of Alabama Shakes, Weezer, Broken Social Scene, The Shins, Andrew Bird, Dawes, and Charles Bradley & His Extraordinaires. \nAlso playing are The Meters, Fitz & The Tantrums, Live, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real, Roy Ayers, Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Galactic, The Revivalists, The Mowgli’s, ZZ Ward, Con Brio, and Jamtown featuring G. Love and Donovan Frankenreiter. \nPerhaps most exciting, however, is the appearance of actor Jeff Goldblum, who will perform alongside the Mildred Snitzer Orchestra. \nSingle-day, two-day, and VIP passes go on sale Monday, March 20th at 11:00 a.m. local time.
