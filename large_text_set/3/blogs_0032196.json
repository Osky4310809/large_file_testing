Ofcom has launched a consultation to slash this by 40% to £52.77 a year by 2020/21. Broadband users in line for millions in Ofcom compensation plan Read more \nThere are estimated to be between 2.4 million and 3 million non-BT customers currently taking the 40Mb package via Openreach, meaning the company’s fees will fall by close to £100m based on estimated customer levels. \n“We would expect these savings to be passed on to residential customers through cheaper prices,” said Ofcom. “This promotes competition in the superfast broadband service most used today by consumers.” \nOfcom said that it intends to continue to allow Openreach to set its own wholesale pricing for the fastest broadband speed packages. \nIt hopes that this cap on what Openreach is allowed to charge at the 40Mb speed will be enough of an incentive to encourage investment from BT and rivals in focussing on building ultrafast and full-fibre networks. \n“Ofcom wants to provide incentives to invest in ultrafast networks, while promoting competition and protecting consumers from high prices,” said Jonathan Oxley, competition group director at Ofcom. \n“People need reliable phone and broadband services more than ever. We’re making sure the market is delivering the best possible services for homes and business across the UK.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T10:54:45.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
