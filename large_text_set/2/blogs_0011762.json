When I say to public defenders that I argued the Brady rule, they genuflect.” Mr. Brady was paroled after 18 years, married and became a truck driver. “I think that the only crime he ever committed was robbing this guy,” Mr. Bamberger said. “I don’t know who killed the man, and I don’t think either of them know.” Edward Clinton Bamberger Jr. was born on July 2, 1926, in Baltimore, the son of Edward Clinton Bamberger Sr. and the former Ann Russo. He earned a bachelor of science degree from Loyola College in Baltimore (now Loyola University Maryland) and graduated from the Georgetown University Law Center. His wife, the former Katharine Kelehar, died in December. He is survived by their son, Edward C. Bamberger III, known as Ned, and three grandchildren. A daughter, Christine Ann Bamberger, died in 1998. After serving in the Johnson administration, Mr. Bamberger was recruited by a former Georgetown classmate, the Rev. Robert Drinan, to be dean of the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America in Washington. (Father Drinan, who became a congressman from Massachusetts, was on the search committee.) Mr. Bamberger became executive vice president of the Legal Services Corporation, a congressionally chartered successor to the program he had headed earlier, and then joined the law school faculty at the University of Maryland. Throughout his career, Mr. Bamberger encouraged lawyers to offer free counsel to clients who could not afford standard fees. In 1966, in the Notre Dame Law Review , he wrote that the Johnson legal-services program was “national recognition that the poor are least equipped with the resources and resilience to obtain fair treatment and, accordingly, least able to cope with the landlord, the merchant, the welfare official, the policeman — people you and I handle with relative ease in the unlikely event we ever see them.” \n  Writing about Mr. Bamberger in an email, Prof. Michael Millemann of the Carey School recalled that as a young legal aid lawyer in 1969, “what I valued the most was Clint’s commitment to our independence — our right to represent the poor in the same way big private law firms represented the rich.” “His legacy? His fire for justice,” he added, “and his demonstration of the ways in which you can and must combine idealism and pragmatism to achieve it.” At his own law firm, Piper & Marbury in Baltimore, Mr. Bamberger helped establish the Reginald Heber Smith Community Lawyer Fellowship to subsidize young lawyers who wanted to work in legal aid programs. In an interview, he explained how the fellowships got their name. “Reginald Heber Smith was a Boston Brahmin lawyer who wrote a study of legal aid in 1920 that is a landmark work that refuted the claims of some bar leaders that poor people had plenty of legal services,” Mr. Bamberger said. “And we thought if we named them Reginald Heber Smith — a nice Brahmin name — nobody would ever think that they were subversive infiltrators.” A version of this article appears in print on February 17, 2017, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: E. Clinton Bamberger, Defense Lawyer With a ‘Fire for Justice,’ Is Dead at 90.
