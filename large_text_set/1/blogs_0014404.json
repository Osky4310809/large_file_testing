The story develops very slowly, without hinting at any kind of mystery or reveals to come. It’s more about exploring a strange and intriguing character. This wouldn’t work so well for a weekly, episodic series if it weren’t for Tom Hardy. His performance alone is enough to carry a show that doesn’t always appear to be going anywhere.\nThat said, this episode began to show clearer signs of the direction the story is taking. It also raises the stakes considerably in the very first scene, which is something the show definitely needed. We begin with the East India Company, where Stuart Strange threatens to have Cholmondeley fired if Delaney isn’t killed. Delaney appears to be using the land he inherited to begin his trading company. He’s dug up his diamonds and bought a ship for “The Delaney Nootka Trading Company.” Strange reasons that the Americans must be behind Delaney’s betrayal of king and country.\nMeanwhile, Delaney returns from buying his ship to find his horse missing. A note reading Atticus has been left behind. Delaney knows who Atticus is and goes to get his horse back. It appears Delaney is on slightly friendlier terms with Atticus than you’d expect. Even a broody mumbler like him is bound to make at least one friend, I guess. Atticus informs Delaney that a man came to him a while back trying to have his father killed. Atticus says he refused and gave Delaney a vague description. Delaney enlists Atticus to be his eyes and ears around the city.\nStephen Graham as Atticus and Tom Hardy as Delaney. (Photo: Via FX)\nIt’s not long before Delaney learns that someone is trying to kill him as well. He’s met by a girl named Winter, who lives in the brothel. She overheard a silver-toothed man speaking with Madame Helga, planning to kill Delaney. Winter takes him to the silver-toothed man’s ship, but Delaney finds no clues as to the man’s identity and sets the ship on fire. When he returns to find Winter gone, he questions Helga at the brothel. She initially denies that the girl exists, but Delaney figures out that Winter is her daughter and enlists Helga in finding the silver-toothed man.\nDelaney spends most of the episode trying to figure out who is after him. He takes a break to inspect his new ship and, upon realizing it once carried slaves, is overcome by flashbacks to the sunken slave ship. He strips naked, chants and carves a bird symbol into the ship’s floorboards. He then visits a doctor who is actually an American spy. He requests a meeting with the American president, but the doctor pulls a gun on him and forces him to leave.\nNow is when things begin to pick up. At the reading of his father’s will, it is revealed that nothing was left to Delaney’s sister and everything is going to him. The move makes his sister’s husband, Thorne Geary angry. Geary causes a scene in front of the entire court, allowing Atticus to get a good look at him. Atticus, who had been watching from the back of the courtroom, informs Delaney that Geary is the man who wanted his father killed. OK Taboo , you have my attention.\nJessie Buckley as Lorna Delaney. (Photo: Via FX)\nSuddenly, a new challenger appears. An actress who says she’s Delaney’s father’s wife appears, asserting some claim over the inheritance. Her claim turns out to be true, but Nootka will only go to her if Delaney dies. There also appears to be some sexual tension between them, because the show takes its title literally. Speaking of which, Delaney goes out that night to creep on his sister some more. She asks if the rumors of his cannibalism are true. He offers to tell her everything if she comes with him. She refuses.\nAs Delaney walks away, he notices a woman following him. It turns out to be the silver-toothed man holding a knife. After a brutally-shot struggle, Delaney slices the man up and takes a big bite out of his throat. Guess we know where those cannibalism rumors come from. Unfortunately, Delaney took a knife to the gut in the fight. As he passes out, he flashes back to Africa and the credits roll.\nAs the series goes on, it’s becoming clear that maybe this shouldn’t have been a weekly series on a traditional cable channel. This is a show that takes its time to put all its pieces into place. The story didn’t even really get going until the final scenes of last night’s episode. That would be easier to handle if it were on Netflix, Hulu or Amazon. If every episode were available right away to binge over a weekend, the slow start wouldn’t stand out so much. As it is now, we have to wait a week to see if the story will go anywhere.\nWhat saves the show is the acting. Tom Hardy is still phenomenal in this series. His performance draws you in and makes you care about this strange, dark anti-hero. Even though the story is slow to start, Hardy makes up for it with a performance that’s impossible to turn away from. He’s created an interesting character here, and you can’t wait to see what he does next. The rest of the cast is fantastic as well. Having Sherlock ‘s Mark Gatiss show up as a gout-ridden prince was a welcome surprise, and his scenery-chewing performance added some much-needed levity to a brooding show. The cast makes me want to keep watching. That will likely be enough to carry the show until the story finds its rhythm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:41:43.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
