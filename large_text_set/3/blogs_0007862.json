Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDimitri Payet has given a damning indictment on West Ham – and the “bored” star claimed he had to leave the London club when the post was his side's man-of-the-match in their December win over Hull. \nThe France playmaker forced a way out of the Hammers in January to return to his former club Marseille. \nSpeaking for the first time about the move to L'Equipe, Payet claimed: “I no longer wanted to play in a team at the bottom of the Premier League. Our way of approaching matches, I didn't like the defensive system put in place. \n\"Playing 4-5-1, I could have all the liberty in the world – it was complicated to express myself. You can say I was bored, yes. Payet admits he was bored at West Ham (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n\"I was going through matches without any pleasure. Then I had contact with Marseille, especially with Rudi Garcia who has a philosophy I know well. The choice was quick. If I had waited six months, I was losing six months. \n“I didn't hesitate. With West Ham at home against Hull (on December 17) we won 1-0 and they hit the woodwork four times. \n\"In the changing room, everyone was pleased but the man of the match that day had been the post. I thought I would not progress anymore. \n\"On the contrary, I took the risk of going backwards. I needed another challenge.” Read More The French star forced his way out of the east London club in January (Photo: Dan Mullan) \nPayet also admitted family problems had also played a part in his desire to return to France. \n“That was a contributory factor in my decision,” he said. “When everything goes well on the pitch, it is because everything is going well off it. When it is complicated family wise, it stops you being at ease in your job.” \nPayet, who agreed a bumper new contract last season, claimed he was forced to go on strike to get his transfer – and he had wanted to go since the summer. \n“I warned them: I was going to do it and maybe they didn't take me seriously. I told them face to face that I accepted the consequences of my actions. Slaven Bilic chats with Payet prior to training (Photo: Avril Husband) \n\"Slaven Bilic knew that I wanted to go elsewhere. Already at the start of the season, when I left the Euros, we had talked about it. \n\"The club shut the door. I respected the choice. But the sporting situation deteriorated. In January, I said to him that I wanted to leave for Marseille and not anywhere else, asking him to pass the message to the directors. The day he said the answer was a definite no, I replied to him that I would no longer play for West Ham.” \nAsked if he had held any grudges against the club, Payet continued: “With the coach, no. I had warned him: the biggest person affected by the situation was him.

The West Ham players even gave me their support, and there was still one who congratulated me on the goal against Lorient (March 5).” \nFrom being a crowd favourite, Payet suffered a fan backlash. “That is normal,” he admitted. “They hated me as much as they loved me. It is for that reason that the reactions were so violent. I cannot blame them. During a year and a half, they gave me a lot and I will never forget it. \n“Was I scared? No. It was more complicated for my family. A lot of things were said, but there were no worries with my car, for example. Me, I continued to live normally. I had a stand-off with Saint-Etienne ( in January 2011) and you know the fans there....” Payet was desperate to rejoin Marseille (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nPayet's insistence on rejoining Marseille ruled out any move to other Premier League or top European clubs. \n“The most important thing is that I am where I wanted to be,” he said. “And the best is yet to come. I didn't think about turning my back on the Premier League. Certain people spoke nastily but that re mains their opinion. \n“When you announce you want €100m (now £87m)... If there had been clubs interested, the negotiations would not have gone very far. It is because of that too that I blame the West Ham directors. I could have gone into a standoff last summer. Last August was badly dealt with.” poll loading Who will have the last laugh? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T12:11:30.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
