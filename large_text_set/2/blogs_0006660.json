By moumita bhattacharjee | Published:  30 am Kaabil stars Hrithik Roshan and Yami Gautam twin in black and grey at the airport \nHrithik Roshan is a level-headed humble person. We have hardly seen him upset or angry. Even when Kaabil clashed with Shah Rukh Khan ‘s Raees at the boxoffice, he only had good things to say about the superstar. He even mentioned that this clash ruins nothing between them. So when a person like gets upsets, it definitely hits you. Couple of minutes back, Hrithik Roshan put up a tweet slamming Tommy Hilfiger for using his and his kids’ pictures for promotional purposes. He sounded pretty angry. \nHrithik writes, “Dear Tommy.I dont wear u, neither do my kids endorse u.If u hv lost ur spine I hv a great team 2help u find it.Please (hil)figure urself out.” The picture he attached has him and his kids having fun. This seems like a really angry tweet by Hrithik. He mentions about his team helping them find it out. So is he thinking of suing them? Check out the tweet right here which will give you a clear picture of how infuriated the Kaabil actor is.

He has always been confident about the film’s prospects at the box office and he was right. Even a mighty Shah Rukh Khan couldn’t slow him down. The film is still earning good money. In fact owing to its good run, the film even got 200+ screens in its second weekend which only added more money to the film’s account. In the midst of so much success, he gets this disparaging picture. No wonder he is angry!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:13:57.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
