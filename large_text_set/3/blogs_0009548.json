Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com   \nJUPITER, Fla. • A year after coming to Cardinals camp to speak with a small group of players and coaches, an author renowned for leadership guidance got an eyeful Tuesday of how things have changed this spring for the Cardinals. \nHe didn’t bring enough books to give away. \nAt the invitation of manager Mike Matheny, author and former pastor John Maxwell visited spring training again, only this time the manager didn’t know if Maxwell would speak to coaches, to a few players, to a roomful, or only to the manager alone. There were no instructions and no invitations like a year ago. There was a sign posted in the clubhouse that said any and all who were interested could attend. At least 40 did, maybe 50. \n“Last year I made the mistake of kind of singling out guys,” Matheny said after the meeting. “I was fortunate that a few of them said, ‘I would have liked to be a part of that. I read this book.’ Now, just like we’ve done all spring, it’s opt-in on some of the work and development. Whether it’s personal development or if you’re thinking of yourself as a leader. I don’t think we can (overstate) the value of what that means. People are growing and the whole thing about leadership is influence.” \nThe Cardinals have struck a more inclusive, relaxed and revitalized vibe this spring, from music on the field to those “opt-in” independent (and voluntary) work stations and throughout the clubhouse. One of the surest signs of how they’ve taken lessons from last year and applied it to this year was Maxwell’s visit Tuesday. Maxwell was a mentor for Matheny before they ever met, and Matheny has pollinated the clubhouse and his coaching staff with many of Maxwell’s books on leadership. Last year, Maxwell came to speak to the Cardinals’ leadership group of veterans and a “sprinkling in” of young players. Or, as one player put it, “a select few.” \nSome teammates not included took note. That moment slipped into a larger pool of others last spring and gave the club a disjointed feel, on the field and in the clubhouse. Toward the end of spring, meetings were held, leadership groups convened and differences discussed in conversations that, Matheny would later say, got “raw.” \nThe clouds have cleared this spring. \nMatheny still wants to lean on a committee of players — leaders who have “seen what championship teams look like from the inside,” he said — but there has been an organic broadening of influence throughout the clubhouse. \n“I think it just has happened naturally,” Adam Wainwright said. “Everybody just sort of came to grips that we didn’t play like we wanted to last year. We weren’t teammates like we wanted to be. We weren’t friends like we wanted to be. And we know we can be better in all of those things.” \nTeam chemistry can be tricky to describe. Matheny has steadfastly said last year’s team felt right “but could have been better; it always could be better.” Chemistry is inevitably intertwined with the standings. Wins paper over any cracks. What fed the odd feel around the Cardinals last year was how they played a game they didn’t recognize, one that was more ragged and erratic. Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith captured the team’s feel when he said it was “uncharacteristic” of the Cardinals. There were also, players have said, figurative cubicles in the clubhouse. Young players there. Alike players here. After the escape-room escapades of earlier this spring, the Cardinals talked about eradicating cliques. \nCliques were one of the concerns general manager John Mozeliak had coming out of the 2010 season. To correct it for 2011, a title year, he brought in Lance Berkman and Ryan Theriot, two veterans with solid reps and gravitational personalities. This year, the Cardinals have welcomed gregarious Dexter Fowler and turned to … \nDarn near everyone, judging by the crowd in the meeting room Tuesday. \n“Trying to maintain a culture,” Matheny said. Maxwell “touched on that. There are some reasons why there is success around here. There’s a culture. How do you grow that culture? He explained very wisely how an organization never out-produces its leadership, and that’s talking about the front office, the coaches and the clubhouse. If the leadership in your organization is capped-out, that’s your max. Trying to push everybody in that organization to find more. That’s a strong but accurate statement.” \nIn his writing about business leadership, Maxwell has said that “culture eats vision for lunch.” He goes on to explain that vision is a destination or goal, but culture is the vehicle that determines when, how fast, or even if a group gets there. In one essay, Maxwell described how “vision is about ‘one day,’ and culture happens every day.” That statement echoes a message that greeted the Cardinals when they arrived at spring training. Chairman Bill DeWitt Jr., Mozeliak and Matheny all in their opening address to the total team referenced a culture they believe is essential to the Cardinals’ ongoing success. \nThey used different words, but it came down to this: \nHonor the past. \nCreate the future. \n“Guys hear how we talk about wanting what’s best for us and them, but if we don’t make any kind of investment then it’s just hollow words, you know?” Matheny said. “Leadership is influence. That’s the same. It’s not a position. It’s not experience. It’s influence.” \nMaxwell draws that connection and suggests that influence can go both ways, negative and positive. A positive direction, Matheny explained, is not for leaders to just gather followers, but to create “other influencers.” And thus a culture spreads. Especially, when a door to that conversation is left open to any who want to walk through. \nGreg Garcia did not attend last year’s talk with Maxwell, but did Tuesday and remarked at how packed the room was. Fowler was there, “throwing himself in,” Matheny said. Prospect Paul DeJong doesn’t have a locker on the major-league side of the clubhouse and yet saw the sign and went with other minor leaguers to take a seat at the leadership gathering. \n“If it was one word, it would be ‘consistency,’” DeJong said. “He talked about anything being worthwhile is uphill. The consistency will help you get where you want to be. Consistency in baseball is something that gets talked about a lot. That’s one thing you have to keep working on every day.” \nDeJong wanted to grab one of Maxwell’s books. The author had already run out. \nMatheny has ordered more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T02:36:56.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
