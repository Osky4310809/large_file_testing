Jackie Speier (Calif.). But somehow CNN's Kate Bolduan began to interview the San Francisco Democrat two minutes later, while she was still being interviewed by Matthews.\nOne of the interviews had to be pre-recorded. But the banner on both broadcasts indicated the events were occurring \"live.\" Neither host disclosed that the interview was recorded ahead of time, in line with standard industry practice.\nSo who fudged it? Judging by Speier's Twitter account, it was CNN. She tweeted about that interview at 6:25, but tweeted about the Matthews interview at 7:08 as it was airing.\nTalking 2 @OutFrontCNN – @POTUS ‘ latest distraction campaign.
