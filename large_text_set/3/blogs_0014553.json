It also spent several years ferrying 765,000 Allied troops during World War II, when it was nicknamed the \"Gray Ghost.\" \nBut now, naval architects and marine engineers who compiled the survey warn that the vessel is probably \"approaching the point of no return.\" \nThe hull is severely rusted and certain areas, including the engine room, could be prone to flooding, according to the newspaper report published on Monday. And because the bilge system is inoperable, large amounts of water can't be pumped out and could cause the ship to sink to the lagoon floor.

Now a floating hotel with shops, restaurants and event spaces, the ship attracts some 1.3 million visitors annually. \nC ity officials said the findings were being discussed with the ship's current leaseholder, Urban Commons, and both sides were committed to preserving the historic asset and making sure it can safely remain open to the public. In November, Long Beach approved $23 million to address the ship's most urgent repairs, and Urban Commons is working to secure additional funding.
