The only Indian in the group is Dipanshu Goyal from New Delhi and the most experienced blogger is Carla Mota from Portugal who has visited 82 countries over the years. Most of the bloggers are visiting India for the first time. \nKBE was piloted in 2014 as a social media campaign, familiarisation trip, bloggers meet and road trip rolled into one, with the aim of creating a pool of global brand ambassadors who have experienced Kerala at close quarters and have the ability to reach out to aspiring international travellers. \nIt has received more than 5,300 entries over the past four years and continues to grow in popularity. The campaign itself has set new benchmarks in destination marketing. The third edition of Kerala Blog Express 3 last year won the Bronze for Social Media (Outreach) at the prestigious ABBY Awards 2016. \nIt generated more than 9,000 tweets, over 300,000 website visits, over 2,000 Instagram pictures and more than 100 blog articles. Kerala, as a travel destination, was covered on the Czech national radio, Polish radio, Bulgarian radio and TV show, and local newspapers in New Zealand and Italy. \nKerala Blog Express 4 will travel through Alleppey, Kumarakom, Thekkady, Munnar, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod before completing its journey on April 3 in Thiruvananthapuram, where the guests will be given a grand farewell by the Tourism Department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:22:55.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
