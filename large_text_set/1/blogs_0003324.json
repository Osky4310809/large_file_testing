If you allow me to sing \"strange fruit\" a song that has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the United States for being too controversial. A song that speaks to all the disregarded and down trodden black people in the United States. A song that is a reminder of how love is the only thing that will conquer all the hatred in this world, then I will graciously accept your invitation and see you in Washington. Best Rebecca X\"\nFerguson's somewhat unconventional offer is reminiscent of actor, Alec Baldwin's, who also gave Trump a song suggestion he probably wasn't too pleased about.\nBack in December, the SNL actor said he would be happy to sing the classic AC/DC song, \"Highway to Hell\" at the inauguration.\nThough Trump has yet to take Ferguson up on her offer, he has former America's Got Talent contestant, Jackie Evancho lined up to sing the inauguration's National Anthem, and possible performances by members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Radio City Rockettes , should they so choose.\nIf all else fails, perhaps Trump can convince his pal Kanye to drop by.\nBONUS: 'Longtime friends' Kanye West and Donald Trump meet up", "external_links": ["https://t.co/CHVDH7Qzbx", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4ZyuULy9zs", "https://twitter.com/RebeccaFMusic/status/815947524385177601", "http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1spgc5t", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/P3NBb3Sa.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/P3NBb3Sa.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-03T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T02:41:18.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
