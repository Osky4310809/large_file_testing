With the #InsideOutChallenge , created by Canadian Yasaman Gheidi, we’ve got the latter.\nThere is such a growing and necessary focus on self-care, and Gheidi uses makeup to speak to that — by creating looks that mirror what she feels on the inside. And the #InsideOutChallenge pushes others to do the same.\nYou expect people to expect you to just keep quiet about your illness and keep it to yourself like it's some sort of taboo, and if you did speak up about it, you'll probably be labeled as 'overreacting', 'drama queen' and think that you would lose the people you love. So you sew your mouth shut out of fear. But what you don't realize is that the more you keep it to yourself, the more it destroys who you are, inside and outside as well. You pull yourself away from the people who matter to you because you're scared they might think and feel lesser about you. You'll end up unable to eat or sleep at night because those negative thoughts keep coming, and no matter how much you try to stop them, you'll feel that what they're saying is true. Come morning, you'll try to hide your dark circles underneath your makeup, your scars underneath your sleeves, and you carve out a smile for the world to see just how normal you are. You're trying to muffle out your body's cry for help. But there's hope for you. Maybe your scars were meant to be noticed. To get help from someone doesn't mean you're lacking, it means you're brave, it's a step towards loving yourself. Don't suffer in silence. There's always a way. I am lucky to have been aware enough that i wasnt able to deal with it alone and im grateful to have friends and family who are supportive and are always there when i was at my lowest with my random fits and episodes. I bet you do too. #InsideOutChallenge #EndTheStigma #LetsTalkAboutIt \nA photo posted by Hammada Bamadhaj-Khan (he/him) (@hammadart) on Jan 14, 2017 at 8:01pm PST \nAs Gheidi wrote in an Instagram post, her makeup tutorials aren’t actually about the makeup.\n“It’s about starting a campaign to spread awareness of mental health illnesses via art. The ‘Inside Out Challenge’ is a way to artistically represent what some of us feel on a day to day basis,” she says. “Many people quietly suffer from anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses due to social stigma.” \nPart 2 of the Inside Out Challenge is up on my YouTube (link in my profile)! When I thought of this challenge I wanted to create three videos. The first one was about my private and my public self. The purpose of that was to show that despite all my \"pretty\" makeup and fashion photos on IG, I battle with many mental health issues behind the screen. The second video is about depression, which is the leading cause of disability worldwide (WHO 2016). I have battled with depression for most of my life, and I used to remain mostly silent about it, which only magnified the pain. Sometimes when my depression is really bad I try to view it as a separate visual entity. I think about what it would look like visually and then think of the colours I would use to paint it with. Doing this mental exercise at times helps me to effectively separate myself from the depression. It becomes art, and art can be very therapeutic. This is another reason why I wanted to create the #insideoutchallenge. Not only would this project raise awareness of mental illness, but it could also be therapeutic for those that chose to participate. What do you guys think? What methods do you use to cope with your mental health issues? @buzzfeed @buzzfeedstyle @theellenshow @ladygaga @caradelevingne @rubyrose @ddlovato @thescene @bell_letstalk @dailyhivevancouver #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #mentalillnessawareness #selflove #change #art #makeup #mua #makeupartist #instamakeup #inspiration #hope #buzzfeed #dailyhivevan \nA video posted by YASAMAN GHEIDI (@lilmoonchildd) on Jan 18, 2017 at 4:10pm PST \nAnd she’s right — mental illness issues are often swept under the rug due to feelings of internalized shame, fear, and isolation. While people from all walks of life suffer from mental illness, it’s still not commonplace to admit our feelings about it nor the consequences we face because of it. Which is why every public effort to remove the associated stigma is so important.\nA few weeks ago my partner and I attended my Christmas staff party. After dinner I experienced an anxiety attack and we decided to leave. I chose to disappear quietly without drawing much attention to myself. I spent the rest of the night holding on to my partner and crying, mentally battling the anxiety until it went away. The next day I was incredibly worried that my workmates were going to question my quick disappearance. I asked my partner what to say when faced with these questions, and without much thought she said to say that I had a headache. I agreed but quickly questioned my decision. Why did I have to be ashamed and lie about my anxiety attack? So many wonderful and amazing people suffer from the same mental illnesses that I do on a daily basis. Why can't we just talk about it openly? This experience along with many others inspired my \"Inside Out Challenge\". Mental illness shouldn't have to be hidden away, let's start to talk about it. ❤️ #endthestigma #letstalkaboutit PRODUCTS USED: @katvondbeauty \"Shade+Light Eye\" palette + @morphebrushes 35P palette, @nyxcosmetics @nyxcosmetics_canada black liquid liner, @limecrimemakeup \"Fetish\" velvetine, @hudabeauty \"Scarlett\" lashes, @kryolanofficial Aqua colours palette #kvdlook #katvondbeauty #morphebrushes #morphe35b #nyxcosmetics #kryolan #kryolanprofessionalmakeup #limecrime #limecrimemakeup #makeup #instamakeup #bellletstalk #beauty #instabeauty #mua #makeupartist #makeupaddict #makeupbyme #mentalhealth #anxiety #selflove #positivevibes #insideoutchallenge #mentalillness #instagood #instamood #motd \nA photo posted by YASAMAN GHEIDI (@lilmoonchildd) on Jan 10, 2017 at 5:47pm PST \nWhether it’s a celebrity going on the books to talk about their mental illness issues ( like the amazing Kirsten Bell) , a fashion line pushing for more awareness , or Gheidi’s brilliantly raw makeup challenge, it all matters.\n#Repost @bat.barbie with @repostapp ・・・ I'll be posting 3 photos in the next few hours. All are of the same makeup look, inspired by @lilmoonchildd 's #insideoutchallenge. The challenge is to raise awareness of/for mental illnesses. The goal is to show how uniquely someone can be emoting on the inside, despite a normalized outward appearance. I inherited depression and anxiety disorders from my mom, who inspires me constantly to keep moving forward. I know there will always be road blocks, but I'm actually really happy by how much understanding there is on social media now about anxiety/depression. It doesn't have to be a dark mystery! Everyone's experience is different. The more the social stigma lifts, the better. Thanks and praise to everyone who helps humanity toward this goal. I'll explain my makeup concept and how it reflects my anxiety in my next post. Lip is KVD's Lolita. White pigment is by Kryolan in Pearl over Mehron white water cake. More details to follow.

She's an amazing human being and one of my favorite MUAs on Instagram.) #makeup #portrait #creativeportrait #anxiety #depression \nA photo posted by YASAMAN GHEIDI (@lilmoonchildd) on Jan 19, 2017 at 10:30am PST \nAnd it matters to a lot of people.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:52:24.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
