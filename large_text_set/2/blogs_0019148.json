AP/Aaron Favila, file photo MANILA, Philippines — Is President Rodrigo Duterte skipping the celebration of the 31st anniversary of the People Power Revolution? Duterte is not in the program of the anniversary rites to be held on Friday in Camp Aguinaldo. Instead of the president, the guest of honor for the event will be Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea. There is no official word yet on whether Duterte, who allowed the burial of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani last year, will skip the celebration. A statement posted on the website of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, however, said Duterte would attend an event related to the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro in Davao City of Friday. The 31st EDSA anniversary program would include the awarding of individuals from the military, religious groups and private sector who have contributed to the promotion of freedom in the country. There will also be also be performances of songs associated with the 1986 revolt namely \"Magkaisa,\" \"Ako ay Pilipino,\" and \"Isang Lahi.\" The salubungan, which celebrates the unity between soldiers and civilians that paved the way for the ouster of former President Marcos, has been scrapped from this year's events. Officials previously said that the 31st anniversary of EDSA would be \"very simple and very quiet\" and would emphasize the need to move forward towards nation-building. The event will be held three months after Marcos, who was accused of condoning human rights violations during his presidency, was given a hero's burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. Malacañang has said that the simplicity of the anniversary rites does not mean that the government is not giving importance to the historic event. \"Just like any young lady who’s celebrating her 18th birthday, we normally celebrate it with pomp. But when she celebrates her 19th birthday, that doesn’t mean that if there’s no celebration similar to her debut that her birthday is given any less significance,\" Senior Deputy Executive Secretary Menardo Guevarra said in a press briefing last Tuesday. \"It’s a time to settle down, to quiet a bit, and think of what has happened over the past 30 years. Do we still have that spirit of EDSA within our hearts? Have we done things that are supposed to guide us after that momentous event in our history?\" he added.
