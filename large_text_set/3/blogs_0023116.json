I wonder, I know you don’t want to talk politics today, but whether you have a reaction to the sort of knee-jerk tweet that came out of the United States from the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., referencing an interview you’d done months ago and saying, ‘you’ve got to be kidding me,’ regarding the frequency or the likelihood of terrorism in big cities today.” \n“I’m not going to respond to a tweet from Donald Trump Jr,” Khan responded, “I’ve been doing more important things over the last 24 hours.” \n“What I do know is that the threat level in London and across the country is severe,” he continued, “that means an attack is highly likely. I was in New York last year when there was an attack in New York. And terrorists hate the fact that whether it’s New York, whether it’s London, whether it’s Paris, whether it’s Brussels, whether it’s Istanbul, whether it’s Madrid, we have diverse communities living together peacefully, getting along with each other, respecting each other.” \n“We’ve got thriving democracy in London,” Khan concluded. “We got a situation where Parliament is returning to normal today, city hall is returning to normal today, tourists are returning to London today, businesses are returning to normal today. Just the thing that terrorists hate, and I’m not going to allow terrorist to divide London, to destroy our way of life. We haven’t in the past, we’re not currently, in the future.” \nKhan said that there would be a vigil to show solidarity and thumb their nose at terrorists.

You have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan https://t.co/uSm2pwRTjO \n— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 22, 2017 \nSadiq Khan has said he believes the threat of terror attacks are “part and parcel of living in a big city” and encouraged Londoners to be vigilant to combat dangers. \nThe Mayor of London revealed he had a “sleepless night” after the recent bombing in New York, and said major cities around the world “have got to be prepared for these sorts of things” to happen when people least expect them. \nThe criticism arising from his previous comments was widely circulated on social media as proof that the mayor had not taken the terror threat seriously. \nhttps://twitter.com/ooRAToo/status/844792522815647746 \nhttps://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/844612778467835904 \nBritish law enforcement officials raided several households Thursday suspected of being involved with the attack and arrested as many as seven persons. The suspect of the terror attack was also identified as a British-born citizen who had been investigated by authorities for his extremism before, but his name had not yet been released. \nThe attack is suspected to be related to Islamist extremism by authorities as many have noted it occurred a year to the day of the Brussels airport and subway terror attacks. Four people have died thus far, including a 48-year-old policeman who was stabbed as he responded to the attack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:54:33.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
