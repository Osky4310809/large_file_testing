Sometimes celebrities or designers will open a storefront or art exhibit that is designed to only exist for a few days, and yo — they can get freaky . Here are five of the weirdest pop-up events in recent memory. Shia LaBeouf cordially invites you to watch him wear a bag \n(source) \nIn early 2014, when Shia LaBeouf was pretty much at peak weirdness (around an 8 on the unofficial Joaquin Phoenix Insane Bearded Movie Star scale), an art installation popped up in Los Angeles, dubbed #IAMSORRY. The super-duper apologetic actor sat silently with a paper bag over his head, adorned with the words \"I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE\" while patrons waited in line for hours to bring him trinkets associated with his films, including a bullwhip. I’ve since adopted this method of apologizing to people, and, you know, it’s time-consuming, but I think they really appreciate it. TRIWA declares a cardboard war \n(source) \nThere are a lot of ways to sell watches, guys. Who knew that military transportation made from the stuff that holds your toilet paper was one of them? In 2012, Polish watch brand TRIWA constructed a freaking tank out of 900 cardboard tubes, and, uh... sold watches inside of it. And if you were wondering what time it is, well, I suppose it’s time to start recycling, AMIRITE FELLAS. Eat like you were dyin’ at Death Row Dinners \n(source) \nDeath Row Dinners took that age-old question, “What would you want as your last meal?” and threw it in an electric chair, flipped the switch, and threw their hands up in confusion when people suggested that it might be in poor taste. 2014 saw Death Row Dinners land in the UK, offering famous last meals of notorious death row inmates in a mock-prison environment. I guess a simulated execution wasn’t the dining experience the English public was clamoring for (or even clamouring for). The 2015 Harding/Kerrigan museum for all your early '90s pop culture needs \n(source) \nIf you saw ESPN’s 30 For 30: The Price of Gold a few years back and DIDN’T decide to open up your own temporary museum dedicated to one of the hottest scandals of the early '90s, then come on, man. What are you even doing? 2015 saw Brooklyn’s Matt Harkins and Viviana Olen open up The Tonya Harding & Nancy Kerrigan 1994 Museum, situated in their very own apartment. I’m anxiously awaiting their follow-up on Deflategate, sure to hit apartment hallways in the year 2035. Banksy opens the Crappiest Place on Earth \nOkay, yeah, “Disney is a giant evil corporation that loves to make money” may not exactly be the hottest take around, especially for Banksy, but give the guy a break: He opened up an entire miniature amusement park in the UK ironically . Featuring beautifully cynical art installations from countless culture jammers, Dismaland was as fascinating as it was ugly. Say what you will about its lack of subtly, but it attracted celebs from across the globe and stimulated the local economy to the tune of £20 million. I can only pray that my planned mini-park dedicated to Frito-Lays will pack the same political punch. People need to know the joys of Big Snacking. \nWhat will you pay homage to at your super-weird one-day-only pop-up?
