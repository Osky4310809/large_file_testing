Amy Duggar claimed that her father violently abused her in a new Marriage Boot Camp teaser released on Friday, February 17. \nIn the clip, Duggar, 30, stands before Dr. Venus Nicolino and a few of the other reality show stars as she recounts a scary incident that allegedly took place during her childhood. “My dad was like, ‘Amy, did you brush your teeth?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, Daddy,’” she said. “And he was like, ‘No, you didn’t.’ And he picked me up by my throat, all the way up to the ceiling.
