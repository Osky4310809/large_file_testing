He shared in 2015 that he’d left the house that Birdman built. \nThe Miami mogul had previously stated that “they” is simply a general term for haters or those who don’t want to see others be successful. \nHere’s what fans had to say after drawing conclusions that Rick Ross revealed “they” is Birdman. So when Khaled refers to \"They\" he's talking about Birdman, Baby, and Stunna???? \n— Charlamagne Tha God (@cthagod) March 17, 2017 When Rick Ross discloses who Dj Khaled is referring to as \"they\" and it's been Birdman this whole time pic.twitter.com/uOwlsB0skU", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T06:30:55.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
