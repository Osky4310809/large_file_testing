I do not look at statistics, I do not look at goals, I just want to go on the pitch,\" Hazard told Chelsea Magazine . \n\"I prefer to win 5-0 and I play an amazing game, but do not score or assist, than play a bad game where I score two goals and we win 2-0. \n\"Football is simple, you just have to win games, so I go on the pitch, I try to do my best and try to make the fans happy. This is why I play, for my enjoyment and also for the fans. \n\"It is like when I go to watch a movie or a spectacle, I want to be happy. For me, when all the fans come to a game, they have to be happy, so it is my job to do make sure they are and I try every game.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T18:23:46.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
