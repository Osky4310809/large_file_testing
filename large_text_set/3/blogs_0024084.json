It's going to remain the law of the land.\" \n\"We came really close today, but we came up short,\" Ryan added it, \"This is a disappointing day for us.\" \n“House Republicans finally realized that the bill they have proposed does not pass muster with the American people,\" said Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who represents parts of Manhattan and Queens, in a statement. \"This bill would have ripped away health insurance from 24 million Americans, increased premiums and imposed an age tax on people over 50 years old,\" she added, referring to the findings of the Congressional Budget Office. \nThe bill, amended to appease the conservative House Freedom Caucus, would also have eliminated \"essential health benefits,\" such as maternity care and prescription drug coverage. \nBut Republicans will continue to push for benefits cuts, in the interest of trimming the federal budget deficit, she warned. \n“I will continue to do everything I can to protect the significant progress we have made since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law seven years ago,\" Maloney said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:48:38.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
