It's the second straight week Benjamin found the end-zone after going without a TD in seven of his last eight games. Benjamin never looked fully healthy this year and faded in the second half, but should benefit from a full offseason. He's locked in as the Panthersâ€™ No. 1 option for 2017. Jan 1 - 5:04 PM Kelvin Benjamin caught 4-of-8 targets for 63 yards and a touchdown in the Panthers' Week 16 loss to the Falcons. Benjamin made the play of the game for the offense on the final snap of the third quarter, getting away with a push off before going up high for a 26-yard touchdown. Benjamin played better than his stat line as Cam Newton threw well over his head on at least a couple targets, but he deserved the off-target throws after spinning the ball following a nine-yard gain on third-and-10 -- meaning he was one-yard short of the first down -- and just stopping on what should have been an interception late in the game. Coming off his most yards since Week 10 and his first touchdown since Week 12, Benjamin will be a WR3 in the season finale in Tampa Bay. Sat, Dec 24, 2016 04:30:00 PM Kelvin Benjamin (back) was a full participant at Thursday's practice. Benjamin was limited on Wednesday. He's all set for Saturday's game against Atlanta. Benjamin has scored just one touchdown over his last 10 games and won't be more than a desperation WR4 for championship week. Thu, Dec 22, 2016 03:45:00 PM Source: D. Orlando Ledbetter on Twitter Kelvin Benjamin caught 2-of-4 targets for 20 yards in the Panthers' Week 15 win over the Redskins. On a night Cam Newton threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns, it's a definite concern that Benjamin wasn't even a factor. Greg Olsen (6-85) led the team with nine targets, and Ted Ginn was the home run hitter with a 4-64-1 line on eight looks. Newton spread the ball around the rest of the evening. Benjamin was expected to see shadow coverage from Josh Norman in this one, but Norman mostly just played his side. Over the last three weeks, Benjamin has totaled five catches for 48 yards. He'll try and rebound next week in a bounce-back spot at home against the Falcons.
