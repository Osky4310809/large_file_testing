Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with the Barcelona job. \nHowever, he has previously said that he was \"born with a bull on his arm,\" in reference to his affection for Espanyol, and has even described Barcelona as his \"sporting enemy.\" \nPochettino has turned Tottenham into Premier League title contenders since joining from Southampton in 2014, and he signed a new five-year contract in May before guiding them to a club-record third-place finish in the Premier League. \nAsked about speculation he could manage Barcelona shortly before Luis Enrique announced his departure last month, Pochettino said: \"I can't say anything. I'm at Tottenham. I am very happy, [I have] four more years of my contract, enjoying an exciting project. It's true it's not an easy project, but I'm very happy here.\" \nDan is ESPN FC's Tottenham correspondent.
