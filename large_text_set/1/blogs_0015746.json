It is a milestone, that all of us want to be special. Some of us wait for the right person, some for the right setting, and some for the right time. But, almost all of us imagine it to be nothing less than blissful! We know that it hurts, but that's really all that we are warned about. Could there be more to having sex for the first time? Or, is it just pain, pain, pain, and then pleasure? Here is what those who've been there, done that, have to say... Anonymous, 30 I was in Pondicherry, madly in love then with an older guy. Lied to him about having done it already to look cool... at that time it felt great because I was totally in love. In retrospect, man it was terrible. Faked an orgasm, of course, to be over with it. Riddhi, 23 I was 19, he was 20. And I was hell nervous and in my head, sex was this revelation kinda thing, but it was very boring and I didn't bleed. No sign of an orgasm. I had to lie that I had a great time, and I kept thinking it was overrated until I realised he didn't know shit. Parul, 29 Umm it was quite uneventful. I didn't bleed, it didn't hurt (as much), I didn't orgasm - All the things I thought would happen! Anonymous, 32 He almost killed me. Haha. I was 17, and he was 30. Would that qualify as paedophilia? I bled. Didn't enjoy, but I was in love. Do you know what the worst part was? He was married! Anonymous, 24 The story of my maiden voyage was a complete tragedy. I was 19 and in a rebound relationship with this boy from Pune (while I was in Delhi). We had been dating for only 2 months when he decided to come and see me. For the first time. Of course I was excited! But did I know if we were going to do it? No. In fact, I was one of the only-my-legal-husband-can-touch-my-vajayjay kind of person. We booked two rooms (ended up using just one. Quite obviously!) in a shady Delhi hotel for the three days he was here. The first day was all roses, where I convinced that he indeed was my soul-mate. What a fool! As soon as the second day was coming to an end, he started to ask me if I wanted to go further. I said no. Like 48 times! He kept asking and soon came down to the do-it-to-prove-your-love emotional blackmail. I said yes! Of course, he didnâ€™t want use a condom because, duh, it was his first time and he wanted to go au naturale! Ugh. I was asked to take a pill. We did it. It hurt, but the pain of doing it unwillingly was much more than the physical trauma. To make it worse, he left the next evening and never got in touch again. Without giving me any reason. Two months later, I find him dating someone else, thanks to the best stalking platform, Facebook. I had a whole year of depression and that took a toll on my life. But I came out of it and I came out stronger than ever before. Now, when I say no, the conversation ends there. Anonymous, 29 I was 18. I remember thinking, man making out is so much better than this! Though I didn't bleed or anything, I didn't orgasm either. This was until I found the right guy who rocked my socks off in bed! P, 29 Okay, so mine took DAYS! Like five days or something... He was too big, and I was too narrow. We had been dating for almost a year. I was 22. We were in a long distance, so we had been talking about having sex. It was a big deal for both of us, because he wasn't a virgin, but I was. And it meant a lot to him that I wanted him to be my first. So, when we got together in the same city, we would make out with the agenda of popping my cherry. Except, it just wouldn't pop. On day three or something, he was fingering me, and suddenly he stopped and slid me to the edge of the bed, so my legs would dangle off it. He kneeled against the bed, and opened by vagina with his fingers, and looked at it intently. I asked him what he was doing, and he went, \"I'm trying to see what's wrong.\" It was really funny. Anyway, we got KY Jelly and the whole shebang, and after trying for another couple of days, he finally entered. I bled a little bit, but didn't orgasm. Not the first time... But, once we found our rhythm, it was great! Shivani, 27 Honestly, I don't even remember my first time. Ayesha, 29 I was 18. My boyfriend and I had gotten a room. We got stoned and had sex, and it was pretty painful. I didn't bleed at all. He did! The foreskin on his penis bled for some strange reason. Also, I didn't have an orgasm. It was a fun weekend but the sex was painful. I couldn't pee or walk without feeling like I was trying to pee fire.
