Manny Pacquiao on the need to create a separate boxing commission. PRIB/Joseph Vidal \n  Sen. Manny Pacquiao, a neophyte lawmaker, may be one the best boxers in the world with a wealth of experience fighting inside the ring. \nOn Tuesday night, however, he was in for a different fight — one that tested his skills as a legislator. \nPacquiao, who was coached by his legislative staff during the interpellation, defended his Senate Bill 1306 that seeks to create a Philippine Boxing Commission under intense questioning from Sen. Franklin Drilon, a former Senate president and veteran member of the chamber. \nDrilon’s objection to SB 1306 stems from the necessity of creating another commission when its functions are already being performed by an existing agency. \nWhen asked about the need to create a commission focused on boxing and other combat sports, Pacquiao said that the PBC would review and update rules and procedures related to the conduct of Philippine boxing. \nHe added that the PBC is meant to ensure that boxing in the Philippines conforms to international standards in the boxing and combat sports industry. It would also collect fees from licensing boxers and match promoters.   \nDrilon then asked if these functions were already being performed by the Games and Amusements Board, to which the boxer-turned-senator answered in the affirmative. \n“Yes, Mr. President,” he said. \nDrilon then asked about the purpose of creating a new body that will serve the same function. \n“The difference is this review and update of the rules and procedures related to professional boxing and combat sports are not in the GAB. And also establish linkages with international boxing organizations and institutions and agencies of foreign government in order to facilitate and ensure the participation of Filipino professional boxers,” Pacquiao said. \nThis answer flustered Drilon who then recast his question. \n“Can we a clearer answer, Mr. President? I’m sorry I didn’t catch the essence of the answer. The question is if these are the functions that are being performed by the Games and Amusement Board, why are we creating a new body to perform the same function?” he asked. \nPacquiao retorted that his proposed commission would ensure that athletes were covered by insurance, health care and other medical benefits. \n“Sa dami ng namamatay na boksingero, Mr. President, kailangan na siguro natin aksyunan. Hindi na natin matanggap siguro kung may mga mamatay pang boksingero dahil sa kakulangan ng tutok at requirements para higpitan yung pag-require sa kanilang mga requirements especially when they [are] going to have match,” he said. \nPacquiao also clarified that he was not saying that GAB was inefficient but that the board has not taken action on accidents and deaths in boxing. \nHe also asserted that focusing on boxing and other combat sports would be difficult for GAB because it was tasked to oversee 22 sports. \n“I don’t think matutukan nilang mabuti itong boxing and other combat sports. Marami na tayong namatay na boksingero, marami ng nadisgrasya,” he said, even citing at one point the case of a friend of his who died because of boxing. \nAt one point, Sen. JV Ejercito, sitting as presiding officer, had to clarify to Pacquiao the point Drilon was driving at. \nEjercito said: I think ang tanong niya, “Kaya naman yata gawin ng GAB ang pag-monitor ng mga atleta.” \nDrilon said that if Pacquiao’s concern was the lack of focus on the boxing industry, then the Senate could provide the sports body with additional manpower and budget. \n“Our point of view is instead of creating a new body that the present Games and Amusement Board be monitored closely, we provide them with additional funds. If there are 22 sports they are supervising, then we provide them with enough manpower so that the issues can be addressed. But creating a new bureaucracy just to address the mismatches, for example, is not necessary. That’s our point,” he said. \nIt was at this point when Pacquio drew from his experiences as a boxer to emphasize the plight of boxers and other combat sports athletes in the country. \n“I know your point. I’m a boxer. I’m an athlete. I feel and I know how hard boxing and combat sports are in training, in preparation, in the fight,” he said. “A lot of boxers have died until now there is no action. Why? It’s only 154 only working in GAB and also they are handling more than 20 sports. I think this is the right time to create a new commission for Philippine boxing and other combat sports.” \nDrilon stood his ground however, saying that these issues could be addressed by strengthening GAB through the infusion of more personnel and funds. \nDrilon rested his case and said that the bill would be deliberated on and put to a vote on the Senate floor anyway. \nPacquiao then vowed to fight for his measure. “I'm willing to fight this bill to have a boxing commission in the floor, because I know, I'm a boxer and I know what is the feeling of being a boxer being athlete sa combat sport. I hope the gentleman won't get offended by this boxing commission.” \nDrilon answered and said that deliberations of issues were a regular feature of debates at the Senate. He added that they made decisions as a collegial body. \nDrilon is the minority leader in the Senate, a post he got after Pacquiao moved to have him and other Liberal Party senators ousted from the majority .
