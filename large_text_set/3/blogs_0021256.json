That one-on-one game will likely never happen, but our favorite NBA impersonator, Brandon Armstrong, put together an excellent simulation of the would-be matchup. \nWell done. \nThe only way this video would have been better is if the two dressed to character. We needed Armstrong to be rocking some Big Baller Brand apparel while his friend, @famouslos32, wears a Charlotte Hornets uniform. \nOtherwise, excellent job.
