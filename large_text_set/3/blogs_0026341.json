Whenever they move and wherever they go, the first thing they do is look for his older brother. \nEventually, Min found a car-washing job at an auto maintenance school in Rizhao, where he can earn money while learning a trade. Moved by his story, the head of the school offered Min and his mother a 20-square meter dorm, where they both now live.
