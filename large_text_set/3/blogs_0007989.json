Combine NW Homeworks ' knowledge and experience with IKEA's products' mutability, and you get things like the space above, which is chock full of special features and custom touches. \nHere are all the little tweaks and changes made to the standard IKEA kitchen products, in the words of NW Homeworks : 1. Appliance Garage (Image credit: NWHomeworks ) \nWe used 3rd party pocket door hinges to allow the doors to open up and tuck out of the way along the sides of the cabinet. With the doors closed, any clutter can be hidden away! 2. Toe Kick Drawers (Image credit: NWHomeworks ) \nWe made these drawers by cutting down some base cabinets and installing stock IKEA shallow drawers. Since the drawers are only 21″ deep, we were able to cut the cabinet back enough to align with the rest of the toe-kick. The only drawback to these toekick drawers is that we had to raise the cabinets up an extra inch to make them fit properly. This means that the finished counter top height is 37″ instead of 36, but the customers weren't phased by this as they are fairly tall anyway. 3. Brass Toe Kicks (Image credit: NWHomeworks ) \nThis is made from special order 18g sheet metal which we cut to fit, and laminated to the toe kick using contact cement. Not only is this a striking visual element by itself, but using a contrasting color toe-kick like this almost makes the cabinets look like they're suspended. 4. Built-In Storage & Windowseat (Image credit: NWHomeworks ) \nWe made these using 30x15x24″ refrigerator cabinets from IKEA. In keeping with standard seat dimensions, we cut them back to a depth of 18″ instead of 24″. [Then] we stacked a 30×80 pantry cabinet on top of the 30×15 fridge cabinet for storing shoes, coats and the kid's backpacks. To make it fill out the wall, we were left with 8″ of extra space, so we decided to make use of it by cutting down a 15×80″ pantry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T14:07:03.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
