(Photo: PETER MOUNTAIN, UNIVERSAL STUDIOS) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW YORK (AP) — Whatever happened to the characters from Love Actually ? \nViewers will find out thanks to Richard Curtis, the writer-director of the beloved 2003 feature, who has created a short reunion film to air as part of Comic Relief's Red Nose Day Special on NBC in May. \nCast members revisiting their roles from the romantic comedy include Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson. \nThe 10-minute \"special sketch\" is from Curtis, who promises it will be \"very much in the spirit of the original film and of Red Nose Day.\" \nThe Red Nose Day Special , which airs for its third year on NBC on May 24, is produced by Curtis. On British TV, it — and the reunion film — will air March 24. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
