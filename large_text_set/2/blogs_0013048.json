It’s a really cozy place.” \nThe bar sells bottles and cans of beer. Bitburger, National Bohemian and Yuengling cost $3, while Union Craft Brewing’s Duckpin Pale Ale, Peroni, Stella Artois, New Belgium’s Fat Tire and Stillwater’s Cellar Door cost $4. Paulus said he plans to hire other bartenders soon, and they’ll brainstorm cocktails and happy-hour specials. \nDiskobar will also serve Kumari’s full menu, along with items exclusive to the bar, like charcoal naan pizza and masala wings, Paulus said.

A neon sign mounted above the bar reads, “if it wasn’t for the music,” a line from Indeep’s 1982 single, “Last Night a D.J. Saved My Life.” (The full line is “If it wasn’t for the music, I don’t know what I’d do.”) Photographs of Bjork and LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy hang on the walls. \n“We have a lot of producers and DJs and singers that are influential to me [represented in the bar],” he said. “I just tried to make it my favorite stuff.” \nPatrons can expect to hear artists such as Norwegian avant-disco producer Prins Thomas, St. Louis producer Osunlade and Russian electronic band D-Pulse, to name a few, Paulus said. The goal is to explore the idea that disco music “is more than that romanticized period” from decades ago. \n“There’s definitely going to be music from the ‘70s played here, but there’s also going to be music from last week,” Paulus said. \nPaulus, a Bolton Hill resident who also DJs, admits the concept is “kind of bizarre,” but believes there’s a demand for the music he craves — there’s just not enough places in the city that play it. \n“Baltimore tends to be very punk rock and experimental,” he said. “There’s a lot of places for that, so we just wanted to come up with something for another style of music.” \nDiskobar will be open 5 p.m.-2 a.m. daily, though it could close early on slow nights, he said. While Diskobar is only days away from opening, the execution of the concept is still fluid. For now, establishing the right vibe is most important. \n“We’re taking a very relaxed philosophy with it — just going with the flow, and doing what we love, which is music and food and bringing people together,” he said. “It’s just appreciating that unifying element of dance music, which has made a big impact on me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:14:04.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
