If you frequent social media sites, then you’ve no doubt seen a ton of Mass Effect Andromeda memes popping up recently. The countless cringe-inducing gifs and pictures understandably made long-time fans nervous. The game’s mediocre review scores didn’t help matters either.\nI’m here to tell you that things aren’t as grim as they appear. After playing for nearly 20 hours, I can assure you that Mass Effect Andromeda is a great game. Is it perfect? Of course not. Despite some issues, Bioware has delivered another solid entry in the beloved series. Mass Effect Andromeda is not a disaster, people.\nLike the original Mass Effect , Andromeda does a fantastic job of instilling players with equal amounts of awe and dread. Right from the game’s opening, players are tossed into the beautiful but dangerous Andromeda galaxy. A sense of wonder over the unknown was all but lost by the time of Mass Effect 3 . It is refreshing that Andromeda brings the series back to its roots in that sense.\nPrevious Mass Effect games let players visit many planets in the Milky Way galaxy. At the time, it felt revolutionary. Looking back, it’s easy to see how limited exploration actually was in those games. The planets were great in number, but they were all small in scale. Mass Effect Andromeda doesn’t have this problem.\nPlanet Eos is the game’s first major planet after the introductory Habitat-7. This world was much bigger than any other Mass Effect planet I remember. Typically, on-planet missions in the past would take upwards of 45 minutes to complete. I went to Eos expecting the same. Boy, was I wrong. From start to finish, it took a little over four hours to complete the main mission. That isn’t even taking into account the time it took to finish the various side quests that opened up afterward.\nIf this is an indication of how large the game’s other planets are then Mass Effect Andromeda dwarfs its predecessors in terms of sheer size. Bioware’s Dragon Age Inquisition also had massive levels that would take hours to complete. I can see how it has taken some reviewers 85 hours to finish this game. If you pick up Andromeda you are getting your money’s worth playtime-wise.\nSince Mass Effect 2 , the series has excelled as a third person shooter. Andromeda is every bit as competent in this field. Many of the same combat mechanics from previous games return. They’ve just been updated for 2017. Sprinting is done by pressing L3, and your character automatically ducks behind cover when under fire. Combat is tight, intuitive, and fun. The ability to use a jet pack to reach higher terrain adds a whole new strategic element to combat as well.\nAndromeda jettisons character classes in favor of allowing players to pick and choose different abilities. This opens up new possibilities since you can now use abilities from the Soldier, Biotic, and Tech classes. If you don’t like your choices, you can re-spec your abilities at any time. At the moment, I am building a pure Soldier character. But, if I eventually want to mix in some Biotic powers, I am free to do so.\nSpeaking of characters, the same great dialogue the series is known for is still very much intact. Don’t get me wrong, some faces and facial animations are downright atrocious. Thankfully, the actual conversations between you and your crew are extremely captivating. Like I did in all of the other Mass Effect games, I enjoyed simply getting to know my crew better. I even flirted around with a few of the women onboard. I’ll eventually have to settle for one lucky lady. But right now, I am having a blast flirting up the place and being a naughty boy.\nThere is still a lot of Mass Effect Andromeda in my immediate future. It is entirely possible that the game could end up disappoint me down the line. With the amount of hours I’ve already put into it, I honestly don’t see that happening. While Andromeda is nowhere near as groundbreaking as its predecessors, it isn’t a train-wreck by any means. If you’re a Mass Effect fan or just enjoy immersive role-playing games, then you owe it to yourself to check out Mass Effect Andromeda .", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYxgC6b5Tyc?feature=oembed?wmode=transparent", "https://r.zdbb.net/u/2ckj"], "published": "2017-03-22T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:01:24.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
