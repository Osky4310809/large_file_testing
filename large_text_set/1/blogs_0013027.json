Toby Melville / Reuters Theresa May has vowed to push ahead with seven day GP services amid tensions over the NHS crisis \nDoctors’ groups have hit back at May, accusing her of trying to “scapegoat” GPs. \nThe director of acute care for NHS England Professor Keith Willett has recently estimated that 30% of the patients attending A&E would be better cared for elsewhere in the system. \nMeanwhile, the latest official figures showed more than four in 10 hospitals in England declared a major alert in the first week of the year as services came under increasing pressure. \nA Downing Street source said: “Most GPs do a fantastic job, and have their patients’ interests firmly at heart. \n“However, it is increasingly clear that a large number of surgeries are not providing access that patients need – and that patients are suffering as a result because they are then forced to go to A&E to seek care. \n“It’s also bad for hospitals, who then face additional pressure on their services.” \nMinisters say they are providing an additional £528 million a year for practices by 2020/21 to ensure that the target for providing seven-day opening is met by that date. \nHowever, they are concerned by a recent finding by the National Audit Office that 46% of GP surgeries were still closing at some point during “core” weekday working hours, despite three-quarters of them having received extra funding to provide extended cover. \nThey also suggest some surgeries are failing to advertise the availability of extended hours appointments and GPs will be warned future additional cash will be contingent on them demonstrating they are offering appointments when patients want them.
