Dan Wolken , USA TODAY Sports 4:38 p.m. ET Jan. 5, 2017 x Share USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken recaps the College Football Playoff Championship and what lies ahead for Alabama and Clemson.

Apart from a wobble in 2013 and 2014, the Crimson Tide enter Monday night’s College Football Playoff championship game in Tampa in as strong a position as ever to continue stacking titles until Saban decides he’s had enough. \n“I tip my hat to them,” said Clemson coach Dabo Swinney, whose team will try to prevent Alabama’s fifth national championship in the last eight years while winning its first since 1981. “Unbelievable run they’ve had. I’ve never seen anything like it.” Injured Eddie Jackson remains motivational force for Alabama \nShould Alabama prevail against Clemson for the second consecutive season and finish 15-0, it will be hard to deny that the gulf between No. 1 and everyone else is as wide as ever, at which point it will be worth asking: How much Bama is too much for a sport that loves dynasties, but also loves seeing them eventually fall? \n“On one hand, you’re describing an incredible reign, sustained achievement,” said ESPN’s Chris Fowler, who will handle play-by-play duties for the championship game. “On the other hand, I’m sure many people would like to see fresh faces, a new story at the top. But that’s what makes it so difficult to do what they’ve done because they’re a huge target, they wear it year after year and manage it and overcome that. So in one respect, you tune into a game like this and one of the major plot lines is marveling at what Alabama continues to do. Nobody’s ever done 15-0 at the highest level of this sport. But five (championships) in eight years; that’s not supposed to happen.” \nThough sports dynasties are defined rather loosely, and often controversially, the 1970s in college football were ruled by Alabama, Oklahoma and Southern California. That triumvirate gave way to Miami (Fla.), Penn State, Notre Dame and a second run of Barry Switzer dominance at Oklahoma in the 1980s. By the 1990s, they’d been replaced by Nebraska winning three championships in four years, Florida State winning two under Bobby Bowden and Florida finishing no lower than No. 7 for six consecutive seasons with one national title. The turn of the century saw Pete Carroll’s USC dynasty, Bob Stoops reviving Oklahoma as a national power and Urban Meyer driving Florida to championships in 2006 and 2008. \nBut ever since Meyer lost to Saban in the 2009 SEC championship game, the conversation has been driven by Alabama practically all the time with brief interruptions provided by Cam Newton in 2010, Jameis Winston in 2013 and a stunning 2014 loss to Ohio State in the inaugural playoff. \nIn both years since then, Alabama has seemingly set the bar even higher with 26 consecutive wins and defenses that stand out statistically among the best in history. And if Saban wins one more game, he’ll match legendary Alabama coach Bear Bryant with six titles (Saban won one at LSU in 2003), effectively ending the conversation about the greatest coach of all time. \nAlabama coach Nick Saban works on interception drills with his players during football practice.

We had two or three times (attempting to go) back-to-back, but we couldn’t ever win that second one. Miami and Florida made it rough. Miami beat us by a point (in 1983) to win their first national championship. Then they won another one and another one. Then when they kind of slack off, here comes Spurrier. \n“It’s easier to win one than to continue to win, and that’s the thing about Nick. He continues to win. Not only is he one win away from Bear Bryant, but gosh, he’s done it all in the last 10 years.” \nThough Bowden’s peers made it hard to put together a run of championships like Alabama, it made for compelling year-in, year-out theater. And though it’s impossible to deny the marvel of Alabama’s sustained excellence, monotony may set in for some fans if a legitimate foil can’t establish itself. \n“Just being a fan of sports whether it’s college basketball or tennis with individuals who go on a Roger Federer-type run, Tiger Woods in golf, I love it,” ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit said. “I love when we have a program that raises the bar and that everybody is aiming for. We kind of mock the ‘We want Bama,’ thing but when you talk to the coaches and players in the sport, whether it’s in the SEC or around the country, they see that coach and that brand and that’s who they’re trying to bring down. Whether the viewer at home gets tired of Alabama, I guess it’s up to each individual, but i really enjoy it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T07:27:58.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
