Mitch McConnell at a Louisville town hall meeting on Tuesday, joins CNN to discuss her experience. \"That was embarrassing,\" she said at the beginning of the interview. \"When I saw the video, I was stunned. So, yeah.\" \"This is about-- they're not being truthful,\" she said about politicians in general. \"Various politicians have lied and lied and lied to Kentucky... Thos jobs aren't coming back. There are lots of reasons... and they know they aren't coming back.\" \"You call those numbers, you can call and call and call,\" she said about calling Sen. Mitch McConnell. \"He doesn't want to hear it, he doesn't want to hear from us.\" \"I lose sleep over it sometimes. This is about people. And you can't sell us off for your campaign donations, and that is what they have been doing,\" she said. She also explained how she wasn't allowed to attend a second McConnell town hall the next morning. \"Today I got thrown out,\" she said. \"I had a big 6 foot 5 inch cop come up to me and ask me to leave... at the Embassy Suites where Mitch McConnell was because he 'wanted to hear what he had to say.'\" \"I'm just an unemployed grandma, I'm no threat,\" she said.
