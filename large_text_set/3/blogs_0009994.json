Give it time.) \nBut then Raven had some exciting news that had nothing to do with Viall — she’s going to “Paradise!” \nRaven added, \nHey, if anything, I know that if Nick can go to Paradise and do this experience and find love, that I can too. \nTo which host Chris Harrison asked, \nSo we’ll see you in Paradise? \nRaven confirmed the news with an enthusiastic, “Yeah!” Giphy \nWe don’t know much else about the upcoming 2017 cast of “Bachelor in Paradise,” but that didn’t stop Bachelor Nation from making plans for Raven. \nIn fact, even though we don’t even know if he’s going to be on “Paradise” or not, everyone’s already making plans for Raven to hook up with the one and only, Luke Pell. \nThe 32-year-old singer and former “ Bachelorette ” contestant was originally suppose to be this year’s “Bachelor,” but lost to Viall in a last-minute switch. ABC Now that we know Raven will be on “Paradise,” people are ready to see her move on to the arguably superior version of Viall.
