You need to shell out shekels for solid shoes, maybe invest in a couple pairs of shorts, and add a few pieces of equipment to your burgeoning basement gym. On top of that, the average price for a personal, 1-hour workout is $50, according to data from Reebok. But there’s an easy way to get a one-on-one sweat session with a professional trainer in a gym near you, and it won’t cost you anything—except for a firm, honest handshake. \nAs part of a new campaign, Reebok has launched an initiative that pairs you with a personal trainer in one of 10 cities: New York, Boston, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. All you have to do is download a ‘trainer-on-demand’ app called Handstand and find the free Reebok workout option. If you book a free class this week—now through Friday, January 20—you can activate it anytime this month. Each city has different trainers and styles to suit your fitness level.
