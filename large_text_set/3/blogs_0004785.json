tap into a Stanford connection and go with a Pac-12 lineman in the first round for third straight year 2h ago • 7 min read \nAfter his outstanding workout at the NFL Scouting Combine, Myles Garrett made the Cleveland Browns ’ decision with the No. 1 overall pick even easier. But the San Francisco 49ers at No. 2 remain a mystery. \nCould San Francisco go quarterback? What about a safety, a position John Lynch is obviously familiar with? Cornerback is a possibility with Ohio State’s Marshon Lattimore . The 49ers can’t go defensive line for the third straight season, right? Not so fast. \nWith Lynch and company looking to take the best player available and a prospect that will help build the culture in the locker room, Alabama’s Jonathan Allen and Stanford’s Solomon Thomas make a lot of sense. And with Allen’s past shoulder issues, Thomas gets the nod in this exercise, making it three straight years the 49ers go with a Pac-12 lineman in Round 1. 1. Cleveland Browns \nMyles Garrett, DE/OLB, Texas A&M: The combine basically confirmed this pick. Cleveland choosing Garrett is the easiest decision for a team picking No. 1 overall since the Indianapolis Colts drafted Andrew Luck . Garrett looks like the clear-cut No. 1 pick in this draft. USATSI 2. San Francisco 49ers \nSolomon Thomas, DE, Stanford Cardinal : Yes, there is the Stanford connection with general manager John Lynch, but more importantly, Thomas is an excellent football player who adds immediate pass rush help on the defensive line. Thomas is just too good to pass up at No. 2. USATSI 3. Chicago Bears \nJonathan Allen, DL, Alabama Crimson Tide : With the Bears likely addressing their quarterback issue in free agency, Chicago would then look to best player available here, which might be Allen if the medicals are OK. Allen, the best available pick here, helps upgrade the Bears on defense. USATSI 4. Jacksonville Jaguars \nJamal Adams, SS, LSU: The Jaguars hit a home run with Jalen Ramsey in last year’s first round and could continue upgrading the secondary this year with Jamal Adams, who fits Jacksonville’s profile. Adams fits the Jaguars profile defense. USATSI 5. Tennessee Titans (from Los Angeles) \nMarshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State Buckeyes : Tennessee needs cornerback help and Lattimore is the best this draft class has to offer. The one variable is his history with hamstring issues, which could be a deal-breaker for some teams. Lattimore helps fix a serious need in Tennessee. USATSI 6. New York Jets \nMalik Hooker , FS, Ohio State: The Jets have no choice but to address the secondary this off-season with question marks at both cornerback and safety. Hooker is coming off two surgeries, but is on track to be ready for training camp. The Jets need secondary help and the talented Hooker should provide some. USATSI 7. Los Angeles San Diego Chargers \nRyan Ramczyk , OT, Wisconsin Badgers : With several unreliable spots on the Chargers’ offensive line, Ramczyk will be an appealing prospect with this pick -- as long as his surgically repaired hip heals as expected. Ramczyk can help a Chargers offensive line with several holes in it. USATSI 8. Carolina Panthers \nDerek Barnett , DE, Tennessee: Barnett might not be as physically gifted as Garrett, but he was more productive the past three seasons and competes with the pedigree and impact to be a reliable edge rusher. Barnett was even more productive in college than projected top pick Myles Garrett. USATSI 9. Cincinnati Bengals \nReuben Foster , LB, Alabama: Linebacker Rey Maualuga is a serviceable player, but Foster would be an instant upgrade with his combination of play speed, instincts and violence -- as long as that violence remains on the field. Foster would provide an instant upgrade on the Bengals defense. USATSI 10. Buffalo Bills \nDeshaun Watson , QB, Clemson Tigers : The Tyrod Taylor situation in Buffalo will continue to play itself out the next few weeks, but if he’s out of the picture then Watson becomes an intriguing option with this pick. His résumé and intangibles continue to win over NFL coaches. Watson is the first quarterback off the board and and the Bills’ future at quarterback. USATSI 11. New Orleans Saints \nMarlon Humphrey , CB, Alabama: The Saints ranked dead-last in the NFL last season in passing yards allowed and collected only nine interceptions (only three by cornerbacks). Humphrey is a well-built athlete with the speed and toughness to start from day one. The Saints need all sorts of help on defense and Humphrey is a physical, attacking corner. USATSI 12. Cleveland Browns (from Philadelphia) \nMitchell Trubisky, QB, North Carolina: Ideal scenario for Cleveland? Garrett at No. 1 and then the hometown kid falls to No. 12. Trubisky has only 13 career starts, but all the traits are present for him to be a reliable NFL starter. Trubisky, an Ohio native, might be the answer for the Browns’ quarterback woes. USATSI 13. Arizona Cardinals \nDeShone Kizer , QB, Notre Dame Fighting Irish : Many believe this will be the final season for Carson Palmer in the NFL and the Cardinals need to plan for the future at the position. Kizer is inconsistent, but the physical tools and mental ability are worth developing. Kizer would benefit from sitting behind Palmer for a season. USATSI 14. Philadelphia Eagles (from Minnesota) \nCorey Davis , WR, Western Michigan Broncos : The Eagles are expected to do some shuffling at the wide receiver position and with no receiver off the board at this point, Philadelphia could have their choice -- and in this scenario it is Corey Davis. Davis would provide Carson Wentz with a much-needed weapon in the passing game. USATSI 15. Indianapolis Colts \nHaason Reddick , LB, Temple Owls : Coming from Kansas City, new Colts general manager Chris Ballard understands the impact of speed on defense and that is exactly what Reddick offers. He can line up inside or outside and give position flexibility to drop in coverage or blitz. Reddick’s athleticism will be an upgrade the Colts need on defense. USATSI 16. Baltimore Ravens \nDalvin Cook , RB, Florida State Seminoles : The Ravens have a stable of average backs on the roster, which is one of the reasons they ranked near last in the NFL in rushing in 2016. Cook would help change that and open up the offense. Cook is the first running back taken and will take pressure off Joe Flacco. USATSI 17. Washington Redskins \nMalik McDowell , DL, Michigan State Spartans : McDowell has an impressive blend of size, athleticism and power to be effective from multiple positions along the defensive line. McDowell should help the Redskins’ front, especially in the run-heavy NFC East. USATSI 18. Tennessee Titans \nMike Williams , WR, Clemson: No, he’s not a burner. But Williams wins in other ways and can provide Marcus Mariota with a large target who plays about the rim in the passing game. Williams should give Mariota a nice target in the Titans passing game. USATSI 19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers \nJohn Ross , WR, Washington Huskies : Mike Evans is the top target of Jameis Winston , but he needs help. Ross is dwarfed by Evans in size, but his explosive athleticism and savvy route-running will only improve the Tampa offensive attack. Ross stole the show with his record 40 time and will give the Bucs a deep threat. USATSI 20. Denver Broncos \nDavid Njoku, TE, Miami (Fla.): The Broncos have plenty of names on the tight end depth chart, but no difference-makers. Njoku is only 20-years old and still raw in areas, but his potential is off the charts. Njoku could be a difference-maker at tight end for the Broncos. Getty Images 21. Detroit Lions \nLeonard Fournette , RB, LSU: There are plenty of names on the Lions running back depth chart, but Fournette would quickly jump to the top and give Detroit another dimension at the position. There are questions about his playing weight, but Fournette will be an upgrade in the Lions backfield. USATSI 22. Miami Dolphins \nTaco Charlton , DE, Michigan Wolverines : The Dolphins will be looking to add another pass-rush option in the draft and Charlton is an ascending prospect that can be groomed behind Cameron Wake . Charlton gives the Dolphins another pass-rush option. USATSI 23. New York Giants \nGarett Bolles , OT, Utah Utes : Bolles is a polarizing prospect throughout the league. After taking some time off from the game, he rediscovered his love for the game, showing NFL-level athleticism, but needs strength and technique work. Bolles has rediscovered his love for the game and has NFL-level talent. USATSI 24. Oakland Raiders \nZach Cunningham , LB, Vanderbilt Commodores : The Raiders could use a tough, rangy linebacker and Cunningham fits the bill with his ball awareness, play speed and length to keep himself free from blocks. The Raiders need a tough, rangy linebacker and Cunningham fits the bill. USATSI 25. Houston Texans \nO.J. Howard , TE, Alabama: Tight end might not be at the top of the priority list for the Texans, but with Howard still available in this scenario, the fit makes sense. Whoever is at quarterback will be better with Howard on the field. With Howard available at this spot, the Texans won’t pass him up. USATSI 26. Seattle Seahawks \nForrest Lamp , OG, Western Kentucky: The Seahawks are getting by with the bodies they have on the offensive line, but that doesn’t mean Seattle shouldn’t be looking for upgrades. Lamp can probably survive at tackle in the NFL, but he might be a Pro Bowl guard with his square-blocking skill-set and stubborn mentality. Lamp would fill a need along the offense line and help protect Russell Wilson. USATSI 27. Kansas City Chiefs \nPatrick Mahomes, QB, Texas Tech: There is a lot about Mahomes that is simply unknown at this point. But what is known is his arm talent and playmaking skills that translate to intriguing upside. In Kansas City, he would be given the opportunity to sit and develop at his own pace. Some think Mahomes might be the best quarterback in this draft. USATSI 28. Dallas Cowboys \nCharles Harris , DE, Missouri Tigers : The Cowboys are in search of a right defensive end who can wrap the edge and put pressure on the pocket. Harris is the latest off the line in the Missouri pass rush factory. Harris should provide the pass rush the Cowboys desperately need. USATSI 29. Green Bay Packers \nChristian McCaffrey , RB, Stanford: Although he might not be a feature back by the traditional definition, McCaffrey is capable of 25 offensive touches per game and would help transform the Packers’ backfield attack. McCaffrey would add another dimension to the Packers offense. USATSI 30. Pittsburgh Steelers \nT.J. Watt , DE/OLB, Wisconsin: Whether he is lined up inside or outside, Watt is a versatile linebacker with the athleticism and competitive drive that will help him make plays on the football field. Watt’s versatility could help the Steelers on defense. USATSI 31. Atlanta Falcons \nObi Melifonwu , DB, Connecticut Huskies : Ricardo Allen has held his own at free safety, but Melifonwu brings positional versatility to the secondary and would give Atlanta a dynamic safety duo along with last year’s first rounder Keanu Neal . Melifonwu is yet another athletic defensive back from UConn. USATSI 32. New England Patriots \nJabrill Peppers , DB, Michigan: Linebacker? Safety? Running back? Regardless, Bill Belichick will know how to best use Peppers’ athleticism and cultivate all that talent. The Patriots will find a way to utilize Peppers’ talents.
