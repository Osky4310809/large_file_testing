From Fox News :\nThe department said some attorneys, as in prior transitions, already had left the department. The statement said, “the Attorney General has now asked the remaining 46 presidentially appointed U.S. Attorneys to tender their resignations in order to ensure a uniform transition.”\n“Until the new U.S. Attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. Attorney’s Offices will continue the great work of the Department in investigating, prosecuting, and deterring the most violent offenders,” the statement added.\nThe Associated Press adds , “It is customary, though not automatic, for the country’s 93 U.S. attorneys to leave their positions once a new president is in office.” Obama allowed the US Attorneys appointed by President Bush to remain in office until their replacements had been confirmed.\nAlready, there are some suggesting a darker motive for this action:\nA new POTUS can do what he wants with US attorneys, but coming when it does, this smacks of Trump paranoia about \"deep state\" conspiracies.\n— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) March 10, 2017 \n\nBut even NPR notes this is routine:\nIt is customary for a new president to appoint his own U.S. attorneys. They are political appointees.\n— NPR (@NPR) March 10, 2017 \n\nIn 1993, Bill Clinton removed all 93 US Attorneys in a single day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:34:08.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
