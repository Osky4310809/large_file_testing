It now says neglectful British authorities cost the EU at least €2 billion ($2.1 billion) in customs duties over the last four years.

Chinese exporters declared an average price of €0.91 per kg of women’s trousers – a value far lower than that of their main raw material, cotton, over the same period. The average value declared for similar products across the EU was of €26 per kg. \nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is contesting the amount of the EU fine, suggesting the calculations were not correct. \n“HMRC has a very strong track record for tackling fraud and rule breaking of all kinds, securing more than £26.6 billion last year alone and no one should be in any doubt that we are responding to the threat of fraud,” a government spokesman said. \n“HMRC is currently handling more than 550 cases relating to potential import fraud, and will not hesitate to engage the relevant prosecuting authorities to bring cases before the courts where evidence of wrongdoing exists.” \nREAD MORE: Brexit ‘divorce settlement’ cheap compared to ‘cost of EU fraud’ \nThe Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is currently investigating an alleged £7 billion VAT evasion case, in which traders abuse online sales platforms such as Amazon and eBay and undercut local, legitimate sellers. \n“We cannot have a situation where British firms are being put out of business by overseas traders fraudulently gaming the system and dodging tax,” Tory committee member Charlie Elphicke told the Daily Mail . \nA Number 10 spokesman claimed the prime minister had “only just” seen the report and did not “recognize the figures.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T20:31:45.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
