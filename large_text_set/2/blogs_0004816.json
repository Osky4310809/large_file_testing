Giphy \nThe studio behind the movie put out unreleased clips from “50 Shades Darker,” and they’re about as hot as something can legally be without having its viewers sign a waiver before watching. \nFor your own sake, please watch this in a soundproof glass jar far away from where your co-workers can hear you. \nThis movie is going to be absolutely insane. Those clips they released today aren’t even that bad compared to some of the other “Fifty Shades Darker” content they’ve put out. \nThe trailer from a few weeks back makes today’s clip release look like a TED Talk on fine dining etiquette.

Finger kaboomed! Full elevator! \nThat’s the single bravest move of all time. There were like five other people there! I don’t even poop if I know my roommates are in the apartment building, let alone go freelance kabooming. \nHot take: Seal Team 6 isn’t as brave as Christian Grey. Sure, they took down Osama and are comprised of the world’s most elite soldiers. They never finger kaboomed in an elevator, though. \nThere should be a presidential medal of freedom for finger kabooming in an elevator car. \nChristian Grey is a folk hero as far as I’m concerned, and he definitely deserves a statue in a town square somewhere. \nMAKE IT HAPPEN, AMERICA!
