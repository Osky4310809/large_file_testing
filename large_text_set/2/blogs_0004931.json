The most important thing is to look what you have done wrong in the game. Then blame others. We have to take that responsibility and then answer. \nIcardi is a goal and assists machine \n\"It can only be mental. We know we can play better and we were sloppy at the start. \"It's all about mentality, being there from the first minute and knowing the Premier League is a difficult competition. \n\"We were not there, they ran all over us, and we cannot be happy with that at home. We have to bounce back, it is a big game against Chelsea, we will try to be there from the first minute to the last second. \n\"We have to be really focused from start to finish because they have a good side, they have been playing well and they have a plan and identity of how they want to play. \n\"It is going to be difficult but it is an opportunity to make things right.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:54:21.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
