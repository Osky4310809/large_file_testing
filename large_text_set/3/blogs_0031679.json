Enter: Malaika Arora and Jacqueline Fernandez’s simple airport beauty hacks. \nTo get their easy yet practical hair looks, go for a high ponytail. This naturally lifts your face and draws attention to your features, while also keeping any annoying strands at bay. Spritz a face mist to hydrate your skin, and add a super hydrating moisturiser to give it that dewy glow. \nNow that your skin is armed to combat dry airplane air, moisturise your lips well, with a lip product that doesn’t leave a residue. Like Jacqueline and Malaika, get that fresh pout by going for a lip stain that is bright yet natural. Stains seep into the skin instead of sitting on the surface like lipstick, and are great for when you need a lip look that says “my lips, but better.” \nAs for the eyes, just go makeup-free and hide any bags or circles behind your largest sunnies, and save yourself from a raccoon-eye situation (thanks, mascara) when you wake up on the other side of the world.
