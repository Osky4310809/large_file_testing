For the young ones, their weight wouldn't kill them. \n\"The officers' assistants would pull them down and break their necks. Two officers' assistants were in charge of this.\" \nAmnesty also released direct testimony from several survivors including Salam Othman, a lawyer from Aleppo, who detailed systematic torture. \n\"When we were beaten in front of the cells, I saw a lot of blood on the floor. There was a rancid and bloody smell,\" he said. Photo: Anas Hamido on the day before his arrest and soon after his release.

You hear sounds — your heart drops to the floor. You begin to shake, you can't control it.\" \nAmnesty has branded the killings a crime against humanity and called on Syria's ally, Russia, to use its power on the Security Council to allow an independent investigation. \n\"These death sentences were approved by the Grand Mufti of Syria and by either the Minister of Defence or the Chief of Staff of the Army who are deputised to act on behalf of the President, Bashar al-Assad,\" Ms Maalouf said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:37:23.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
