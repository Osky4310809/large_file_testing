One flier took issue with a university that dismissed an employee due a tweet regarding the \"genocide in Palestine,\" and another flier argued in favor of Holocaust denial.\nNotably, many of the posts are tagged with #BlackLivesMatter and #WeAreAllMuslim .\nThe university released a statement about the fliers , promising an investigation.\nWhether they catch whomever is responsible is irrelevant: they're certainly free to be anti-Semitic idiots if they want to be, after all. Speech is a natural right, and America exists to secure all of our rights.\nThe pivotal issue is that the Left -- as they host classes on how to \"bash the fash,\" for example -- they fail to acknowledge that such hatred has always lived on the Left, and not with the conservatives who uphold every individual's right to life, liberty, and property.\nIt's not Trump screaming about ending \"white privilege,\" or claiming that \"Jewish privilege\" has to go first -- or that either actually exists. No, these hateful positions are actually PILLARS of Leftist thought now, and often spouted by social justice warriors.\nConsider that one of the fliers specifically claims that ending \"Jewish privilege\" is not anti-Semitic, but is instead \"social justice\" -- not exactly a conservative cause.\nAnti-Semitism in the United States is overwhelmingly a left-wing phenomenon. Those wishing to participate in the Left's \"anti-racist\" or \"anti-fascist\" protests need to recognize that singling out Israel, and even Jews in general, as targets is a staple of the movement now, and has been for decades.\nMaybe Debbie Wasserman Schultz should keep that in mind as she complains about anti-Semitism.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/21/leftist-anti-semitic-fliers-appear-on-college-campus/", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchava.eva%2Fposts%2F10209093105388863&width=500", "http://news.uic.edu/files/official/march2017.html"], "published": "2017-03-21T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:16:55.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
