King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 2 hours ago 3 \nMetal bass champion Steve DiGiorgio, known for his work with Death, Testament, Sadus, Obscura, Iced Earth and many more, talked about what drew him towards one of the key components of his distinctive sound - the fretless bass. \nSingling out Dave Pegg - the bassist of Jethro Tull between 1979 and 1985 - as a crucial figure and a bit of an \"unconventional\" influence for a metal musician, Steve told Bass Player : \n\"It's funny because if you look at his entire body of work, someone might be like, 'I don't get it.' The music is cool and you can tell he's proficient, but his playing with Tull on [1980's] 'A' and [1982's] 'The Broadsword of the Beast' is amazing. \n\"Maybe it was the period, or the songs they had written, but that's the only time he's ever really stood out. The sound of his fretless on those albums brought me into that world.\" \nResponding to the interviewer's comment that most fretless dudes tend to cite Jaco Pastorius as their No. 1 guy, DiGiorgio replied: \n\"How can you not appreciate his work? But I'm a latecomer to Jaco - I didn't start there. Dave Pegg was my main fretless influence in a context that you wouldn't really expect to hear it. When you hear Gary Willis or Percy Jones, their playing is 20 times better than Pegg's on those Tull albums - it's killer, but it belongs there. With Pegg, it was unexpected, and that's what drew me in.\" \nDiscussing his musical approach in general, the bassist noted: \"Early on I realized it's pointless to try to be the best ay anything, because there's no such thing. But you can always be different in some way. You can always have some small idenifying factor that makes you 'you.' I'm always looking for something to keep me a little different from the regular flow of everyone else.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:53:59.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
