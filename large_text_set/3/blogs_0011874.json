He told Recode that Resistbot was designed with the intention of resisting the Trump Administration. \n“We will faithfully deliver any message our users send in, but the voice of the product is for the liberals and conservatives in opposition to the Trump administration,” he wrote in an email to Recode ( emphasis on “conservatives” his). \nWhy faxes? He elaborated that they’re “considered just as effective or more so [than phone calls] because there’s no way to truly verify if a call is from a constituent.” \nOthers involved in the effort include Eric Ries, CEO of a startup called the Long-Term Stock Exchange and author of The Lean Startup, and at least a dozen other people including a few employees of Twilio. \nUsing Resistbot is free and there’s no need to download an app or sign up for anything. You literally just send the text and follow the directions from there. \nUsing your zip code, Resistbot finds the politicians who represent you. It then asks for the message you’d like to send — like giving your stance on the ACA, calling for an independent investigation into Russia’s involvement in the election, or whatever else you’d like to say to people who represent you in Washington, D.C. \nWhen we tried it here at Mashable , the texting bot responded within a minute each time, so the whole transaction took about five minutes. \nEach message that’s texted is formatted into a business letter. The service starts off by sending a letter to the senators of your state, and later asks about sending letters to your local congressperson. \nAfter all is said and done, the user should eventually receive messages confirming the faxed letters have been “received and read by actual Congressional staffers.” Photographs of the letters themselves are also sent. \nTexting services like this one can be prone to spamming, but Resistbot states on its website that messages can be stopped at anytime. \n“It will text you once in a while to see if you’d like to pressure your officials or keep you posted on what we think you’d be interested in,” the site says of Resistbot. “You can text STOP anytime to leave the resistance.” \nWell, resisting can’t get much easier than that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:00:00.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
