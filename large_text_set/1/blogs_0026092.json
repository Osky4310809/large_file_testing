Falb then took out the No. 73 Park Place Motorsports Porsche 911 GT3 R of Matt McMurray as he tried to rejoin the track. \nFalb was able to drive himself back into the pits, but McMurray’s car was unrepairable and had to be retired. Both drivers were thankfully okay despite the hard hit. The No. 8, however, received a stop and ten-minute penalty from the stewards for causing the crash.

Like, I won’t even wear my Orlove’d shirt to a track day, much less put “hit” in the name of anything related to my race car.
