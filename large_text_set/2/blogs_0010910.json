I truly believe that too; there is no on and off button when it comes to loving a person. You might see a gradual change in the level of passion or caring that goes in the relationship, mostly aided by circumstances, but the feeling always remains. Long after you've had your heart broken, you will still feel a tingle each time you think back to the times that were. Long after you've put a ring on it and said \"I do\", you will still feel the occasional butterflies coming up when you least expect them to, making you smile. \nYou cannot kill love, and in the world that we live in currently I don't think that's a bad thing either. It's lovely to have a feeling that stays on, despite whatever happens. It might be painful to be in love at times, and you'd want it to go away. But at the helm of all the suffering and the joys, the love that binds you to those you adore will never fade. \nI've been married for seven years, and it does seem like forever, but in a good way. When we first met, one of the biggest driving forces in our relationships was the conversations we would have. We could talk for hours, with not a care in the world, and still find something to say to each other the next day. Today - after seven years since our marriage and a decade of knowing each other - we don't talk as much but that's because we end up finishing each other's sentences. We know exactly what's going on in the other person's mind and it's nice to have that level of comfort and familiarity with someone. People who know us from back then, probably look at us and feel that the love between us has dissipated, but I disagree. I think that the love we have for each other has just grown, become more mature. We've moved on from the butterflies in the stomach, to that warm feeling of knowing that there is someone who always has your back. \nAt the end of the day even if you don't feel that rush, those overrated butterflies, or that passion, don't worry the love still exists. All you need to do is rekindle it.
