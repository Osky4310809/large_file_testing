Kelly had to assume his soapbox on Instagram to dispel rumors that he would be front and center in Washington D.C. on January 20. But now, social media has been rumbling with the assumption that renowned crossover rapper Flo Rida would be performing for the future President Donald. \nA report originated by RadarOnline and powered by KSFM.CBSLocal.com claimed the multi-platinum hitmaker accepted $1 million to hit the stage. HipHopDX confirmed with Flo Rida’s label Atlantic Records that he would not be performing at the inauguration. End of story. \nFlo Rida was once scheduled to perform for Trump’s July 12, 2015 Miss USA pageant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana but pulled out as the president-elect’s comments about Mexican Americans began to gain traction and Macy’s deaded their business relationships with him.

With big Billboard hits like “Low,”“My House” and “Good Feeling,” Flo Rida may not have the most staunch Hip Hop head fanbase, but that will be one title he won’t have to live down. \nGet The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
