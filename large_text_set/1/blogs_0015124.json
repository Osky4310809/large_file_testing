Sanders will replace Oakland Raiders receiver Amari Cooper , who will not participate. \nSanders, who is making his second Pro Bowl appearance (2014), joins outside linebacker Von Miller , safety Darian Stewart , and cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Chris Harris in Orlando on Jan. 29. Related Articles December 20, 2016 Three Broncos defenders selected to 2017 Pro Bowl \nFor the third consecutive season, Sanders and Demaryius Thomas each had more than 1,000 yards receiving. They are one of seven NFL duos to achieve that in NFL history. \nThe accomplishment was more impressive this season given the Broncos’ youth at quarterback with first-year starter Trevor Siemian and rookie Paxton Lynch as signal callers. \nSanders finished the season with 79 catches, 1,032 yards receiving and five touchdowns. He received a three-year, $33 million contract extension in September that will keep him under contract in Denver until 2019. \nIt’s still possible for one or two more Broncos to join the current five in the Pro Bowl if current selections decline the invite because of injury, choice or because they are a participant in the Super Bowl . \nMoney, money, money. The NFL Players Association released Wednesday each team’s carryover spending figures from 2016. The Broncos can carry over $7,243,248 into 2017 to add to their league-wide set NFL salary cap, 13th most in the NFL. \nThe carryover amount, unused cap dollars from the 2016 league year, can be transferred into 2017 for additional cap space and spending. The Browns lead the NFL with more than $50 million in carryover dollars. \nThe NFL is expected to announce the 2017 salary cap in late February or early March. Multiple reports expect that figure to be between $163 million and $170 million. The 2016 salary cap was $155.27 million. \nDenver is expected to have between $35 million to $42 million in cap space before making key decisions on whether to part ways with players such as offensive tackles Russell Okung and Donald Stephenson. \nOkung has a $1 million option due on the first day of the new league year, March 9, which if exercised would trigger a four-year, $48 million contract with another $19.5 million fully guaranteed. It’s unlikely the Broncos would pick up the option, but they could re-do the contract to a more reasonable figure. \nStephenson has two years and $8 million left on his contract, but he could also be a prime candidate to be released because of his struggles at right tackle last season. \nBoth failed to live up to the expectations of their contracts. \nRegardless of the official numbers, the Broncos will have a healthy amount of cap room to keep important players and peruse the free-agency market for players who can fill holes.
