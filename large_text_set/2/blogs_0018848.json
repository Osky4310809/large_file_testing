Henderson/Getty Images Rob Goldberg Featured   If the Chicago Bulls are active before the Feb. 23 trade deadline, Nikola Mirotic might be the player on the move. K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune reports Jimmy Butler is likely safe from a blockbuster deal, but he notes the team has been \"aggressive\" in shopping Mirotic. The Los Angeles Clippers are considered a possible destination for the power forward. Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times reported in January the team was shopping both Mirotic and Rajon Rondo in order to improve the roster for this season. The organization has clearly ramped up its efforts on the former with just a few days left before the deadline. After a solid first two seasons with the Bulls, Mirotic has been a bit of a disappointment in 2016-17. The 26-year-old is averaging just 9.0 points per game while shooting 38.1 percent from the field, both of which would be his lowest of his three-year career. While he made 39 percent of his looks from three-point range a year ago, that number is down to just 29.9 percent this season. The Bulls are hoping to gain some value for the impending free agent while remaining in contention this season. The squad entered the All-Star break with a 28-29 record, good enough for seventh place in the Eastern Conference. If the team fails to reach the postseason, it would be the first time missing the playoffs in back-to-back years since the six-year stretch from 1998 to 2004.
