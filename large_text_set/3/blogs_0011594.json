The 31-year-old actress' attorney sent a letter on Wednesday to Celeb Jihad, acknowledging that the photos feature Seyfried \"either in various states of nudity\" or \"in intimate moments with her former boyfriend,\" and were meant to be private. \"These photographs are believed to have been leaked, i.e., wrongfully obtained by a third party or parties without Ms. Seyfried's knowledge or consent,\" the letter, which was obtained by TMZ , reads. \"Your unauthorized use and distribution of the Seyfried Photographs constitutes, at a minimum, copyright infringement, violation of Ms. Seyfriedâ€™s right of privacy under applicable law, and tortious conduct under state and common law.\" Seyfried's attorney is demanding the website immediately remove the photos and that they preserve any evidence related to the leak. ET has reached out to Seyfried's rep for comment, as well as her attorney. Nude photos of Seyfried leaked online on Wednesday, some featuring her ex-boyfriend, Justin Long, Gossip Cop reports. The actress is now engaged to 40-year-old actor Thomas Sadoski, and is currently pregnant with her first child. Interestingly enough, on Wednesday, Emma Watson also took legal action after photos of her trying on various outfits were leaked. \"Photos from a clothes fitting Emma had with a stylist a couple of years ago have been stolen,\" Watson's rep told ET in a statement. \"They are not nude photographs. Lawyers have been instructed and we are not commenting further.\" NEWS: Kirsten Dunst Tweets iCloud Dis Amid Nude Photo Scandal This, of course, isn't the first time A-list celebs have been the target of hacking.
