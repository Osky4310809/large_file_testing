(Picture: Halo) The impact of non-biodegradable packaging upon the environment is starker than it’s ever been.\nWhether that’s water bottles , beauty products or coffee capsules .\nThe 5:2 diet has relaxed its calorie count, but is it still any good for us? The latter in particular is one of the luxuries so many of us use on a regular basis but are particularly harmful to the environment.\nStine Wilhelmsen from Hubbub.org told Metro.co.uk,\n‘Coffee pods are really difficult to recycle, due to the specific material mix used – mixed plastics (PE and PP) and Aluminum – as well as the contamination caused by the coffee grounds. As most pods comprise of 6g of coffee per 3g of material, it is clear that the rise of coffee pods has serious environmental implications.’\n‘Another major issue is the lack of transparency. It’s practically impossible to find any data on the number of pods recycled / not recycled.’\nFarewell, waste (Picture: Halo) Luckily, coffee makers are starting to react to this issue, with most if they aren’t doing so already, promise to offer fully compostable (or at least biodegradable) coffee capsules in the near future.\nEthical coffee brand Cru Kafe, for example, promises that it’s ‘currently working on new 100% compostable pods’ while Lavazza says it’s ‘researching innovative materials, of which the compostable capsule is the first concrete example’.\nWhile Dualit, meanwhile, is already set up and running with compostable pods.\nEthical coffee brand, Halo, is one of the companies offering fully compostable packaging – an idea which, according to its co-founder Nils Leonard, was born out of ‘frustration’ about brands’ attitudes:\n‘So many of the brands on our shelves don’t have a real mission in the world, they don’t stand for anything outside profit,’ Nils told Metro.co.uk.\nSo he hopes that the environmental mission behind Halo will inspire other ecologically conscious brands:\n‘Like some of the most powerful ideas Halo is born out of a problem,’ he says.\n‘Capsule coffee is an environmental crisis.’\n\nThough for other emerging brands, he reminds that as with any product that people want to consume and enjoy, this can’t mean that other aspects of a business can be comprised.\nBut sometimes, being ethical and the story it tells can pay for itself.\n‘The truth is that you don’t need advertising if the brand has a story built in,’ he explains. ‘Our story is to bring the best coffee in the world to people in a way they love, without damaging the planet while we do it. ‘The challenge to anyone with an environmentally positive idea is just to start… And for all of us, to start making a difference in any way we can, with our everyday actions, big or small.’ Hopefully, with the help of Nils and other brands hoping to ditch non-recyclable coffee capsules, it’s one further step towards saying farewell to damaging packaging for good.\nMORE: You can now get Baileys iced coffee in a can \nMORE: Important things Lush is doing in the environmental and justice space right now \nMORE: Experts say sushi is wrecking the environment and our health \nMORE: Wine-infused coffee now exists in the world \nMORE: Starbucks is bringing fancy Nitro Cold Brew Coffee to their UK stores ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T14:09:28.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
