A new trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy V ol. 2 debuted on Tuesday night, and by the looks of it, the Guardians have their work cut out for them. The movie’s first trailer , released back in October, gave us a look at Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel ), and subsequent teasers have offered a glimpse of some of the new characters Guardians vol. 2 will introduce. This new trailer adds more intrigue by including Nebula ( Karen Gillan ), a secondary villain from the first film now returning to clash with the Guardians. We also get our first look at golden villain Ayesha ( Elizabeth Debicki ), sitting atop a throne and promising to “cleanse the universe” of weaknesses like fear, jealousy, and betrayal. But the trailer’s biggest reveal comes at the end, when Peter Quill ( Chris Pratt ) receives a surprise visit from an older man (played by Kurt Russell ) who reveals himself to be Peter’s long-lost dad. Guardians V ol. 2 , directed by James Gunn, is the sequel to Marvel’s 2014 space opera. Because the next big villain of Marvel’s cinematic universe is Thanos, and Thanos shares Marvel’s cosmic universe with the Guardians, there’s some interest in seeing how this sequel (and to some extent Thor: Ragnarok ,which comes out in November) sets the table for Avengers: Infinity War Part I (which comes out in May 2018) and the Guardians, Thanos, and the existing Avengers together. Guardians of the Galaxy V ol. 2 hits theaters on May 5.
