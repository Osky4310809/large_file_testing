Each captain leads a 35 to 37 member team with two lieutenants helping coordinate their efforts. \nEach of the different THON committees sports a different color shirt, OPP wears a familiar Penn State navy blue. In the depths of the BJC a river of colors flows through the corridors. Different committees flow on and off the dance floor, among them OPP's navy shirts move in masses keeping the floors clean and solving problems as the come along. \nLieutenant Rachel Hobbs was directing dancer area clean up when a member of Dancer Relations approached her with a problem, someone took a trash can out of one of DR's rooms and they needed it back. \nAfter Hobbs (junior-environmental systems engineer) spoke with a her captain they decided a trash bag would suffice for now. With bag in hand Hobbs tried to find the room with the missing can. \nThe river of color carried her around the BJC, through wrong directions from other committees, high-fives and hugs. The music muffled by layers of concrete still brought those in the river to dance. Hobbs dipped ropes and dodge groups carrying dancer mail to the floor. Once she got to the room she explained to a Dancer Relations committee member the situation. \n\"So we're trying to figure out the can problem, until then you can get bags from by the freight elevator,\" Hobbs said. \nHobbs said incidents like these happen all throughout THON weekend. \n\"One of my teams was cleaning up broken glass before, it's a lot of little things like that,\" Hobbs said. \nOPP helps with figuring out how many supplies THON will need to function. Not wasting things is a big part of OPP's job Tatano said. \nWith waste removal as a main part of OPP's job, Tatano hopes to reduce waste in the future to almost none. \n\"We hope to make THON a zero-waste event,\" Tatano said. \"Its not just for the kids, it's for the planet too.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:42:24.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
