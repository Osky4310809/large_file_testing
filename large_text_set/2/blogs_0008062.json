There would be a bet between me and him. \n\"In the first few training sessions, he was always winning! After that, not so much! Every time after, he lost! He didn't want to play anymore! It was €50 a game and by the end I had a positive balance! But I saw for the first time with him how important it was [to] train. \n\"I saw what I have to do on the pitch when I don't have the ball. You look at Liverpool now and how they play with the pressing. That is what I learned from him. \n\"He also improved my finishing. When I came to Dortmund, it wasn't so good. He told me to improve. He showed me what I had to do.\" \nThis season, Lewandowski has scored 15 Bundesliga goals to help Bayern top the standings after 19 matches. \nLewandowski and Bayern travel to Ingolstadt on Saturday.
