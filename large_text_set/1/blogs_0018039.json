You'd be a bit freaked out right? You'd probably also be a bit hopeful that you just stumbled upon a real life Toy Story situation, but alas, you would be disappointed. \nWhat's not disappointing is watching several fans and their friends attempt to figure out this impromptu escape room scenario that Captain America actor Chris Evans and Omaze put together. Evans and the crew used the Comicazi comic shop as their home base and had some fun with the regular patrons, which included making them don masks and goggles as they walked around outside looking for a stealth Hydra Agent. \nIt's quite entertaining, and you can watch the whole thing in the video above. Plus, the attention goes to a great cause, as Evans has partnered with Omaze to support his Christophers Haven non-profit organization. It helps parents and families of children with cancer find places to live while they are in the hospital with fully furnished apartments. \nWhile you're supporting a great cause you can enter in to win a chance to hang out with Evans at a custom escape room in Boston. The winner gets to bring three friends along for the escape room adventure, and afterward, they will join Evans for burgers and a beer. Your flight and hotel will be provided, and you will be put up in a four-star hotel. \nOther prizes to win include an escape with Chris Evans t-shirt and keychain, a signed copy of Captain America: Civil War , an outgoing voicemail message from Evans, and a signed Captain America poster, which looks to be from Captain America: The Winter Soldier . \nYou can head here to find out more about the campaign and donate, and you can find out more about Christopher's Haven here . \nDoctor Strange is in theaters now, and next up for Marvel is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on May 5, 2017. Spider-Man: Homecoming lands on July 7, 2017, followed by Thor: Ragnarok on November 3, 2017. After that Black Panther debuts on February 16, 2018.
