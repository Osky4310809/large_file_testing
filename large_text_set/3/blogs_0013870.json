The Duchess of Cambridge takes a drink of Guinness as she meets with soldiers of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards in their canteen following their St Patrick's Day parade at Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow. The Duchess of Cambridge sipped on a pint of Guinness to traditionally mark St Patrick's Day. \nShe toasted the pint with her husband the Duke of Cambridge after a parade of the Irish Guards. \nPrince William attended the event in his role as colonel of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards, an infantry unit who gather on St Patrick's Day for the ceremonial celebration. \nLed by a regimental band and their mascot Irish wolfhound Domhnall, 450 soldiers marched on Parade Square at the Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow, west London. \nDuring the parade Kate, wearing a dark green Catherine Walker coat, presented sprigs of shamrock to officers. \nThe royal couple then met some of the soldiers and their families for lunch in the welfare centre of the barracks where the longest-serving Guardsman in the battalion proposed a toast to and thanked the Duchess for presenting the shamrocks.
