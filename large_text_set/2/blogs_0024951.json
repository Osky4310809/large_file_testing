The film, which was simultaneously released in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil, has raked in Rs a decent collection of Rs 29.65 crore in 8 days through all the three versions. While many will argue that it should have made more money, let us inform you that considering the size of release, The Ghazi Attack has performed decently. However, we expected it to do better in the Hindi Version, where it could collect only Rs 12.75 crore in 8 days. \nTalking about the detailed collections, trade analyst Taran Adarsh revealed on Twitter, “#TheGhaziAttack [Week 2] Fri 90 lakhs. Total: Rs 12.75 cr. Hindi version… ALL VERSIONS – Week 2: Fri 2.40 cr. Total: Rs 29.65 cr. STEADY!” As Taran mentioned, The Ghazi Attack has been steady even with competition from a film like Akshay Kumar ‘s Jolly LLB 2 . And while the film got mixed reviews, a few people have been raving about the story and the performances of all the lead actors on social media. This has given rise to a small word of mouth publicity, which has helped the movie rake in the moolah.

Rangoon has taken up 1800 screens, so obviously Rana Daggubati’s film has a smaller screen space in its second week. Its performance over the second weekend will now determine if the film will sustain throughout the next week or not.

Apart from Rana and Taapsee, Kay Kay Menon and Atul Kulkarni are also a part of the movie.
