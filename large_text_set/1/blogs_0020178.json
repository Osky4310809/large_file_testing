Both tracks race on Friday and Saturday. \nClaims have been made in the High Court of Justice Chancery Division involving Coral, Ladbrokes, Coral-Ladbrokes Group plc, as well as Betfred and SIS. \nDispute set for the courts \nSince the start of this year pictures from six courses – Doncaster, Lingfield, Southwell, Windsor, Wolverhampton and Worcester – have been seen only in betting shops whose owners have done a deal with TRP, which represents the 15 Arena Racing Company courses and seven independents. The remaining 16 tracks will leave SIS to join TRP from the start of 2018. \nLadbrokes are the only bookmakers with shops on those six Arena tracks and director of media David Williams said: \"We have recently been informed that our on-course shops would need to close as a result of the ongoing media rights discussion with TRP. They will remain closed indefinitely.\" \nThe impasse has left the three major high street firms without any action from British courses on some days as a result of which they have resorted to other ways of providing a service to their customers, including offtube commentaries, the legality of which is understood to be under examination by TRP. \nWilliam Hill were the latest retail chain to agree a long-term media rights deal with TRP, which means more than 4,000 betting shops in Britain and Ireland are able to show the service. \nArc declined to comment on Wednesday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:29:04.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
