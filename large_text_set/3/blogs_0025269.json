The CEO of The Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger just outta nowhere dropped into a conversion that we’re going to learn a lot about Han Solo’s backstory in the stand alone Han Solo movie. Like, what, you ask? The things we’re expecting, like his first meeting with Chewbacca and winning the Millennium Falcon.\nOh, and also, how Han Solo got his name .\nAnd that means that, yes, Han Solo’s name might not actually be Han Solo’s given name. Does it feel like the walls are suddenly spinning around you? Yeah, same.\n\n\nSpeaking at a USC tech conference , Iger took a second to touch on the future of Star Wars , which is very nice of him.\n“We’re actually shooting now an origin story of Han Solo, which will come out in 2018. That picks up with Han Solo when he was 18 years old and takes him through when he was 24.” Then, he launched into a little bit more detail about exactly what we’re going to see. Go ahead and sit down for this one:\nThere are a few significant things that happen in Han Solo’s life, like acquiring a certain vehicle and meeting a certain Wookiee that will happen in this film. But you will also discover how he got his name.” Take a second to unpack that. We will discover how he got his name. That implies, Han Solo has not always been Han Solo, and this is a major game changer. This is a huge Star Wars bombshell. This, honestly, makes us question everything else we’ve ever learned about in life, because what else has been hiding behind the name HAN SOLO for the last 40 years? What are you going to tell us next, Iger, that Darth Vader isn’t really Luke’s father??\nEven worse, we’re still going to have to wait at least another year to learn his real name; the Han Solo movie is slated for release in 2018 (427 days, if you’re wondering). Have fun driving yourself mad trying to figure out the REAL name of our favorite OG scoundrel.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:48:14.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
