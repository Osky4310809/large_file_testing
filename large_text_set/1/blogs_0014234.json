IndiaToday.in | Posted by Parmita Uniyal A + A - Bani and Lopa get embroiled in fisticuffs. \nBigg Boss 10 will witness one of its ugliest fights tonight, where arch rivals Bani and Lopa will get violent and attack each other physically. \nIt all started on the first day of BB Call Centre task last night when Rohan, Bani and Nitibha were given the role of callers and Manu, Manveer and Lopa became the executives of the call centre. \nBani took her role of a hassled customer to another level altogether, when she called Lopa a gold-digger and made other such statements to provoke her. Lopa tried not to lose her cool and the task ended there. \nAlso read: Bigg Boss: Five reasons Season 10 is the worst one of them all \nTonight, on the second day of the task, the roles of the contestants will be reversed. During the task, it was Bani's turn to become the call centre executive while Lopa had the liberty to instigate her to cut the call. \nIn an order to provoke Bani, Lopa will say that she uses her mother as a weapon to gain sympathy from everyone. She also said that she never stood up for her when Priyanka Jagga hurled abuses at her. Bani will lose her cool at this point and will bang the phone several times. After the end buzzer ring, Bani will blow up and get into a brawl with Lopa.

Both Bani and Lopa will refuse to calm down and will begin to exchange blows. \nAccording to reports, surprisingly, so far Bigg Boss hasn't taken any action against the two. Earlier, when Rohan slapped Om Swami, he was nominated for the entire season as punishment. \nBigg Boss 10 airs Mon-Fri at 10:30pm and Sat-Sun at 9pm on Colors TV.
