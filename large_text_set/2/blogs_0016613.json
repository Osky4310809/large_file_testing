Photo: Apple \nFebruary 22, 2001: Apple introduces the iMac Special Edition, making its savior iMac G3 computer available in custom “Flower Power” and “Blue Dalmatian” patterned designs. A far cry from the super-serious, aluminum-heavy industrial design Apple loves today, these are some of the wackiest, most irreverent (c’mon, when was a real Dalmatian blue?) Macs Apple ever launched.\nUnder the consciously tacky exterior was a pretty darn great Mac, though. Pick your color, make your choice \nThe Flower Power and Blue Dalmatian iMacs were the culmination of an ultra-colorful range which also included the original Bondi Blue iMac G3, as well as Blueberry, Strawberry, Lime, Tangerine, Grape, Graphite, Indigo, Ruby, Sage, and Snow options. \nComing at a time when your typical PC was still a beige box or gray box, the decision to release the iMac in a wide range of colors was pretty revolutionary. It tapped into the same spirit of individualism that made “ Think Different ” work as a catch phrase, because the idea was that everyone could choose the color Mac that best represented their personality. Goofy marketing? Sure. A brilliant move? Definitely. \nIn some ways, the more hippie-patterned iMacs were a fun nod to Apple’s own past, as well as what was happening in the pop culture. The 1990s and early 2000s were full of nostalgia for the 60s, much like today is filled with 1980s-inspired retro. \nSteve Jobs himself always described himself, accurately or not, as being heavily inspired by 60s counterculture — even if it’s hard to imagine him having a Flower Power Mac in his office. \nThe reaction from regular Mac fans was about what you would expect. Not everyone was a fan of the new computers, but that wasn’t the point. With an affordable $1,199 – $1,499 price tag and decent mid-level specs (500 or 600 MHz PowerPC G3 processor, 64 or 128 MB RAM, 256 kB Level 2 cache, CD-RW drive, and 15-inch monitor), this was a Mac that could appeal to the masses. \nSure, not everyone would want a wacky patterned Mac would want one, but there would certainly be some who would. And they quite possibly weren’t buying Macs during the bad old days of the 1990s. A game changer \nAs I’ve written before in “Today in Apple history,” the iMac G3 was a game changer for Apple. In fact, you can make the argument that it’s the second most important product Apple ever made, after the breakthrough Apple II in 1977. It was the first real collaboration between Jony Ive and Steve Jobs and a massive commercial hit at a time when Apple really needed one. \nIf the iMac G3 had sunk like a stone, there possibly wouldn’t have been an iPod, iPhone, iPad or any of the other breakthrough Apple products which followed over the next decade. \nEven with that being the case, though, the Flower Power and Blue Dalmatian iMacs didn’t hang around for too long. They were discontinued in July, making way for the iMac G4 — a personal favorite of mine — which shipped in 2002. \nWhat was your favorite color (or pattern) iMac G3? Did you own one back in the day?
