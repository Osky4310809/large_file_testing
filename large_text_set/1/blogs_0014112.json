However, Chandler has not been considered fit for release and remains in prison to this day. \nIn 2014, following a cold case DNA review , Chandler was charged with and admitted a seventh rape on a 30-year-old victim, having stalked her as she returned home from the pub on March 27 1986. \nThe woman woke up to find she had been tied up and Chandler was on top and raping her, having climbed through a window into her Harrow home. \nThe attack only ended when the woman’s husband burst into the bedroom and Chandler fled by jumping out of a window. \nChandler admitted the attack in November 2014, but surprised police and prosecutors by also confessing to a rape which he had been acquitted of at his original trial. \nWearing a balaclava, he jumped out on a 19-year-old woman in a West Harrow park while she was sat having a cigarette and thrust a knife at her. \nChandler forced her to a secluded spot where he ordered that she strip naked and then he raped her. \nHe pleaded guilty to the March 1 1986 attack on Friday, after prosecutors had to seek to overturn his original acquittal because of the confession. \nAt the Old Bailey on Monday afternoon, Judge Mark Lucraft QC sentenced Chandler to three life sentences with five year minimum terms after he had admitted two rapes and one count of false imprisonment. \n“Between 1985 and 1987 you carried out the most appalling series of rapes – now in total we know you subjected eight women to the most frightening series of attacks”, he said. \n“The offences were committed at knife point, and both victims suffered physically and psychologically. \n“These were the most appalling offences and will have had the most devastating impact on the victims.” Read more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:39:52.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
