John Lewis is dominating Amazon's bestsellers list\nJohn Lewis, a computer science educator from Blacksburg, Virginia, may be the best example of this.\nMeet John Lewis, owner of the world's most confusing Twitter handle.\nImage: twitter/ @johnlewis /mashable composite\nBasically, if you search for \"John Lewis\" on Twitter, you'll get something like this:\nImage: twitter\nThe man at the top is the Congressman and civil rights hero who has been in the news recently after a Donald Trump Twitter storm. The handle in the middle is that of a large department store in the UK (you know, the one that makes those viral Christmas adverts every year).\nThe man at the bottom, meanwhile, is our hapless hero.\nBecause he joined Twitter way back in November 2007, John Lewis bagged himself the most straightforward Twitter handle of the three: @johnlewis.\nThe problem? It means he constantly has to field requests like this:\n@waitrose @johnlewis 2/2 you guys are to blame for the library closing down upstairs in the Podium. Can you confirm you're not the reason?\n— Caroline Ambrose (@caroambrose) January 12, 2017\nI can categorically confirm that I am NOT the reason for the library closing upstairs in the Podium, whatever that is. @johnlewisretail https://t.co/zLTETjdzdt\n— John Lewis (@johnlewis) January 12, 2017\nJohn Lewis is pretty much famous in Britain for the way he handles the annual surge of tweets mis-directed at the UK department store whenever they release their Christmas ad.\nAnd since Congressman John Lewis made headlines last Wednesday when he spoke out about Trump's nominee for attorney general , the other John Lewis has been fielding even more misplaced tweets.\nBows to @CoryBooker and @JohnLewis thank you for your fearlessness\n— Jana Fleming (@JtotheFlem) January 11, 2017\nYou should thank @repjohnlewis instead. He deserves it. https://t.co/t286msOzmY\n— John Lewis (@johnlewis) January 11, 2017\nPeople were quick to pick up on the added confusion.\n@johnlewis As if confusion with @johnlewisretail weren't enough for you to cope with! @repjohnlewis\n— Yvonne Johnston (@Whyjay99) January 11, 2017\nYeah, I'm a busy guy, what with helping run a country and being a corporate conglomerate and all. https://t.co/cQQoRTV7Gx\n— John Lewis (@johnlewis) January 11, 2017\n@johnlewis @repjohnlewis @JtotheFlem @CoryBooker are you ok , bit of a day today!\n— Carol Webster (@We41584304Carol) January 11, 2017\n@We41584304Carol I'm ok, thanks. It's a good thing the government takes off around Christmas.\n— John Lewis (@johnlewis) January 12, 2017\nFollowing Trump's Twitter rant about Congressman Lewis, though, John Lewis' Twitter feed took a depressing turn.\nDepressing day. 90% of misdirected tweets today were racist rants, which I did NOT redirect or reply to.\n— John Lewis (@johnlewis) January 16, 2017\nLuckily, despite the many unpleasant voices on the internet, there were just as many people who made their support for both John Lewis' clear.\nI wish Trump was a civil rights hero, a patient man on Twitter, and had a two year warranty. @repjohnlewis @johnlewis @johnlewisretail\n— David Estall (@Mr_Estall) January 15, 2017\nThis almost made my Twitter experience today worth it.
