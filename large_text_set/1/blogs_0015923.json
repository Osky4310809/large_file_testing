Each one of the top four have more than that now. \nThe two Manchester giants would have been viewed as title contenders with their tallies a year ago, and they are fifth and sixth! \n2015-16 was a season where the established elite under-performed and they have responded with renewed zest. Man United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates his equaliser in an absorbing draw with Liverpool (Photo: Reuters) Alexis Sanchez's Arsenal are in fourth with more points than last year's champions after 21 weeks (Photo: Getty Images) \nThe title race has rarely had so many contenders and the entertainment is thrilling. \nFrom Tottenham’s swashbuckling full backs that are stationed higher than the Shard, to Chelsea’s assassin-like ruthlessness. \nWe waited years for a scorpion kick goal and then two came along at once. \nIt’s not confined to the top six either. Andy Carroll’s clinching goal for a West Ham reunited was breathtaking, Bournemouth have provided comebacks and collapses that have captivated. Henrikh Mkhitaryan's scorpion kick came out of the blue but is just another of many highlights (Photo: Jan Kruger) Andy Carroll's strike on Saturday was a bona fide stunner as well (Photo: AFP) \nAt Hull City Robert Snodgrass has smashed in exquisite free kicks, and Sunderland despite their travails have unearthed a diamond in the rough in Jordan Pickford, who has produced some wonderful saves. \nWe are treated to the odd “off the field” scandal, that stimulates debate and adds extra spice to the narrative. \nIn 2013-14 it was as competitive but the leaders only had 48 points, Chelsea have the highest number of points after 21 games for 10 years. Magic moments aren't restricted to the top six, with Robert Snodgrass's free-kicks up there with the best (Photo: REUTERS) Sunderland's Jordan Pickford has proven his potential for show stopping moments, as well (Photo: Reuters) \nJust eight points separated Leeds and sixth placed Chelsea in 2001/02 but the points totals were a lot lower. The leaders had 41. \nThis campaign is an exceptional season of football and we should be proud of it. \nThe games between the top six are usually a measure of the quality level. Manchester United and Liverpool’s draw was absorbing without being technically brilliant. \nChelsea at Manchester City, Liverpool versus Arsenal were both great games. \nSome may disagree, and argue over a lack of quality when compared to Barcelona and Real Madrid but the games are compelling. They draw you in, they fascinate you. \nThe perennial debate over who has the best league in the world is boring. Jose Mourinho and Jurgen Klopp clash during Sunday's match that may not have been pretty, but it didn't matter (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) Harry Kane's Tottenham are the hottest on Chelsea's heels with plenty of stories still to be told this season (Photo: Reuters) \nIn my opinion it’s a pointless and silly one because it’s impossible to prove because there’s so many variables that are impossible to score. \nThe competition is more fierce in one league, the quality is higher in another, the amount of viewers is greater in the next, and the best players are scattered between them all. \nWhat we have in the Premier League is gripping, absorbing and competitive. It thrills and gets the heart beating faster. I love it, I bet you do too, and we should thank our lucky stars we have it.
