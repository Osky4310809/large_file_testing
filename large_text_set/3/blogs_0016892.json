The collision of stars that slammed into me hard and sent my neat little world plummeting into the ocean. I never expected it to be you, you know? But it is you. It’s all you. And now there’s no looking back.” ~ Beau Taplin ~ Love grows between the kisses, the hugs, the moments gilded in golden memories, between raindrops, between snowflakes. Love is the essence between each breath. \nLove grows silently in those times when we are least aware of what the heart is doing. While we focus outward on our lover, the inward work of the heart is done. \nLove grows quietly after we’ve made love, after soft touches, and fervent embraces. \nLove grows after arguments when we are suddenly aware of the fragility of true connection. \nLove grows like an out of hand fire in-between the moments of meals shared, hands held, tears shed. \nLove grows while we’re sleeping, tucked in against each other, skin on skin, breasts to chest. \nWhile we’re paying attention to the mundane things in life, love softly speaks to our soul, reminding us of this touch or that, this spoken tenderness or that heated kiss, and expands into every nook and cranny of our being. \nWhen we’re least expecting it, love fills our mind with remembrances of starlit walks, of sun-dappled naps, of naked need and silly jokes. When we’re turned away, in-between the doing and the creating of our life, love makes a nest in the deepest part of our being. \nLove finds meaning when we least expect it, and one day we wake up and know that we’re full, so full we may break open, because our hearts have been stolen. \nLove is what happens in the in-between moments, where galaxies are birthed and sunsets are closing. \nLove is a whisper until it becomes a roar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:21:12.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
