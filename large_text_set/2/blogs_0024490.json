The simplicity of monochrome makes it a timeless classic. \nNo matter what season, it just works. \nWhether it is prints, stripes or colour blocking, working the monochrome look is so easy. There's no stress of wearing colours that don't complement each other. Our favourite celebrities also seem to agree with us, as alluded to by some of their recent monochrome outfits! Now you know what colours to pick next, right? \n1. Kangana Ranaut actually loves monochrome a little too much. Here she is, wearing a Bardot dress with a black top and white skirt! \n2. Sara Ali Khan's checkboard print dress made news when she appeared for Shahid Kapoor's birthday! \n3. Shilpa Shetty looks sizzling in that monochrome gown that fit her goddess-like body like a glove! \n4. Sonakshi Sinha and her sporty take with a black and white bodycon dress looks quite fun and comfy! \n5. What did we tell you about Kangana? We love how subtle and elegant her monochrome sari looks. \n6. Athiya Shetty's white shirt paired with a textured black skirt looks quite fabulous. It is surprising how simple yet dramatic it is at the same time!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:02:21.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
