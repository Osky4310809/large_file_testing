Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. \nPeople, let's bring back butterscotch. Yeah, yeah, salted caramel has been all the rage the past few years, but butterscotch is the most underrated dessert sauce out there. Here's the hilarious secret.

Butterscotch Sauce From Anna Monette Roberts, POPSUGAR Food Notes \nButterscotch tastes best when it's served hot! Reheat it in a small nonstick saucepan over low heat. Alternatively, remove the lid to the mason jar, and microwave in 15-second increments, stirring between sessions, until sauce is warmed through.
