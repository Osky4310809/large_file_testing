Some hope they could take it a step further by sinking one of Trump’s nominees — but it’s not yet clear who that would be. There's a \"target-rich environment\" of extremely wealthy nominees whose fat-cat images run counter to Trump's populism and campaign promises to champion the working class, said Center for American Progress executive vice president Winnie Stachelberg.\nEight Trump nominees will be especially targeted by Senate Democrats, The Washington Post reported recently : former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson; Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions; Betsy DeVos; Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.); Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.); Andrew Puzder; Steve Mnuchin and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Trump's pick to lead the EPA.\nPruitt's belief that climate change may not be rooted in human actions makes him a top target for Democrats, who hope to use his climate skepticism to turn some Republican votes against him. And Democrats are spoiling for a fight over Puzder, Trump's pick for labor secretary, who is CEO of a company that franchises Hardee's and Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurants and has criticized raising the minimum wage.\nPuzder has \"a clear history of squeezing workers and has explicitly expressed positions that would hurt workers and benefit people at the top,\" one Senate aide said, making him the archetype of a nominee Democrats think reflects poorly on Trump.\nTillerson is the only nominee thus far who has drawn some scrutiny from the GOP; but, ultimately, the former ExxonMobil chief is in many ways a moderate, which will make it difficult to build a case capable of sinking his nomination, some Democrats said.\nBut it would be \"short-sighted\" to focus on a small group of nominees because Democrats are still waiting for some of them to submit important supporting materials, such as tax returns, said one senior Senate Democratic aide.\n\"We don't have the full picture yet, so it's difficult to say who has that thing in their past that might trip them up,\" the aide said. The nominees that Democrats are focused on fall into two buckets: people who have \"complicated and vast financial holdings, and people who are diametrically opposed to things Trump wants to take on,\" the aide said.", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/01/here-are-the-8-trump-cabinet-picks-democrats-plan-to-target/?utm_term=.61dbdd46ae8c", "http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a47368b0a5a0d76a85d2f96d983d4fd91090fd7380510fdfbe1205d037b47c0d", "http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a47368b0a5a0d76a903f49ebd3bda367cbc3197a1125ee6621c650dc8d0b7987"], "published": "2017-01-04T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:40:38.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
