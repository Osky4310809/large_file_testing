Meanwhile, unrest continued to brew in the Kingdom and Daryl ( Norman Reedus ) told a big lie for love (or something like it.) Here are the biggest moments from \"New Best Friends.\" The Walking Dead Cast: What They Look Like on the Red Carpet \nThe Kingdom's Tricky Dick It was no surprise to see Richard ( Karl Makinen ) taking steps to force a war with the Saviors after Ezekiel ( Khary Payton ) said \"nope\" to Rick's plea for an alliance, or that he enlisted Daryl to be his partner in crime. But while his plan to lay a trap for the Saviors was a good one, his choice of Carol as bait was not. When Daryl realized that the woman Richard planned to sacrifice was none other than his absent friend, there would be no more partnership — and a whole lotta punching. And when Richard pleaded with Daryl, \"I would die for the Kingdom!\" Daryl's response was a deadpan, \"Why don't you.\" (That sound you hear is Richard's odds of survival plummeting to rock bottom.) Lennie James as Morgan Jones, Norman Reedus as Daryl Dixon Gene Page/AMC \nA Tearful Reunion Now seems a good time to reminisce about that moment back in season 4 when Carol ( Melissa McBride ), having been exiled from the group, was reunited with Daryl in the woods outside Terminus, and the two shared a passionate hug that singlehandedly spawned a thousand filthy fanfics.
