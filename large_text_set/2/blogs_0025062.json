King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 11 hours ago 0 \nAsking Alexandria guitarist Ben Bruce sang praises of Slipknot's \" Iowa ,\" branding the 2001 effort the most metal album of all time in his book. \nThe musician told Metal Hammer : \"Slipknot's 'Iowa' [is the most metal album I own] - I still think that's the most metal album in the world, it's so filthy and raw. \n\"It was innovative and fresh at the time but it still hasn't been replicated - nobody's ever been able to deliver a record as aggressive as that.\" \nCorey Taylor Shares Disturbing Story of How He Cut Himself During 'Iowa' Recording, Naked \nDuring the rest of the chat, Ben was asked about the most illegal thing he ever did, to which he replied: \n\"On tour with Chelsea Grin in South America, we had a whole hotel floor to ourselves so we totally trashed it. We tried to pay for the damage but they wanted punishment instead. The police held our plane home on the runway to arrest me - they thought I was a fugitive but I'd only trashed a hotel so they let me off. The next time we went to the country, my name had obviously travelled round because my hotel room had no pictures, no fridge, just a bed!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:15:23.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
