Clarke's \nA sampling of what's on the way for 2017 in Center City - big and small: Rooster Soup Company , a luncheonette/diner at 1526 Sansom St. from the Federal Donuts crew that promises to send profits to charity (opening Jan. 23); bāo • logy , a takeout-oriented specialist in Taiwanese street food from Andy Tessier and Judy Ni Tessier at 1829 JFK Blvd. (February); Wiz Kid , Rich Landau and Kate Jacoby's vegan drop-in at 124 S. 19th St., next to V Street (February); Keen , a long-awaited bistro at 1708 Lombard St. (late winter); Maison 208 , a bar-restaurant at 13th and Chancellor Streets from Top Chef contestant Sylva Senat (March; hiring has begun via ); Tria Wine Garden , an expanded version of the popular wine bar, on 18th Street near Market (spring); a branch of the Northeast Philadelphia Peruvian favorite El Balconcito , replacing Tin Angel and Serrano at 20 S. Second St. in Old City (spring); and Giuseppe & Sons , a red-gravy Italian restaurant on the 1500 block of Sansom Street, pairing Michael Schulson (who has Harp & Crown next door) and the Termini Bakery family. Also, the Palm \nMuch of 2017's action happens to be outside of Center City. For starters, two neighborhood-oriented bar-restaurants are due this month: Booker's , at 5021 Baltimore Ave. in West Philadelphia from Saba Tedla of the nearby Aksum, with chef Michael Thomas, and the sprawling Chick's , \nOn the splashier side: the King of Prussia Mall spinoff of Mistral , the Princeton foodie fave (winter); Danlu , a long-in-the-works upmarket Asian restaurant at 3601 Market St. in University City from the team behind Nectar in Berwyn (late spring); a still-unnamed restaurant at FMC Tower at Cira Centre South from the creators of the New York City bistro Rebelle (spring); Cheu Noodle Bar's second location, at 1420 Frankford Ave. in Fishtown (March); a Montco branch of Cherry Hill's Farm & Fisherman Tavern , at Norristown and Horsham Roads in Horsham (April); chef Bryan Sikora and wife Andrea's latest, Hearth Kitchen , a bar with an Italian menu at the Shoppes at Longwood Village in Kennett Square (late April); the ambitious chain Founding Farmers in King of Prussia (spring); a second Tredici , in Bryn Mawr (spring); an unnamed wood-fired grill from former Zeppoli/Petruce/Vernick chef-alum Dom Piperno in Collingswood (June); and East Passyunk's first out-of-town chain restaurant, Barcelona Wine Bar \nIn Manayunk, the landmark Jake's/Cooper's Wine Bar is coming back later this month after a long shutdown from flood damage. Arpeggio in Spring House, Montgomery County, is preparing for a nearby move within its shopping center in the spring. \nAlso on the way are at least a half-dozen brew pubs or breweries with tasting rooms, including Goose Island , at 33 E. Laurel St. near the Fillmore in Fishtown; the nearby Fishtown Brewpub (1101 Frankford Ave.) and Evil Genius (1731 N. Front St.); Urban Village Brewing Co. at the Schmidt's Commons in Northern Liberties; Wissahickon Brewing Co. at 3705 W. School House Lane in East Falls; Second District , at 1939 S. Bancroft St. (at McKean) in South Philadelphia; and a Spring Garden offshoot of Chambersburg, Pa.'s Roy-Pitz Brewing Co. , at 990 Spring Garden St. Kurant Cider \nAlso: In the spirits world, Philadelphia Distilling \nJose Garces is coming to Tropicana in Atlantic City in March with three restaurants : Olon (seafood), Okatshe (noodles), and La Cerveceria (a bar). Michael Symon goes to Borgata with Angeline \nAs for the wildest concept, that would be Mad Rex , a post-apocalypse-theme restaurant planned next to the Fillmore , with an \"Entertainment Eatery and Lounge\" called Urban EEL n \nAs the local scene shows signs of cooling, some observers believe that the business situation nationally is downright dire because of fast-rising rents, taxes, labor, and food costs. In the Philadelphia area, the price of liquor licenses has skyrocketed as supermarket chains pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for the same piece of paper as a corner bar for the privilege of selling alcohol. \nTo some, the marketplace seems saturated. Chef/restaurateur Kevin Sbraga, who opened a branch of The Fat Ham \n\"There's no small business in the city anymore,\" said Peggy Stephens, whose tea company Premium Steap \nMuch new Center City development is poised east of Broad Street; among the newcomers will be stir-fry/salad specialist Honeygrow , opening this summer at 15 S. 11th St., and a branch of Wrap Shack \nTenants have not yet been announced for East Market (the mixed-use development along Market Street between 11th and 12th Streets) and the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia (the former Gallery, just east of that). Most, if not all, of these new restaurants are expected to \nBernie's \nBlue Duck \nBryn & Dane's \nBuena Onda \nFar East Descendant \nFox & Son Fancy Corndogs \nGina's 45 \nGrace & Proper \nHarvest Seasonal Grill ( Village at Newtown Shopping Center in Newtown, Bucks County, spring): The locally bred farm-to-table restaurant. \nLove & Honey \nOtis & Pickles Speakeasy \nPineville Tavern \nPoi Dog \nShoo Fry \n6 Feet Under \nSuburban Restaurant & Beer Garden (Eagleview Town Center in Exton): \nTuna Bar \nAs always, watch this space January 12, 2017 — 2:11 AM EST | Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate Commenting policy Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
