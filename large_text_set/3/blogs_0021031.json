When the gradient moves under the numerals–rendered in the Favorit typeface by the Swiss designers at Dinamo –they become legible thanks to the the color contrast. \n“When designing the watch, I was thinking about how to naturally hide passing time,” designer Jiwoong Jung says in a release. “My research began with how hiding occurs in nature, which led me to one of the best known examples––the chameleon’s protective color. Their defense mechanism is a kind of optical illusion, but a simple and effective way to have two things together naturally when superimposed.” \nThe watch is unisex, comes in three different colors (rose gold, black, and white), and features a Swiss Ronda Caliber 515 Quartz movement. While the gradient looks like an LED display in photos, it’s really a UV-printed circular gradient that rotates as time passes. “A simple optical trick, but it is a new perception of time,” Jang says. \nFind Hidden Time on Kickstarter for $128 . Shipping is expected in September 2017. About the author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:14:15.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
