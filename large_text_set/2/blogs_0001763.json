One lens says that the Mr. Prime Minister is trying to make the primary building blocks of quality education at different levels with which we can build the country of our dreams in the coming decade. Another lens looks at it entirely different and comes out with the judgement that higher education has been forgotten except few passing references.\nIt is upto you – which lens to wear. One argument can be that the system has reached this stage from last 70 years and someone needs to mend it by taking hard decisions which may not look good to the people who are looking for some immediate benefits. Another argument can be that we don’t want to be fooled by this ‘long term theory’ perspective.\nLet us first examine it in detail from the First lens.\nIt is the first time in the history of India that we will have a system of measuring annual learning outcomes in our education system. Until now, Indian education has not gone beyond content based education; while the world has moved to project based experiential learning. Welcome step of the Government in creating the innovation Fund for backward districts will be appreciated by all academicians and researchers.\nDuring my visit to any panel discussion or seminar or conference, the only recommendation was autonomy. It was a good feeling when I heard the following line in the budget, “Good quality higher education institutions to have greater administrative and academic autonomy”. This is a step in the right direction, which will pave the way for broad ranging improvements in the system because the institutions want to break the shackles of moribund affiliating university system.\nIn line with the vision of recently announced Padamsree Award winner Sh. Anant Agarwal, AICTE has come up with the Swayam platform similar to Coursera, edX and Udacity. In the coming year there is a plan to launch 350 courses. However, everyone associated with it must be cautious regarding the quality aspects related to these courses.\nAnother pain point in the education system is the number of tests after 10+2 and Graduation. A National Testing Agency outlined in the budget speech is a step in the right direction. My only advice here is that it should be manned by people with high professionalism and integrity.\nSome of you may have missed a very subtle initiative by our Prime Minister named as DigiGaon. If we see this in combination with STRIVE and SANKALP schemes, then the impact becomes clearer.\nLast year also, the Govt announced big funding for setting 10 private and 10 Govt institutions to be taken the world class level. Intentions are very good, but we will need people with passion and drive to take these initiative to their success. It has taken complete one year to just set the norms for selecting these 20 institutions.\nSo in nutshell, view that comes out of first lens is that we are on the highway to become a major education hub.\nNow let us see from the second lens which looks for some immediate and tangible results in the short term.\nWell… Every critique will say that the amount of funding allocate to education sector is very low. Even the ABVP (Student Wing of Sangh Parivar) is raising this issue from many years that the allocation of funds to education needs to be enhanced in terms of percentage of GDP.\nNext point can be that while the Govt wants to increase quality of education, there is no funding allocated for setting of Teaching Support Units or Education Research Centres in the Universities which can come with new pedagogy models and lead the whole ecosystem of quality education. There has been some funding by DST and other funding agencies in creating some Academic Teaching Learning Units, but that is too meagre to cater to vast country of ours.\nCritiques are also asking where the plan to fill the vacancies in higher education is. Where is the plan to set up Research facilities in the niche areas? Where is the plan to have proactive engagements with international Universities and Research Labs?\nBut from my deep and active engagement with higher education, I know that if you have good ideas and proposals then there are Govt Schemes from where you can fund your ideas. But the catch is that there is no free money available in the name of research, because the historic data says that there has been a low output in proportion to the expenditure done on research grants in last seventy years.\nUniversities, Institutions and Colleges need to rise up to the occasion and so as to march ahead with the mission to take our education system to the ancient glory of Nalanda and Takshshila times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:32:37.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
