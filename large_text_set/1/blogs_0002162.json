Save Getty Creative \nSince humanity hasn't quite figured out a way to directly take a picture of black hole yet, NASA's next major science mission will send a trio of highly specialized telescopes into space to study the high-energy X-ray radiation surrounding black holes, neutron stars and pulsars. According to NASA's announcement today , the ultimate goal of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission is to learn more about the gravitational, electric and magnetic fields at the edges of these cosmic phenomena. \nThe IXPE works as its name suggests: superheated gases around black holes become polarized and vibrate in a particular direction, so the IXPE gets a look at the invisible by measuring the polarization of those X-rays. \n\"We cannot directly image what's going on near objects like black holes and neutron stars,\" Paul Hertz, a director with NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington said, \"but studying the polarization of X-rays emitted from their surrounding environments reveals the physics of these enigmatic objects.\" \nThe IXPE mission will launch in 2020, and NASA expects it to cost $188 million including the cost of the launch vehicle, which is being provided by Colorado-based Ball Aerospace. The Italian Space Agency also contributed the Italian-made polarization sensitive X-ray detectors. The mission itself came from NASA's Astrophysics Explorer's Program , which accepts outside proposals for new missions and has led to breakthroughs in the study of everything from Earth's atmosphere to cosmic background radiation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T10:31:20.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
