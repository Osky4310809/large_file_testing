The fans have been waiting for Chelsea (Melissa Claire Egan) to find out that her best friend was working with Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) to frame her husband for Constance Bingham’s (Sally Keller) murder. \nAccording to Celeb Dirty Laundry , CBS may be forced by the fans to bring Adam back to Genoa City. The Young and the Restless fans have been pretty vocal about their desire for the soap opera to bring Adam back. Many of them stated that the show is boring without him. Plus, many feel that Chelsea belongs with Adam and not Nick (Joshua Morrow). \nThe Young and the Restless revealed that Chloe was the one that planted the fake diary that framed Adam for Constance’s murder. And that wasn’t the end of Chloe’s crimes either. She was the last person to see Adam alive before the cabin exploded. Many Y&R fans [still] believe that Chloe or Victor moved Adam to another location. \nPretty soon, Chloe will have a bonafide mess on her hands. The Young and the Restless spoilers indicate that Bella’s paternity could be revealed , which will bring up more questions than answers, Soap Hub reported.

She [falsely] believes that her life is back on track. Kevin (Greg Rikaart) wants to marry her (again). She has a gorgeous daughter and Adam is gone for good. Well, that could all change if (and when) Adam comes back to reclaim his life with his family. \nWhen Adam returns to Genoa City, he could expose Chloe as being the one that framed him for murder with Victor help and that she was at the cabin just minutes before the explosion. Just those two juicy tidbits would send Chelsea over the edge. She will feel hurt and betrayed by someone she thought she could trust. \nFor a while, it looked like Gloria (Judith Chapman) was going to expose Chloe’s paternity scoop. She ended up letting it go after Kevin begged her not to invade Chloe’s privacy. \nThe Young and the Restless spoilers tease that Billy (Jason Thompson) begins to see something special about Bella. Is it possible that Bella reminds him of Delia? Will he ever put two and two together and come to the conclusion that Bella is his daughter?

The Young and the Restless spoilers suggest that it won’t be long before Chloe’s lies catch up to her. When that happens, Chloe will be forced to explain why she made some of the poor choices she did. \nThe Young and the Restless fans are losing hope that Chloe will ever pay for any of her crimes. Every time it looks like Chloe will finally pay for something, she finds a way to get out of it. \nThe real drama will be when Chelsea learns that Chloe was the one who framed Adam for Constance’s murder. The Young and the Restless fans would love to see a catfight between them after the truth comes out. \nThe Young and the Restless fans, do you think Chloe will ever pay for any of her crimes? Do you think Chelsea will find out about her role in framing Adam? Will Bella’s paternity secret come out soon? \nThe Young and the Restless airs weekdays on CBS. \n[Featured Image By Mark Davis/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:34:22.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
