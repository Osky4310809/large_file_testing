The Philadelphia rapper has used the social media tool in the past to throw shots and this particular instance may have had similar aims. \nLast Thursday (January 19), Mill posted a photo to his Instagram page sitting in a driveway atop a luxury vehicle with the caption reading, “Left my bent in her driveway …. her ex ni#%a embarrassed #pullup.” He didn’t tag anyone specific, but given his recent breakup with ex-girlfriend Nicki Minaj, it might not be a stretch that Mill is still out there taking shots. (That said, does that really look like Nicki Minaj’s driveway to you?)

Mill claimed that rumors he’d taken the ring back were lies and tried to bury the chatter.
