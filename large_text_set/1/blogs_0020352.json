Trends Iran tension \nThe head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Ali Akbar Salehi, said Tehran reserves the right to “act appropriately” if Washington reconsiders the so-called P5+1 deal on the Iranian nuclear program. \n\"We can very easily snap back and go back … not only to where we were, but a much higher position technologically speaking,\" Salehi said in an interview with Canada’s CBC News. Ali Akbar Salehi: \"We'll have to wait and see what happens. Iran is a patient county, we will not react hastily.\" https://t.co/NUkFF7TEkS — abbas torabi (@abbastorabi60) January 22, 2017 \n\"I don't want to see that day. I don't want to make a decision in that course, but we are prepared,” Iran’s nuclear chief added. \nAccording to the deal signed in July 2015 between Tehran and six major world powers (Russia, China, the US, Britain, France, and Germany), Iran agreed to reduce the number of its centrifuges by two-thirds. \nUnder the deal, governed by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Tehran also agreed to cap its uranium enrichment below the level needed for bomb-grade material. \nThe Islamic Republic also vowed to reduce its enriched uranium stockpile from around 10,000kg to 300kg for 15 years and agreed to international inspections. In response, Western countries agreed to lift international sanctions.

Tehran is gauging the new administration's behavior in honoring its commitment to the deal.

This is only empty talk,\" Rouhani said. \"I don't think he can do much when he goes to the White House.\" \nThe UN Security Council which monitors progress reports on the implementation of Iran's nuclear deal, earlier this week heard that Iran is honoring its end of the bargain. \n“[The UN] has not received any report, nor is aware of any open source information regarding the supply, sale or transfer to Iran of nuclear-related items undertaken contrary to the provisions of the resolution,” Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman told the UNSC. \nFeltman also noted there’s no information on \" Iranian ballistic missile activities or ballistic missile-related transfers to the country undertaken contrary to the relevant provisions of the resolution,\" the UN news service noted .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:49:03.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
