It sounds like a joke, but a plucky group of retirees in suburban Boston has hatched a plan to keep poultry warm during the New England winter. \nThe unusual project began after members of a knitting club at Fuller Village, a retirement home in Milton, Massachusetts, heard about the hardships that some chickens suffer this time of year. \nCertain breeds shed their feathers and grow new plumage in the winter months. Others imported from tropical climates just aren’t suited for the wintry conditions. \nOrganizer Nancy Kearns said the project benefits birds kept on a neighboring estate known as the Mary M.B. Wakefield Charitable Trust. \n“I don’t think in my wildest dreams I ever thought anybody made sweaters for chickens,” said Barbara Widmayer, 76, who started knitting when she was 15 years old.

Making something pachyderm-sized, she joked, might be a little too ambitious. \n“Probably not something we’re going to do,” she said. “But you never know.” ___ Follow Rodrique Ngowi on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/ngowi . \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
