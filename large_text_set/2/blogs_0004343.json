From rocking the baby bump to walking the ramp while being pregnant and immediately afterwards, Kareena has done it all. Post the birth of baby Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi , Kareena unlike other actresses has been living in the limelight. The actress has already lost oodles of weight through yoga and we saw her sizzling avatar as she walked at the grand finale of Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2017 . But in a world where we see body shaming occur daily, especially in regards with the body types of various actresses, everyone would want to know what Kareena thinks about. \nDuring a recent interview with Hindustan Times, Kareena was asked about her take on this and she revealed, “It’s been just 46 days which people should know and I don’t know if any Indian actor has actually been kind of out there on day 46. I am very confident. It’s natural to put on a few kilos. There is a strict regimen that’s been followed which will take 2-3 months, but I don’t care. I am happy for it to take its course. Like I got pregnant and worked through my pregnancy. Exactly the same way is what I am going to take my life from here on. Not every actor will step out on day 46, knowing that they have put on a few kilos. But I think it is amazing, it is the most natural thing ever to have a child. I think just embrace that and understand that it is the greatest part of womanhood.” ALSO READ – Kareena Kapoor reacts to Priyanka Chopra’s compliment on Taimur’s lips and its priceless \nOn the professional front, Kareena is currently prepping for Veere Di Wedding , which also stars Sonam Kapoor and Swara Bhaskar .
