By Shoshanna Delventhal | February 6, 2017 — 10:35 AM EST \nPresident Donald Trump’s radical stance on restricting immigration in the U.S. brings to light a multi-faceted debate, including the importance of free movement for skilled tech workers. \nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, columnist Christopher Mims speaks with reporter Tanya Rivero regarding what may happen if skilled tech workers are unable to enter the U.S. Mims indicates that the policy wouldn’t work to boost U.S. tech jobs, instead shifting the centers of tech talent as U.S. startups work with remote infrastructure, moving outside the country and looking to Canada in particular.

H-1B Visas Under Attack \nAs Trump takes extremist actions regarding immigration, he also puts at risk the number of high-skilled H-1B visas accepted into the U.S. Since tech giants rely on this talent, Mims says they will leverage a variety of strategies including technologies around remote work. With the digital economy, even a startup can be multinational, explains Mims. \nHistorically, one of the reasons for a multinational presence was because companies needed to go where the talent was. Since startups are already accustomed to go outside the country, they will leverage existing infrastructure to move outside if they are afraid of moving people in and out. Mims indicates that a lot of skills are simply not taught in the U.S. anymore, using the example of analog circuits, in which no university in the U.S. has an expertise in anymore. \nTherefore, while some companies have abused the H1-B visas to replace U.S. workers, Mims says the U.S. is lacking native talents in certain areas. Due to the fact that tech giants such as Facebook Inc. ( FB ) and Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG ) need to bring in the best talent from around the world in a winner-takes-all business, the columnist says they are already thinking about moving headquarters outside the U.S. Mims indicates that companies are willing to restructure their company “on the fly” to deal with immigration issues, moving intellectual property and fundamental business outside the U.S. Welcome to Canada \nRegarding where talent will coalesce, Mims says there are startup hubs all over the world. In particular, Canada looks attractive as venture-capital investment explodes due to the emergence of an infrastructure that can finally support it. The columnist indicates that Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), Google, Facebook and Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO ) already have huge engineering offices in Canada. He says companies such as Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) currently have engineers stationed in Canada, and have the ability to ship engineers there from over countries if they can’t get them to the U.S. \nOverall, the industry specialist says it’s not a question of tech hiring talent inside the U.S. or not, rather that tech firms are going to hire who they are going to hire and all that Trump’s immigration policies will do is alter how they do it.
