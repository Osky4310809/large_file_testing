India posted 144 on a sluggish wicket at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur and were heading for defeat after a 52-run fourth wicket stand between Joe Root and Ben Stokes before Ashish Nehra (3 for 28) and Bumrah's (2 for 20) expert death bowling helped India defend 41 off the final five overs. \nEngland had moved firmly into the ascendancy when Jos Buttler hit 12 runs off Nehra's final three deliveries to reduce the equation to a very gettable eight runs off the final over. Joe Root (38) was adjudged LBW off the first ball of the final over despite replays showing that the star England batsman had inside-edged the Bumrah delivery on to his legs. Moeen Ali turned the strike over to allow Buttler to finish the game off, but the big hitting England wicketkeeper missed a slower one and was then castled by a delivery that skidded through. Chris Jordan swung and missed but scampered across for a bye to leave Moeen with an unenviable task of having to hit a last-ball six to win the game. He missed the wide full toss, much to the relief of the 11 Indian players on the field and their 30000-strong supporters. \nFor a second game in a row, India struggled with the bat, especially with the surface playing true to its recent reputations. KL Rahul found a good game to find form after a series of no shows, slamming a 47-ball 71 to power India to what eventually turned out to be a match-winning total. \nIf there were still lingering doubts about what Nagpur had on offer, Eoin Morgan's early moves after winning the toss made it clear. England did a Liam swap and handed the left-spinner Dawson the first over of the match. India's reading of the pitch wasn't too far off, although they removed a spinner - Parvez Rasool - to accommodate another, Amit Mishra. \nResisting the temptation to play Rishabh Pant meant Virat Kohli needed to assume the role of aggressor. He had a highly fortuitous start, top-edging a pull off Tymal Mills and then surviving what looked an absolutely plumb LBW appeal off Jordan. But just as he began to find his range, picking Mills off for successive boundaries including an incredulous backfoot punch over long-off for six, Jordan deceived the Indian captain with a slower ball and had him misting a lofted shot to mid-on. \nKohli's little cameo allowed India to reel off 46 runs in the powerplay but the arrival of spin sent them back once more. Moeen Ali, as in the Kanpur game, was at the heart of yet another middle-overs choke. And Adil Rashid, given an over this time, was equally up to the task with both the surface and the boundary lengths proving to be a trustworthy friend. \nThe duo gave away only 11 from their first three, with Rashid striking off his fourth ball to dismiss Raina with a googly. Yuvraj Singh then endured a troubled stay in the middle, reminiscent of his innings in the World T20 final of 2014. He got his first run off his seventh ball before a failed attempt at a sweep ended his 12-ball stay for four runs. \nDawson wasn't as effective with Rahul taking a particular liking to the left-hander in the 12th over, peppering the on side with a four and a six. But while Rahul contrived to propel the Indian total onward by completing a 32-ball 50, the new batsmen struggled for timing in the face of some excellent death bowling from the returning seamers. Manish Pandey was left increasingly frustrated by the lack of pace on offer with Mills and Stokes using the change-ups to great effect. Dhoni walked in at the fall of Rahul's wicket and played seven of the 16 remaining deliveries for only five runs as India finished their innings with an underwhelming final five overs, where they scored only 36 runs and lost five wickets in the process. \nEngland began watchfully as India followed the visitors' example to open with spin. But both Jason Roy and Sam Billings weren't to be tied down for too long. The duo picked up a six apiece in a 15-run third over from Yuzvendra Chahal. But Nehra brought India into the contest with a double strike, dismissing both the openers off successive deliveries. Billings was hurried into a pull by a surprise bouncer before Roy was done in by a ball that stopped on him. \nJoe Root held one end together, keeping the scoreboard ticking along by resisting the urge to attack the Indian spinners. Morgan plodded around for a 23-ball 19 before hitting Amit Mishra straight to deep midwicket. The legspinner celebrated a wicket off the very next ball when he cleaned up Ben Stokes only for the celebrations to be cut short by an overstepping transgression. \nMishra's lapse cost India 38 runs off 27 balls and potentially the match as Stokes set about rebuilding England's chase along with Root. The Durham all-rounder targeted Suresh Raina's (0 for 30) final over, clubbing a six and a four to reduce the equation to 52 off 36. From thereon England were in complete control until India's seamers returned. The 37-year-old Nehra bowled a miserly 17th over, claiming the big wicket of Stokes with a slower one and despite conceding 16 off his 28 runs in his final over, his bowling partner ensured India left Nagpur with a smile and the series still in the balance \nBrief scores: India 144/8 in 20 overs (KL Rahul 71, Manish Pandey 30; Chris Jordan 3-22) beat England 139/6 in 20 overs (Joe Root 38, Ben Stokes 38; Ashish Nehra 3-28, Jasprit Bumrah 2-20) by 5 runs. © Cricbuzz TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T19:47:58.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
