That was three years before the poet first published Leaves of Grass, which scholars say the lost novel foreshadows in various ways. \nCareful detective work and a bit of luck helped the grad student, Zachary Turpin, unearth the lost work at the Library of Congress, where perhaps the only copy of that issue of The Sunday Dispatch survives. The find is only the latest in Whitman studies; in 2011 a scholar announced the discovery of a trove of 3,000 government documents, handwritten by Whitman when he was a bureaucrat in post-Civil War Washington, D.C. \nThe lost novel is now being published online by The Walt Whitman Quarterly Review and as a book by the University of Iowa Press. \n“It’s not a great novel,” David S. Reynolds, a professor of English at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center and an expert on Whitman, conceded to the Times. But “it’s not a bad read either.” This entry was posted in Graduate Students , Research . Bookmark the permalink .
