Mike Hood.\n“Speaking truth to power can be risky,” Hawn said in a recent post on his Facebook page. “I re-confirmed that this week by speaking out rather more forcefully than was appreciated to the Commander of the RCAF and the Chief of the Defence Staff, on the issue of the CF-18 replacement.”\nHawn, who as Conservative parliamentary defence secretary was the Harper government’s point man advocating the purchase of the F-35 stealth fighter, outlined on Facebook what he believed were the flaws of the Super Hornet. He accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of “foolish and inaccurate statements” on the fighter jet file. “And you thought that Donald Trump was the only purveyor of ‘alternate facts’,” Hawn wrote.\nRelated Liberals admit ‘interim’ Super Hornet jets may only fly for 12 years, despite costing billions Parliamentary budget watchdog investigating unknown cost to purchase Super Hornet fighter jets Report critical of interim fighter jet purchases deleted from DND website amid plan to buy Super Hornets Hood asked Hawn to resign on Feb. 11 and Hawn did so, the RCAF confirmed in a statement to the Ottawa Citizen on Tuesday.\n“As political advocating is not compatible with continued service as an Honorary Colonel, Laurie Hawn has resigned as Honorary Colonel for 401 Tactical Fighter Squadron,” the RCAF noted in the statement. “His leadership and tireless commitment to the RCAF is deeply appreciated.”\nAccording to the RCAF, the public and the news media consider honorary appointees to be representatives of the Department of National Defence. “It is very important, however, that Honorary Colonels remain outside any public controversy concerning the Canadian Armed Forces, steer well clear of comments that could possibly threaten operational security and never use the appointment to promote political opinion or to seek political favour for the unit or any member thereof,” according to a policy statement forwarded by the RCAF.\nHawn acknowledged on Facebook that, “I have been very critical of the 100% politically motivated plan to buy 18 “interim” Super Hornets for some time.”\nJack Boland/Postmedia Network A U.S. Navy F/A 18 Super Hornet performs at the Canadian International Air Show at the CNE in Toronto, Sept. 4, 2016. “Most Canadians may not really care about Super Hornet versus F-35, but I think they do care about the waste of billions of dollars for very little return, especially if it’s purely in the name of politics,” Hawn added.\nIn November the Liberal government announced it was entering into discussions with the U.S. government and Boeing for the eventual acquisition of 18 “interim” Super Hornet jets until a permanent fleet for the existing CF-18 aircraft could be bought.\nThe Liberals said Canada is facing a capability gap because it doesn’t have enough fighter jets to fulfill its military missions. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has blamed the previous Conservative government for bungling the project to replace the aging CF-18s.\nThe Liberal government has acknowledged the decision to buy the 18 Super Hornets will cost more in the long run.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:51:38.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
