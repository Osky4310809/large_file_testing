Yogi Adityanath during his first press conference as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. PTI \nFrom Civil Lines to Ghantaghar, chants of \"Yogi-Yogi\" are heard frequently, while the 44-year-old's supporters virtually compete with each other in handing over laddoos to those passing by the Gorakhnath Temple where Adityanath was the 'mahant' (head priest) since 1994. \nA couple of days ago, officials of the temple had told reporters that more CCTV cameras would be installed in the temple premises from the safety and security point of view. \nEven the baati-chokhaa (traditional eastern UP dish prepared using gram) sellers are upbeat with the latest political development in the state and expect that their local cuisine would eventually make inroads in the dietary habits of people residing in western districts of UP. \nAdityanath was sworn-in as UP's 21st chief minister along with his team of 46 ministers on 19 March at Kanshiram Smriti Upwan in Lucknow. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP chief Amit Shah, Union Home minister Rajnath Singh, a number of a host of chief ministers from BJP-ruled states, former Uttar Pradesh chief ministers Akhilesh Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Narayan Dutt Tiwari had attended the grand swearing-in ceremony. \nThe saffron-clad Yogi, who is an ardent follower of Sanatan Hindu Dharma, hails from the Nath sect, the roots of which could be traced to Guru Gorakhnath, believed to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva. \nThe sect focusses on 'brahmacharya' (celibacy), yoga and self-purification through spiritual practices. \n 49  49 pm Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:28:26.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
