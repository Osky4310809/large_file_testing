Other hand rolls, including shrimp, cucumber and mountain yam (yamaimo), are also available, as are a couple of sashimi. Only soft drinks, teas, beer and sake will be served.

It already moved its headquarters to Red Hook, Brooklyn, and now, the company said, the distance to the Hudson Valley was proving to be too far to handle easily: 307 Wall Street, Kingston, N.Y., 845-338-6666, fleishers.com .
