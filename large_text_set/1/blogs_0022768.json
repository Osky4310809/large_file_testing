It was a gamble that didn’t pay off . Signing players from Portugal is tricky – in a league dominated by a big three, it can be hard for scouts to properly assess if a player is tearing it up because of their supreme ability (Cristiano Ronaldo) or because they are being carried, a collateral hanger-oner (Anderson) puffed up in the swell of routine victories over Rio Ave, Marítimo and the like. \nIt doesn’t seem to stop Europe’s elite coming back though, particularly when Jorge Mendes seems to have the ear of every sporting director from Madrid to Munich, and it is hardly surprising that Manchester United – who have recently regained top spot in the global Deloitte rich list and who are managed by Portuguese José Mourinho, whose agent is Mendes – have been linked with the latest bright young thing off the Mendes/Portugal production line: Gonçalo Guedes . Transfer interactive \nHowever, it seems that PSG have stolen a march on Mourinho and co, reportedly tabling a bid of £25m for the 20-year-old striker who – despite scoring just eight career goals in 52 appearances – is also being tracked by Monaco . Unai Emery said on Monday that PSG were interested in the striker, who is expected to sign for the French champions this week after missing Benfica’s game against Tondela at the weekend. \nOne man who could be heading out of Old Trafford’s exit door is Ashley Young , who hasn’t started a league game since November. A loan deal seems most likely, with potential suitors West Brom , Crystal Palace and Swansea all unable to match his reported £120,000-a-week contract, which runs until 2018. \nMarseille are having their patience tested: Sky are reporting that they’ve had a third bid of £22.5m for Dimitri Payet turned down by Westfield Ham, who still seem to be under the impression that one solo goal against Middlesbrough back in October, and nothing but mediocrity and nuisance since, means they can command a fee of £30m for a man turning 30 in a couple of months. \nSouthampton are closing in on Manolo Gabbiadini after Napoli stuck a yellow reduced sticker on the Italian striker and shunted him in the direction of the Solent. The 25-year-old has only played a bit-part role for Maurizio Sarri this season, and despite scoring in each of his last three appearances for the Italian club, Napoli are now willing to accept £14.5m, having previously valued Gabbiadini closer to £18m. \nIt seems that putting in sub-par performances for Aston Villa and the sixth-best team in Greece can still earn you a move to the Premier League: Joleon Lescott is back, baby! David Moyes has come over all nostalgic about the former Everton man he sold to Manchester City for £22m back in 2009, and despite the passing of time appearing to take its toll on the 34-year-old, Moyes is ready to fill the Lescott-shaped hole in both his heart and his back four by offering the defender a short-term deal.
