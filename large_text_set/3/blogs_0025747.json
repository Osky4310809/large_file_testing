It had to be Rowdy.\" Heather Cichowski @heatherceditor Mar 22, 2017 \nCarter Blanchard was diagnosed with vitiligo when he was in kindergarten. The long-term skin condition causes patches of skin to lose their melanin and turn white. When the 8-year-old from Arkansas noticed the skin around his eyes starting to lose pigment, he began to lose confidence. \nCarter's mom, Stephanie Adcock, said that her son would get home from school and the first thing he would say was that he hated his face and the way he looked . Then Adcock came across Rowdy, a black labrador retriever with the same skin condition. \nShe found the 13-year-old dog's photo online where he is nicknamed White Eyed Rowdy thanks to his distinct spots around his eyes. Adcock showed the photos to her son before beginning a correspondence with Rowdy's owner, Niki Umbenhower, who is based in Oregon. \nAdcock told KATU that just seeing the photos of Rowdy impacted her son. He was thrilled to see a dog who had the same condition as him and who was famous for helping kids with it. However, things got even better when Carter and his family had the opportunity to meet Rowdy in person after KATU viewers donated money for the trip across the country. \nRowdy's owners shared a sweet photo on Instagram of the pooch and Carter cuddling and wrote in the caption, \"Dreams came true tonight!!! Carter and I were finally able to meet in person!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T07:04:17.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
