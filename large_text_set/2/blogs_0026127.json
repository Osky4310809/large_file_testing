During that time, the state has added more than 2 million people, but once you account for inflation, state transportation revenues are actually below 1991 levels — and it shows. \nAnyone who drives in the metro area can see what is happening to traffic. Our main roads and highways are now congested — even when you avoid rush hour. The latest projections show that the average person will spend 50 percent more time stuck in traffic by 2040. We need smart, targeted improvements to our highways. \nHow big is our funding problem? Studies referenced by the Colorado Department of Transportation document that we have a $1 billion-a-year shortage in funding for roads, and another $1 billion-a-year funding shortage for public transit, and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure. \nBut expanding our major highways and roads is not a solution in the metro area. To do so would destroy existing neighborhoods and shut down businesses. To meet our mobility challenges — the metro area must invest in transit, bike and pedestrian solutions. Colorado ranks near the bottom in state revenues supporting public transit. Across the country, on average states provide 24 percent of the cost of operating public transit — in Colorado the state provides only 1 percent. In fact, per-person state spending on public transit is less than one penny per day. \nColorado also spends very little to help local governments improve safety and convenience for people walking or riding bicycles. Last year, more pedestrians and cyclists were killed in Colorado than at any time in the last 15 years. In our cities and towns, more than 14,000 miles of sidewalks are either completely missing or in such bad shape that they are almost unusable. \nWe are encouraged efforts in the legislature to refer a measure to the voters this fall to increase transportation funding. Making meaningful progress requires significant new revenue — there is simply no way to meet the need by reallocating existing funds. As Republican elected officials, we understand the need for fiscal restraint, but we know the needs are too great to ignore. The status quo is simply not an option. \nIt is critical that we raise enough money to make progress at meeting the diverse transportation needs of the entire state. Any measure must help both the rural areas that are critical to our agricultural and tourist economy, and our urban areas where most people live and most taxes are generated. \nA few years ago, a statewide coalition of elected officials and civic groups developed a revenue proposal that would address both roadway and multimodal needs. That formula would have allocated 67 percent of dollars to state and local roadway needs and 33 percent to all other modes of transportation. That formula allowed significant reinvestment in state highways and interstates and guaranteed the sales taxes generated by city and county governments would also be available to meet local needs. \nWe believe that a multimodal set-aside remains a critical component of any viable package. Without it, Colorado simply cannot meet the mobility challenges of an incredibly diverse population that includes the very young, elderly and disabled and those for whom driving is not an option. \nWe recognize that the way new transportation funds will be spent will vary statewide. In the metro area, we need highway improvements to help move traffic more efficiently and public transit improvements that connect people to jobs. In urban areas, we also need improvements to sidewalks, intersections and bikeways to allow walking and biking to be a safe and convenient option. Rural areas may focus dollars on better highway maintenance, adding shoulders to make the roads safer for all users, and transit service that allows seniors and the disabled to access critical services. \nA measure that funds state highways, local governments and multimodal transportation will allow all regions of the state to benefit. We urge state elected officials to show the vision and courage to refer such a measure to the voters of Colorado. \nMarc Williams is mayor of Arvada.
