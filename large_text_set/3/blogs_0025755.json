According to the rules of Eurovision, the broadcasting country should provide all participants “the opportunity to obtain an entry visa for the entire period of the event.” Thus, Yulia Samoilova’s refusal to enter the territory of Ukraine violates the rules of the Contest.\n‘We consider the offer of distance participation strange and refuse it, because it certainly contradicts the very meaning of the event, whose strict rule is the live performance on the stage of Eurovision.’\nMore: Music Watch Adele pay tribute to her 'soulmate' London after terror attack \nMetallica UK tour tickets - when are they on sale and how can I get them? \nKasabian tickets for UK tour 2017 - when are they on sale and where can I get them? \nThis is the first time in the history of Eurovision that a competitor is registered with the security forces of the host country for having broken the law of their land. As such, Ukraine believes that it has every right to deny Samoylova entry to the country.\nUkraine’s Minister for Culture, Vyacheslav Kyrylenko, tweeted that ‘broadcasts containing individuals who are banned from Ukraine are not legal within Ukraine and as a result the EBU’s proposal would violate Ukrainian law‘ and said that Russia would be welcome at the Eurovision Song Contest if they select an ‘artist who has not broken Ukrainian law’.\nThe EBU has told Metro.co.uk: ‘ We are continuing our dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities with the ambition to have all artists present to perform in host city, Kyiv, which is, of course, our preferred option. \n‘However, in case the travel ban on Julia Samoylova is upheld, we have to investigate alternative options. We have made a proposal to Channel One for one such alternative, and if accepted will review how to conduct this as fairly as possible within the framework of the local laws of the host broadcaster.’ \nUkraine’s entry is O. Torvald with the rock song, Time.\n\nThe statement from Russia’s Channel One goes on to attack Eurovision organisers for trying to find a solution, stating: ‘We believe that the European Broadcasting Union should not invent new rules for the Russian participant in 2017 and is able to hold a competition in accordance with its own rules.’\nLast night Channel One stated that if Julia Samoylova is not allowed to enter Ukraine, Russia would refuse to broadcast the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest and she would become their entrant for 2018.\nMore: Music Kendrick Lamar fans lose their cool after he teases a new album \nEBU goes to new lengths to accommodate Russia at Eurovision 2017 \nHarry Styles has gone all David Bowie in his new music \nClaims on social media suggest that although Channel One did appreciate the EBU offer, they had already decided to boycott the event in Ukraine, giving Julia, wheelchair bound since childhood, a strong story to promote her entry in twelve months time.\nThe EBU have yet to make a statement after Russia’s rejection of the proposal but have previously stated : ‘We have to respect the local laws of the host country, however we are deeply disappointed in this decision as we feel it goes against both the spirit of the Contest.’\nRussia’s outright rejection of the proposal would suggest that they will not be competing at or broadcasting this year’s Eurovision Song Contest, which is set to be one of the strongest ever in terms of music quality.\nAmongst the favourites to win the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest are Italy with Francesco Gabanni and Bulgaria’s Kristian Kostov, who’s Beautiful Mess is now second favourite with the bookies.\n\nMORE: Former Eurovision winner Mans Zelmerlow says the UK has ‘no chance’ of victory this year ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:00:32.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
