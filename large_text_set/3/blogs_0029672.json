During the summer of 2006, the crew set out to kill another man from Howard Beach and was responsible for at least four shootings over three months in the neighborhood, according to the indictment. \nThey also set a man's car on fire because a relative was cooperating with law enforcement on a case, prosecutors said. \nGiallanzo spent more than seven years in prison on extortion charges, but he remained a part of the violent gang and got right back into the business after he was released in 2013, officials said. \nHe worked for a few months at the All-American Deli on Cross Bay Boulevard, which Pisani owned, using it as a location for people to drop off their loan repayments, according to the charges. \nThe deli will be forfeited as part of the investigation, according to the release. \nThe pair's friendship goes beyond the deli, officials said. Pisani sold Giallanzo the home in New Howard Beach that the mafia boss turned into a \"gargantuan\" mansion that he used as \"a daily visual reminder to those in his neighborhood of his wealth and power.\" \nThe before and after of the home in Howard Beach owned by Giallanzo, who feds say used millions to turn it into a \"gargantuan\" home. (Eastern District New York.) \nAll 10 suspects were charged with racketeering conspiracy. \nGiallanzo, Pisani and Boothby were also charged with illegal gambling, and Padavona and Tanico were charged with obstruction of justice for giving false testimony to a grand jury in the case, officials said. Tanico was also charged with perjury. \nThey all face forfeiture penalties of more than $26 million and the loss of five properties. \nIf convicted, they face between two and 27 years in prison, with Giallanzo facing the most prison time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:46:18.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
