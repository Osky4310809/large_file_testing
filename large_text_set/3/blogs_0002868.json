Addressed to the narrator’s daughter (and, it seems, the daughter of that daughter), these words celebrate the hidden potentiality inside every woman—and the spontaneity of life itself, even in its contemplation of sudden death. \n—Lee Yew Leong, Editor-in-Chief, Asymptote Testament \nI’m about to fly off somewhereand my fear of heights plus myselffinds me resorting to tranquillisersand having confused dreams \nI want my daughter always to remember mefor someone to sing to her even if they can’t hold a tuneto offer her pure dreamsrather than a fixed timetableor a well-made bed \nTo give her love and the abilityto look inside thingsto dream of blue suns and brilliant skiesinstead of teaching her how to add upand how to peel potatoes \nTo prepare my daughterif I should die on a planeand be separated from my bodyand become a free-floating atom in the sky \nLet my daughterand later on say to her own daughterthat I flew off into the skyand was all dazzle and contentmentto see that in her house none of the sums added upand the potatoes were still in their sack forgottenentire \nTranslated from the Portuguese by Margaret Jull Costa Ana Luísa Amaral published her first volume of poetry, ‘Minha Senhora de Quê’ in 1990 and has since published 15 collections.
