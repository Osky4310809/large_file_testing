The new car builds on Honda's heritage in developing high-performance hatchbacks, and represents the segment's ultimate expression of dynamic purity. \nSharing the same fundamentals as the new Civic hatchback, the new Type R has been engineered from the ground up to deliver the most rewarding drive in the hot-hatch segment - both on road and on the race track. \nRevised 2.0-litre VTEC TURBO engine and 6-speed manual transmission \nThe 2.0-litre VTEC TURBO 'heart' of the multi-award-winning previous generation Type R has been optimised and refined and now produces 320 PS with peak torque of 400 Nm. Throttle response and driveability have improved thanks to optimised engine control settings. \nThe smooth and precise six-speed manual transmission is further improved by a rev match control system, ensuring no compromise in the Type R's intimate, rewarding connection with the driver. \nA stiffer chassis and revised suspension \nThe new Type R takes the lighter, more rigid body shell of the new Civic hatchback and adds further use of adhesive in key areas. Compared to the previous Type R, torsional rigidity is further improved by 38%. \nThe front Macpherson strut suspension of the standard hatchback is revised with new geometry to minimise torque steer and maximise sporty handling. At the rear, the new independent multi-link system of the standard car is improved with the use of unique high rigidity suspension arms. \nEnhanced driving modes \nAn enhanced selection of driving modes give the car greater usability compared to the previous Type R. A new 'Comfort' setting sits alongside agile 'Sport' and track-focused '+R' modes. Each selection tailors the adaptive dampers, steering force, gear shift feeling and throttle response of the car on demand. \nRefined aerodynamics for high-speed stability \nThe all-new Type R has a more comprehensive aerodynamic package than the previous model, including a smoother underbody, front air curtain, a lightweight rear wing and vortex generators at the trailing edge of the roof line. The muscular, aggressive body has a best-in-class balance between lift and drag, contributing to greater high speed stability. \nProduced in Europe, exported to major markets worldwide \nProduction of the new Honda Civic Type R is anticipated to start in summer 2017 at Honda of the UK Manufacturing (HUM) in Swindon - the global manufacturing hub for the 10th generation Civic hatchback. \nThe Type R will be exported across Europe and to other markets around the world, including Japan and the US. Its arrival in North America will mark the first time that any Honda-badged Type R has been officially sold there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:12:01.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
