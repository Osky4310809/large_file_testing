It is a formula with which many have wrangled, but with less success. (Consider the term ‘fashion plate’, and what it implies about the wearer’s marrow, to see how fashion can be a double-edged sword for women in the public eye.) Obama’s style genius was not to rely on timeworn first lady tropes, but instead to show the glamour of being brave and the elegance of being modern @JessC_M   08.00 GMT On the day Barack Obama clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, his wife made a powerful visual pitch for the role of first lady. In royal purple with a Kennedy-sized string of pearls, this was a look which made no bones of its White House ambition. This dress was an early signifier of the commercial power Michelle Obama’s fashion choices would come to have, giving a sizeable boost to the profile of its Chicago-based designer, Maria Pinto Photograph: Charles Ommanney/Getty Images Having played it relatively safe on the campaign trail, Michelle Obama went a little wild with her election night choice, a red and black Narciso Rodriguez sheath which raised eyebrows among commentators. Some compared it to a lava lamp. Yet this memorable dress helped imprint an image of Obama’s on-stage triumph that night which remains vivid more than eight years later Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images From the get-go, Michelle Obama made colourful cardigans a staple of her working wardrobe for daytime engagements. They became the equivalent of her husband’s white shirt-sleeved image: a modern, smart-casual uniform for getting stuff done. The cardigans she chose, with their 1950s pastels and country-club diamond shapes, leant a nostalgic sweetness to practical outfits Photograph: Paul Morigi/Getty Images Let’s Move, Michelle Obama’s campaign against childhood obesity, took her into schools to talk to teenage girls about body image. She dressed for appearances like this one, at the Alice Deal school, with a low-key sportiness which balanced teen appeal with looking age-appropriate. And never missed a chance to show those toned upper arms Photograph: Molly Riley/Reuters After the rainbow-coloured coats and fairytale white gown of the first inauguration, Michelle Obama cut a clean, unfrothy figure four years later. This Thom Browne suit continued her campaign of quiet support for well thought-of but low-key American designers, and its print – taken from a necktie – set a businesslike tone. The solid belt, something of a Flotus motif, and the pop of colour in the crimson gloves added personality Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images When the occasion called for it, Michelle Obama did not shy away from Oscar-worthy glamour. This Marchesa dress is daringly bare, but unimpeachably classic. Custom-made by the label behind some of the best red carpet dresses of recent history, this was a dynamite look Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Sceptics of the careful messaging enshrined in Michelle Obama’s often laid-back seeming wardrobe choices should consider her choices for the 4 July receptions for veterans held at the White House during the Obama years. This white halterneck sundress, in 2014, radiated the uncomplicated patriotism embodied by wholesome, small-town, milk-bar Americana. Similar in tone were her choices in 2013 (a floral shirt dress) and 2015 (pink gingham) Photograph: White House Pool (isp Pool Images)/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images The challenges of having a wardrobe subject to global scrutiny are greater than ever, in a global culture where the modest dressing of Islamic tradition has become a political flashpoint from the cities of the Middle East to the beaches of France. On a visit to Saudi Arabia, Michelle Obama trod a careful line, notably opting not to cover her hair, but dressing respectfully in an elegant knee length jacket over loose fitting blouse and trousers Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP The black tunic over cigarette-slim trousers, which Michelle Obama wore onstage with Prince Harry at the Orlando launch of the Invictus games, was the first lady at her most sophisticated. The all black had a touch of Donna Karan, the wrap shape a hint of Diane Von Furstenberg.
