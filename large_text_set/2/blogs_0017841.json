The type of guy that should be leading us here in the UK — Mark Lawrence (@MLawrenceJourno) February 21, 2017 \nJóhannesson clarified his comments on Facebook, saying that while he likes pineapples when they're not on pizza, he doesn't actually have the power to ban people from putting them on pizza. He also doesn't think that any president should have that power. Jóhannesson said that he recommends that people put seafood* on pizza. \nSo now we know: Many people have very, very strong feelings about whether fruit should be on pizza. (Personally, I don't care. Give me all the buffalo chicken, however.) \n* WHAT?! How is that better than pineapple?!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:03:03.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
