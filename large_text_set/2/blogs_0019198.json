Got it! ✉ Email \nWhat’s the best place to eat an orange? A fascinating question. Vexing, really. I tend to eat my messy, stressy lil’ spheres o’ citrus at the comforts of my creaky kitchen table. But I almost always keep a paper towel by my side. This process can often be unduly burdensome, after all; citrine residue sticking to my hands, juice flying into every bodily orifice imaginable. Eating an orange guarantees a trip to the sink afterwards, because I've gotta stay clean. \nAwful. Advertisement i have found a subreddit of ppl who eat oranges in the shower, to avoid mess. https://t.co/Ytszy8bWsE pic.twitter.com/ECKQs0ygbS — brad esposito (@braddybb) February 20, 2017 \nSo, here’s a solution. Yesterday, BuzzFeed reporter Brad Esposito came across the r/ShowerOrange subreddit, a community over 8,000 people strong that’s been around for a year now. It’s devoted to people who swear by eating their oranges in the shower, while the water's on. Their reasoning is that eating an orange in the shower is cleaner, safer, and more fun than eating an orange in some boring, traditional setting. The rules are ironclad: no nudity. No grapefruits. (Clementines, tangerines, and blood oranges all pass muster.) Be kind! All in all, solid pillars of a positive, nurturing community experience. \nThere are signs that this activity isn’t just confined to this subreddit, that it's being mainstreamed. Earlier this month, before this even blew up with Esposito’s tweet, Men’s Health ran an article unironically singing the praises of this practice, both for its cleanliness and ingenuity.

(Uh, I've never had a Shower Beer , either. Guess I'll have to try.) In the meantime, I'll enjoy going down this rabbit hole today, and I hope you do, too. Join in on the fun. Eat an orange in your shower. Take a picture of it. Drink a beer while you’re at it, too. Go crazy. Let me know how it goes. \nEver eat an orange in the shower?
