Set in a modern-day “Wild West,” the drama, written by Josh Pate and Rodes Fishburne, tracks the pilgrimage of a young, ambitious couple, seeking a better life, to the oil fields of the Bakken, where they come across roughnecks, grifters, oil barons, criminals and fellow prospectors. The pilot will be exec produced by Tony Krantz and Josh Pate, with Fishburne co-exec producing. \n“The Adversaries,” also from ABC Studios, is written and exec produced by “ER’s” David Zabel. The drama will follow the patriarch of a New York legal dynasty who becomes embroiled in a trial of his own, forcing his federal-prosecutor daughter to decide which side she will fight on. \n“The Advocate,” from Vendetta Productions, in association with Warner Bros. TV, comes from writer Sheldon Turner (“X-Men: First Class”), who will exec produce with Jennifer Klein, with Dr. Valerie Ulene and Byrdie Lifson-Pompan as consulting producers. The female lead, described as type-A, tough, resourceful and at the top of her game, has a medical scare, is dangerously misdiagnosed and experiences the hazards of the healthcare system, inspiring her to leave her career behind to become an advocate for those caught in the “chaotic and ever-changing maze” of modern medicine.
