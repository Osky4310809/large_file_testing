The Secret Service has been looking into her comments, and according to new reports , O’Grady will no longer be in charge of the Service’s Denver District. \nIt is currently unclear whether O’Grady was outright fired over her statements, since her fellow agents have reportedly discussed how she might soon be transferred to a new role under the Department of Homeland Security. Officers are supposedly holding conversations about whether the agency’s leadership is worked to provide leniency to O’Grady, which would allow her to finish the length of her career. \nThe Secret Service has been dealing with multiple complications recently in their efforts to maintain security for the president. One incident occurred when someone spent 15 minutes on the White House grounds after jumping the fence, and an agent in New York had a laptop stolen which contained the floor plans to Trump Tower. \n[Image via Shutterstock]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T02:19:44.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
