But that’s exactly what he did and it ended in tears on Sheree’s part.\nSheree says that hanging out after divorce wasn’t happening with her and Bob. “Definitely didn’t work for us.”\nHe asks, “What didn’t work for us?”\n“Once we decided to split,” Sheree says. “You and I wouldn’t be on a trip together like Cynthia and Peter.”\nBob reminds Sheree that after they’d broken up, they took a trip to Vegas together.\n“I was driving her and she fell asleep. I was like ‘Yeah, it would be easy for me to take the seatbelt off of you and hit the brakes so she can fly her a$$ through the window.”\nSheree : “He sure did.”\nThen Bob starts up with the lies. “I never hit her.”\nSheree nearly caught whiplash looking at Bob in shock.\nBob: “I don’t do that.”\nWhat made matters worse was that this whole conversation was taking place with Kenya and Phaedra in the car.\nKenya chimes in, “That’s not the look she just gave.”\nBob, seemingly confused, asks, “Have I ever physically touched you? Have I ever smacked you, choked you? For real have I? I might have forgotten.”\nSheree says, “You have.”\nBob asks, “Could you still breathe?”\nKenya : “That’s not funny. I’m sorry.”\nBob responds, making a bad situation worse. “I don’t remember choking her but if I did I’m sorry cuz maybe I didn’t choke you hard enough.”\nSheree, appalled by his comments, looks out the window and eventually starts crying. Bob, changing suddenly, tries to grab her hand. She pushes him off of her and Kenya leans forward to comfort her. That’s where the clip ends.\nWho knew?!\nObviously, Sheree knows Bob better than we do; but with a history like that and his cavalier attitude towards it, I can’t understand why she was ever contemplating a reunion with him.\nYou can watch the incredibly tense moment in the video below.\n#RHOA Episode 916 Sneak Peek. pic.twitter.com/rbWOrlL7fa \n— JoeyBGCBlogger (@_JoeyBGCBlogger) March 6, 2017 \n\nVeronica Wells is the culture editor at MadameNoire.com.
