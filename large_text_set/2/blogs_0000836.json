All I can say is from the day I signed until now and going forward, I'm eternally grateful for everything and to everyone. \n\"Chelsea fans gave myself and my team-mates such incredible support. Their passion and hunger drove me on personally to give my best year after year. I couldn't have done it without them.\" \nLampard is studying for his coaching badges and added: \"I look forward to pursuing the off-field opportunities that this decision opens.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:03:22.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
