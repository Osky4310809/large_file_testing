I want to say thank you because experience is a great teacher and I am experienced. I am on the spot and I have watched things in Lagos since my tenure ended. \n“I was worried hell when you (Ambode) took over, not about your credibility, character or capacity, but because however wise or smart a man is, if there is no resources to back the ideas, production would be zero, progress would be zero. \n“When you (Ambode) took over, I knew you inherited a burden of debt. The debt profile of Lagos was high, I was wondering how you will reengineer and face the challenges to make progress. \n“Today, I can see your report card, you have scored well, and you have shown prudency especially in the judicious use of resources of the state. \n“You didn’t disappoint us. Ambode is silently achieving, meticulously planning, religiously executing and brilliantly giving results for Lagos State,” the former Lagos governor said. \nTinubu said all over Lagos, the results of good governance were being felt by the people, and wished Ambode sound health and wisdom to continue to lead the State. \nBefore the commssioning of projects, Moslem and Christian leaders held prayer sessions at Tinubu’s Bourdillon, Ikoyi, Lagos residence. \nThe Moslem prayers were led by the Chief Imam of Lagos, Sheik Garba Akintola Ibrahim while Bishop Olanrewaju Obembe led the Christian prayers. \nIn his remarks, at the commissioning, Governor Ambode described the event as a historic day in the life of the people of Alimosho and the State in general. \nGovernor Ambode also flagged off the construction of a network of roads within the boundaries of Lagos and Ogun States, saying that it was in honour of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, whom he described as the brain behind the 21st century Lagos. \nHe expressed optimism that the roads which have been identified for immediate construction and rehabilitation would complete the new face of Alimosho constituency, saying that work would commence next week. \nHe listed the roads to include Ikola Road with Odo Obasanjo Bridge – 6.4km (from Ipaja/Command to Ilo River); Ogunseye Road – 1.75km (from Ajasa/Command to Ikola Road);Oko Filling Road – 1.5km (from AIT to Ilo River); Osenatu Ilo road – 620m (from Ibari Road to Ilo River); Amikanle road – 3.1km (from AIT to Ogunseye Road); Aina Aladi road – 1.9km (from AIT to Ilo River) and Aiyetoro Road with a bridge– 1.4km (from New Market/Ishefun Road intersection to Ilo River). \nHe however appealed to the affected communities to cooperate with the contractors to enable them deliver the network of roads not later than the scheduled date. \nAlso, Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State and Senator representing Lagos West, Olamilekan Adeola said it was obvious that Ambode started well and is doing well, and solicited the cooperation of the people to engender further dividends of democracy and good governance.
