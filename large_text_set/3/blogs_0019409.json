Apple \nApple just announced a load of new products on Tuesday morning. \nFrom glamorous red iPhones to cheap new iPads, the California tech company unveiled updates, refreshes, and accessories for many of its product lines. \nApple didn't hold a media big event to coincide with the announcements either. Instead, it just pre-briefed a few media outlets and dumped the updates on its website. \nBusiness Insider rounded up all the key announcements Apple made on Tuesday. Here we go: New iPads Apple \nApple updated and simplified its iPad line on Tuesday: Now, you can either get an iPad Mini, the new 9.7-inch iPad, or the iPad Pro in 9.7-inch or 12.9-inch varieties. \nThe new 9.7-inch iPad is actually a bit thicker than the iPad Air 2 — its case is about the size of the original iPad Air — but it has a much cheaper price tag, starting at $329 for 32GB of storage (or £339 in the UK). That tablet is powered by Apple's fast A9 chip — the same one that's in the iPhone 6s — but it lacks the special screen on the iPad Pro, including its True Tone display and wide color display. It also doesn't come with the iPad Pro's stereo speakers. Special Edition iPhone 7 (RED) Apple \nThe RED special edition of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus only comes in the 128GB and 256GB options, not the 64GB option. \nApart from the color change, it's still the same iPhone 7. \nWith each purchase of an iPhone 7 RED, Apple contributes to the (RED) HIV/AIDS program. Improvements to the iPhone SE Apple \nApple is ditching the 16GB and 64GB models of the iPhone SE, and replacing them with 32GB and 128GB options . The cheapest iPhone SE model still costs $399, while the higher-end version has gone from $449 back to its original price of $499. (In the UK it's £379 or £479.) A new app called \"Clips\" Apple \nApple's newest app is called Clips , and it's a mix of Snapchat and iMovie. It lets you create photos or short videos, or import them from your Photos app, to add special filters and effects before sharing them to your favorite social network. New Apple Watch bands Apple \nApple introduced a handful of new Apple Watch bands so customers can further customize their Watches. The new options include a new striped woven nylon, Nike Sport, and Apple Watch Hermès Bands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:14:36.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
