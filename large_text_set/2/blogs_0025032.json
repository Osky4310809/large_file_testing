RUDY SANTOS \nMANILA, Philippines - The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) has reopened the Surigao airport to commercial flights after repairs on the earthquake-damaged runway and terminal were completed. \nManuel Tamayo, CAAP deputy director general for operations, said the 1,000-meter long damaged runway stretch was rehabilitated and declared usable and safe for aircraft operations. \nHe added that a team from CAAP and Department of Public Works and Highways conducted coring tests and sub-surface soil exploration surveys on the runway last week. \nTransportation Secretary Arthur Tugade led other officials in reopening the airport to commercial flights, including that of PalExpress and Cebu Pacific, yesterday. \nSurigao airport was closed for operations last Feb. 11, after a 6.7 magnitude quake hit Surigao del Norte. \nQuakes continue to hit southern Mindanao with the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) reporting several incidents yesterday.   \nIn Davao City, at least five people were hurt after a 4.6 magnitude quake struck southern Mindanao early morning. Three victims were hit by a waiting shed that collapsed in front of the Palma Gil Elementary School, one was hit by a falling scaffolding while another fell from a footbridge. – With Edith Regalado, Roel Pareño, Louella Desiderio  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T10:34:30.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
