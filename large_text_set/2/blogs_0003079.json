Pence was a member of the audience. \n“We have a little message for you, sir, and we hope you will hear us out. We, sir — we — are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,” he said. “We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf all of us.” \nTrump blasted the cast for attacking Pence and he called the cast overrated. \nTrump took a bit of a hit at NFL commissioner Roger Goodell last November when asked if he would fire Goodell.
