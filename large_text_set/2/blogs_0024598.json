Indeed, such hearings are given after the minors turn 18. \nThe appeals judges appeared to accept the government's claim that the decision to require hearings could create problems for federal agencies. However, the court did not indicate that the feds were likely to prevail in the end. \n\"We do not suggest a conclusion as to the merits of the appeal. Given a sufficient showing of irreparable harm, a stay is appropriate when an appeal presents 'serious legal questions,'\" Judges William Canby Jr., Richard Clifton and Michelle Friedland said in a joint order. By Hadas Gold \nThe same panel of appeals judges who granted the stay to the Trump administration in the case about immigrant kids denied the government a stay earlier this month in the much higher profile case involving President Donald Trump's travel ban executive order. \nA lawyer for the immigrant children, Holly Cooper, declined to comment on the 9th Circuit's action Friday. \nCanby is an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, Clifton was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Friedland by President Barack Obama. \nThe order requiring the bail hearings was issued last month by Los Angeles-based U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, an Obama appointee.
