They are due to be sentenced on March 10. Laylah De Cruz: The model is facing jail \n\"The fraud was as simple as it was audacious\", said prosecutor Teresa Hay. \n\"Dianne Moorcroft changed her name by deed pool in summer 2014 solely for the purpose of participating in this fraud. \n\"She was encouraged and supported in the endeavour by her daughter, Laylah De Cruz.\" \nMoorcroft, who lives in Blackpool, became Margaret Gwenllian Richards so she could pose as the legitimate owner of the Kensington home. \nAnother member of the gang, calling himself Mark Armstrong, had already begun renting the property from the real Mrs Richards, but then went to solicitors claiming he was representing the owner and she wanted to sell up and move to Dubai. Fraud: The model in her police mugshot (Met Police) \nOn a second visit, Moorcroft – posing as Mrs Richards – joined Armstrong to back up his story that she was looking for a sale. \nShe secured a UK passport and Dubai residency permit in Mrs Richards name, and then convinced loans firm Finance and Credit Corporation to transfer £1,196,108 to a bank account in Dubai as bridging loan. \nThe money was swiftly withdrawn in cash before the Land Registry noticed the deal was suspicious and flagged it as a suspected fraud. \nDe Cruz’s role in the scam was revealed by texts she sent her mother, encouraging her to join in for a £30,000 fee which was then upped to £100,000. \n\"It's 30k, you fly here for two days then back, you can change to your other name, it's only your passport not all your docs\", she said. \nIn a later message, De Cruz added: \"It's now 100k for you.\" \nAt trial De Cruz stayed silent while her mother told the jury she had gone to Dubai on three occasions to open a bank account in Mrs Richards’ name and complete the sale of two properties. \nShe claimed Cronin told her Mrs Richards’ family had consented to the deal, and “didn't think he was asking me to do anything illegal at the time”.
