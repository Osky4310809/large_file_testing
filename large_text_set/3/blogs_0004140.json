She looks familiar in that position,” Rep. Richmond said, according to Independent Journal Review writer Benny Johnson. \nJohnson later tweeted that Richmond might have said “comfortable” instead of “familiar.” Politico reporter Hadas Gold was also at the dinner and tweeted about an “uncomfortable” joke the Louisiana congressman said about the photo of Kellyanne. \nRichmond’s office did not immediately return a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T06:40:09.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
