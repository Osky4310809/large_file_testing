The Atlanta-based producer revealed these plans in a detailed interview with GQ .\n“I’m heavily influenced by a lot of people like Dre, Pharrell, and Kanye,” he said in the interview. “They’re all big time tastemakers and trendsetters, just for culture, period. So I strive to do that as well. I’m starting my label up, so of course I’m going to keep bringing new things to the table: new artists, new sounds, and new vibes for people to love and live with.”\nAt only 23 years old, Metro Boomin has become one of the most sought-after producers in rap working with the likes of Migos, Kanye West, Future and 21 Savage.\nIn case you missed it, Remy Ma took more shots at Nicki Minaj in the ongoing feud between the two New York rappers.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T14:51:49.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
