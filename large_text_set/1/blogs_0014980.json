Oh wow. We were not aware. Oh my. I cannot believe it. This is bad,” said Salil Sankaran, Ampcus president, as he read TheDCNF’s exclusive story Thursday . \nTheDCNF has now revealed that two out of the top three mortgage officials in the country were forced out of their jobs for misconduct, and that both separately misrepresented themselves on their resumes and imposed a massive financial toll on taxpayers, without the agency informing the public. \nKinney’s bio on Ampcus’ website says she “was nominated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the Distinguished Recognition Award – U.S. Federal Government, March 2015.” \nThat award is also known as the Presidential Rank Award and is the highest honor available to federal employees, coming with a cash award of up to $63,000 . \nBut HUD spokesman Jereon Brown said “HUD nominated one person, Stan Gimont.” Gimont’s nomination is confirmed by the Office of Personnel Management . Kinney did not respond to TheDCNF’s request for comment. \nA direct subordinate of Kinney authorized the $1 million settlement from taxpayers to a black employee that Kinney called “Buckwheat,” a minstrel-like character from the Little Rascals, in order to keep the woman from suing, which would have made Kinney’s conduct public. The employee filed a complaint about the incident in 2013, and by 2015 the agency substantiated it. \nDespite the use of an unprecedented amount of taxpayer money, the settlement was supposed to remain secret, and HUD acknowledged it only under threat of litigation by TheDCNF. \nKinney retired immediately following the settlement. The settlement divulged that HUD had previously made a similar payment to a different black woman who filed a racism complaint against Kinney. But Kinney was allowed to remain in Ginnie Mae’s top job. \nAs Ginnie Mae’s chief operations officer, Kinney was in charge of all day-to-day operations, while the chief financial officer, David Fender, was in charge of $1.7 trillion in mortgage guarantee products. \nAlthough both left the federal workforce, Ginnie Mae did not disclose the misconduct even as Kinney and Fender used their former high-profile government jobs to move into other lucrative opportunities.

Instead, he was a serial con artist and failed businessman who had operated a string of scams in Asia, and immediately plunged the mortgage agency’s financial books into such disarray that they were unauditable. His previous boss told HUD Fender was a liar when they called for a reference check, but he was hired anyway. \nInspectors soon found that “due to deficiencies in Ginnie Mae’s control environment, accounting practices used, and financial systems deployed,” there were “$6.6 billion in total assets that we were unable to audit.” \nIt quietly fired him after supervisors realized he was an imposter, and he somehow got a job as CFO of a state agency. \nBut when TheDCNF revealed the circumstances of his departure from HUD, the state agency immediately fired him and embarked on a complete audit of the books he’d been in charge of–something that could have been averted if HUD had aggressively held responsible employees who were engaged in extreme negligence. \nFollow Luke on Twitter .
