Scott Thomas will star alongside Mark Strong ( Kingsman: The Secret Service , Sherlock Holmes ) who is in talks to join. \nThe Sea Change is about a group of people who re-evaluate loss, love, and human connection when they find themselves together on a remote Greek island. Emmanuel (Mark Strong) is a successful London playwright, married to the complex and witty Lillian (Kristin Scott Thomas) for many years, but their marriage is in crisis, a crisis which is overcome by the arrival of a curious and outspoken young girl, Alice (Anya Taylor-Joy). Their relationship is thrown into perspective when her life is thrown upside down. \nRebecca Lenkiewicz ( Ida ) adapted the novel for the screen and Barnaby Thompson ( Easy Virtue , The Importance of Being Earnest , St Trinian’s ) will produce for Fragile Films. Principal photography is scheduled to begin later this year in the UK and Europe. \nTaylor-Joy can currently be seen in M. Night Shyamalan’s box office and breakout hit Split for Universal Pictures and Thoroughbred for Focus Features. She was nominated for a BAFTA in 2017, for the Rising Star Award and is in post-production on the thriller Marrowbone for Lionsgate. \n(Photo credit: Getty Images)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T19:44:06.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
