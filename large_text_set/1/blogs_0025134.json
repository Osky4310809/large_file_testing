Microsoft itself hasn’t fully explained whether or not Scorpio is or isn’t a next-gen console, but at least one Xbox developer believes that it is.\nOver on NeoGAF , Ori and the Blind Forest creator, Thomas Mahler, answered questions about whether or not the Scorpio was powerful enough to be considered next-gen or if the system was merely just an update like Sony’s PlayStation 4 Pro. He gave a rather definitive answer.\n“Scorpio isn’t just a half-assed upgrade (which the PS4 Pro kinda is…), but a full-blown next-gen machine that’s just backwards-compatible to your current library.”\nWhat’s interesting about this statement is that it goes against what Microsoft and Xbox head Phil Spencer have said in the past. Microsoft has stated that the Scorpio will end console generations entirely — a statement that Xbox head Phil Spencer has also echoed . On top of that, Spencer said that Xbox games would be both backward and forwards compatible. Though Mahler says Scorpio represents an entirely new generation, Microsoft hasn’t made such a claim.\nYesterday, Digital Foundry released a story about a leaked whitepaper it had received on Project Scorpio. Among other things, the document said that Scorpio would be 4.2 times more powerful than the Xbox One. As I said in my editorial, that jump in power makes it seem as though Scorpio is a next-gen system. In that sense, Mahler’s belief that Scorpio is a next-gen console isn’t unwarranted.\nProject Scorpio is slated to be released during this year’s holiday season. We can’t say when Microsoft will officially unveil the system, but it’s safe to assume we’ll see something for it before or during this year’s Xbox E3 press conference. Hopefully, we’ll find out once and for all if Project Scorpio is an update or if it’s truly a next-gen console.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:49:40.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
