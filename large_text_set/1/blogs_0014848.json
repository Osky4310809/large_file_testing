That left a lot of guesswork in how these patients should—or shouldn’t be—treated. Now, researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine have determined that using CT scans, which detect levels of calcium in the arteries, can help figure out which of these patients would benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment . Those with higher calcium scores were more likely to be at risk of heart problems. \nTry This Memory Trick Need to remember some key facts and figures? Tell a friend them immediately after you receive the information .

After examining a family of bacteria called carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) at four hospitals, the researchers discovered they have many genetic traits that allow them to resist antibiotics, and that those traits are easily transferable among the different bacterial species. The result? CRE is a continually evolving threat—and it may be transmittable asymptomatically from person to person, meaning its spread can be much more insidious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:06:58.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
