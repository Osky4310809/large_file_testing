There are also some items from other TV shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Red Dwarf . \nVisitors are always accompanied by a guide, either one of the owners or a member of their expert team. \nOne of the larger items on display is the Console from the 1989 Doctor Who Stage Play \"The Ultimate Adventure\" but there are also original scripts and other production paperwork on display. Some costumes and props are in glass cabinets but others are not. Photography is absolutely fine so take as many photos as you like. Staff are happy to help and ready to take photographs. \nA lot of the collection is from the older series of Doctor Who so it's great for those who have been following the show for a long time. \nThe Who Shop has a lot of collectibles and I met customers from across the world. My favorite items on sale were the sonic screwdriver toothbrush, sonic toothbrush TV remote plus the Mr Potato Head Eleventh Doctor. I'll have to go back for those another time but I came away with a fabulous TARDIS notebook which is admired regularly.
