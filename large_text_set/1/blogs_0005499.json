Example: 20 magic resistance reduction reduces the target's magic resistance by 20, so a target with 30 magic resistance will be reduced to 10 magic resistance. (30 − 20 = 10) \nFlat magic resistance reduction can reduce a target's magic resistance below zero. For example, if an enemy with 10 magic resistance has their magic resistance reduced by 25, the enemy will have −15 magic resistance. Percentage magic resistance reduction Edit \nThe target's magic resistance is multiplied by a percentage (100% − the listed reduction). Percentage magic resistance reduction stacks multiplicatively and is ignored if the target's magic resistance is 0 or less. Example: 20% magic resistance reduction multiplies the target's magic resistance to 80%, so a target with 30 magic resistance will be reduced to 24 magic resist. (30 × 0. 8 = 24) \nPercentage magic resistance reduction makes a bigger difference on targets with higher magic resistance. For instance, with 40% magic resistance reduction, a target with 200 magic resistance will lose 80 while a target with only 50 magic resistance will lose 20. Percentage magic penetration Edit \nThe target's magic resistance is treated as being multiplied by a percentage for purposes of damage calculation (100% − the listed penetration). Percentage magic penetration stacks multiplicatively and is ignored if the target's magic resistance is 0 or less. Example: 20% magic penetration causes the target to take damage as if its magic resistance was multiplied by 80%, so a target with 30 magic resistance will be treated as though it had 24 for purposes of damage calculation (the target's actual magic resistance value will not change, however). \nBecause the target's actual magic resistance value does not change, anything else depending on that value also doesn't change (e.g. Runic Skin ). \nPercentage magic penetration makes a bigger difference on targets with higher magic resistance. For instance, with 40% magic penetration, a target with 200 magic resistance will be considered as having 80 less while a target with only 50 magic resistance will be considered as having 20 less. Flat magic penetration Edit \nThe target's magic resist is treated as being reduced by an amount for purposes of damage calculation, but cannot be reduced below 0. Flat magic penetration stacks additively . Example: 20 magic penetration causes the target to take damage as if its magic resistance was 20 less, so a target with 30 magic resistance will be treated as though it had 10 for purposes of damage calculation (the target's actual magic resistance value will not change, however). \nBecause the target's actual magic resistance value does not change, anything else depending on that value also doesn't change. Examples \nGiven 20 flat magic resistance reduction and 30% magic resistance reduction, and the target is affected by 10 flat magic penetration and 40% magic penetration, Target A has 80 magic resistance. The 80 is reduced to 60 by the 20 magic resistance reduction. The 60 is reduced to 42 by the 30% magic resistance reduction. The 42 is considered to be 27. 3 by the 35% magic resistance penetration. The 27. is considered to be 17. 3 by the 10 magic resistance penetration. Target A takes damage as if it has 17. 3 Target B has 18 magic resistance. The 18 is reduced to −2 by the 20 magic resistance reduction. The −2 is not affected by any further calculations because it is less than 0. Target B takes damage as if it has −2 magic resistance. \nGraph of % increase in damage of mpen vs no mpen, at up to 300 MR: Increasing magic penetration This article is outdated.
