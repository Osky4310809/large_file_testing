She rebuffed the idea that reducing the deficit should come through cuts to education, calling it \"stupid.\"\n\"Remember this: Nothing brings more money to the Treasury than investment in education,\" Pelosi said, according to the American Mirror . \"So when the Republicans say, ‘We need to reduce the deficit, and therefore we must cut education,' that is a stupid economy.\"\n\"Again, nothing brings more money to the Treasury to reduce the deficit than the education of the American people, she added.\nPelosi later suggested America's \"mission is about the future\" and \"demands that we invest\" in health, education, and the well-being of American families.\n\"This budget is really a slap in the face of the future,\" Pelosi told reporters after expressing hope for good will on St. Patrick's Day.\nThe post Pelosi: Trump Budget Proposal ‘Stupid’ Because ‘Nothing Brings More Money to the Treasury Than Education’ appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T16:27:29.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
