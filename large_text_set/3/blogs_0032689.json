By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 31, 2017 11:48 AM In the upcoming MCD elections, Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP is seeking to prove that the stunning victory in the 2015 Delhi assembly polls was not a fluke and it still can challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP. \nIn the upcoming MCD elections, Arvind Kejriwal -led AAP is seeking to prove that the stunning victory in the 2015 Delhi assembly polls was not a fluke and it still can challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP . But ahead of the crucial civic bodies polls, the rift within the Aam Aadmi Party ranks is evident as Janakpuri MLA Rajesh Rishi has aired his discontentment, cautioning CM Kejriwal against ‘sycophants’. This comes days after Bawana MLA Ved Parkash quit the AAP to join BJP. In a series of tweets, AAP’s Janakpuri MLA Rajesh Rishi quoted poignant couplets uttered by Rajesh Khanna in the film Amar Prem to manifest his feelings which indicated a regime nears its end if one relies on sycophants. He also tagged Kejriwal in his tweets. Rishi, however, later deleted the tweets and cleared the air saying he was not quitting the party. \n“Majhdhaar mein naiyya dole toh manjhi paar lagaye, Manjhi jo nao duboye usey kaun bachaye”, the MLA had tweeted. \nRead Also: MCD elections 2017- PM Narendra Modi for a safe, flashy BJP campaign to paint Delhi in saffron colours \n“I am with the party since the India Against Corruption days and will not quit the AAP or join any other party,” he said. It has been learned that he was not happy with the ticket distribution in his constituency for the upcoming MCD polls. AAP and its convener Kejriwal’s pan-India dream has already hit the roadblock after lackluster performances in the recently concluded assembly elections in Punjab and Goa. Notably, MCD elections will be held on April 23. \nWatch this video \n“The defeat in Punjab is yet to be looked into. It is high time we learn from our mistakes. I am not leaving AAP or joining any other party. I have been with this party since the India Against Corruption days and have given my blood and sweat in building it. There are times when you build a house and you see intruders pulling down its walls. It hurts. But you cannot just sit and watch. You have to save it. This is my party and I will stand up for it. We are revolutionaries,” Rishi told The Indian Express. \nThe party tried to control the damage claiming that everything is fine between the leadership and the MLA. After announcing candidates for MCD polls, the AAP replaced 15 of them. The party also termed it as an “internal matter” without giving the reason behind the move. It is not only trying to pacify those who were replaced, but also trying to deal with workers unhappy with ticket distribution. Even some MLAs are believed to have been unhappy with ticket distribution. \nAAP’s Bawana MLA Ved Parkash had quit the party early this week and attacked the Delhi government, saying it was “being run through laptop” and there is no connect with the ground reality. Parkash was also learnt to have been upset with the party over ticket distribution. AAP has 65 MLAs in the 70-member Assembly. Parkash said there was discontent among the people over the AAP governments failure to address their grievances. “The AAP has already a list of rebel MLAs which includes Devinder Sehrawat, Pankaj Pushkar and former minister Sandeep Kumar,” Parkash claimed. \nWatch this video \nRishi was in news after his brother was arrested for assaulting a women last month. Interestingly, the party had fielded Rishi, along with other Poorvanchali MLAs, to take on Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari when note ban was announced. \n(With agency inputs)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T09:30:18.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
