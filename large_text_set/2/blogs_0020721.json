It will replace the major final outputs (MFO) as the means to structure the national budget. \n“Recurring activities and projects, that contribute to a common particular organizational objective or outcome shall be grouped into a program under that outcome,” according to the circular. \n“This is being done to better articulate in the agency budget the programs and strategies being employed by the agency to achieve its organizational outcomes,” it said. \nThe DBM is focusing more on programs or strategies that would better assess an agency’s performance.   \n“More so, that performance information is provided for each program, revising the agency-wide approach under the Organizational Performance Indicator Framework (OPIF),” the DBM said. \n“Adopting a PREXC-based PIB, therefore, aims to facilitate the evaluation of the impact of agency strategies or interventions and provide better information for planning, prioritization, and the organizational management of agencies,” it said. \nUnit heads and program managers of each agency are also recommended to take part in the formulation of the performance indicators per program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:39:34.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
