Also included in the playlist are Future, Blac Youngsta, and 21 Savage , as well as tracks from 2 Chainz and Cardi herself. \nListen to Erykah Badu's playlist here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T01:42:43.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
