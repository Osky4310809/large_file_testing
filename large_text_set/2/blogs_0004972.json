The movies that portray love as all hunky dory and invincible, may sure make us feel all mushy and molten inside, but the reality is often a far cry from the idyllic world that rom-coms almost always serve us with on a platter. \nThe good news, however, is that all romantic movies are not My Fair Lady, Sound of Music or The Princess Diaries . There are movies that are romantic, yes, but sure as hell show us what love exactly is...and it definitely ain't perfect. Yes, it's a momentary, beautiful feeling that may or may not last a lifetime. And when it doesn't, it just doesn't. People may move on from their partners, but that doesn't necessarily mean giving up on Love altogether. \nThese movies depict the relationship between lovers and how what looks promising at the start, doesn't culminate into a happily ever after. And the depiction is done ever so beautifully that you'll still want to fall in love; maybe this time, just for its imperfections. \nWe bring you our favourites that have made love stories so much more real and relatable. 1. La La Land (2016) \nThis movie stole the show last year and swept the Golden Globes this year for good reason. It explores how two people, who're madly in love, choose their aspirations over being with each other. They sacrifice their love, with love. And can we forget the last, brilliant scene where they acknowledge each other with respect when their eyes meet--epic! 2. Her (2013) \nHow ridiculous does a man falling in love with his OS (yes, operating system) sound to you? Yeah, it did seem far fetched even for us, until we actually saw the film. It's a one-of-its-kind that evokes myriad emotions in a span of 120 minutes. We laugh, cry and ache to see the love story come to an end the way it does. And Scarlett Johansson's voice over stays with you long after you're done with the film. 3. Blue Valentine (2010) \nTwo people fall in love with each other and their respective imperfections. They marry, bring up a child together, and while dodging all the stones that life hurls at them; they grow apart and how. The reality of every scene in the film overwhelms you, so prepare yourself for this intense experience. 4. 500 Days Of Summer (2009) \nIt's not always that one reciprocates love the same way we expect. Each person has his/her own definition of the four-lettered word and the versions that we witness in the film make you warm and fuzzy one instant, and break your heart the next. It's a story of unrequited love. 5. Lost in Translation (2003) \nAn ageing actor and a young philosophy student find solace and comfort in each other's company rather than their own respective spouses, in the city of Tokyo. And they decide whether the fleeting moments of love are going to be transitory or otherwise. The film tugs right at your heart and gives you ample reasons to introspect. 6. Annie Hall (1977) \nEvery time Woody Allen and Diane Keaton share the screen in this Oscar winning film, it is magic and so so endearing. There's mush, humour, making love, and fights. A lot of fights. Their story is complicated, but so is life! 7. Casablanca ( 1942) \nWhen you have timeless beauty Ingrid Bergman paired with the inordinately suave Humphrey Bogart, the screen just lights up with their chemistry. A love story draped in a topical theme, Casablanca is one of those rare gems that not only have romance, humour, but also pathos and tense melodrama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:44:43.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
