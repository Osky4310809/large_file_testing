The wedding was a private affair held in Mumbai, and the reception that followed was nothing short of Bollywood award’s night glamour – only this time ethnic outfits ruled the roost! Everyone from Madhuri Dixit to Alia Bhatt and designer Manish Malhotra were present in their ethnic finery. While white seemed to be the colour on everyone’s mind, we’ve rounded up our own list and put together everything that caught our fancy. Bookmark these for ethnic fashion inspiration all year round. \nAnupama and Vidhu Vinod Chopra \nFilm critic, Anupama Chopra and B-town director and producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra were seen in their ethnic best, with Anupama in a head-to-toe white and silver ensemble. We loved the churidar and long kurta and the heavy choker neckpiece kept the look from getting too boring. A special mention for Vidhu’s deep blue bandhgala – seems like the perfect choice for a winter wedding. \nShop contemporary salwar suits . \nNita Ambani \nNita Ambani chose veteran Sabyasachi for her shimmer suit. Since this is the season of bling, we’ve got to give 10 points to the in-your-face-yet-subtle dupatta. Diamond jewellery complemented her outfit choice to perfection. \nShahid Kapoor \nShahid Kapoor chose the not-too-traditional black for the wedding, but in true Kapoor swag, he upped the style meter with his printed, monochrome pants. The Khanijo outfit certainly gets brownie points for its desi meets quirky vibes. \nShop ethnic wear for men . \nSonakshi Sinha \nBefore she headed out for the reception, we saw a glimpse of Sona in her wedding finery on her SnapChat and we were already in love. She pulls off the Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla white lehenga perfectly well. Also, the matching potli and pink lips make us want to bookmark this outfit for the next sangeet party we have to attend. \nShop wedding lehengas . \nManish Malhotra \nWhoever said men don’t have any traditional wear options needs to see this picture. Adding to the print bandwagon was Manish Malhotra with a scarf draped over his ethnic ensemble. Posing next to him, although not in his ethnic best, is Puneet Malhotra who works the classic suit and good shoes formula to perfection. \nYou Might Also Like: Shilpa Shetty Saree Looks That Gave Us #Fashion Goals \nVidya Balan \nNo one does a saree as well as Vidya Balan – okay also Rekha. The actress didn’t disappoint in this very traditional pattu saree. Just the right amount of shimmer and bling, needed at a wedding reception, don’t you think? \nShop art silk sarees . \nAditya Roy Kapur \nWearing a printed Shantanu and Nikhil koti over his traditional outfit, Aditya Roy Kapur certainly turned on the charm that evening. We’ve got to say we are getting a little jealous of all the men and their perfect ethnic style. \nKiran Rao \nWhile most people find Kiran Rao’s glasses out of place, we totally love them. They add to her feisty personality, and dressed in this beautiful blue saree with a noodle strap blouse, we think she is totally winning the desi style game. \nPerizaad Zorabian \nStepping away from the mass of whites at the wedding, Perizaad picked a pink and orange saree that looked totally at home at a winter wedding. We also love the dangling earrings and the gold and white clutch. \nDia Mirza \nDia Mirza glowed in a black and gold lehenga by Tarun Tahiliani. Her hair updo and gold jewellery perfectly complemented the wedding look. \nShop floor length anarkalis . \nAlia Bhatt \nArriving together at the reception, the two sent gossip sites into a frenzy … are they finally ready to admit they’re dating? That aside, we totally love the PYT (Pretty Young Thing) vibe that Alia channeled in this off-shoulder pastel lehenga/skirt by Manish Malhotra. \nAarti Surendranath \nA quick look at Aarti’s regular style and you know that she loves bling. Adding to her love for everything fine, the socialite came out in an all-gold saree that definitely didn’t look out of place at an outdoor wedding. We quite like the puffed sleeves that are making a comeback this year. \nMadhuri Dixit Nene \nMadhuri, the dhak dhak girl of Bollywood looked ravishing in a Tarun Tahiliani ensemble. We loved the nude shade that might have seemed like an odd choice for a wedding for us mere mortals, but looked perfect on B-town’s dancing diva.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T08:40:55.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
