And while you don’t have to keep swapping in pricey ink cartridges, you will have to buy special thermal paper sticky notes directly from Mangoslab, because the nemonic doesn’t work with 3M’s Post-Its, or the cheaper knock-offs your local office supply place sells. \nPricing aside, the nemonic works as simply and as streamlined as you’d hope it would. Through an accompanying Android or iOS app you can make sketches, take notes, and even snap a photo or import an image to use as a background. At the push of a button, your slick-looking sticky note almost instantly slides out of the top of the tiny printer making you appear like someone who totally has their life together. Even if the sticky note is reminding you to finally buy deodorant.
