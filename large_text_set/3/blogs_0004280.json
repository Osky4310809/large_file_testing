Under the Normans the site was used to keep rabbits for their meat and skins, as the poor sandy soil was ideal for the animals’ warrens. \nThe area was only excavated and identified as a flint mine – yielding an almost indestructible jet-black flint – in 1870 by William Greenwell, an Anglican priest and archaeology enthusiast. \nMany ritual deposits were found in the shafts including an axe made of greenstone from Cornwall and human and animal bones. Much of Greenwell’s vast collection is now in the British Museum, and the shaft opening to visitors for the first time is named Greenwell’s Pit in his honour. \nJust 10 prehistoric flint mines have been identified in England and only Grime’s Graves is open to the public . Of hundreds of pits originally sunk up to 13 metres deep, dug with immense labour using antler picks, visitors to the site were only able to go into Pit 1. This year English Heritage will open a second, Greenwell’s Pit, giving a better impression of the original appearance of the shafts. \nBooking starts this week for visits by English Heritage members from April and for the general public from June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T02:22:01.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
