Gary Weir fell victim to a form of dementia called Korsakoff’s Syndrome more than five years ago (Photo: WalesOnline) \nHe now lives at Pendine Park’s Bodlondeb centre of excellence for dementia care in Wrexham. \nHe said: “I loved working as a carer in Camden but I’m not well enough to work now. \n“I was going through a very rough patch. I realised I couldn’t live at home any more. \n“I have a lot of friends here at Bodlondeb who have dementia and I want people to know how it is for people with dementia and other conditions like mine. \n“The poem sums up what it feels like to live with dementia. \n“I like poetry and I wanted to get everyone to listen and know how it feels from a resident’s point of view. \n“People just need to be a bit patient and try to understand. \n“The staff here are kind and very caring they understand but other people don’t.” Gary chose to recite a poem about his condition to urge people to be patient (Photo: WalesOnline) \nArlene Elano, deputy manager of Bodlondeb, said: “Gary practiced a lot beforehand and the way he read it was so emotional it really struck home. \n“There were plenty of people who heard it with tears in their eyes, including me I have to admit. It was so touching and heartfelt. \n“Gary is a wonderful resident who is very active. He’s actually a very intelligent man who is fantastic at quizzes such as ‘Who wants to be a Millionaire’. He knows all the answers. \n“He has problems with his memory and he also has problems with roads and traffic. \n“Gary is clearly happy here and has a very positive influence on other residents.” \nSenior manager Gill Hughes was among those who listened to Gary recite the poem. \nShe said: “It was really quite emotional and you could have heard a pin drop. I think everyone present was captivated by what Gary said. \n“Living in a care home isn’t the end of your life and that is exactly what Gary was telling us through his poem recital.” Gary with deputy manager of Pendine Park’s Bodlondeb centre of excellence for dementia, Arlene Elano (Photo: WalesOnline) \nThe poem recited by Gary: \nPlease be patient with me. \nI am the helpless victim of a brain disease \nTalk to me. \nEven though I cannot always answer you, \nBe kind to me, \nEach day of my life is a desperate struggle, \nConsider my feelings, \nThey are still very much alive within me, \nTreat me with dignity and respect, \nAs I would gladly have treated you, \nRemember my past, \nFor I was once a healthy and vibrant person, \nRemember my present, \nFor I am still living, \nRemember my future, \nThough it may seem bleak to you, \nPray for me, \nFor I am a person who lingers in the mists of time and eternity, \nLove me \nAnd the gifts of love you give will be a blessing forever.
