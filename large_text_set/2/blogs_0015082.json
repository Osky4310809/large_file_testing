When it comes to bedroom activity, you like to surrender all control to your partner. You find satisfaction in pleasing them, and making sure they’re satisfied is your number one mission.\nYou got: Mostly submissive! You’re definitely more submissive in bed. You think it’s hot when somebody else takes control and knows exactly what they want. However, you do have elements of dominance in you, and although you can be submissive in most senses, you definitely make sure you’re not left behind.\nYou got: A balance of both! You’re a balance of both submissive and dominant, it all depends on your mood and the context. Sometimes you like to take the dominant role and lead the way, but other times you’re happy to fall back and let the other person take control. This versatility makes you very adaptable in bed, and sex with you is always memorable.\nYou got: Mostly dominant! You’re definitely more dominant during sex. You know what you want and taking control comes natural to you. However, although you are mostly dominant, you do sometimes like to take your foot off the gas and let your partner take control. But once that’s over, you’re back to your dominant ways.\nYou got: Dominant! You definitely like to take charge when you’re getting freaky. You like to have control of every aspect during sex and know exactly what you want.\n  10562296   \nBen Henry  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:09:17.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
