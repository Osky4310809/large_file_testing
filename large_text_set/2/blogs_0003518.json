Today, Inglis has emerged as an online activist of sorts, helping women embrace their imperfections while also learning to do the same for herself. On her Instagram page, a stirring side-by-side image of Inglis details how small she had gotten just a year before. So extreme was her weight loss that she had to be fed via a tube through her nasal passages. Inglis started the page in hopes of documenting her recovery and to galvanize others who might also be battling the same issues, as reported by the Daily Mail . Hammering this point home, with the photo , Inglis posted the following caption: “Firstly I want to say this is not a ‘look how skinny I was’ or ‘look how well I’ve done’ post. This is to hopefully show you that no matter how lost you are in your own head, it is possible to escape! It is possible to find happiness again!!! Secondly, you do not have to be this shape, size, colour or gender for your struggles to matter! You are always deserving of help if you are struggling!!!” She continued the post by sharing intimate details of her difficult journey. Inglis said she was so sick that she wanted to die before she was admitted to a hospital to seek treatment. She added that watching her weight rise was agonizing for her, and she had to be medicated and subdued as part of her recovery process. With the power of family, friends, and a loving boyfriend, Inglis found the strength to continue on and said she “fought like hell” because they were there for her. She said that her decade-long battle with anorexia might be over and she still has personal work to do, but she offered her encouraging story as a show of support for others just like her. Recent photos of Inglis show her happy and glowing, showing off her midriff, “pudge” and all, as she puts it. With close to 39,000 followers and growing, Inglis is giving voice to others who might not know where to turn. A commissioned report by BEAT, an eating disorders awareness group , estimated that around 725,000 people in the United Kingdom alone are affected by some type of eating disorder, with 11 percent of those being men, according to the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence. In the United States, 20 million women and 10 million men are battling or have battled with a form of eating disorder. This includes anorexia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and other related conditions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:58:00.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
