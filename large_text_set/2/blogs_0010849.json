Once Abe was able to free his hands, he seemed to cringe and roll his eyes, while turning his body away from the president. Trump is known for his aggressive greeting style, which involves shooting his hand toward the other person and jerking it up and down with force. It’s an odd move, considering his fixation on cleanliness (during a January press conference, he confessed to being a “ germaphobe ”) and rumors of his alleged “ small hands .” “Both these handshakes really soured from the beginning,” Susan Constantine , a body language expert who trains law enforcement and the Department of Defense, tells Yahoo Beauty. With Trudeau, Trump passively offers his hand, palm up, as if he’s asking the prime minster to dance. “Trump could have asserted himself by placing his hand on top,” she says. “Instead, he assumes a surrender position, which is incomprehensible.” Trudeau’s expression, she adds, is pure exasperation. “His lips are tightly pressed together with the corners pointing down. He seems to be withholding disdain for the moment.” Still, the prime minister is a good sport, and the two play along for the cameras.

The experience was likely unusual for Abe, who rolled his eyes and signaled to stand by placing his hands on the armrest of his chair. “It’s important to learn cultural norms when traveling as a global leader,” says Constantine. “For example, Trump’s infamous thumb-up gesture when he steps off airplanes could be offensive, depending on who is present. It’s possible that the president wasn’t prepared well for these meetings.” Let’s keep in touch!
