Tom Price, is facing questions from the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Wednesday morning. \nPrice’s confirmation hearing comes just as Republicans are attempting a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s landmark healthcare legislation. Recently, GOP lawmakers have split on how to go about with a “repeal and replace” of Obamacare, however. Debate has shown some legislators are wary of destabilizing insurance markets and sending premiums skyrocketing if they repealed the law without a replacement. \nFollow along with our live updates below. \n10:35 a.m. ET Tom Price gives his opening statement at his confirmation hearing. \n10:00 a.m. ET Top Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennesse, who chairs the Senate’s HELP committee, pushed for Republicans not to finalize a repeal of Obamacare until it has a replacement ready. \nSen. Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the HELP committee, said in a statement at the beginning of the hearing that Price will face tough questions on Obamacare and his own investments and stock trades involving health care companies. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
