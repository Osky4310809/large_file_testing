It is awaiting prequalification by the World Health Organization before it can be purchased by the United Nations and government agencies. \nAlthough 27 children in the vaccine part of the study died, along with 22 in the placebo group, researchers said their deaths were unrelated to the vaccine. \nThe “most common causes of death were infections and infestations (in 37 infants) and metabolism and nutrition disorders,” said the study. \nNo serious adverse events were found to be linked to the vaccine. \n“After the successful clinical trial of this new vaccine, we hope that it can be made available as soon as possible to children in Niger and across Africa,” Isanaka said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:46:04.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
