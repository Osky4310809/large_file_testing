In contrast to many other assistant services that hype their automation and technology, Lola proudly highlights the fact that its iPhone app uses human travel agents — English has described Lola as providing “human-powered travel.” \nLola users interact with those agents through a chat-based interface, allowing you to book plane tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and more. The app is supposed to learn your preferences over time and also help travelers deal with unexpected emergencies.
