The New York based brand has channeled their passion for fashion and dogs into a collection of pet-sized hoodies. Their latest includes a play on Kanye West’s “Pablo” merch, a very VLONE-suggestive option, and a number of “Anti Social Puppy Club” pieces in available in multiple colors.\nWe know its a Thursday, so after you’re done crying over the L’s you took from today’s Supreme drop , get into the holiday spirit and get your four-legged friend fresh too. Peep the gallery above and let us know if you’d like to see your own hounds hooded in that new-new.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:18:44.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
