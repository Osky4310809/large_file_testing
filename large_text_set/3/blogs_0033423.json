Still, it's totally possible to forget to do it until it's too late (ugh!), or to feel like you have to be sitting in front of a computer in order to actually go through a studio's schedule and figure out where and when you want to work out. Luckily, technology continues to make the process easier and easier. The latest development in class booking comes from a site you likely already use on the reg: Google Maps. (Here, find out if fitness apps actually help you lose weight .) \nToday, Google rolled out an update that allows you to use Maps directly to book classes. So now you can check out a studio's reviews, see how to get there, and sign up for a class, all in the same place. Pretty awesome, right? The feature was piloted earlier this year in cities like NYC, LA, and San Francisco, so if you live in one of those places, you might already be familiar with it. For everyone else, it's super exciting that it's now available anywhere with participating studios. (Psst: Here are more healthy Google hacks you never knew existed .) \nThere are actually two ways to book classes. The first is to visit the Google Reserve website and search for your favorite class (or something new!). The second is to open up a studio's listing on Google Maps or through Google Search (either on your desktop or through the app). If the studio works with the service, you'll see available classes right on their listing. Then, all you have to do is click \"Reserve with Google\" to book and pay. \nBoth methods allow you to see special intro deals at some studios, as well as get recommendations for other studios you might like based on location or workout style. Not only can you use the feature when booking classes in your home city, but it also comes in handy when you're traveling and not sure where to work out. (BTW, if you don't have time to hit up a class, these quick workouts designed for busy travel days will do the trick.) \nGoogle has partnered with class booking services like MindBody and Front Desk, so the process of getting into a class is even simpler if you're already registered with the service a studio uses. We're pretty psyched about this! When it comes to getting in a sweat session, anything that makes the process faster and easier is a seriously welcome development in our book.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:47:49.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
