That is to say, they have faced constituents -- voters -- with actual concerns. Men and women who want to know specifics about what their representatives have planned for them. Vote for me, then bugger off \nIn Arizona, our cowardly congressional lions are off cowering somewhere, afraid to meet you face to face. \nIt's pathetic. \nThey beg for your vote. They take your money. They enjoy all the privileges afforded to members of Congress. The kind of privileges ordinary people couldn't imagine. Travel. Access. Opportunity. \nMONTINI: Are McCain and Flake afraid of you? \nAll that you ask - and should expect - is service. \nThat means looking you in the eye and telling you what they're going to do, how they're going to vote, who they're going to support, even if they know it might make you angry. \nEspecially then, because you pay their salaries. You deserve that much. \nInstead, you're getting a lot less. They mocked Kirkpatrick for this CLOSE x Share Arizona's senators need to use more rubber mallet and less rubber stamp with President Trump, columnist E.J. Montini says. \nSome small groups of constituents have been trying to flush out our cowering congressmen, but without any luck. \nRemember how former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick was ridiculed in a campaign commercial for having run out of a town hall? I'd guess that a lot of people voted for Sen. John McCain in the Senate race because of those ads. Now, neither McCain nor Sen. Jeff Flake are holding town halls during the week off. \nMORE: Trump goes after 'so-called angry crowds' in GOP districts \nAnd neither are any of our Republican congressmen, for whom it would actually mean something, since Republicans control both the Senate and the House. There is a Republican president. They control the legislative process. They can do anything they want. And they have chosen to do is ignore you. \nAvoid you. \nDisrespect you. How to contact your absent lawmakers \nYou could contact them by telephone. Maybe. Depending on whether their messaging systems are functioning. And depending on whether they actual listen to those messages. \nRep. Paul Gosar’s Arizona office can be reached at (928) 445-1683 or his Washington office at (202) 225-2315. \nRep. Andy Biggs’s Arizona office can be reached at at (480) 699-8239 or his Washington office at (202) 225-2635. \nRep. David Schweikert’s Arizona office can be reached at (480) 946-2411 or his Washington office at (202) 225-2190. \nRep. Trent Franks's Arizona office can be reached at (623) 776-7911 or his Washington office at (202) 225-4576. \nNone of them scheduled town halls open to the public during their recess week. As candidates they roar like lions. As congressmen they cower. \nNo courtesy, candor or courage. \nOh my.
