[Image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images] \nThat plan only came about after Angelina was sure that Pitt had cheated on her with Marion — it’s unclear how the Salt star came to that conclusion, but after confronting Brad about it on multiple occasions, the 41-year-old is said to have had no reason not to believe what she had already known to begin with. \nWhen reports suggested that Angelina Jolie’s marriage fell flat over the cheating claims between Brad and Cotillard, 41, the A-list movie star was quick to deny the claims, stressing he had never stepped out of his relationship throughout his time with Jolie. \nHollywood Life alleges that Angelina is not buying it. She’s always been concerned about Brad and his supposed cheating ways, often reminding herself that she ended up getting with Pitt while he was still married to Jennifer Aniston. \nFans will recall the couple’s infamous breakup in 2005, when the 53-year-old decided to call it quits with the Friends actress, having grown a close bond with Angelina, who he had just wrapped shooting their hit movie Mr & Mrs Smith with. \nSources are now stressing that the main reason for Jolie’s decision to end things with Brad is because she was very much convinced that the man she had spent 12 years of her life with had cheated on her, and while Pitt continuously denied it, Angelina was ready to end their marriage and move on with her life. \nThat is what then ignited the custody war between the two , insiders claim, with Angelina Jolie going to extreme lengths in portraying Brad to be anything but a father who is capable of taking care of their six children. \nAllegedly using her PR team to create a smear campaign around her ex-husband would see stories such as child and substance abuse come forward — Angelina Jolie’s supposed way to give her the upper chance of winning the forthcoming custody court case against Brad. [Image by J Redden/UNHCR via Getty Images] \n“Angelina is obsessed with fears that Brad may have cheated on her with Marion Cotillard, 41 — even though both Marion and Brad have denied it — and that’s what prompted the break-up in the first place,” a source reveals. \n“He swears blind that he didn’t, but she refuses to believe him — she actually even threw back in face the fact that they met and became close while he was still to married to Jen. [Angelina Jolie] was using it as a convenient excuse, and that she had wanted to end the marriage for months as they had been fighting a lot towards the end.” \nAfter Angelina Jolie’s suspicions regarding her husband’s alleged cheating affair months prior to filing the divorce papers in September, the mother-of-six reportedly fell out of love with Brad and refused to be around him, the source adds. \nThis has now led to the couple’s nasty divorce and custody battle, Telegraph reports, which is expected to set the former couple back by $10 million, making it one of the priciest Hollywood court cases in recent years. \n[Featured Image by Milos Bicanski/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:41:43.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
