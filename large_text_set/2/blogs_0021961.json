His heavy quantity of releases has allowed him to sit at multiple positions in the charts at any given moment. Having just secured his fourth consecutive number one album with FUTURE, the Atlanta rapper may see more than one album in the top 10.\nJust yesterday, Future dropped HNDRXX, a week after the release of his self-titled album. The latter had a more prominent trap sound, and the former saw Future become more introspective and rely more heavily on his vocals. While he’s often been accused of over-saturation, it’s a smart strategy for ensuring his music pulls the numbers and, with an artist like Future, that isn’t difficult.\nLast night, Future took to Twitter to celebrate his achievement:\n#1 #2 album in the world 🙏🏾🙏🏾 god got me,Sorry\n— FUTURE/FREEBANDZ (@1future) February 24, 2017 \n\nIn other music news, Stormzy has dropped his highly-anticipated debut album Gang Signs & Prayer yesterday.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:50:34.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
