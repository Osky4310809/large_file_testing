The one-time Cy Young award-winner turned ESPN baseball analyst turned insane Twitter person continued his rather astonishing descent on Monday night and Tuesday morning by getting into it with CNN contributor Jason Kander about Donald Trump’s latest remarks about the military. \nKander, an Afghanistan veteran and former Army intelligence officer, took exception as many did to Trump saying the U.S. military no longer fights to win. \nPOTUS just said our soldiers \"don't fight to win.\" \nI'd happily introduce him to some friends of mine who have fought pretty hard to win.\n— Jason Kander (@JasonKander) February 27, 2017 \n\nIt’s a reasonable stance from a veteran to be upset when the Commander in Chief makes such a remark. Former baseball player Curt Schilling, who has very been vocal in his support of Trump , came barreling in with his takes.\n\n@JasonKander know he was referring to leadership and not the soldiers on the ground. But that doesn't allow you to piss about it of you\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 28, 2017 \n\nKander didn’t respond initially, as Schilling got into a spat with another Twitter user, rambling about the Muslim ban and other things, but then, Schilling dug himself into a hole (one tweet from his rant is missing) as Kander laid the perfect trap.\n@etrigan_27 @JasonKander and elsewhere all seemed like warfighters working their asses off to win.Jason, spend much time outside the wire?\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 28, 2017 \nA LOT of folks did more than me, but yes, I was outside the wire about 4 days/week. How about your deployment, Curt? https://t.co/w8SjOG6K8f \n— Jason Kander (@JasonKander) February 28, 2017 \n@JasonKander I wasn't deployed, I just had the honor of spending 18 days in theater while visiting soldiers who actually did stuff\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 28, 2017 \n\n\nOh, Curt. Mr. Bloody Sock, this was unwise. You have just set yourself up to get owned online. Kander took advantage of this opportunity and played it beautifully. \n@gehrig38 Thank you for your service. We are forever in your debt.\n— Jason Kander (@JasonKander) February 28, 2017 \n\nOf course, Twitter had a field day with this and Schilling was roasted over and over. \n@JasonKander @gehrig38 Curt Schilling, Purple Heart recipient for injuries sustained during ACLS 2004-2005 and 18-day USO short tour.\n— dylan (@dyllyp) February 28, 2017 \n@gehrig38 @JasonKander did you get a Purple Heart for the ketchup you put in your sock?\n— (Spiegel) (@Spi39s) February 28, 2017 \n\nOne day Schilling might disappear from Twitter and make all of us happier, but until then, we’ll have to settle for watching him lose Twitter battles regularly and completely ruin any positive memories we may have had of him on the baseball diamond.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:32:23.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
