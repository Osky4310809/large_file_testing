It's the only part of the spacecraft that returned to Earth. \nThe last time the capsule left the Washington area was for a national tour in the early 1970s. It's been on display at the National Air and Space Museum for most of the past 40 years. \n\"Apollo is such an amazing story and we hope to relight that inspiration in America today,\" Gen. John Dailey, director of the National Air and Space Museum, said at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center on Wednesday. \"We could use that in this country right now, that spirit.\" \nThe extravehicular visor assembly worn by astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface during the historic Apollo 11 mission in July, 1969.

The exhibition will be on display at Seattle's Museum of Flight on the 50th anniversary of its return to Earth — July 20, 2019. \n\"People in those areas can get up close and personal with this unbelievable artifact,\" said David Skorton, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. \nJust like giant panda Bao Bao earlier this week, the capsule will be shipped via FedEx, the sole transportation sponsor of the exhibit. \nAbout 20 other objects from the Apollo 11 mission will travel with the capsule, including gloves and a visor Aldrin wore on the moon, a star chart used on board the lunar module and a \"rock box\" that brought back the first samples from the moon's surface. \nVisitors to the exhibition will also be able explore an interactive, 3D tour showing the inside and outside of the capsule. Visitors aren't allowed inside the capsule, but the interactive will let them view the famous graffiti Collins scribbled after the mission: \"The Best Ship to Come Down the Line ... God Bless Her.\" 16 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lwUchU NEVER MISS OUT Tech Be the earliest adopter.
