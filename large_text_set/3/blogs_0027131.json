Sure, if you and your bae are equally focused on fitness and healthy living, that instantly makes you more compatible with each other, compared to someone who would rather eat, sleep in, or watch T.V. than go for a morning run. But, there is more to it than simply having similar interests and priorities. Working out together can actually benefit the two of you individually, as well as your relationship, in the following ways... It can boost relationship happiness and satisfaction. Exercise has been known to make us happier, more confident, and positive. By working out with your partner, the benefits of physiological arousal also positively influence your relationship, including increasing attraction between the two of you. In other words, those bicep curls help to keep the spark alive! It makes your workouts more efficient. This is especially true if you have already been working out on your own, and decide to bring your partner along, rather than starting a brand new workout with them. Their presence acts as a motivating factor to perform. It increases your chances of falling, or staying, in love. Sexual and physiological arousal exhibits many similarities at the biological level. Sweating it out with your partner for company, can blur the line between the two, and make you fall in love! Besides, who doesn't think it is absolutely, breathtakingly sexy to watch sweat dripping off a panting body on the treadmill? It brings you emotionally closer. Good relationships are made out of shared experiences. The more things you do together, the closer you come together. This is why couples go on dates, travel together, and watch movies, and even raise kids together. All of this makes them a unit. Exercising together works in a similar way. A relationship is made out of three entities - you, him or her, and the relationship itself. Working out as a couple benefits all these three entities. It will make you and your bae fitter, stronger, and happier, and make your relationship solid, like those tight, toned calf muscles.
