We're not sure why, exactly, self-pleasuring remains so taboo. The truth of the matter? There's absolutely nothing embarrassing about it! We talked to Dr. Kat Van Kirk , licensed marriage and sex therapist and resident sex expert for Adam and Eve , about the intriguing reasons to get your rocks off all on your own .\n1. Women who masturbate are more confident. \"Frankly, masturbation is a public health issue. Research suggests that women and men who learn to masturbate early have higher self-esteem and are less likely to have early unprotected sex, a lower incidence of STDs, and higher satisfaction when it comes to their sex life later on.\"\n2. It's especially important to masturbate as you get older. \"As we age, masturbation and sex become even more important, as they are tools in maintaining not only pelvic/vaginal/penile performance, but also keeping the muscles and tissues toned and lubricated, as well as helping us maintain our hormone levels. Older adults who masturbate also indicate that they have a more satisfying overall relationship with their partner, [and they] feel more emotionally bonded to them. Masturbation is also useful in stress management.\"\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media2.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/FMAdLbpc8jgPFWy7GKu2gmtguzc/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/04/07/001/n/1922398/0c6cc056896866c8_new.jpg", "http://www.adameve.com/", "http://drkat.com/"], "published": "2017-03-14T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:21:23.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
