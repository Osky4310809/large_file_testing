It was 1993 and this theme focused on the power of unleashing the human capital in the world's developing countries. This idea ultimately motivated me to launch the firm's first international fund, focused on emerging markets . This was one of the greatest experiences of my life, and to this day it shapes my world view: That people are people, from country to country. And all are seeking a better life for themselves and their families. Period. \nThis same chief investment officer also wrote about \"choosing up sides\" as a society. We were collectively being asked: Will we choose to embrace this new world and the freedom it promises? Or will we resist this trend, digging in our heels to preserve the status quo? \nI think we know how this one turned out. Emerging markets, from China to Brazil, are now some of the world's largest economies. (For more, see: Sustainability Gives Work and Investing Purpose .) Today's Opportunity \nAs investors, we are at another crossroads. We again get to choose up sides. The (traditional) energy sector was among the S&P 500 's best performing sectors last year. The old guard moved back to the front. But the world's problems haven't lessened. So, investors need to ponder some important questions: Do we decide that \"business as usual\" is the profitable path, and ignore/abandon our values? Or, do we affirm a commitment to use our money as a force for good? Do we disregard the evidence that climate change will irreparably damage our planet? Or, do we consciously choose to vote with our money and against those destructive forces by spending and investing in a manner that helps to turn the tide the other way? \nToday’s investors are increasingly making a difference by changing how they invest. But, I look around and think: It's Just. Not. Enough . “Best of class” sustainable investing , while a good start, seems to fall short. The time for half measures has long passed. \nThe world demands it. Our kids' future demands it. It’s time for serious investors to consider divesting their portfolios from fossil fuels. Why Now? \nMuch has changed over the past five years to bring me to this conclusion. It's clear that government isn't going to lead the way on maintaining a livable planet or an equitable society. Someone must lead. Cities are doing it. And corporations are doing it. \nMeanwhile, the investment industry has evolved. The number of fossil free and socially-responsible investment choices has reached a critical mass that makes this effort possible. \nLastly, the math on fossil fuel investments is very clear. Valuations are based on reserves in the ground and on a company’s ability to invest successfully to add to those reserves. But burning all of them will result in a planet that is increasingly uninhabitable. \nIf nearly every country on this same planet understands this (i.e., the Paris Agreement), then how can an investor who concerns themselves with risk possibly ignore the likelihood that these valuations will be impaired when legislation/moral suasion/taxation results in some of these assets being stranded? This is a risk that all investors need to assess. Conclusion \nIt’s about the future of your wealth. It’s about the productivity of this big ball of real estate that we call home. If we care about these things, then we surely can do more. Shifting some investments might be the easiest thing that we can do. And our collective actions can have an impact. Trillions of dollars in brokerage accounts, pension plans, 401(k)s and IRAs can be liberated to move the needle. In other words, the time is right. (For more, see: Sustainable Investing Still Makes Sense .) \nTwo roads are again diverging in a wood, and we are choosing to take the one less traveled by. Hopefully, our collective actions will make all the difference. \n(With apologies to Robert Frost)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:59:05.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
