( AAPL ) is the most environment-friendly company in the world, according to a new report from the non-profit Greenpeace Foundation. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company retained the top spot for the third year in a row. Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google ( GOOG ) and Facebook, Inc. ( FB ) also earned high marks from the non-profit for their efforts to cut down on greenhouse emissions. \nAll three companies earned an A grade on Greenpeace’s report card. Apple was rated 83% in the foundation's Clean Energy Index, while Google and Facebook earned ratings of 56% and 67%, respectively. (See also: Clean or Green Technology Investing .) \n\"Both Apple and Google continue to lead the (technology) sector in matching their growth with an equivalent or larger supply of renewable energy, and both companies continue to use their influence to push governments as well as their utility and IT sector vendors to increase access to renewable energy for their operations,\" the report's authors wrote. They also commended Facebook and Apple for providing transparency and \"regular and easy-to-access reporting of their data center energy footprint.\" (See also: 4 Things To Know About The Future Of U.S. Energy . ) \nOn the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc.'s ( AMZN ) cloud service leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) was criticized by Greenpeace for being \"completely non-transparent.\" The foundation said lack of data about AWS's operations coupled with the service's foray into regions that are dominated by dirty power (such as Virginia) makes it unclear whether AWS is on a renewable energy path. \nStreaming video providers Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX ) and Amazon Prime also did not fare well in the report. Both services earned an F for energy transparency. Amazon Prime earned a D for Renewable Energy Commitment & Siting Policy, while Netflix earned an F in the same category. Their low grades are a cause for concern because streaming video is expected to be big in the future. \nAs the report points out, video streaming traffic will be responsible for more than 80% of the total traffic generated on Internet platforms by 2020. A research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory concluded that streaming video in America was responsible for consumption of 25 petajoules of energy and 1.3 billion kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions in 2014. That amount could increase in the future without an explicit commitment to renewable energy from video streaming providers. (See also: Carbon Trading: Action Or Distraction? ) \n\"Netflix has stated that 'It's important that our data center providers commit to 100% green power through RECs and that they continue to find new and innovative ways to become carbon neutral.' Unfortunately, such a low bar is unlikely to push AWS or other data center operators to take the action necessary to transition to a renewable supply of electricity,\" the report states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T04:13:24.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
