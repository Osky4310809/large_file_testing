By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 21, 2017 12:28 PM Hafiz Saeed. (Reuters) \nFormer Union minister and senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has revealed that on one of his trips to the neighbouring country he met Lashkar e Toiba and Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, who has been listed under an anti-terrorism law and is currently under house arrest in Pakistan. Saeed is on India’s most-wanted list as he was the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks. He has also been sponsoring terror in India through his activities in Pakistan with that country refusing to step in to stop his criminal and worse activities. Aiyar said that, “When I was in Pakistan on a TV show and I saw Hafiz Saeed face-to-face, I said he should be arrested immediately.” India has presented clinching evidence of the involvement of Saeed in terror activities in India but so far Pakistani authorities have been stalling and even on the international front diplomatic moves by India to corner Pakistan on the Saeed issue have been thwarted by China. \nYou may also want to watch- \nAiyar said that his very public statement that Saeed should be arrested elicited a lot of support from all quarters and that even in Pakistan he received praise for having condemned the terror merchant and that this included the common man on the street there. Aiyar revealed, “A driver and other people in Pakistan came to me and said that I had said a fabulous thing (that Saeed should be arrested) and action must be taken.” \nSaeed was placed under house arrest under the fourth schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on January 30 in Lahore which created an uproar among his party and allies. He was put under house arrest after the Mumbai terror attacks in November 2008. A total of 166 people died in the incident. Saeed was freed in 2009 and he carries a reward of USD 10 million as announced by the US.
