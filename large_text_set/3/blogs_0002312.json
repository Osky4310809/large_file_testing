In the CPPCC, it is participated in by political parties, people's organizations and people of all ethnic groups and sectors of society through a variety of activities organized by CPPCC committees. It is carried out through comments, criticism and proposals in accordance with the CPPCC's Charter. \n\"The CPPCC is not a body of State power. Its oversight work does not rely on mandatory or binding force but on political influence,\" Yu said. \"Its purpose is to help the Communist Party of China and the government to resolve problems, improve their work, build solidarity and gather support.\" \nYu said political advisers need to take a problem-oriented approach, focus on major problems and the issues at their core, and accurately identify any difficulties or weak links. This requires improvement of the CPPCC committee members' capabilities in research and studies. \n\"When offering suggestions, empty and general comments with no research to support them must be avoided. Speeches and criticism should get straight to the point,\" Yu said. \"Arrangements for CPPCC democratic oversight work should be submitted to Party committees and incorporated into the overall plan, and key topics should be included in the annual consultation plans and reported to Party committees for approval.\" \nPan Qinglin, a national political adviser and standing committee member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said he visits lower-level organizations and develops an understanding of the actual situation before drafting and submitting his proposals each year. \"Oversight is very important, but it has to be based on research, study and responsibility,\" he said. \nLing Feng, another national political adviser and a neurosurgeon at Xuanwu Hospital in Beijing, said he used to misunderstand the influence of democratic oversight. \nIn 2014, Ling proposed, along with 89 other CPPCC National Committee members, to combat violence at hospitals and against doctors. Parts of the proposal were adopted into law in August 2015. \n\"I truly felt the power behind one proposal, as well as the attention and importance attached to it by government agencies,\" he added. \nCPPCC National Committee members submitted 5,769 proposals over the past year, covering such issues as the economy, politics, culture, society and the ecosystem, according to the CPPCC. \nMa Peihua, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, said more proposals from members of the CPPCC National Committee that exercise democratic oversight will be listed as priorities this year. \nContact the writers at suzhou@chinadaily.com.cn and sunxiaochen@chinadaily.com.cn Previous Page 1 2 Next Page \nRelated Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T14:36:14.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
