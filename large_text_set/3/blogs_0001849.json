Fifty-five of them were office workers and 56 delivered post for a living. \nThe study revealed those who had desk jobs registered a bigger waist circumference - 97cm compared to 94cm - and approximately one BMI unit difference. \nThey also had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease - 2.2% compared to 1.6% over 10 years. \nThe research suggests waist circumference increases by two centimetres, and risk of cardiovascular diseases by 0.2%, for every additional hour of sitting on top of five hours.

You'd need to walk 15,000 steps a day to mitigate the risk (Photo: Getty) \n“The levels associated with zero risk factors were walking more than 15,000 steps per day, which is equivalent to walking seven to eight miles, or spending seven hours per day upright. \n“Our findings could be used as the basis of new public health targets for sitting, lying, standing and stepping to avoid metabolic risks. \n“However the levels suggested in our research would be very challenging to achieve unless incorporated into people’s occupations.” \nParticipants in the study wore a tiny physical activity and position monitor called activPAL, invented by co-authors from Glasgow Caledonian University, strapped to their thigh for seven days. The study was published in the International Journal of Obesity (Photo: Getty) \nThey also had their weight, height and blood pressure measured, and provided blood samples. \nCardiovascular risks were assessed using the Procam risk calculator which takes into account age, sex, family history, blood pressure and metabolic measures. \nThe study took place between September 2006 and September 2007, involving volunteers from the Royal Mail in Glasgow. \nOnly apparently healthy non-smokers, with no personal history of heart attack, stroke, coronary heart disease, hypertension or diabetes were included.

We probably adapted to be healthiest spending seven to eight hours every day on our feet, as hunters or gatherers. \n“Our new research supports that idea. The ‘bottom’ line is that if you want to be sure of having no risks of heart disease, you must keep off your bottom.” \nThe study, Time spent in sedentary posture is associated with waist circumference and cardiovascular risk, has recently been published in the International Journal of Obesity.
