The pop-ups claimed the computers had problems when they really didn’t, and the operators scared thousands of people into paying hundreds of dollars each for tech support services they didn’t need. \nWe recently learned that some of these same people are getting called again. The callers claim to be working with the company the FTC shut down, sometimes using the name “Global Connect.” People report that the caller asks for remote access to their computer, either to reestablish service or to process a refund into the person’s bank account. \nDon’t do it. Never give someone who calls you control of your computer. Instead, hang up and report it to the FTC . And, in this particular case, none of the companies involved in the FTC’s case against Global Connect should be calling you. They have no legitimate reason to call you – and, anyway, almost all of them are out of business. But, if you get one of these calls, be sure to tell the FTC. \nVisit the FTC for information about how to spot and stop tech support scams , including what to do if you’ve already given a scammer your passwords or remote access to your computer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:22:40.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
