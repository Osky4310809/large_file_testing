Do you really think that people are that stupid? Sorry, most women are smart enough to know that no matter how much we like football, our men go to the games to watch the game. They don't want to be distracted, which is why we should either find something else to do or, if we are fans ourselves, go to the game with our football loving girlfriends. Either way, we are not going to pay $1600 to dress up like a wino. Bwahahahahaha 3 years Oh, Leah...What fantasy land do you live in? Not a chance for distraction from football. Yeah...that army parka gets me turned on... The only distraction is the two seconds it takes to say \"get out of my life\" when I see you're dumb enough to waste $1649 for that crap. I like my women smart, including when it comes to money. Jason14979562 3 years That Outfit is ridiculous. My eyes will still be glued to the game, the only way my girl can get me away from the game is if she strips down naked and flash her boobs and ass in my face, then there is a 10% chance I might stop watching the game.
