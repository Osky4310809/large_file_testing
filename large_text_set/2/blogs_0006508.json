Approves Decision To Become A ‘Sanctuary’ For Immigrants February 6, 2017 8:35 PM By Ava-joye Burnett \nCOLUMBIA, Md. (WJZ) — Howard County Council has approved a controversial sanctuary county bill in a 3-2 vote. The bill will now go to County Executive Allan Kittleman. However, Kittleman has already said that he will veto any such bill. \n“We are trying to find a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist,” he says. \nUnder the sanctuary bill, police could not ask about someone’s immigration status or work with federal agents to get information about it. \nPeople rallied on both sides of the issue of whether or not Howard County will be a “Sanctuary County.” \nSupporters believe that undocumented immigrants should not be fearful to go to the police, and that they should feel like they are part of the community. Opponents worry about the loss of federal funds and cooperating with federal law enforcement. \nOpponents to the bill have been worried about the loss of federal funds and cooperating with federal law enforcement. \nHoward County has long prided itself on diversity and inclusion. It’s a suburban mix of old and new, located between Baltimore and Washington. \nColumbia was built 50 years ago on a platform racial harmony. A bill tonight would make this a sanctuary, joining other jurisdictions nationwide where authorities do not enforce federal immigration law. \n“I don’t think it is really any of my business on your immigration status,” says Irina Zeller, Howard County resident. \n“I understand that it is within the jurisdiction of the federal government to keep certain people out,” Howard County resident Mike Lloyd says. \nPresident Trump has signed an executive order that would strip sanctuary cities and counties of federal dollars. \n“They are not safe. We have to take care of that horrible situation,” President Trump says in a statement. \nIf the bill does become law, impact in Howard County is unclear. The county could be out millions. Baltimore City, Montgomery, Prince George are area counties that have already defined themselves as sanctuaries. \n“We need our federal funding. That’s just more to come for the state from us,” says Brenda McKoy, a Howard County resident. \n“Many people are scared,” El Salvadorean immigrant Juan Francisco Andrades says. \n“People have a right to their freedom. If they’re not harming anybody don’t see why they would have to do it, why they should have to question them,” says Allan Conover, a Howard County resident. \nThe County Executive points out to us that he has never received or heard of a complaint of a police officer treating an undocumented immigrant poorly. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook Ava-joye Burnett Ava-joye Burnett joined WJZ Eyewitness News in January of 2016 as a general assignment reporter.
