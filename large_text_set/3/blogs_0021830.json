Marketing teams need to ensure they’re using premium photography services in all promotional materials, whether print or digital. \nFor The Travel Corporation (TTC), parent company of Insight Vacations and Luxury Gold, creating a visual impression that matched the exceptional quality of both of the company’s brands premium and luxury escorted journeys was a big opportunity for its recent website and brochure refresh project. \nTTC needed a broad range of destination images to suit the tastes of a global market and the U.S. and Australia in particular. \n“We needed to find a resource that provided incredibly high quality images that were not just aspirational and impactful, but also have an artistic essence that would make them shine above generic stock imagery,” says Andrew Raeymaekers, TTC’s Global Creative Director. \nThey turned to 500px. \nThe 500px team helped TTC source premium photography that showcased not only multiple destinations, but also multiple styles, creating a feel that was true to the world travel experience. \n“We very much enjoy working with 500px. The website is user friendly, and the team is even better. From creative services, to our account manager, they are not only easy to work with, but feel like true collaborative partners,” says Raeymaekers. \nAs a result of the refresh, the Insight Vacations website saw a 10% increase in traffic, a 4% decrease in bounce rate, a 36% conversion improvement in requests for quotes and—most impressively—online booking conversions increased 31%! \nThat’s the power of premium images. And 500px can put it in your hands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:59:34.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
