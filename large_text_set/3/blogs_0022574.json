But I’m feeling really good now.” \nWhile the baby will be Eric and Lara’s first, it definitely won’t be Trump’s first grandchild. In fact, the president already has eight . And his siblings’ children have all been good practice for Eric’s parenting skills. \n“Eric’s going to be an amazing dad,” Lara says. “The nieces and nephews love hanging with him. He’s the cool uncle. He’s watched ‘Frozen’ many times.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:21:41.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
