January 7, 2017, 9:33 PM Sportsnet Staff January 7, 2017, 9:33 PM \nEach NHL team gets one representative for the NHL all-star game, and there’s an almost-sure chance Toronto’s will be a rookie. \nFirst-year players have led the way for the Maple Leafs in 2016-17, and Auston Matthews has been the best of the bunch with a team-high 21 goals and 35 points entering Saturday’s action. \nThere’s been some thought that Leafs GM Lou Lamoriello won’t allow his rookies to participate in the 2017 All-Star Game in Los Angeles as a means of shielding them from the public eye, though Sportsnet’s Hockey Night in Canada panel tampered those concerns on Saturday’s Headlines. \n“As one source said, ‘Look.
