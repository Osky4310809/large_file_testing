McCown hasn’t found much success as a starter in his career, having gone just 2-20 in the role over the past three years. \nMcCown, who will play for his seventh team in 2017, had one of his better outings last season against the Jets, throwing for a season-high 341 yards in the Browns’ 31-28 loss. \nChristian Hackenberg and Bryce Petty are the only other quarterbacks on the Jets roster. Ryan Fitzpatrick and Geno Smith – two of the quarterbacks who started in New York last season – are on the free-agent market. Hackenberg hasn’t taken a snap in a regular-season game and Petty has only four career starts under his belt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:50:53.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
