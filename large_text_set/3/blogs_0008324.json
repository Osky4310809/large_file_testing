My husband, unfortunately. For the Big Sur International Marathon, I’m pulling a Keith. By Christine Fennessy Tuesday, March 7, 2017, 3:30 pm I didn't have a great training cycle for last year's race either, but that smile is genuine. Christine Fennessy \nI know what I’m in for. Oh yes, I can picture those final miles through the Carmel Highlands and I know it’s not going to matter how awesome those strawberries are or how amazing the views on my left are going to be or how much more in key the student band is going to sound this time around, I am going to be one hurting unit. \nThis is a terrible thing for a Runner’s World editor to admit. But my training for this marathon resembles the running I was doing before I was training for a marathon. I’m still out there, two (sometimes three…) times a week, still chugging up my favorite monster hill, still meeting a couple of my favorite people for some much needed distraction. Still not running long or ramping up my mileage or acting like you think I should, given where I work and who I am. In fact, not training correctly makes me wonder who I am. I mean, I am starting to resemble… my husband . Which fills me with shock and awe. And despair. And I’m sure if he knew that I just wrote that, he’d punch the air with his fist and smile at me with such a knowing look of delight I would probably have to leave the room.

He pays no attention to convention or rules or nerves and people LOVE HIM FOR IT. He’s not obnoxious about it, which helps. He’s just one of those guys in a beer shirt and ball cap who is down for just about anything, refuses to stress about it, finishes it, and feels good enough to joke about how bad he feels. Hundred-mile road ride after a winter of sitting around? Sure! Crazy CrossFit workout full of moves tapping muscles you never use? No problem. Burpees in the basement because it’s a blizzard outside? Not awesome, but okay. Run a marathon after 11 training runs? Why not? \nDon’t let this range of exercises fool you. He does these things on occasion. The point is that he does them without prelude. Without obsession or planning or training. Just jumps right in, and somehow, jumps right back out of them with a fine attitude and a fine enough performance. It’s always made me crazy (it makes most people crazy, let’s be honest) and I was certain I knew myself well enough to know I’d never be like him. Last year, in the lead-up to launching The Runner’s World Show podcast, I got close. I did fewer than half of my long runs in preparation for Big Sur . This year, I am 100 percent pulling a Keith and I just can’t believe it. \nIt’s not because I disregard the distance or the sport or my body or all the runners around me who have been busting ass for months to have a good race. I was that runner, I miss that runner, I will most likely be that runner again, but I am not that runner now. I know there are those who can do everything and for a long time, I was one of them. But right now, I’m not. So I’m pulling a Keith. And while I can’t believe it, I have watched the Keith happen often enough that I know what to expect. I know that I’ll get through it. I know it’ll hurt. I know stressing about it changes nothing and beer will make it better. I know if I smile and laugh at myself and forget for a while who I used to be, I’ll be fine. \n* * * \nChristine Fennessy is doing her best to prepare for the 2017 Big Sur International Marathon with Runner’s World VIP.
