After making his Marvel Cinematic Universe in last year’s Captain America: Civil War , Peter Parker gets his first solo MCU flick and he certainly isn’t going to be the only superhero to appear in the movie. \nAfter the movie’s first teaser was made public, we saw that Tony Stark would be making an appearance in the movie and in the closing frames, it appeared that Stark would be rocking some new Iron Man armor. \nThanks to toy merchandising leading up to the debut of the movie this summer, we’ve gotten a more clear look at Stark’s latest Iron Man armor. Diverting from his typical color scheme of scarlet and gold, the Homecoming Iron Man armor introduces a whole slew of silver, much like Stark’s armor found in the Ultimate Iron Man comic run by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Michael Allred. \nThis latest Iron Man toy, which can be see in the Instagram photo below, can be found in a three-pack alongside the web-slinger himself and Michael Keaton’s Vulture, the primary antagonist in Homecoming. As the movie nears its premiere, make sure to keep your eyes peeled for the latest Spider-Man: Homecoming toys at your local toy store. \nA post shared by Homecoming=July 7 (@spidermanhomecoming.ig) on Feb 19, 2017 at 7:44pm PST \nA young Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland), who made his sensational debut in Captain America: Civil War , begins to navigate his newfound identity as the web-slinging super hero in Spider-Man: Homecoming . Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter returns home, where he lives with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.). Peter tries to fall back into his normal daily routine – distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man – but when the Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as a new villain, everything that Peter holds most important will be threatened. \nThe cast includes Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Tyne Daly, Bokeem Woodbine, with Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. It also includes Jon Favreau, Martin Starr, Kenneth Choi, Michael Mando, Selenis Leyva, Isabella Amara, Jorge Lendeborg, Jr., JJ Totah, and Hannibal Buress. \nNext up for Marvel is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on May 5, 2017. Spider-Man: Homecoming lands on July 7, 2017, followed by Thor: Ragnarok on November 3, 2017. After that Black Panther debuts on February 16, 2018, while Avengers: Infinity War hits theaters on May 4, 2018. Ant-Man and the Wasp is slated for July 6, 2018, followed by Captain Marvel on March 8, 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:51:53.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
