After today's trip to Barnsley, where they have won only once in 45 years, Albion face a double-header against promotion rivals Reading and Newcastle. \nAnd as Bruno met the winners from Eastbourne Town under-8s in EFL partners Wickes' Kits for Kids competition, he admitted Brighton were in familiar territory – between a stick of rock and a hard place.

Grace beard to restore Brighton to the elite 34 years after Jimmy Melia led them to the FA Cup final in his dancing shoes but took them down in the same season. \n“We have had a few chances to go up and, for various reasons, we couldn't take them,” said Bruno, whose contract with the Seagulls is up at the end of the season. \n“But we are getting closer and closer, the team is getting stronger, the squad's quality has improved each season and the club is not going crazy with money. There are other ways to win promotion than just throwing money at it. Bruno celebrates with team-mate Jacob Murphy (Photo: Getty) \n“In almost every respect, we are ready to be in the Premier League. We hope it's finally going to happen this season but, sooner or later, I'm sure it's going to happen. We have so many reasons for wanting to go up, so many motivations. \n“There was the Shoreham air disaster last season which killed a member of our groundstaff. Connor Goldson, a really good young player, was diagnosed with a heart problem last month. We missed out by one goal on automatic promotion at Middlesbrough on the last day. And we were very close again in the play-offs. \n“Everything about the club – the stadium, the training ground, the city, the fan base - is ready for the Premier League. \n“We must not forget that the only way to get there is by winning games on the pitch, but we have a lot of reasons to wish for it – and a lot of reasons to believe we can do it. \n“Last year we were so close, but I could sense that we would come back stronger. Where we are now says a lot about our spirit and how strong we are mentally, but now we have to finish the job.” Chris Hughton is the man to take Brighton to the Promised Land, says Bruno (Photo: PA) \nPupils at St Christopher's school in Hove, where Bruno's son Pol – who will be nine tomorrow – studies, presented the Seagulls skipper with a giant good-luck card before the fateful game at Middlesbrough decided Brighton's cruel fate on the last day of the season. \nIf he was worried about showing his face on the school run after Albion's heartbreaking near miss with the promised land, he need not have worried. \n“We are lucky because everyone, including the kids at school, knows we did not fail. We could not have done any more. \n“After the game at Middlesbrough, I have never known desolation like it. Not in all my career. But there was a special feeling inside the changing room, a feeling that the experience would make us stronger. \n“The hurt was so strong, it ran very deep. It was a very hard lesson – I hope we learned from it.\" \nManager Hughton's calm, pastoral leadership will be an asset as Brighton look for the eight wins from their last 15 games which would surely seal the deal. poll loading Will Brighton win the title? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO \nBruno has has played under some educated coaches, including Paris St Germain's Unai Emery in his incarnation at Valencia, but he rates Hughton the best of them all. \nHe laughed at the suggestion Hughton would be a good traffic cop because he wouldn't make you feel bad about a speeding ticket, saying: “He would convince you that it is better not to drive so fast. \n“You can talk about ways to play, tactics and technical aspects, but as a manager who controls his emotions and communicates that to his players, Chris is the best I have worked with. \n“It is so difficult to keep everyone pleased, but he has created a special environment here and that is very rare in football.” \nHughton has won the Championship before with Newcastle, in 2010, and now he is deadlocked in a fight for the title with them. \nIf life imitates art, Brighton are about to give Bruno and his manager a run for their Monet.
