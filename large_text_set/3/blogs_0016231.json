United Kingdom \n20. Chile \nThere were 18 countries deemed “happier” than the UK, including the US, Germany, Ireland and Israel.

THE MIDNIGHT SUN \nLike Finland, Norway is a beneficiary of the midnight sun. For a few weeks every summer, the sun never sets above the Arctic Circle. If you’ve never seen it, try to imagine sunset and sunrise happening all at once and colouring everything in a reddish, yellow gold light. Midnight whale safaris, camping, swimming, cycling and sea kayaking are all on offer and a way to see things in 'a new light'. If you travel to the Svalbard islands right up in the north, the midnight sun lasts from April to late August. Just magical.

OUTDOOR LIFESTYLE \nIt doesn’t translate into English, but the Norweigans have a special word ‘friluftsliv’ (meaning ‘free air life’), which is all about reconnecting with nature and has come to embody their enchantment with the latter. Just a few minutes of Googling the country’s landscape and you’ll see why they don’t lead sedentary lifestyles: glaciers, fjords, lakes, rivers, creeks and a rugged coastline lend themselves to kayaking, hiking, fishing, skiing and swimming. Even its capital Oslo is packed with green spaces. Kristin Folsland Olsen/Visitnorway.com 4/21 3. YOU CAN SEE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS \nIn the northern part of the country, from the Lofoten Islands all the way up the coast to the North Cape and beyond, you will have a very good chance of seeing the Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis. The best time to see this scientific phenomenon of violet, pink and green dancing lights, is from late September to late March. But remember, patience is best as it’s never a guarantee. Bård Løken/Visitnorway.com 5/21 4. OSLO \nIt’s underrated compared to its Scandinavian sister cities, Copenhagen and Stockholm, but Oslo is having its Cinderella moment and has more than enough to offer to city breakers. In the summer it’s virtually an open air city, taking advantage of the long summer nights on its beaches, in its parks and rooftop bars. Thanks to cutting-edge architecture – namely the marble and glass waterfront opera house to rival Sydney’s - more sculpture parks than you can shake a stick at, café culture and hipster neighbourhoods like Grunerlokka Grove, Norway's capital is fizzing with new energy.

Norway is peppered with charming under the radar cities that deserve your attention. First up is Bergen, its second largest city, which is surrounded by seven mountains and seven fjords. It’s known as the ‘gateway to the fjords’ but there’s more to this vibrant city than its geographical convenience. Namely a first class foodie scene, great coffee and Bryggen, it’s UNESCO Hanseatic wharf which is postcard-perfect with its multi-coloured pastel wooden houses. Then there’s the Art Nouveau town of Ålesund, which has rugged mountains and sapphire blue fjords for offpiste skiing and fishing. It also plays host to several festivals throughout the year across theatre and literature. Trondheim is Norway’s oldest major city (it turns 1,020 in 2017) and the former seat of a long line of Viking kings. It is now renowned as a creative student city where everyone cycles and technology reigns.
