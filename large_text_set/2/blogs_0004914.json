Keep reading to learn his best advice. \nPOPSUGAR: What's the ultimate breakfast sandwich? Jeff Mauro: Perfectly griddled sausage patty, everything bagel, veggie cream cheese, and pickled jalape√±os, of course. \nPS: What's the worst thing anyone could put on a sandwich? JM: Mealy tomatoes. \nPS: What's the best sandwich bread ever? JM: The answer is NONE. Each sandwich has at least one appropriate bread to act as the vehicle. ADVERTISEMENT \nPS: Does your son eat what you cook? How do you get him to eat vegetables? JM: Kind of. He always eats the protein we make, and starch (usually sweet potatoes) and veggies. He's still not eating salads or asparagus, but we've always fed him well-seasoned and well-balanced food. I guess the trick is, and mind you, I only have one kid, to really not give [kids] a choice. They have to at least taste everything you make. \nPS: What's your ultimate Father's Day meal? JM: My ideal Father's Day meal is a big grilled beef tenderloin. Pair that with tons of mushrooms, something cheesy, and lots of Mark West wine. \nPS: What's the most fun thing about being a chef who is a dad? JM: Taking pride in the fact that my boy knows and respects good food and where it comes from and what it takes to make it. Now with my restaurant Pork & Mindy's in Chicago, he can come hang out with me on the weekends and see food from that end of the business. Plus, I'm proud that my boy can crack an egg like a champ.
