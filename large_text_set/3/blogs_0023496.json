Saban is a very close friend and political ally of the Clintons and his California home, for years, was a regular stop on the Clinton fund-raising circuit. Foster, 67, who is in the midst of a divorce from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Hadid, is also a close friend of Saban.\nThe Clintons even sent a congratulatory letter to Saban on his Walk of Fame star, according to Vanity Fair .\nThe letter, signed “Bill and Hillary,” reads: “This well-deserved honor is not only a testament to your decades of groundbreaking contributions in the entertainment industry, but to your enduring generosity and efforts to advance good causes across American and around the world.”\nFROM COINAGE: This Is How Much It Would Cost to Paint the White House (And More Crazy Facts) \nAbedin was also recently photographed at Disneyland with her young son, Jordan, Scandal star Tony Goldwyn, and one of his daughters.\nAbedin and Goldwyn became friends through Clinton’s presidential campaign, during which the actor stumped for the Democratic nominee, produced and directed several videos supporting her campaign and gave a speech at the DNC. Clinton and Abedin also visited the actor on the set of Scandal .\nRELATED VIDEO: WATCH: Huma Abedin Splits from Husband Anthony Weiner After He’s Caught in Third Sexting Scandal \nAbedin had been keeping a relatively low profile since announcing her split from Weiner in October, following the news of his third sexting scandal .\nThe scandal broke in the final days of the 2016 presidential election and led to the FBI reigniting concerns over Clinton’s private email server. Clinton and Abedin remain close and were spotted together for the first time in months at Bergdorf Goodman in New York City on March 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:29:34.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
