We just had to put it to the back of our minds and concentrate on the football. \n\"I read one story that said it was straight after the Seville game. It said I was personally involved in a meeting when I was actually sat in anti-doping for three hours. A few of you [reporters] waited around for an interview after.\" \nThe striker added that he and wife Rebekah had been subjected to abuse in the streets and even received threats against their lives. \n\"Then, of course, the story is out there and people pick it up and jump on it and you're getting death threats - about your family, kids, everything, on social media, you name it, walking down the street,\" he said. \n\"To be honest, I get them every week. Football fans don't seem to like me that much. I get abuse at every stadium that I turn up at. To be honest, you are always going to get stick from fans. It is part and parcel of football. \n\"I just get on with it, but when people are trying to cut your missus [wife] up while she's driving along, with the kids in the back of the car, it's not the best. It is terrifying. People get cut up, but if there are no cameras, you're screwed.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:49:14.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
