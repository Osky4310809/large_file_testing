Does that surprise anyone? As reader Alan told me in an email, “that shows once the shackles of an organized or mainstream religion are removed, people are more likely to self-identify.” \nMaybe the question religious leaders should be asking themselves is whether people who identify as LGBT would be safe telling people about it in their churches, temples, or synagogues. \nThe longer the answer remains no, the quicker they’ll learn to walk out of those religious institutions for good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T16:13:49.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
