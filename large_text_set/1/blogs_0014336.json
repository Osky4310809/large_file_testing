Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, attended the vigil (AP) \nSupporters posed for photographs holding candles and signs asking for the mother to be freed, while a banner depicting a child captioned \"looking for mummy\" was also hung from a nearby wall. \nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, also attended and delivered a letter to the Iranian Embassy addressed to President Hassan Rouhani. \nMr Ratcliffe, 42, left the letter and a package of messages for his wife on the embassy doorstep after being assured via intercom it would be collected later. Mr Ratcliffe delivered a letter to the Iranian Embassy asking for help bringing his wife home (AP) \nIn the letter, he requested help to secure a visa so he can see his family, ensure letters to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe from supporters are delivered and that his wife receive a fair trial. \nMr Ratcliffe wrote: \"Notwithstanding my public criticism of the injustices visited on my family by Iranian authorities, my view is that Iran and the UK need to build better relations, grounded in mutual understanding, for Gabriella's future. \n\"Arbitrarily holding Nazanin, denying Gabriella regular access to both her parents does not serve this.\" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained for almost 300 days so far (PA) \nHe added: \"I ask for your help in bringing Nazanin and Gabriella home because framing the innocent serves no one, not even those perpetrating it - it risks undermining the values Iran and Islam are proudest of.\" \nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe appealed against her prison sentence earlier in January but no decision has been communicated by the Iranian authorities, Amnesty has said. \nThe human rights charity said the mother has suffered a serious decline in her physical and mental health since being detained.
