Even Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee Jason Chaffetz joined the chorus of voices demanding an explanation. \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said enigmatically Thursday that Conway had been “counseled” on the issue. A senior administration official now tells CNN that Conway apologized to Trump. According to that official, Trump then told Conway he supports her completely, confirming what Conway herself tweeted . POTUS supports me, and millions of Americans support him & his agenda. https://t.co/FTaPXTymGV \n— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) February 10, 2017 \nAccording to CNN, Trump also told Conway he was upset with Spicer’s “counseled” language, saying that he “hated” it. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:25:00.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
