That was my only relationship. So it’s like, give me this, people.”\nIn addition to apparently not dating much, Mayer also revealed in the interview that he recently quit drinking and is “very thoughtfully entering cannabis lifestyle.” He also shared with his characteristic candor that he’s ready to shed his reputation as a “bad version of a bad boy” for something a little more domestic.\n“I want the baby with the protective earphones,” he said. “I’m right on time for my career, and I’m running late for my life.”\nPerry, for her part, recently split from actor Orlando Bloom — so hold out hope, John. There might be hope for that baby bouncing by the side of the stage yet.\nListen to Mayer’s new song below.\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:44:23.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
