Facebook screengrab/Presidential Communications \nMANILA, Philippines - He’s no Emperor Nero who simply watched as Rome burned. \n“Very extreme” scenarios might force President Duterte to declare martial law, Solicitor General Jose Calida said yesterday, among them a massive destabilization that includes the President’s assassination and the bombing of Malacañang. \n“We are talking here of certain conditions which cannot be predicted. However, it must be very extreme,” Calida said. “For example, you are aware of the plot to oust the President. What if they will bomb Malacañang, they will … put bombs in our malls? You know, to create trouble.” \nHe cited the possibility of drug lords financing the killing of Duterte. \n“The drug lords will hire assassins to kill him and some parties might be in cahoots with this plot. In other words, there is already a breakdown of law and order and nobody is acting or they are afraid to act. Somebody has to act and it should be the President,” he said. \nCalida, who argued before the Supreme Court the President’s decision to allow the burial of former president Ferdinand Marcos at the heroes’ cemetery, stressed the general and overall welfare of the people.   \n“The welfare of the people is the supreme law,” he said. \n“Under the conditions that I mentioned, when it is already the life of the country that is at stake, the lives of the citizens of this country, the President will not stand by, you know, just like Nero and let Rome burn,” Calida said. \nHe cited the People Power EDSA revolution in 1986 that overthrew the Marcos dictatorship. \nCalida said the people power movement was done “outside” of the Constitution to oust Marcos. \n“In fact, during the 1986 EDSA Revolution, if you notice, there was no martial law declared but there was a change in government. It was an extra constitutional movement that changed the government. Why? Because probably during that time there was really a need to do so. So we cannot put the President in a box and tell him, you only do these things. Because the President cares for the country and if the country faces imminent danger and nobody is acting, then, the welfare of the people is the supreme law,” Calida explained. \nCalida, however, pointed out there is no imminent reason for the President to declare martial law – a point earlier raised by chief presidential legal adviser Salvador Panelo. \n“Remember he said, ‘if I want to.’ It doesn’t mean he will do it; but he can do it if he wants to,” he said. \nCalida agrees with Duterte that the 1987 Constitution’s provisions on martial law need to be amended to enable the chief executive to act promptly during emergency situations. \nCalida said the Constitution, which subjects a martial law declaration to a review by Congress and the Supreme Court, was a reaction to Marcos who placed the country under military rule in 1972. \n“The 1987 Constitution is a reflex action because of the Marcos experience. So it was not a normal situation when they drafted the Constitution. Probably now, there is no need for those. We need to make it work. Because if some constitutional provisions do not work under an emergency situation, then we have a problem,” Calida said. \n“If it becomes worse, if there are already foreign elements trying to destabilize our country, to assassinate him, to assassinate government officials. In those extreme circumstances, somebody has to act,” he added. \nUnder the 1987 Constitution, the President may declare martial law in case of an invasion or rebellion or “when the public safety requires it.” \nThe Chief Executive may place the country or parts of it under martial law for not more than 60 days. The President is required to submit a report to Congress within two days from the proclamation of martial law. \nCongress will then decide whether to revoke or extend the martial law declaration. \nThe Supreme Court can also review the martial law proclamation if a citizen questions its basis. The high court shall come up with a decision on the petition within 30 days from filing. \n“Because it is an emergency situation, there should be haste, we do not have the luxury of time for 60 days to validate whether or not there is really an emergency, somebody has to act fast on it,” Calida said. \n“Well, we are talking here of emergency, aren’t we? We are talking here of the possible destruction of our youth and our country. Now, you dilly-dally for 60 days? You are unmindful of the emergency if you do that,” he said. – Alexis Romero", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:12:10.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
