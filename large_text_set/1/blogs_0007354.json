Pic credit: Pravin Barnale © BCCL \n\"Why are your hands so cold?\" - was my first greeting of the day, coming from Mumbai's selector Milind Rege. He had just walked out of the confines of a warm mess after having his breakfast - what else in Indore, but poha and a hot cup of tea? I, on the other hand, was out in the open bracing the 12 degree Celsius weather. In fact, journalists, most of them from Mumbai, in the plan of covering the final, had failed to take into account what the Indore winter chills held for them. The selectors were left in a fix too. They wanted to watch the match from the stands, but had to take shelter in covered spaces after the chilly weather proved beyond what they could stand. \nThe crowd, the liveliest and loudest of them so far this season, had warmed up well - to the weather and the occasion.They were good in number, and as the day progressed, they just kept increasing. There were children, who could relate to the players on the basis of their IPL visibility, and there were the oldies, who walked up to the selectors and recognised them by their domestic performances. When the cheers and applause stopped, an acapella began. The crowd just refused to stay quiet. Amidst all this, there were also those excited 12-13 year-olds, who called out Shreyas Iyer and asked \" Delhi Daredevils ka contract chahiye kya (Do you want A Delhi Daredevils contract)?' to which they got his straight-faced nod of approval. It was that kind of a crowd that most venues would've loved having for even Test matches in India. \nThe weather was cold, but the welcome to cricket was certainly warm. \nMumbai, who had reached the Ranji Trophy final for the 46th time with 41 victories already under their belt, knew the drill - the players, the coaches, the support staff and the selectors - of what it takes to be ready for the all-important game. They knew what it takes to be there, and for the new-comers - Prithvi Shaw and Vijay Gohil, there have been enough people to feed them with sufficient knowledge to have had a virtual feeling of being there. Gujarat, on the other hand, had reached the stage for the first time in 66 years. None of them had a clue of what it means to be there. Thus, when Parthiv Patel said, \"We will look to play the match like any other,\" a day before the match, there wasn't much of an option he and his team had to fall back on. But when the occasion actually came, the nerves were obvious. \nOn what was a green bed presented in the morning, Gujarat elected to field after winning the toss. Given that there has been very little heat that has been coming down, even the red-soiled pitch wouldn't be impacted much to cause the batsmen trouble by turn on the last two days. So in all likelihood, the first day was expected to be the best time for the bowling side. \nThey struck early, courtesy the experienced RP Singh, who trapped Akhil Herwadkar plumb. The crowd cheered in excitement, giving away initial hints that they were behind the underdogs. But that was to change soon as Shaw played a few crunching drives and cuts. As it turned out, the crowd was willing to lend loyalty to anyone who would entertain. In the first session, Shaw ensured that he kept the crowd on his team's side. \nWith pace and bounce on offer, Gujarat seamers kept pitching the ball short and allowed Mumbai to go through the first hour of play without as much trouble as they could have posed had they not got carried away. Rege repeated several times from the stands, \"This is a wicket for swing. Bounce and pace won't get them wickets here, swing will. They need to pitch it up.\" Only if his observations were to reach the opposition camp! \nThe excitement of the stage was obvious for Gujarat. When Shaw edged one outside off, Samit Gohel at second slip went for a difficult catch and dropped it, while it was heading for an easy take to the first slip fielder. Then Chirag Gandhi went for an over-excited celebration when he clearly took a catch on the bounce. There were the over-stretched appeals for leg-before and bit of loose emotional bursts when the ball beat the bat. \nMumbai, on the other hand, had warmed themselves to the occasion well. They took advantage of Gujarat's frayed nerves and treated an audience that was ready to celebrate for every bit of entertainment, to a good show. Shaw and Iyer hit some solid shots and took quick singles to keep the pressure on Gujarat. \nIyer, after getting set in the middle, poked needlessly while coming out of the crease to give his wicket away. But apart from that, there was nothing to cheer for Gujarat. Lunch, however, did well to settle their nerves. A lot of it was also helped by the fact that there was a huge, loud group that came out in support of Gujarat - with chants and flags. \nGujarat came back a lot more calm in their approach, and reaped rewards of Suryakumar Yadav's double error. First, he made a rash call to get Shaw run-out and then played a half-hearted pull to find himself back in the pavilion. \nBut came crisis, came Abhishek Nayar. Irrespective of who has scored how many runs and who has taken how many wickets, there has been no other player as effective as him this season. Every time there was a problem, the veteran all-rounder had bailed Mumbai out of trouble and, in the process, helped them reach the final. But, this time, he couldn't as wickets kept falling from the other end. \nJust when Gujarat realised they didn't need to do much and Mumbai were imploding, they went through the motions, and Nayar was more than happy to see through the last couple of hours of play. He almost did, but in the process, called for a bad single and ran Vishal Dabholkar out. Three quick wickets - Balwinder Sandhu, Shardul Thakur and Dabholkar - turned the tide of the contest. In the company of last man Vijay Gohil, Nayar knew he couldn't wage a battle long enough and decided to after the bowling. In doing so, he gifted his wicket away by edging an ugly pull. \nIn the end, the scoreboard looks poised in Gujarat's favour. Even as they couldn't take advantage of the conditions early and had to rely on Mumbai doing them a favour with their shoddy batting, part-timer Rujul Bhatt did what the specialist Hardik Patel didn't - flight the ball and reap rewards. \nThe defending champions wouldn't be a pleased lot. While they played out the tough periods with ease, a few rash moments led to more players walking back to the pavilion than they would have liked. Even as a ready-for-the-occasion Mumbai called the shots on a day when a nervy Gujarat should have dictated the proceedings, the day ended in the latter's favour. In context of the match, with the pitch expected to ease out for batting in the next two days, the wickets that were thrown away would come to haunt the team that's been there and done that. \nToo sum up the day, Shaw dropped a straightforward catch at slips in the only over of Gujarat's innings. The second-time finalists didn't have a hand in it. SELF-DESTRUCTION - is the word. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T14:55:53.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
