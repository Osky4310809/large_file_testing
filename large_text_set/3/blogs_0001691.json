Ferguson was supposed to face Khabib Nurmagomedov for the interim lightweight title in Saturday’s co-main event in Las Vegas, but that bout was canceled after Nurmagomedov was deemed medically unfit to compete. Not long after, rumors surfaced that Michael Johnson , among others, was ready to step in and face “El Cucuy” on short notice. That did not come to fruition, however, as UFC President Dana White told TMZ Sports that Ferguson will not be fighting on Saturday night. White did confirm that he spoke to Johnson, but the promotion ultimately decided to remove Ferguson from the card and book him at a later date. I was ready and willing!! To make that title weight for last minute. Unfortunately @TonyFergusonXT declined it. Catch ya around next time! — Michael Johnson (@FollowTheMenace) March 3, 2017 “The problem is we’re one day away from the fight. Very hard. The guys have to go through medicals and all kinds of stuff,” White said. “I respect the fact that so many people want to take the fight.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:20:59.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
