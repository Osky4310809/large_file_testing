Not to mention all the wedding-related events that come with the actual nuptials, from engagement parties, to bachelorette parties, to bridal showers. In fact, Millennials are spending so much money going to weddings , they often have to skip events because they can’t afford it.\nPriceline.com conducted a Bridal Season Travel Survey to see what Millennials spend money on when it comes to weddings, how much they spend, and how many events they skip due to the cost. According to the survey, people spend about $600 (and sometimes more!) on each wedding event.\nIf you have weddings to attend in the coming months , here are a few more things you should know.\nA third of people will skip events \nBecause each wedding-related event is so costly, 39 percent of people will pass on at least one. This isn’t very shocking, but it does mean you shouldn’t feel bad if you have to skip a friend or relative’s party.\nHotels cost the most \nPriceline.com’s survey revealed that 38 percent of people spend the most cash on hotels. While flights are usually costly as well, 41 percent of participants said they spent more on a place to stay than a flight. Big cities like New York and Los Angeles are some of the most popular places to get married, according to the survey, and hotels there don’t come cheap.\nBachelorette parties are really expensive \nBachelorette and bachelor parties are usually the most exciting events, but the survey shows that 24 percent of people will spend at least $800 to $1,000 on one. That’s a lot of money, especially when you still have to pay to get to the actual wedding afterwards.\nWeddings are expensive for everyone involved, so plan ahead, try to save up extra cash, and don’t worry if you can’t make it to every event.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:53:43.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
