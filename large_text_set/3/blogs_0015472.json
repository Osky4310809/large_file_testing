Every once in a while, there comes a collection that puts up a visual show so compelling that forces you out of your third-day-at-fashion week stupor. With its goose bumps-inducing beats, followed by a video exploring the meaning of the word, “Human”, the label was decidedly aiming to connect with every wide-eyed fashion-goer at Amazon India Fashion Week Autumn-Winter 2017. Stories of survival – from abuse, failure and regret – have been pushed out on their Instagram account to give perspective into this process. While at the show, gender became a fluid concept, what remained were only stories of the average human. In this scenario, the clothes were but nothing but tools of communication. The message was paramount, the silhouettes, compelling. \nWe rounded up seven human archetypes from the show. Find out which one of these sartorial stories uncannily feels like your very own. 1.The Gender Non-Conformist \nGender does not meddle with how you button your shirt or wear your hair. 2.The Hijab-Loving Muslim \nThe hijab also metaphorically stands for every sartorial choice of yours that gets casually dismissed. 3.The Dressed-Up Feminist \nYour feminist resolve doesn’t get stymied by sheer dresses or floral motifs. 4.The Sensitised Alpha \nEveryone is an alpha in their own right, and uniform isn’t a prerequisite to staking your identity. 5.The Non-Glamorous Traveller \nYour travels are an intimate experience, and you should be prepared for the wild. 6.The Assertive Lady Boss \nYour shoulder pads ensure that your word is the last. 7.The Heart-on-Sleeve Girl \nYou keep your sweet rebellion on your long sleeves, unflinchingly.
