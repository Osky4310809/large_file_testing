In fact, hospitals could save money by offering private rooms, since they’d have fewer illnesses to treat, Dr. Khullar writes. \nLack of private space could also make people less forthcoming about their medical histories, leading to uninformed treatment plans. \nIt’s also common for people to fall in the hospital due to slippery floors and bad lighting, and nurses aren’t always stationed where they can spot these accidents and help immediately. \nOn top of that, the sterile, impersonal settings have measurable physical effects. Dr. Khullar cites a study by architecture professor Roger Ulrich showing that gallbladder surgery patients recover faster with views of trees rather than brick walls. Other research has shown that people with bipolar disorder make it out of the hospital more quickly when their rooms are brighter, and psychiatric patients require fewer meds when they have pictures of nature in their rooms. \nDr. Khullar recommends hospitals decentralize nursing stations, use better air filters and more cleanable surfaces, install sound-proofing panels, and provide more light. Those are some things he believes can help make hospitals safer. \nYou can’t change how hospitals are designed, but you can make yourself less susceptible to their problems. MedlinePlus advises taking advantage of the hand sanitizers in hospitals, avoiding close contact with patients, and exercising the precautions you normally would to avoid getting sick (Here are 26 ways to avoid sickness this winter ).
