The teenager cowers in his seat as he is attacked \nPeople in the background appear to encourage the attackers before one bystander eventually tells them to 'leave it'. \nNo one steps in to stop the fight. \nThe victim walks away from his attackers before the video ends. \nThe video was posted on Facebook by a concerned mother who wanted to warn others about the violence. The teen was punched in the head and kicked repeatedly \nShe said her children travel to school on the exact same train and were 'traumatised' after witnessing the fight. \nShe wrote: \"Please be careful when letting your children train it home as there is a group of young males who frequent the train stations from Ipswich to Goodna train lines.\" Read More Queensland Rail are said to be investigating the incident (Photo: Getty) \nThe assault, which occurred yesterday was reported to police. \nQueensland Rail told 9news.com.au : \"Our officers livestreamed CCTV at the two stations where the group exited the train to monitor the situation, while emergency services responded. \nAdditional security resources have been deployed in the area. \n\"Safety is Queensland Railâ€™s number one priority and we do not condone violent or disrespectful behaviour on our network.\" \nQueensland Police have yet to comment to Australian media.
