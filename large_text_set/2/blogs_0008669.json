Adele totally ruled Grammys 2017 with her stellar opening performance, the beautiful tribute she paid to George Michael, and winning every award that she was nominated for.The singer, as expected, also won Album of the Year for 25, beating Beyonce's Lemonade. She broke down while accepting the prize, and used her stage time to thank Beyoncé. \"I can't possibly accept this award,\" Adele said. \"I'm very humbled and very grateful and gracious, but my life is Beyoncé.\"The Lemonade album, Beyoncé, was so monumental, and so well thought out, and so beautiful and soul-bearing. And we all got to see another side of you that you don't always let us see, and we appreciate that. And all us artists adore you. You are our light. And the way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel, is empowering, and you make them stand up for themselves. And I love you. I always have. And I always will.\"And then, straight out of Mean Girls, she broke the award into two to share with Beyoncé. Here's are all the videos from the big night.
