Who cares about performances on the pitch, just as long as you're all having an excellent evening.\" \nTracey Finlay snarked: \"Of course it's been an excellent night, there was no bloody football being played !!!\" \nAndrew Clark said :\"Awww that's cute. Perhaps you could give blues fans something to smile about? You seem happy enough to take our money.\" \nJason Lenny Facey added: \"Been an excellent evening with zola has it ?? Why is that, did he resign ?\" \nWhile angry David Wood quipped: \" said a single Blues fan as the final whistle blew, like NEVER!\" Zola has just one win in 14 games since arriving after the shock sacking of Gary Rowett in December (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nZola has told the Birmingham board, however, that he is prepared to tough it out at St Andrew . \nHe faces a tricky trip next to local rivals Wolves on Friday night with mounting concern from fans at his reign, with his side most recently on the end of a4-1 home thumping by struggling QPR. \nZola has tried and failed to change Blues' style midway through the campaign to a more passing game since succeeding Rowett in December. \nBut Chinese owner Paul Suen is sticking by the Chelsea legend after taking control of the Championship club four months ago.
