But Trump was involved with at least one Twitter-related story this week that does not give us reason to actively fear for the safety and security of the nation: The revelation that his official account briefly followed, then unfollowed, the handle @EmrgencyKitten s, dedicated to adorable feline photos and cat memes. As Colbert notes, Trump only follows a handful of people on Twitter—even Barack Obama doesn’t make the cut—making the follow all the more significant. It's a Meowntain. But he unfollowed before the punchline. pic.twitter.com/emcQanPx4Y — Emergency Kittens (@EmrgencyKittens) January 2, 2017 \nThe big joke, of course, is that cats are sometimes known as pussies and vaginas are sometimes also referred to as pussies . “That must be strange for Trump to see,” Colbert said of one photo of a cat clutching a man’s arm. “A man being grabbed by a pussy? It’s so unusual,” he quipped. Get it? It’s funny because our president-elect was once caught on tape bragging about committing sexual assault . Comedy! Advertisement \nTrump no longer appears to be following the account, which is a shame, because Colbert came up with at least one way to put Trump’s evident affinity for cats to good use: by dressing up his refused daily intelligence briefings with feline puns to trick him into actually reading them. \nMarissa Martinelli is a Slate editorial assistant.
