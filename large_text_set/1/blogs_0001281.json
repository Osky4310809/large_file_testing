The two protesters – a man and a woman – were later arrested for trespassing, Minneapolis police spokesman Officer Corey Schmidt said. \nThe banner urged Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank to divest from the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline. Opponents contend the pipeline could affect drinking water and Native American artifacts. Texas-based developer Energy Transfer Partners says the pipeline will be safe. \nAfter rappelling into place in the second quarter, the protesters hung in a seated position about 100 feet above the seats that were evacuated for safety. The pair watched the rest of the game, occasionally shifting positions or waving at people in sections behind the east end zone. Authorities declined to aggressively remove them out of safety concerns. \nStadium operator SMG released a statement saying the two people apparently climbed over a guard rail to access the ridge truss. Police spoke with them from a catwalk in attempt to get them to stop, and by the fourth quarter about a half-dozen police and firefighters in rappelling gear were on the truss waiting to remove the protesters. \nBut the protesters willingly climbed up their ropes as soon as the game was over. After speaking with authorities, they climbed down the stairs toward the concourse while being booed by a handful of fans who stayed to watch. \nVikings spokesman Lester Bagley said the team’s only concern is about the ”safety of our fans and guests.” \nProtesters say U.S. Bank has extended a large credit line to Energy Transfer Partners. U.S. Bank spokesman Dana Ripley declined comment. \nThe pipeline would carry oil from western North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to Illinois where it can be shipped on to users. Protesters camped in North Dakota for months to try to stop completion of construction. \n— \nAssociated Press reporter Jeff Baenen contributed to this story from Minneapolis. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T00:35:26.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
