He has obvious dealings with Russia. \nThere’s so many things he’s doing that are unconstitutional. How are we going to get him out? \nShe replied, \nWe have a lot of people looking at this. \nI think he’s going to get himself out. \nI think that sending his sons to another country to make a financial deal for his company and then have that covered with government expenses. I believe that should not be allowed. \nWe’re working on a bill that would do that now. \nWe’re working on a couple of bills that would deal with conflicts of interest. \nThis exchange was caught on video.

Maxine Waters has been very vocal about this as well. Rep. @MaxineWaters sees impeachment in #Trump 's future.
