Despite a recent (and significant) rise in values, the Jaguar XJ220 is arguably still not as revered as its supercar contemporaries. With cars like the Ferrari F50, Bugatti EB110 and McLaren F1 also around at the same sort of time, perhaps it was always going to struggle. But this was once the fastest car in the world, combining huge power and presence with a healthy dose of old fashioned supercar intimidation. People should be clamouring for one, right? Because an XJ220 was so unassuming before Especially an XJ220 like this - the XJ220 S. The best part of 25 years ago TWR took nine XJ220 road cars to make into competition entries, homologating six along the way. This is one of six XJ220 S spec cars.\nHowever it's not entirely clear whether this was an original TWR car. While to spec, it registered fairly late for a 220 and appears to have the work completed by Don Law Racing. Hardly a bad thing given the pre-eminence of Don Law in Jaguar circles, but it does make the car itself a little confusing. If anyone knows more about this car's provenance we'd love to hear it! \nRegardless, the spec makes for very exciting reading. It makes 690hp at 7,900rpm thanks to larger turbos, a new ECU and uprated fuel system. Torque is 526lb ft at 5,000rpm. It's claimed to hit 60mph in 2.7 seconds and 150mph in 15 flat. Don't forget that's with a manual gearbox too, which will cloak the acceleration's ferocity to some extent. \nIn addition to that there are some carbon body parts, competition brakes, split-rim BBS wheels, a straight-through exhaust and that wing. If you feel modern supercars are too soft and accommodating, this could be just the thing for you. It's left-hand drive too, for a bit of extra challenge. Because an XJ220 was so sluggish before Unsurprisingly given this car's specification it has been extremely well cared for over the past 20 years, with a full Don Law service history and just 16,000 miles recorded. It's even been treated to a 'deep boot upgrade' with twice the capacity of standard; combine that with the larger 100-litre tank and you have the perfect car for long weekends away, right?\nIn all seriousness though, it's hard to think of a more intense, more exhilarating 90s supercar. F40? Well yes, very good point, but it's down 200hp here by the official numbers. That and the fact the most affordable F40 on PH is £800,000 with the same mileage as the Jaguar, against £420,000 for the XJ220. If ever £420,000 could look reasonable value... \nFinally, it's worth noting just how far XJ220s have come in recent years. Another XJ220 S was featured on PH ahead of an auction sale in early 2012 - it sold for $230,000 , or about £150,000 at the exchange rate then. £150K! At the start of 2014 a low-mileage XJ220 would have cost £160,000, which is not far off half what one will cost you now. But while the time may have passed for a 220 as an investment, the McLaren F1 is well into the millions now. There is an upside to being the underdog! \nJAGUAR XJ220 Why you should : The ultimate XJ220 Why you shouldn't : The price they used to be... \nSee the original advert here \n[Source: RM Sotheby's ] P.H.
