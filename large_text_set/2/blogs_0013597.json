Twenty-five-year-old Bharat Darbarsingh Yadav is one such patriot who has chosen the Indian Army over a five-figure salary. Representational image, source: News18 \nThe son of an Anganwadi helper, he recently cracked the Combined Defence Services (CDS) exam after his failed attempt to clear the National Defence Academy (NDA) entrance examination in 2010. Working with TCS in Hinjewadi, Pune, he cleared the exams despite a hectic work schedule as a systems engineer, reports DNA . \nBharat lost his father when he in standard 5 and ever since then he has chased his dreams of being in the defence forces. In 2016, he started preparing for the CDS exams and went up to clearing the SSB (Service Selection Board) interview. \nWhen I took up the job as a systems engineer in 2014, I knew this was not the place I wanted to be for the rest of my life, he said in an interview to DNA . \nA native of Sutala Budruk village in Khamgaon in Buldhana district, Bharat cleared the BE examination from Shri Santh Gajanan Maharaj College of Engineering, Shegaon and started working with Tata Consultancy Services, Hinjewadi in 2014. \nHe has placed 108th out of 153 candidates and will be joining the Officers Training Academy (OTA) in Chennai in the first week of April. He will be officially commissioned into the Indian Army as a Short Service Commissioned (SSC) officer after completing his training period. \nOne of his sources of inspiration has been Col Pradip Brahmankar (retd), who runs an academy in the same city. He added, \nI mainly helped Yadav to improve on his weak areas but it was his hard work which paid off eventually. \nBharat is well on his way to doing great things for the country and we at Think Change India applaud his feat. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:58:20.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
