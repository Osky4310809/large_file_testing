This means extra work for your front and lateral delts. \nDumbbell single-arm split-stance rows and presses turn two individual classic upper-body moves into a total-body metabolism-boosting exercise by incorporating a lower-body isometric hold. \nThe dumbbell circle press will build shoulders of steel by locking your elbows in a fixed position and putting constant tension on your shoulder muscles without the assistance of your triceps. By keeping your elbows flexed and fixed the entire time, you'll get a lot of bicep action, especially at the bottom of the movement. In other words, your biceps and shoulders will burn like hell. \nDirections: Perform the exercises below in the order listed for 40 seconds, resting for 20 seconds between each movement: Dumbbell row reach Dumbbell single-arm split-stance row and press Dumbbell circle press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:30:30.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
