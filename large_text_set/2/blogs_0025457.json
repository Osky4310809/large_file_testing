The event is modeled after the NFL Combine, and one male and one female winner will get to announce the Cowboys' 2017 draft pick in April. \nSpokeswoman Kim Kimbriel said it's a great way to showcase our military athletes, some of whom beat individual scores in the NFL Combine. \nAt the trials in November, soldier Ethan Roulston posted a 34-inch vertical jump, compared with 33 1/2 inches by Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott at the 2016 NFL Combine. And Shonta Tucker's 7-foot broad jump nearly matched the 8-foot mark set by Houston Texans' Nick Martin at the 2016 NFL Combine. \n\"This Military Combine allows me to show the skills I learned as a soldier,\" said Tucker, 41. \"We are trained to be the strongest, standing ready to go to the enemy lines at any time to fight for our country. I am proud to represent my unit, serve in a leadership role and show a commitment to work hard, push ourselves to excel in anything we do, whether physical fitness and in our work.\" \nThe competition will be conducted by Dallas Cowboys personnel. Terrence Wheatley of the Dallas Cowboys said each soldier will compete in seven events: the 40-yard dash, short shuttle, \"L\" drill, 300-yard shuttle, vertical jump, broad jump and a two-minute pushup test. \nThere will be autographs from Cowboys alumni, a meet and greet with Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders and photo ops with mascot Rowdy. The stats Cowboys fans should really pay attention to at the NFL combine \nAnother highlight: Three cars will be given away to Fort Hood soldiers in need of reliable transportation. State Farm donated the vehicles, and Caliber employees volunteered their time to repair them. \n\"It promises to be a fun-filled day but more important, the Combine showcases and highlights the high caliber of men and women who selflessly serve to protect our country,\" Steve Grimshaw, president and CEO of Caliber Collision, said in a statement. \nThe combine starts at 2 p.m., and doors open at 1:30 p.m. It's free and open to the public, but you can get make it easy on yourself by getting an event and parking pass beforehand at calibercollision.com/combine .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:13:56.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
