Everything came to a head when Jimmy confronted him, took him hostage and then accidentally knocked him out of a window and, as they reached an uneasy truce, that seemed to be the end of the matter.\n\nBut Rakesh’s situation will rear its head one more time – leading to dramatic ending.\nSpeaking at the RTS Awards, at which Emmerdale won the Best Soap and Continuing Drama prize , Pasha teased: ‘I think the upcoming episodes and the upcoming storyline are going to be pretty explosive. It’s not going to end well. What we’re looking at is the combination of all of the events that have taken place and the repercussions of all of that. It’s exciting and a dramatic end.’\nIt remains to be seen quite how badly things go for Rakesh and those around him but could the trouble end up leading to an end for the character as well as the storyline?\nOr can Rakesh and Priya pick up the pieces once more?\nMORE: Emmerdale wins another Best Soap prize at the RTS Awards \nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Sally Dexter hints at a second Robert Sugden and Aaron Dingle wedding ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:23:33.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
