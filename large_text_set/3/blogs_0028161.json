I feel lucky to get second.” \nIt was a rough week overall for the Team Penske driver. Keselowski lost his crew chief Paul Wolfe for three weeks on Wednesday after failing post-race inspection at Phoenix last week. \nThe penalty cost him 35 driver points and put him in a rough position without his usual crew chief on the pit box. Brian Wilson replaced Wolfe as the crew chief at Auto Club. \nWith a backup crew chief and a ton of damage, Keselowski kept chipping away as caution after caution came out in the closing laps. \nHeading into overtime, he restarted third and made his move as soon as the pack passed the start-finish line. \nKeselowski battled with Clint Bowyer for second-place as Kyle Larson pulled away to victory. \n“I’d be curious to see what we could have done if we weren’t torn up but great day for us to persevere despite adversity,” Keselowski said. “You’re going to have that in a 36-race season. It’s really important to have that as a team and I’m proud of them for that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:28:11.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
