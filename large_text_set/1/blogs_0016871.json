This is lower than the 3.1% percent average annual GDP growth we've been experiencing since 1950. \nWhile there are a number of reasons for this — sluggish corporate investment, Americans saving more of their income, low wage growth, and more — it would take a monumental task to return the US to nearly double its current annual growth rate. \nReversing the course of this will be difficult, especially in just four years, as other problems are large-scale issues like declining productivity that have persisted for decades and will require more than quick policy fixes. \nAdditionally, the president's policies can have a limited impact of the economy given the global nature of the inputs of the US economy. Currently, the IMF projects world GDP growth to be 3.1% for 2016 and 3.4% for 2017, it is unlikely given the US economy's global nature for it to outperform this by much. \nThe rest of Trump's proposal outlines how 4% growth will be achieved by cutting the corporate tax rate and through deregulation. \nAccording to the world bank, the proposed cut in corporate taxes would add just 0.3% to GDP growth this year and 0.8% next year. \nOn the flip side, Trump's hard-line rhetoric on international trade and desire for companies to make products in the US has been projected by most economists to be a net drag on GDP growth. According to reports, Trump's team is considering a 5% tariff across the board. Citi chief economist Willem Buiter projected these policies could lead to a 1% annual decrease in US GDP growth. \nAn additional issue for Trump may be the Federal Reserve. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has changed her tone since Trump's election, anticipating additional rate increases and saying that the Fed will not allow the economy to run hot as some had believed. \nBy increasing rates, this would mitigate some of the inflationary aspects of Trump's agenda but also stifle growth for some time. In fact, the Fed's own projection for GDP (which, sure, is just a projection) has it remaining well below 4% growth. This could imply that in order to keep inflation controlled, they expect to dampen economic growth. \nAll in all, it would be great if the US hit 4% GDP growth, but the balance of Trump's agenda may make that promise difficult to deliver on. \nSEE ALSO: Here's how much debt the US government added under President Obama NOW WATCH: Here's how to use one of the many apps to buy and trade bitcoin Loading video...
