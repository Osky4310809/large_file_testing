(AP) — A Wisconsin newspaper is apologizing for a columnist who connected Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson ‘s child abuse case to beatings suffered by slaves. \nGreen Bay-Press Gazette columnist Pete Dougherty’s remark came in a column calling for the Packers to consider signing Peterson. \nReferencing the charge Peterson faced for disciplining his son with a wooden switch, Dougherty wrote that Peterson “likely is descended from slaves who suffered savage disciplinary beatings generation after generation after generation. It excuses nothing but also can’t be ignored.” \nThe Press-Gazette removed the paragraph Thursday night and apologized to readers. In a statement Friday, editor Robert Zizzo called it “a huge mistake in judgment by a reporter and failed oversight by editors.” \nThe column was also carried by USA Today and the affiliated PackersNews.com. \nDougherty didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
