Legendary war correspondent and journalist Clare Hollingworth, perhaps best known for breaking the advent of WWII, died on Tuesday in her home in Hong Kong, the New York Times reports . She was 105.\nAdvertisement \n\nHollingworth was born on Oct. 10, 1911, in Leicester, to a family that owned and operated a boot and shoe factory. The Times notes that Hollingworth’s family had conventional expectations for her and insisted she attend domestic science college near her home. She later wrote that “although it is useful to be able to make an omelet,” her training in domestic science caused her to “hate having anything to do with housework.” She was briefly engaged, but broke it off and horrified her parents by announcing an intention to go into journalism.\nHollingworth went on to study at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at University College London, then the University of Zagreb in Yugoslavia. She began working for the League of Nations Union, who dispatched her to Warsaw. Towards the beginning of 1939, she is credited with aiding thousands of refugees in their escape from Nazi-annexed Czechoslovakia to Poland.\n\nThen, late in August of that year, Hollingworth was driving from Germany to Poland, when she hit on what may have been the biggest scoop of the century:\nAdvertisement \n\n...She watched as the wind lifted a piece of the tarpaulin that had been erected on the German side to screen the valley below from view.\nThrough the opening, Ms. Hollingworth saw, she later wrote, “large numbers of troops, literally hundreds of tanks, armored cars and field guns” concealed in the valley.\nShe knew then that Germany was poised for a major military incursion. Hastening back across the border to the Polish side, she telephoned her editor with the news, a world exclusive.\nHer article was published in The Telegraph on August 29, 1939. On September 1, World War II began as Hitler’s forces invaded Poland.\n\nAn obituary by The Telegraph , quotes quote Hollingworth’s feelings on the experience:\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T20:10:35.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
