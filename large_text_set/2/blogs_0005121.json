During the recently concluded Super Bowl LI (congratulations New England Patriots), a new spot for the movie was aired and as the title states, is “all kinds of crazy.” \nFor starters, the stunts are more outlandish than before where you’ll get to see a wrecking ball plowing through cars, a tank driving on a frozen lake, a Lamborghini plunging into said lake before said tank pulls the doors of said Lamborghini, a leaping Dodge Charger, and even a submarine-car chase. \nThe former street racing gang are now referred to as an “elite force” and will have to travel “from the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea,” in order to recover Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) from the villainous grasp of Cipher, Charlize Theron’s character in the movie. \nNearly the entire family is back for another adventure, including Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej Parker (Ludacris). Other returning characters in Fate are Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), Frank Petty (Kurt Russell), Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel). \nFate of the Furious will be released on April 14, 2017, and will be followed by two more films , with the ninth film going on the silver screen on April 19, 2019, while the tenth (and maybe the final) instalment will arrive on April 2, 2021.
