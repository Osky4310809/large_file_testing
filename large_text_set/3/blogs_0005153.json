People change their opinion every week,\" Zidane said when asked about the trio's form at a pre-match news conference. \nZidane: Madrid squad love Modric \n\"I'm happy to have all my squad available except two or three that we've left at home. We're all here and I'm happy for that. \n\"Everyone is free to have an opinion and decide who they think should play but it doesn't bother me too much.\" â€” Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadriden) March 6, 2017 \nZidane is familiar with the cauldron-like atmosphere at San Paolo from his playing days at Juventus and expects a typically high-intensity approach from Maurizio Sarri's side, who are nursing a 3-1 deficit from the first leg. \n\"I've lived this atmosphere here as a player. It's never been an easy place to come,\" he said. \"It's a stadium where the fans really get behind their side, they are really involved in the game. \n\"But at the same time it is very nice. I like atmospheres like that when the fans get behind the team. It's nice for their side but it is nice for the rival as well. It's an extra motivation. \n\"I think it will be very intense and quick from the start. They have to score. \n\"They are a team who can play in two different ways. They can pressure you or they can try and do something different by playing quickly on the counter attack \nHow Madrid tried to sign Maradona \n\"We know they're a good side. They can do great damage to the rival.\" \nA Dries Mertens brace saw Napoli to a vital 2-1 win at similarly high-flying Roma in Serie A on Saturday and Zidane added: \"When you beat the side in second away from home it gives you a lot of confidence. It gives them a lot of energy, I'm sure, that win.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T14:20:40.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
