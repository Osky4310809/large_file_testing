Reacting with a range of emotions—they are NOT always happy!”\n“That is a stereotype about people with Down Syndrome,” the next cards explain, before injecting a bit of humor into the video. “Don’t believe us? The you take away Meg’s iPad and see how she reacts!”\nThe boys continue to hold up cards that debunk stereotypes and preconceived notions about people with Down Syndrome.\nThey include how the girls are reaching new goals all the time, always willing to help a friend, and always available to make you smile.\n“Receiving the love and support of many. Thank you,” two cards read together as one. “Refusing to give up! They work hard each day.\"\nAs the boys display the cards, the video cuts to pictures of their family, including their mom and dad and sisters.\nThe boys then ask whether you, the viewer, will help their sisters.\n“Recruiting others to help them on their journey. Will you?” the cards read, before the next admit that their sisters rebel just like all other kids do.\n“They are changing the world! Reducing ignorance, intolerance, and hate,” the cards state. “And replacing those ugly things with hope, love and respect.\"\nThe next two cards that appear on the screen make a bold statement with just one word, repeated on each card: “Respect.”\n“Our sisters are NOT Retards,” the next cards read, before being torn in half by the boys.\nThey then make the call for help in stopping the use of the word “retard” by taking the pledge at www.r-word.org.\nTo date, more than 650,000 people have made the online pledge.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T02:59:54.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
