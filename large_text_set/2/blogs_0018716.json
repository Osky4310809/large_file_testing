Was disgusting treated like vermin\" \nRod Hodson Walker added: \"Spanish police using batons like nobody's business, complete and utter brain dead\" \nAdam Kirton wrote: \"Spanish riot police are absolute thugs. Stormed in and gave the LCFC fans an unwarranted beating.\" \nDaryn added: \"Leicester fans being ambushed by the Spanish police and now we're being locked in! Absolute joke hahaha\" \nFans of English clubs have encountered numerous problems with Spanish police and fans in recent years. The Champions League game finished 2-1 to Sevilla (Photo: Getty) \nFighting broke out between around 50 Liverpool and Sevilla fans before kick-off at last year's Europa League final in Basel, Switzerland. \nManchester City fans had to barricade themselves inside an Irish bar in Seville after being ambushed by a group of Spanish supporters on the eve of their Champions League clash in 2015. \nAnd Tottenham accused Spanish police of hitting a disabled fan during their Uefa Cup tie in Seville, in 2007, when riot police charged away fans during the first half as trouble broke out inside the ground.
