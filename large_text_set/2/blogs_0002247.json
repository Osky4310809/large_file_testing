After all, the Cavs have made back-to-back trips to the Finals and won an NBA championship last season largely because the organization has acquiesced to his demands about how he wants the roster constructed. \nA lot of folks might not agree with his philosophy toward diplomacy, but as the Public Enemy front-man once said “I’d rather be hate for what I am than loved for what I’m not.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:11:27.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
