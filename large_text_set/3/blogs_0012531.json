His opponents and even some allies wanted to know where his income came from or if he’d avoided paying taxes (which makes him “smart”). Throughout the campaign, then-candidate Trump declared he’d release his tax returns once an ongoing audit was complete, but these promises turned out to be false; Trump won the election, the audit seems like it will never end, and still — no tax returns. This meant Trump became the first president in over 40 years to not release his returns, which, while embroiled in an alleged Russian hacking scandal, meant citizens had no clue where their elected official’s money came from . \nNow, it turns out Rachel Maddow has a scoop on Trump’s 2005 1040 form. Trump paid $38 million in returns in 2005, and show Trump and his wife paying $5.3 million in federal income tax. $31 million of the taxes were paid in the alternative minimum tax. \nWhat we've got is from 2005… the President's 1040 form… details to come tonight 9PM ET, MSNBC.\n— Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 15, 2017 \nWhat we've got is from 2005… the President's 1040 form… details to come tonight 9PM ET, MSNBC.\n— Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 15, 2017 \n\nhttps://twitter.com/tripgabriel/status/841804683366789120 \nThe White House, learning of Maddow’s tease on Twitter with the rest of the world, worked to get ahead of MSNBC and made the following statement, basically confirming the documents:\n“You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago… Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that.”\nWH responds to MSNBC report on Trump tax returns: \"you know you are desperate when you willing to violate the law…\" pic.twitter.com/DCedFdxWCc \n— Jim Acosta (@Acosta) March 15, 2017 \n\nWhether these documents are allegedly stolen is up for debate, and that’s a hefty accusation. But, what’s noteworthy is the fact that these are Trump’s first publicly-released tax returns in nearly 40 years and now we have bottom line numbers that are likely quite average with most millionaires. Trump roughly paid 25.3% of his total income in tax dollars. \nThe returns also show Trump was still benefitting from his $916 million loss he claimed in 1995 as a tax credit. And while these won’t show where his money has come from, they may paint a picture of a man with a bloated self-worth who claims to be worth $10 billion when he’s possibly quite far from that number.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:41:55.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
