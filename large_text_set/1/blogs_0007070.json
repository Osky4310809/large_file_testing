Ian MacNicol / Getty \nAfter Mo Farah’s historic gold medal performance in both the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the 2016 Olympics , the British runner—along with tennis star Andy Murray and heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill—was named to the “New Year’s Honours List” on December 31, by Her Majesty the Queen of England. What that means, apparently, was that Farah was officially knighted. \nSince Americans don’t have any traditions resembling this, we have a few questions for Sir Farah: Advertisement \n1. Did they do the thing with the sword , and was it sharp? \n2. How will you run in the full suit of armor? \n3. Do you get to compete in races while mounted on a horse? \n4.

When do you start officially hunting for the Grail? \n8. Did Sir Paul McCartney teach you the secret handshake? \n9. Did you immediately shave the corners off your table, or do they have a specially-made round one they just give you? \n10. Will you now have to compete in this? \nThe man who is surely Britain’s speediest knight will be competing at the Great Edinburgh International Cross Country 8K on Saturday, where he will try to reclaim the top spot from Garrett Heath .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T13:43:06.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
