Risa Hontiveros warned yesterday. \nHontiveros said Duterte’s order to let the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) lead the government’s anti-drug campaign is not new and is “automatic,” as PDEA has the mandate to push for efficient law enforcement in the fight against illegal drugs. \nShe said the government’s plan to include the military will just add to the “already chaotic situation” and will roll back the important gains in security sector reforms in the AFP. \nShe said this could also lead to unnecessary clashes between the military and PDEA. \nShe noted that while the military and PNP are both legal bearers of arms, they have different roles and training. The police force is for law enforcement and apprehension. The military is trained for combat duties. \n“May I remind the government that the military has a different mandate and orientation. It should not be dragged into civilian policing,” Hontiveros said.   \n“To blur these lines is not only dangerous, it is a throwback to martial law times. It is a nod to authoritarian leadership,” she added. \nShe expressed concern that allowing the Armed Forces to implement the same “flawed and abusive style of war on drugs will only subject it to the same fate as the PNP,” referring to the rising cases of drug-related summary killings.
