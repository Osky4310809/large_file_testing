Ben Moshinsky Business Insider \nLONDON â€” Before the 2008 financial crisis, jobs in investment banking and trading were the most sought after by young people interested in finance. \nBut tougher capital rules and bonus restrictions, as well as weaker economic growth in the US and Europe, have taken the sheen off these areas and caused large banks to change their business models. \nCredit Suisse is a good example, cutting back in markets and switching focus to private banking, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. \nSo what is it like for a young person working in a bank like Credit Suisse in 2017? \nHenri Etchegoyen, pictured right, is one of the Swiss lender's private bankers in London. He is a relationship manager, tasked with building up a UK clientele and looking after existing customers. Here is how his typical working day goes: View As: One Page Slides Meet Henri Etchegoyen, 28, pictured here in the Credit Suisse office cafe. He joined the bank as an intern, working his way up to analyst, and finally relationship manager in the private bank. Henri went through an 18-month training programme in Zurich, taking both internal exams and tests from the Financial Conduct Authority to be approved for the role. Ben Moshinsky Business Insider On Mondays, Etchegoyen gets into work for an 8 a.m. meeting at the Credit Suisse Canary Wharf office after a commute of around 45 minutes. At the meeting, the private banking team gets a markets update and discusses investing strategies and ideas. Ben Moshinsky Business Insider After that, Etchegoyen often has a lot of external meetings both with prospective clients and existing ones. Many of those take the form of coffees and lunches around Mayfair, where Credit Suisse has a private banking office. Ben Moshinsky Business Insider Etchegoyen's main task is to build a book of business, convincing wealthy individuals to let Credit Suisse handle their money. He mostly focuses on UK entrepreneurs and says word of mouth is key to expanding the client base. Ben Moshinsky Business Insider If Etchegoyen is not in Mayfair or elsewhere in the City meeting clients, he has got Credit Suisse's enormous canteen to grab lunch from. Ben Moshinsky Business Insider You load up your canteen card with credit... Ben Moshinsky Business Insider ... and then go charging around the different food venues. The \"taste theatre\" dominates the space as the centre of the canteen. Ben Moshinsky Business Insider There is a whole load of deli meats.
