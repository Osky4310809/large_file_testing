The ambitious FX series will bring the thrilling action of the X-Men films to life with a smart drama about a mutant named David Haller. The sickly boy has spent his life thinking he’s insane when he’s really just been harboring a powerful gift, so the show will follow the man as he learns to embrace his mutation. UP NEXT: Legion Producer Reveals Whether The Show Is In The Same World As The X-Men Movies \nBut, if you feel like you’ve heard this story once before, then don’t panic! David Haller is a well-known character from the X-Men comics, so fans are eager to see how the television show aligns with the comic canon. Now, Legion ’s producer is talking about one major element of David’s complex past, and it has to do with good-old Professor X avier. \nIn an interview with IGN , Lauren Shuler Donner took time to speak about Legion and was asked how Professor Xavier would play a role in the show. As readers know, the wise telepath fathered David with Gabrielle Haller, but Donner is warning fans that Legion won’t dive into that mystery quite yet. \n“We just don't want to get into the Xavier world, because that's not what this show is about,” she explained. \n“Probably the driving mystery is, yes, who is David? But not in that sense. It's more, \"Is David schizophrenic? Is he crazy? Or does he have powers?\" That is the mystery. \"Who is David?”” \nWhen asked whether the decision to avoid Professor Xavier was an intentional one, Donner said it was. However, the producer promised the show touches on the topic here and there. \nLegion is the story of a troubled young man who may be more than human. It introduces the story of David Haller, who since he was a teenager, has struggled with mental illness. Diagnosed as schizophrenic, David has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for years. But after a strange encounter with a fellow patient, he’s confronted with the possibility that the voices he hears and the visions he sees might be real. \nDan Stevens (Downton Abbey), Rachel Keller (Fargo), Jean Smart (Fargo), Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation), Jeremie Harris (A Walk Among the Tombstones), Amber Midthunder (Hell or High Water), Katie Aselton (The League) and Bill Irwin (Interstellar) star in Legion . \nMore LEGION: New Legion Teaser Image / New Legion Trailer / Legion In X-Men Comic Books / Who Is Legion? / Jemaine Clement Joins Legion / Legion Producers Talk X-Men And Marvel Universe Connections / How Legion Could Fix X-Men Continuity \nNoah Hawley (Fargo) will serve as an Executive Producer along with Lauren Shuler Donner (X-Men: Days of Future Past, Deadpool), Bryan Singer (X-Men: Apocalypse, Superman Returns), Simon Kinberg (X-Men: Days of Future Past, The Martian), Jeph Loeb (Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Marvel’s Daredevil, Marvel’s Jessica Jones), Jim Chory (Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Marvel’s Daredevil, Marvel’s Jessica Jones) and John Cameron (Fargo, The Big Lebowski).
