She was making an emotional address at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the house of worship in Mr Lewis' district where Dr King once preached. \n\"Many of you here are proud residents of the fifth congressional district and we are proud of the progress we have made here and in this city,\" she said, in response to Mr Trump, who had described the area as \"crime-infested\" and \"falling apart\". Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad! — Donald J.

I think at some point I bridge-build. The goal is to bring America together,\" Mr King told reporters. Celebrate Martin Luther King Day and all of the many wonderful things that he stood for.
