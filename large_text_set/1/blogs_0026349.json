The report shows that despite the Galaxy Note 7′s failure, the company was able to absorb the impact thanks to robust component sales and continued sales momentum of the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 edge. Samsung has now provided some figures which reveal just how many units it sold in the last quarter of 2016. \nA Samsung executive revealed during a conference call with investors and journalists that the company had sold 90 million smartphones in the quarter ending December 2016 aside from 8 million tablets. The executive predicted that sales of smartphones and 2G phones will likely increase in the first quarter of this year while decreased demand will cause a drop in tablet sales. It was also said that smartphone sales will reach the high 80-percent range in the first three months of this year. \nThe executive also reiterated Samsung’s smartphone strategy for 2017 in the conference call which involves bringing features like water/dust resistance and fingerprint sensors to low-end and mid-range devices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T10:09:24.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
