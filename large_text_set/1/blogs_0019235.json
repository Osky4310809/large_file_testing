'Health inequalities' \nCommittee members also urged the Scottish government to consider whether regulations could be brought in which would prevent retailers promoting foods that are bad for health. \nThe committee is currently considering if it could bring forward its own legislative proposals to tackle the problem. \nIn a letter to Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell, the committee said: \"We support a bold approach to the new obesity strategy and would encourage you to include options that may initially be unpopular as this could result in an important step towards balancing out health inequalities in Scotland.\" \nThe committee highlighted the \"obesogenic environment in Scotland\", where unhealthy food is \"more available and more heavily promoted than in other countries\". \nTwo fifths of adults do not do enough exercise to meet guidelines, it added, with MSPs also pointing to a food culture of people eating together less, and snacking more. \nAnd it said poverty forces some shoppers to opt for high calorie choices instead of healthier options.

This resulted in successful policies not being scaled up or stopped altogether.\" \nMs Campbell was pressed on whether the government would restore its funding for the Jogscotland initiative , which the committee said had been \"particularly successful in encouraging women to undertake more physical activity\". \nThe committee also suggested money may need to be ring-fenced to fund projects when a new obesity strategy is introduced. 'No easy fix' \nThe MSPs said: \"We understand interventions cost money but believe preventative spend must be looked at seriously by the Scottish government. \n\"The initial outlay would seem to be outweighed by the ultimate cost savings to the NHS, employers, and local authorities. \n\"All the above show there is no easy fix for tackling obesity in Scotland and a comprehensive long term, cross-portfolio approach will be required.\" \nCommittee convenor Neil Findlay said it was disappointing that the \"good policies\" put in place to tackle obesity by the Scottish government \"don't seem to be working\". \nThe Labour MSP added: \"Scotland has not previously been afraid to take the initiative to tackle health related issues when other interventions have failed. This is why this committee is asking for a bold approach to tackling obesity. \n\"If we don't act now, we will be condemning future generations to a lifetime of poor health which is often driven by poverty leading to poor dietary choices.\" \nResponding to the committee's letter, Ms Campbell said: \"We have consistently called on the UK government to ban junk food advertising before the 9pm watershed. \n\"And we are looking at what further effective actions we can take within the powers available to us, including the use of multi-buy promotions, as well as examining a range of actions to improve diet, physical activity and education. \n\"We have announced our intention to set out and consult on the development of our new diet and obesity strategy this year, building on our wide range of activity to make it easier for people - including children and their families - to be more active, eat less, and eat better.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T12:03:06.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
