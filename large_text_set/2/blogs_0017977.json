And for the rest of the group, there was only a slight correlation between looks and earnings. At 29, for example, the average very unattractive person earned $35,000 per year, while unattractive people earned $24,000, average-looking people earned $30,000, attractive people earned $34,000, and very attractive people earned $36,000. \nPlus, the salary differences that existed were attributable to variations in other traits that also happened to correlate with looks. In particular, people high in health, intelligence, conscientiousness, and extraversion and low in neurosis were more attractive and earned more. (Profession didn’t make a difference.) Once these variations were factored out, the so-called “beauty premium” and “ugliness penalty” disappeared. \nThe upside of all this is that if you’re scared your appearance will hold you back at work, that may not be inevitable—especially if you’ve got the personality to make up for it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:02:13.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
