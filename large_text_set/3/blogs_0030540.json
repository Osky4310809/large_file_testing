These efforts would help to reposition the party, based on sound strategies that have been developed to advance the party in the direction of inclusive growth. \n”The APC has demonstrated gross incompetence in governance at all levels, particularly in managing the economy. Members are enjoined to position themselves to provide the required alternatives to the APC in future elections.” \nOn state issues, the party condemned the perceived ‘unconstitutional and opportunistic’ actions of three members of the party in the state House of Assembly (Adewale Omofaye (Ijumu) Kolawole Matthew (Kabba-Bunu) and Jimoh Omiata (Yagba East), who decamped from PDP to APC recently, declaring that: “All legal and constitutional provisions would be explored to challenge the acts of betrayal demonstrated by the decampees.” R-L; President Muhammadu Buhari, APC National Chairman, Chief John Odigie Oyegun, APC National Secretary, Hon Mai Mala Buni and SGF Engr Babachir David Lawal during breaking of Ramadan Fast at the State House.

JUNE 24 2016. \nThe party also described as embarrassing the unending screening of civil servants, which it adjudged inconclusive, noting that it was a cruel irony that civil servants whose data were used to secure bailout funds for the state had benefited the least from the proceeds. \nThe PDP called on the APC-led government in the state to put an immediate end to the agony of the affected civil servants. \nIt also lamented that tertiary institutions in the state had remained shut for several months arising from poor attention to the welfare of staff and students. \nAccording to the party: “We request the state government to reverse this ugly situation, to avoid further destruction to the state’s educational record and legacy. Bad governance has persisted in the state because members of the PDP have been magnanimous in opposition by not projecting the shortcomings of the APC administration as required.” Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:42:57.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
