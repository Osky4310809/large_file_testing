This is about kids who just want to go to school who just want to be themselves, and to hear the president a week or two ago talk about how supportive he is of LGBT people, it’s just outrageous that he go after trans kids this way.” \nAccording to The Pride LA : \nJointly issued in May under the Obama administration by the Justice Department and Education Department, the guidance asserts that denying transgender students access to the restroom in accordance with their gender identity violates the prohibition on sex discrimination under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. \nUnder Trump’s administration, such discrimination will be legal and schools will be able to force students to use bathrooms that match their birth certificates rather than their own gender identity. \nThis will put millions of students across the nation at risk of abuse and harassment. \nMore than 800 parents of transgender students along with numerous pro-LGBTQ groups sent letters to the Department of Education and the administration pleading to keep the guidelines in place. Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi joined the parents and groups calling the coming decision “deeply disappointing.” \nIf there is any good news from this it is that pro-LGBTQ advocates say this won’t actually remove the right’s of transgender students, saying students can still sue the school and school district if they are discriminated against because they believe Title IX still applies, regardless of the president’s order.
