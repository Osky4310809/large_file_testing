Tina and Bobby,What a story,What a journey,What a series,It's been an absolute honour. Thankyou for all your support,” she tweeted. \nIt's been widely praised, but Michelle did have to defend herself after an embarrassing blunder that saw her claim football wasn't a big sport in the 1960s. \nAt the time of the gaffe, the star - whose role in Tina & Bobby would suggest she should recall England's World Cup victory in 1966 - was talking about Sir Bobby Moore and his first wife Tina's role as the first celebrity couple . \nNow, Michelle has responded to the blooper, telling Metro: \"It was early in the morning and the words just didn't come out the way I wanted. Michelle stars with Lorne MacFadyen in Tina & Bobby (Photo: Stuart Wood) \n\"Of course I know football was a big deal in the 1960s - England won the World Cup. What I meant was back then, footballers didn't have the celebrity status they have now. \n\"It was a different world for Tina and Bobby - they were football's first golden couple.\" She previously suggested football wasn't a big deal in the 1960s (Photo: Stuart Wood) She was trolled for the comments (Photo: Stuart Wood/itv) \nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast in September, the star claimed football wasn't a \"major sport\" in the UK. \nShe said: \"Back in the sixties people didn't really know anything about football. It wasn't really a major sport back then.\" Ringing any bells, Michelle?
