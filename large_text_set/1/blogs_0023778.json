And sometimes, that can be scarily pressurising. You may be so nervous about something going wrong, that you'll probably be afraid of trying something new. But we're here to tell you, that there's no need to be. It's your day, and you have every right to look just the way you want to, from head-to-toe. So, to inspire you to go for whatever look you want, here are 8 fresh new hair trends from 2017 that you can try for your wedding. Flipped parting Only 2 more days #DayabyZendaya #AllDaya A photo posted by Daya by Zendaya (@dayabyzendaya) on Nov 1, 2016 at 5:24pm PDT \nPossibly the easiest hairstyle to give you a new look for your wedding, is flipping your hair parting. Style your hair in whatever way you choose, and then flip your hair over from the side you normally part it in. It's like an instant volume boost, plus people will notice the difference in your hair, but won't be able to put their finger on what you've done. Curls I've always been obsessed with curly hair üôÇWhat do you guys think? Should I keep this look for a while? #curlyhair #curlyhairstyles #curls #curl #pencilcurls #hairstyles #hair #haircolor #youtube #indian #indianyoutuber #mumbai #india #beautybloggers A photo posted by Sonal Sagaraya (@sonalsagaraya) on Jan 25, 2017 at 6:09am PST \nWhether they're natural, or product and tool-induced, curls are definitely in. Whether it's for your sangeet or even your wedding ceremony, embrace your curly side, and you'll be happier for it. Contourage CHRISSYüëÑ #chrissyteigen #girlcrush #fashion #fashionista #fash #fashionable #fashionblogger #fashionimport #fashionistas #fashiongram #instafashion #fashionblog #fashiondiaries #fashionpost #fashionlover #style #styles #streetstyle #instastyle #styleicon #styleblog #styleblogger A photo posted by @satisfymysoulll on Jan 20, 2017 at 1:40pm PST \nThis new hair colouring technique should ideally be done a week or two before your wedding. The fun-named technique is basically like contouring for your hair, where light and dark hair colour shades work to frame your face better and enhance your bone structure. Sounds like magic, doesn't it? Plus, it'll cut some time out of your wedding make-up routine. Crimping Weekend hair inspo from @maneaddicts \"bringin' back the crimp!\" #crimped A photo posted by Canberra Hairdressing Salon (@edgehairoconnor) on Dec 17, 2016 at 6:29pm PST \nRemember the heat styling trend everyone in the 80s and early 90s used to rock? An odd mix between straight and wavy hair, crimping is back in style. So, break out your old hair crimpers, and add a touch of texture to your wedding day hairstyle. We don't suggest crimping your full head of hair, because that might not turn out the way you want, but crimping bits and pieces totally works. Plus, if you're going for an updo or ponytail, the crimped texture will add to it. Tiger eye hair colour Justo cuando cre√≠mos que el balayage y los tonos met√°licos se hab√≠an apoderado de todo de aqu√≠ a final de a√±o, una nueva tendencia de coloraci√≥n volvi√≥ a realizar un boomüí£ y se trata del \"tiger eye o m√°s bien ojos de tigre\". Su nombre delata en qu√© consiste el estilo, s√≥lo basta con pensar en la fascinante tonalidad bronce, dorada y caf√© que tienen los tigres, incluyendo las rayas. Pero no se asusten, no es un regreso de aquella t√©nica del 2004 cuando el mundo se pintaba el cabello de amarillo y remataba con rayas de color oscuro muy marcado. Este estilo conserva la t√©cnica de balayage para darle un acabado suave a los diferentes tonos utilizados y dejar tu cabello con un aire m√≠stico e hipnotizante, digno de estas criaturas. #PSVstudiord #SalonDeBelleza #BeautySalon #Tendencias2017 #TigerEyeHair A photo posted by Sal√≥n De Belleza PSV Studio (@psvstudiord) on Jan 25, 2017 at 10:52am PST \nAnother hair colour job, which will ideally have to be done a couple of days before your wedding, is currently the ‚Äòit' hair colour of the year - tiger eye. Specifically for brunette hair, this balayage colour job adds warmth and intensity to your hair, using shades of brown, bronze, caramel and gold. Named after the colours of the tiger's eye stone, the hair colour will make you want to keep flipping your hair as you dance at your wedding. Bangs Mood #nofilter A photo posted by Huma Qureshi (@iamhumaq) on Dec 9, 2016 at 12:08am PST \nAlmost everyone had bangs last year, and the trend is strongly continuing into 2017. Go long or short, but make sure they're as messy as possible and frame your face well. Whatever hairstyle you choose for your wedding, having bangs gives your face a little more dimension and gives you a more playful, but still fancy look, depending on how you style them. Hair accessories Let's give the makeup artist some love. @jessicapsmalls thank you for my under eye twinkles! And being a true artist. üôèüèø Congrats on your first golden globes! A photo posted by Janelle Mon√°e (@janellemonae) on Jan 10, 2017 at 11:20am PST \nFrom dainty ornaments to hair jewellery, hair accessories are in right now, and what better occasion to wear some, than your own wedding. If you're looking to go down a slightly eccentric route, look to Janelle Monae for inspiration. High ponytail üåµ‚ô° shoutout to my microphone @nbchairspraylive A photo posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Dec 4, 2016 at 11:47am PST \nIf you're looking to put your hair up for your wedding, a high ponytail might be the way to go. Celebrities are rocking this style left, right and centre, and it frames your face like no other hairstyle. Plus, you can still rock curls, waves or even straight hair with this hairstyle.
