(Photo: PA / Gazette Live) \nThe Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) recently launched a crackdown on the sale and distribution of these illegal \"fully loaded\" devices. \nFive people were arrested in the North West of England and Wales last month, charged with breaching the Copyright, Designs and Patent Act 1988, and one seller has been ordered to pay a fine of Â£250,000. \n\"Set-top boxes loaded with apps and add-ons allowing access to copyright infringing material are very much illegal and anyone involved in selling these boxes should not be surprised to receive a knock on the door,\" said Kieron Sharp, Director General of FACT. (Photo: Gazette Live) \nInterestingly, Irdeto's research revealed that live sports was not the most popular type of pirated video content on Kodi - with movies and TV series topping of the list. \nThe only countries that indicated that live sports was the type of pirated video content they were most interested in were Portugal (25%), Egypt (23%) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (19%). \nMore men in each country indicated that live sports is the type of content they are most interested in pirating, while a majority of women prefer to pirate TV series.
