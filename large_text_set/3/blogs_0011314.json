The personalised email spelled Hollie's first name wrong (Photo: Mercury Press) \nShop Direct, which operates Very.co.uk, have apologised and said the email was \"fully-intended to be light-hearted\".

It said 'Holly's mum has got it going on'. \n\"I was like, 'what'?' I was shocked, and felt a bit sick, then I was really upset and started crying. \n\"I was angry that they had actually said that. Because they had personalised the email for me it was even more of a shock.\" \nHollie's mum Lyn Carew, 63, died of cancer in August last year, just weeks after she was diagnosed. \nShe said: \"It all happened really quickly, and we're still trying to sort things out now. It's all still very fresh and I'd only just started to think I was starting to deal with it about a month ago. Hollie says the email left her in tears (Photo: Mercury Press) \n\"Christmas was really hard, then it was her birthday in January. We're still sorting things out with the solicitors and I was just starting to get on with things again. \n\"This kind of reminder was the last thing I needed - a first Mother's Day without her is hard enough as it is.

There was no personal response. \n\"We were asked to fill in a form, if we wished, that would remove us from the Very.co.uk email list. \n\"That was just extra work for me to do after something that shouldn't have happened in the first place. \n\"I would have liked a proper apology. It's given me a different impression of the company.\" The email contains a reference to a Fountains of Wayne song (Photo: Mercury Press) \nCustomer James Mawdsley, 40, from Chester, Cheshire, was also left upset when he spotted the email in his inbox. \nJames, whose mum died of cancer two years ago, also complained to Very.co.uk.

I lost my mum quite recently and thought it was very strange to send an email with that title. \n\"It was targeting me personally, which made it worse. Quite frankly I can't imagine many marketing managers approving an email like that. \n\"I understand that it's Mother's Day and they want to promote it but what's wrong with something like 'Treat your mum on Mother's Day'?\" \nA third customer complained to the company on social media, saying: \"As if Mother's Day isn't hard enough to then receive an email with that title.
