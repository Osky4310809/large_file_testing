The Spurs boss has been in charge for 100 games (Photo: Ian Walton / Getty) \nThis season Spurs have the best defence in the Premier League – last term it was joint-best – despite injuries to key men Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Danny Rose. \nSignificantly, they also have heart. While Arsenal were bullied out of yet another title race by Chelsea on Saturday, Spurs are the only team to have beaten the Blues in the league since last September. \nWhen the going gets tough they can hang in there, stay patient and maintain their consistency. \nSo while a growing number of fans at the other end of the Seven Sisters Road cannot wait to see Arsene Wenger go, Spurs would love another 100 games under Pochettino.
