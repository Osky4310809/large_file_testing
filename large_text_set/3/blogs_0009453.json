Scott Fitzgerald, who lived in Mount Vernon for a time. (Algerina Perna / Baltimore Sun) Wesley Case ; $4 on St. Patrick’s Day, $12 normally — on menu now and for foreseeable future)\n¾ ounce Paddy Irish whiskey \n¾ ounce Bittermens New Orleans Coffee Liqueur \nSingle shot espresso or 1½ ounces dark roast coffee \n1½ ounces raspberry-cream cordial* \nWhipped cream and nutmeg (optional) \n*To create the cordial, add one can condensed sweet cream, one quart of raspberries, ½ cup of Everclear or vodka and 3 cups of milk or heavy cream to a blender. Sweeten to taste. (Stores in refrigerator for up to a month.) \nStir all of the ingredients together. Garnish with whipped cream and fresh ground nutmeg. \nLast year, Christian Stoddart, beverage director of Canton’s Verde, tried the coffee at the famous Café du Monde in New Orleans and loved its uncommon use of chicory, the root of the endive plant. \nSo for his take on an Irish coffee cocktail, Stoddart uses a coffee-and-chicory liqueur that adds “an earthy note.” But his favorite aspect is the raspberry-cream cordial, which might take a little extra effort at home. You could use Bailey’s, but he recommends giving your own a try. \n“I don’t think it really carries quite the punch that you can do when you make something yourself,” Stoddart said. “To be able to throw in the additional flavors and play with it, and really build it how you enjoy, is the best.” Barcocina's Irish Amnesia \nThe Irish Amnesia at Fells Point's Barcocina elevates familiar St. Patrick's Day flavors. \nThe Irish Amnesia at Fells Point's Barcocina elevates familiar St. Patrick's Day flavors.

Let simmer until reduced by half. \nCombine whiskey, reduction and Allspice Dram in a shaker tin with ice. Shake and strain over ice into a double rocks glass. \nWhisk Bailey’s, whipping cream and powdered sugar until stiff. Top drink with whipped cream mixture and garnish with espresso beans. \nLiz Jankiewicz, bar manager at Barcocina in Fells Point, wanted to elevate the flavors of an Irish Car-bomb, while rejecting its problematic title. “Irish Amensia” is a term Ireland locals use as a way of saying, “I’ll forgive you but I’ll never forget,” she said. In her mind, Jankiewicz is pointing out that the inspiration for her cocktail has an ugly name, but its flavors have merit. \n“You might enjoy this cocktail, but you’re not going to forget what the roots of it are,” she said. \nThe Bailey’s whipped cream won’t curdle like the Bailey’s cream liqueur would, so no need to rush. \n“Hopefully, they don’t have to chug this one,” Jankiewicz said.

Charles St., thelephantbaltimore.com , $12 — available March 14-19) \n1 ounce Jameson Irish Whiskey \n½ ounce Luxardo maraschino liqueur \n½ ounce Green Chartreuse liqueur \n½ ounce lime juice \n½ ounce simple syrup \nCombine all ingredients in a shaker tin with ice. Shake and strain over ice into a double rocks glass. \nPlaying off the popular Hemingway Daiquiri, the Elephant bartender Lara Sumerson dedicated her cocktail to another literary giant: F. Scott Fitzgerald, the once-Baltimore resident with Irish roots. \nShe substituted the Hemingway’s rum for Jameson, and added the Green Chartreuse for a layer of herbal flavor. (Its pale green color is also “sort of an homage to the day itself,” she said.) \nMost important to Sumerson is the Fitzgerald’s approachability, with the sweetness of the Luxardo and simple syrup balances the whiskey’s punch. Like the other cocktails here, the hope, she said, is the drink will be enjoyed at one’s leisure. \n“With our customer base, nobody’s binge-drinking anymore,” Sumerson said. “It’s more about the community and the company, and just enjoying the day.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T19:39:28.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
