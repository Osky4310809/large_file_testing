So in 2013, he packed his bags and moved to Beijing to join Xiaomi . He took on the role of the Vice President of International at the company, which he is now apparently leaving behind. Hugo Barra took to Facebook to announce he is leaving Xiaomi and moving back to Silicon Valley.\nIn a lengthy post, Mr. Barra wrote that his time at Xiaomi was the greatest and most challenging adventure of his life. He mentioned that with his help, Xiaomi has expanded its operations from China to more than 20 markets around the world, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, and Poland, among others. The company also reached a new milestone in India, as its revenues in the country topped $1 billion last year .\nSee also: Xiaomi admits growing too fast, no longer sharing yearly sales figures 2 weeks ago Barra also talked about the toll his work at Xiaomi took on his health and personal life.\nBut what I’ve realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health. My friends, what I consider to be my home, and my life are back in Silicon Valley, which is also much closer to my family. Seeing how much I’ve left behind these past few years, it is clear to me that the time has come to return.\nHugo Barra will officially leave his position at Xiaomi in February after Chinese New Year. He will then take some time off before heading back to Silicon Valley. For now, he hasn’t shared any info regarding new projects he will be working on once he gets back to California.\nIn a comment to Barra’s Facebook post, Xiaomi co-founder Bin Lin (pictured above) thanked him for his work and revealed that Barra would remain involved with Xiaomi as an “advisor.” Hugo Barra’s job at Xiaomi will be taken over by Xiang Wang, a Senior Vice President with the company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T10:05:29.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
