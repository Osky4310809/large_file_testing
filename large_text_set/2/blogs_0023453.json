He then called Allen, who confessed that he was at his sister’s house in Idaho visiting family against Moore’s order, court records say. \nAllen pleaded guilty in July to a two-count drug theft indictment related to his theft of a syringe in January while on the job at Swedish. \nAllen was court-martialed in 2011 while enlisted in the Navy and stationed at a hospital in Kandahar, Afghanistan, after he admitted to stealing vials of fentanyl. He was fired from at least five health care facilities in California, Arizona and Washington before Swedish hired him in August 2015. \nAllen was able to continue to find jobs in the health care field by lying about his addiction, drug thefts and work history, prosecutors said in court filings. Swedish fired him after he was caught swapping out a saline syringe to steal a fentanyl syringe from the hospital. Hundreds of patients were tested for possible contamination.
