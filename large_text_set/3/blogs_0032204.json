What gives it its unique character is the beach and surf lifestyle that attracts so many to the country. Unfortunately, Australia‚Äôs location makes it difficult for people to access the brands they crave from overseas and, until recently, few stores were stocking the labels they desired.\nDani Mercer, Conor Mercer and Jake Polce launched LESSONS in 2014, and in an incredibly short amount of time it‚Äôs become home to some of the biggest contemporary brands from around the world. Initially a hidden basement store, then a web store, the team opened its first official location last year in Perth CBD, Western Australia. On the rails, you‚Äôll find names such as Astrid Andersen, KTZ, MISBHV, Places + Faces, VFILES, YEEZY and many more.\nWe wanted to talk to the team behind LESSONS to find out more, so we arranged a call in the middle of the night to talk building relationships with brands, supporting upcoming labels and other stuff. Read the interview below and shop the online store here .\nLESSONS started in 2014 in a hidden basement. The inspiration came from us all heavily shopping online from overseas stores, as there was nowhere locally to source these designers (and getting killed with hectic shipping costs). We saw a major gap in the Australian market and an opportunity.\n#lessonsconceptstore \nA post shared by LESSONS (@lessonsconceptstore) on Feb 13, 2017 at 12:36am PST \n\nLESSONS provides Australia with a local access point to international designers not previously available on our shores, both with our physical location in Western Australia and our web-store.\nTravelling to LA, New York and Paris for Men‚Äôs Fashion Weeks and showroom meetings, something we hadn‚Äôt seen Australian stores doing, was crucial in building relationships and securing these designers locally. We travel four times a year to maintain and further develop these relationships, some of the designers we stock have become our good friends.\nKTZ was the first major brand we worked with ‚Äî we still remember stepping out of the lift elevator into our first meeting and it being in Kelly Cutrone‚Äôs apartment in New York with the KTZ owners and Kelly sitting at a table. I think we were all a bit shell-shocked, the whole meeting is still a bit of a blur.\nStreetwear is such a broad term, and we feel like all aspects are now being covered over here, from higher end luxury through to surf and skate we feel like there‚Äôs a platform for each segment.\nIn general, we‚Äôve seen fashion in Australia developing rapidly over the last few years with key people and stores helping push and drive it forward, for example, Sneakerboy and StreetX who kill it. In terms of the culture in Perth (where our store is located), kids are really well-educated and versed with what‚Äôs going on in fashion internationally.\nWelcoming Gianluca as a LESSONS Intern ‚Äì you'll see him around the store on Saturdays, say whatsup ‚úåüèª \nA post shared by LESSONS (@lessonsconceptstore) on Feb 24, 2017 at 11:36pm PST \n\nOur interests in fashion stem from what we‚Äôve each done and where we come from. What we love about it today is being able to see and experience it from a behind the scenes point of view. We also love that it transcends clothing and allows for collaboration across different industries ‚Äî we‚Äôre lucky to work with some amazingly talented people from around the world.\nIt‚Äôs always been really important to us that LESSONS introduces a brand to Australia or at the least to Western Australia ‚Äî the idea of exclusivity has been what‚Äôs set us apart from other stores in Australia.\nWe look for brands that influence culture and also like to work with designers we connect and can grow with, meeting the actual designers is a huge part of this.\nIt‚Äôs also really important to us that LESSONS has a balance in terms of price-point and is accessible to a wide demographic, we want everyone to be able to experience the store and shop with us.\nOur vision from the outset was always to source brands we felt were up and coming regardless of hype, and provide them with a platform in Australia. We‚Äôre always on the lookout for brands and designers who are adding something new to the conversation.\nThe Incorporated is a perfect example of this for us. We heard the buzz of this brand while we were in Paris during Fashion Week and went to their showroom in St. Germain to view their first collection. We vibed with the guys behind the brand from day one and were one of the first stores worldwide to release Collection 1 ‚Äî we also have a collab dropping soon, keep an eye out.\nLinking up with @theinc0rp0rated out here in Paris. New collection coming very soon. #lessonsconceptstore #theincorporated \nA post shared by LESSONS (@lessonsconceptstore) on Jan 21, 2017 at 6:48am PST \n\nOur initial focus was to bring our current designer list together. Now that we‚Äôve nearly achieved this and are almost three years in, we can start to turn our attention to the idea of sustainability. We‚Äôre putting this into practice with our in-house LESSONS brand which is wholly sourced, manufactured and produced in Australia, with the first collection of basics releasing shortly.\nExpansion and continuing to bring Australia exclusive designers from around the world. The Fall/Winter ‚Äô17 season is going to be crazy for LESSONS. We‚Äôve secured some amazing designers such as Palm Angels, Marcelo Burlon, Yeezy Season 5, Unravel Project, Faith Connexion, Kappa Kontroll, Enfants Riches Deprimes and more. We‚Äôd also love to throw more events and parties like the one we put on last year with ASAP Ferg in attendance.\nASAP FERG at LESSONS last night was crazy. Thanks to everyone who came down & special thanks to @asapferg @marty_baller & @tjmizell.
