Gary Barlow has defended his new talent show after criticism (Photo: Getty) \nSpeaking to Digital Spy , he said: \"We can’t say, ‘Hey, listen, if you’ve been on a stage before you can’t come in the door’. The great thing about someone like Jason is that he brings with him two years of experience of being in a show. \n“Now if he’s in a band with someone who’s had no experience and they’re 16 years old and they’ve left home for a year, he’s going to be an amazing support mechanism for [them].” \n“That’s where you see how important it is to be in these groups and to have the cross section we’ve had – people who’ve never been on a stage, people who’ve performed for 20 years but never been given an opportunity to people who’ve already been in musicals. It has to be open to everybody, and it’s important it’s open to everybody for that reason.” Jason Brock is already a successful West End star \nJason, who has appeared in Thriller live, dazzled viewers and got a standing ovation from judges, but his theatre success had not been widely disclosed. \nNaturally, some fans were disgruntled by the news - although only time will tell if it affects the show's popularity in an already-saturated market. \nAlso featuring Dannii Minogue, Martin Kemp and musical theatre star Amber Riley, the judges are looking to cast a troupe of young men who'll star in a forthcoming musical about Take That.
