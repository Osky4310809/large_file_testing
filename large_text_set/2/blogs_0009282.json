Sad.\nTrump, whose been busy this weekend meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, took a break from diplomacy to take a seemingly unprovoked shot at nemesis Mark Cuban on Twitter.\nI know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.He's not smart enough to run for president!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017 \n\nCuban initially shrugged it off, but then shared a back-and-forth the two had in 2016, including an email from Cuban that questioned Trump’s decision-making.\nLol https://t.co/c4VkkX3ODP \n— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 12, 2017 \nHow soon they forget …. pic.twitter.com/VXcfnjj4qX \n— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 12, 2017 \n\nThe contents read:\nNothing happened. Once you got past [Ted] Cruz I really hoped you would dig into the issues. You have a real chance to win. But to make it work you have to really dig in on the issues.\nIt’s like the tech stuff today. The number of tech IPOs has fallen off a cliff. There are hardly any new public tech companies. So when you say there’s a bubble, it sounds like you are winging it, which also makes it sound like your comments are based on who you talked to last. Which tells me you are getting bad advice.\nI get that a big part of your base doesn’t care about issue details, but to be President, to be this close, you have to dig in and know your sh*t. You don’t have to bore people with details, but you have to learn the details.\nEveryone else is afraid of you. I like to challenge you.\nWhen asked on Twitter why Trump was taking aim at him, Cuban had no answer.\nI don't know. But isn't it better for all of us that he is tweeting rather than trying to govern ? https://t.co/953MuEdfeu \n— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 12, 2017 \n\nWhile we’re at it, lets revisit the of their feud which can be traced back to 2004, when Donald Trump sent Cuban a hilariously scathing letter after the failure of his show The Benefactor . NBC canceled the show because it was too similar to Trump’s The Apprentice program. Trump enjoyed this. Trump enjoyed this very much.\nLetter to Mark Cuban from Donald J. Trump pic.twitter.com/TaS2QhdrJv \n— Truth Hurts (@CrangesMcbsktbl) September 24, 2016 \n\nTranscript of the letter:\n‘I am truly sorry to hear that your show has been cancelled for lack of ratings,’ he read. ‘When I initially called you to congratulate you on The Benefactor — little did you or I realize how disastrous and embarrassing it would turn out to be for you.\nIf you ever decide to do another show, please call me and I will be happy to lend a helping hand.\n‘With best wishes, Sincerely, Donald Trump.’\nCan these two just fuck already?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:06:13.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
