By Tom Phillips Published 06/02/2017 \nHigh-profile British YouTuber Craig \"Nepenthez\" Douglas has plead guilty to offenses under the UK Gambling Act. \nDouglas, 32, and business partner Dylan Rigby, 33, were in court today to change their pleas - both had previously said they were innocent of promoting a lottery, advertising unlawful gambling and inviting children to gamble (as reported by BBC News ). \nThe case, which is still ongoing, is the first in UK legal history to centre on a gambling website connected to a video game. \nDouglas ran FUT Galaxy, a site which let users place bets using FIFA's coin-based currency. He also made videos showing himself winning thousands of pounds, in which he encouraged his 1.3m subscribers to play as well. \nEvidence dug up at the time suggested Douglas had not disclosed his ownership of the site. Viewers also questioned the accuracy and fairness of the bets he was shown winning. \nThe UK Gambling Commission intervened and charged both men late last year. \nBoth Douglas and Rigby are due to be sentenced when the case resumes tomorrow.
