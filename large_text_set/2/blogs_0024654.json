The camp is on federal land, and authorities have told occupants to leave by Wednesday, Feb. 22 in advance of spring flooding. Associated Press \nBISMARCK, N.D. — The Latest on plans to close a protest encampment near the Dakota Access pipeline construction site in North Dakota (all times local): \n8:30 a.m. \nDakota Access pipeline protesters are ceremonially burning some of their living structures ahead of the closure of a longstanding camp in North Dakota. \nAbout 200 to 300 protesters remain at the camp, which is on federal land in southern North Dakota between the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the pipeline route. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has ordered the camp closed on Wednesday, citing the potential for spring flooding. \nThose left in camp milled about peacefully Wednesday, many in prayer. At least four wooden structures were being burned in what protesters say is part of the ceremony of leaving. \nNestor Silva, of California, says he is planning to move to a nearby camp being set up on land leased by the Cheyenne River Sioux. Law enforcement say they expect to make some arrests, but Silva says he doesn’t expect any trouble. \nWednesday’s deadline for the protesters to leave also may not spell the end of the heavy law enforcement presence near where the Dallas-based developer is finishing the last big section of the pipeline, which will carry oil from North Dakota through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. \nThe protest camp has at times housed thousands of people, though it’s dwindled to just a couple of hundred as the pipeline battle has largely moved into the courts. \nPresident Donald Trump, a fan of fossil fuels, has revived Energy Transfer Partners’s Dakota Access and another controversial pipeline, the TransCanada Corp.‘s Keystone XL. They would add 2,300 miles to the U.S. network with room to transport 1.1 million barrels a day. \nAs it is, there are more than 200,000 miles of pipe cutting across the country carrying crude, gasoline and other hazardous liquids -- about 18 billion barrels worth annually. Many other projects are on the map; in Houston alone, planned lines are expected to increase capacity by 550,000 barrels a day in the next few years. \nWhere do regulations stand? \nSeven days before Trump’s inauguration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration finalized a rule toughening up inspection and repair demands, mandating, for example, that companies have leak-detection systems in populated areas and requiring they examine lines within 72 hours of flooding or another so-called extreme weather event. \nThe American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s main trade group, characterized it all as overreaching and unnecessary. \nThe rule was set to take effect in July. The Trump administration slapped a freeze on all regulations written under Obama that haven’t yet gone into force. \nPipeline leaks are pretty much inevitable; one ruptures every day on average in the U.S., though in the majority of cases the discharge is less than 5 barrels, or 210 gallons. \nBut big ones can be destructive, and deadly. The 2010 failure of an Enbridge Inc. line sent more than 20,000 barrels of heavy crude into a Kalamazoo River tributary, coating birds, muskrats and other wildlife and closing the river to recreational activity for 22 months; Enbridge agreed to pay $177 million in fines and to boost safety in a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, which said it took the company 17 hours to notice the breach. \nLast October, an explosion on the largest U.S. gasoline pipeline killed one person, injured several more and temporarily cut off the fuel supply along the East Coast. In December, about 150 miles from a Dakota Access protest camp, a pipeline spilled 4,200 barrels of oil and was held up by environmentalists as a harbinger of what’s to come. \nGovernment statistics show there has been recent improvement in incident rates: In 2016, the number of accidents fell for the first time in five years, to 417 from 462, with total volume spilled declining 27 percent and the cost of related property damage dropping to $183 million from $257 million. The PHMSA wouldn’t speculate on the reasons and pro-regulation forces were reluctant to draw conclusions based on a single year’s statistics. \nThose with vast assets tend to report a higher number of incidents, of course. The biggest, Enterprise Products Partners, ranked first between 2010 and 2016. But the amount spilled comprised “a tiny fraction” of the total shipped, said Enterprise spokesman Rick Rainey. \n“The highest priority is to get to zero incidents,” said Carl Weimer, executive director of the nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust, a watchdog group founded after a 1999 gasoline pipeline explosion in Bellingham, Washington, that killed two children, both 10, and an 18-year-old. \nCongress isn’t likely to move to repeal or rewrite the Obama rule until a new head of the PHMSA is in office. But the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, said last week that easing up on the regulations was the right thing to do. \nBloomberg News contributed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:14:04.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
