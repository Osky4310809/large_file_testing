She first came forward with these allegations in October, after the release of the Access Hollywood tapes . But she's not suing Trump for sexual assault.\n\"Ms. Zervos was ambushed by Mr. Trump on more than one occasion,\" the lawsuit, which was filed by celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred, states. \"Mr. Trump suddenly, and without her consent, kissed her on the mouth repeatedly; he touched her breast; and he pressed his genitals up against her. Ms. Zervos never consented to any of this disgusting touching.\"\nAfter the Access Hollywood tapes went public, Zervos discovered something. \"For the first time,\" the lawsuit explains, Zervos \"saw Mr. Trump's behavior towards her for what it was: that of a sexual predator who had preyed on her and other women.\"\nEleven other women came out along with Zervos, accusing Trump of sexual assault. He responded by promising to sue them after the election. \"They're trying to poison the mind of the American voter,\" Trump said. \"every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. ... Total fabrication, the events never happened — never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.\"\nZevos is suing Trump for defamation — for calling her a liar in a statement he knew would be heard by millions, and would do irreparable harm to the women who accused him of sexual assault. He knew Zervos and the others would face \"threats of violence, economic harm, and reputational damage,\" the lawsuit claims. The woman's claim, for emotional harm and economic damage, seeks an undisclosed amount of money in compensatory and punitive damages.\nResponding to the suit, Trump's presidential transition team spokeswoman Hope Hicks attacked it as \"more of the same from Gloria Allred. There is no truth to this absurd story.\"\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/18/this-former-apprentice-contestant-is-suing-trump/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2266248/", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/17/apprentice-contestant-summer-zervos-slaps-donald-trump-with-defamation-lawsuit.html"], "published": "2017-01-19T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T08:49:05.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
