They did not kiss each other!\" she exclaimed. As Frazier showed her footage of the kiss she responded \"They did?! That's hilarious.\" \nGosling didn't mind sharing the spotlight with his fellow nominee either, telling Frazier: \"I mean, I'm happy for them, honestly, you know? Good for them.\" \nStone and Garfield have remained friendly exes since splitting in 2015. Garfield even gave Stone a standing ovation for her win on Sunday night.
