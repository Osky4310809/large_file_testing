They are saying demonetisation was not an election issue... why not? It was a major issue... People gave their verdict.\" \nHe also took a jibe at the opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh and said: \"The results were such because you were nurturing one section and depriving the other.\" First Published:   18:13 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:13:36.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
