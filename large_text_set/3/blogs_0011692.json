Well, former First Lady, since this episode was taped back when Michelle Obama was “the real boss” of the White House, as Gordon Ramsay puts it. The winner gets to have dinner with her in D.C., so the kids are ready to put it all on the line. “It’s been in the cards, the last 18 months working closely with the White House, and finally we’ve nailed it,” Ramsay told us when we visited the set to watch the challenge being filmed. It was the result of a chance meeting at an event attended by both Ramsay and Obama where they realized they had shared values. “Between the First Lady’s team and our team,” says executive producer Robin Ashbrook, “It was obvious there was synergy and a shared ambition of what we were trying to do.” “We all agree on the principles of good, clean food prepared well, and healthy relationships with food,” which, says Ashbrook, is the engine that drives the show, trumping even ratings in importance. Find out who wins Thursday night and come back to Yahoo TV to hear from the challenge winner. MasterChef Junior airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on Fox.
