Everyone’s favorite polymathic designer also found some time to take in other shows, and we caught the designer outside of Japanese brand sacai’s FW17 offering.\nWhat He’s Wearing: A Supreme x The North Face Mountain light jacket in an electric orange colorway, a cropped denim jacket, an essential black T-shirt, a pair of stonewash slim denim jeans and a pair of Air Force 1s that are rumored to be from his mysterious Off-White x Nike collaboration .\n\nSTEIN’s all-weather work jacket is a much cheaper option than Virgil’s Supreme x The North Face mountain jacket. Beyond offering less damage to your wallet, the STEIN jacket still packs in the protection. While Virgil’s Supreme jacket looks opportune for a rainy Paris day, the STEIN version boasts sealed seams to ensure the same. It also features a lined removal hood, and the collar is lined with comfy neoprene to make sure you feel as good as you look.\n\nVirgil demonstrates a lesson in layering while out and about at Paris Fashion Week. Underneath his hi-vis orange windbreaker, the creative polymath opts for a cropped denim jacket that could be a custom piece from his very own label’s womenswear offering. If you can’t quite shell out for an Off-White staple, then H&M has a much cheaper alternative that won’t set you back a fortune.\n\nA good pair of denim jeans is always worth splashing out on. Supreme’s slim-fit denim jeans with 5-pocket styling in a stone-washed shade are certainly a pair to indulge in. We’re sure that Virgil appreciates the joys of premium denim, and dark denim also offers endless versatility when it comes to wardrobe rotation too.\n\nSo, obviously Virgil is teasing a pair of Air Force 1s from his hotly anticipated Nike collaboration, and while you can’t quite cop those just yet, you can use Nike iD to create your very own Off-White-inspired kicks. Of course, a customized pair doesn’t offer any of the incredible details that Virgil Abloh has cooked up for his special collaboration, but the clean silhouette of these custom AF1s will still elevate your everyday your look, as demonstrated by Virgil above.\nFor more celebrity steez, check out how to get Kanye’s latest luxe-lazy-military getup for less. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:32:26.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
