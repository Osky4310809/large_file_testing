Distributed by MGM Worldwide Television. In production from 2004 — Present (currently starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Governor of California) Mark Burnett: lives in HollywoodMGM: headquartered in HollywoodUA: headquartered in Hollywood I just read an article called “ 199 Most Donald Trump Things Donald Trump Has Ever Said ”. A lot of the quotes included are outrageous, but I bet if you give that list to a Trump supporter, they would say of the most outrageous ones “well, these are taken out of context,” because they have an understanding of media, of spin, of marketing, and of the general complexities of life and speech and communication. Hollywood churns out low-grade crap because it believes that only a handful of intelligent people who watch TV or go to the movies can understand high drama or foreign films. It believes that the people who consume the low-grade crap it churns out are less intelligent, and don’t have an understanding of how the world works, who is important, and who isn’t. Hollywood is also run mostly by men, Gen Xers and Millenials, who make the movies they want to see; that is to say, mostly out of nostalgia for their own childhood toys and comics ( Transformers, Iron Man ). It’s the cinematic version of people who collect Jeff Koons — very expensive childhood toys to remind people of idyllic days, but because they’re made by an artist or auteur, the ridiculous amount of money spent is justified because it’s “art”. (see: Balloon Dog (Koons), Blade Runner 2049 (Villeneuve)). I know this, because I was told this by the producer of Porky’s , who I used to work for. Hollywood seems to be completely unaware that it is condemning to stupidity the audience that consumes its product, even though that is the only product it actually churns out. It seems to be unaware of its own ouroboros logic, and even more unaware of its own hypocrisy. Except for a brief period in the 70s, it has historically never assumed that the mass public has an understanding of media, of spin, of marketing, and of the general complexities of life and speech and communication… and yet, they do (see above). The mass public also understands that humans are capable of consuming reality TV, blockbuster movies and junk food AND reading books at the same time, of forming their own opinions, being thoughtful, while still enjoying being entertained. In short, an understanding of the complexities and contradictions of being human, which is the very thing they go the movies for — to recognize themselves. In fact, the very thing Streep mentions, as her purpose as an actor, in her speech. I don’t particularly like American football or Mixed Martial Arts, but I would rather watch either one instead of the Golden Globes or the Academy Awards because awards shows are boring as hell… and because very rarely are awards given for merit — skill and talent — rather than based on populism, box office gross, and effective marketing. (Which is exactly how the 2016 election was played.) There is a higher ratio of African Americans to Caucasians in the NFL than in most other corporate industries in the US. American football shows a greater diversity in race alone than Hollywood does — during Streep’s speech, the camera panned to three black people. Three. Out of a room of well over a hundred people. In Mixed Martial Arts, the diversity of participants is even greater, both in race and in gender. Further — and more importantly— MMA is one of the few places where women perform, compete and are judged first and foremost on their skill and talent, and only lastly on their looks and age — unlike Hollywood, where the EXACT OPPOSITE is true. As an aging actress, Streep feels this most keenly (see above: Hollywood is mostly run by men who won’t grow up). Don’t even get me started on the amount of child actors who grew up to be drug addicts and killed themselves, because the pressure to be perfect and the Hollywood fame machine is so twisted. Or the number of women who have been systematically groped and raped by Hollywood producers and directors, or been told to remove ribs or enlarge their breasts or reconstruct their noses / eyes / lips / wrinkles because they’re not “hot” enough. Or the anorexics who have been told to lose weight because they’re “ fat pigs ”. Or the growing population of children of celebrities who are entitled only for their family names, who are treated with entitlement because of their family name, and who act like bratty despots, and who cackle and crow over the “losers” who don’t enjoy the same privilege. If Donald Trump were a town, he would be Hollywood. I admire Meryl Streep as an actress; by all accounts, she seems to be an intelligent, thoughtful woman. And I believe she is entitled to and even should speak her mind — I’m very glad she did. But there is so much wrong with her speech, so much hypocrisy, so much out-of-touchness, separatist, elitist BS that only perpetuates the Us vs Them mentality, and feeds the Hydra (see: Hannah Arendt on isolationism and Totalitarianism ). Streep’s Golden Globes speech is disingenuous at best, dangerous at worst. To put it in Porky’s terms, it’s the theater kids versus the jocks, and Streep is only contributing to the whole mess. I wouldn’t be surprised if all the actors and musicians who went to Obama’s final White House party — but who won’t go to Trump’s Inauguration —  tweeted selfies from the bathroom to Trump, because that’s what the cool kids do. Please. Open your eyes. Look a little deeper. See what’s really there, and then we can really change.
