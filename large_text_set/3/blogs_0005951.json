Akira Tozawa and Rich Swann vs. Brian Kendrick and Noam Dar 2 of 3 Credit: WWE.com Two midcard cruiserweight stories came together for a tag team match on Sunday's Kickoff Show as Akira Tozawa and Rich Swann battled Brian Kendrick and Noam Dar, accompanied to the squared circle by Alicia Fox. The babyfaces cleared the ring of the heels and were poised to deliver a set of suicide dives when Fox stepped in front of Dar and Kendrick, shielding them. The heels isolated Tozawa and worked him over until the Japanese star made a hot tag to Swann, who exploded into the match. The former cruiserweight champion took the fight to both Dar and Kendrick, scoring a few near-falls in the process. A well-timed knee to the back sent Swann to the arena floor and the heels regained control as Fox danced, celebrating the performance of her boyfriend and his partner to that point. Swann fought out of The Captain's Hook but ate a suplex from Kendrick. Swann did manage to deliver a big kick that provided the opening he needed to make the tag to Tozawa. A senton, stereo suicide dives and a Shining Wizard had the babyfaces rolling. Swann kicked Kendrick into the Snap German, and Swann delivered the Phoenix Splash to Dar for the win.
