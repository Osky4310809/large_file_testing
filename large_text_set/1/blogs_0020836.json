He was taken to the nearby Holy Spirit Hospital, where he was declared dead on Friday.\nKreider was 16-years-old when he broke into the Lancaster, Pa., home of classmate Kevin Haines and his parents, Thomas and Lisa Haines.\nInvestigators searched for a suspect, as Kreider attended Haines’ memorial service appearing distraught, according to mourners.\n“We were comforting each other. He was crying,” friend Laura Humbard told People in 2007 . “Alec was the most upset kid.”\nIt was not until Kreider allegedly told his father, Tim Kreider, a month later about how he’d killed the couple and their son that his dad turned him over to police.\nThe teen pled guilty at the 2008 trial, but never provided a motive, telling the court room that “there is none,” according to CBS News .\nKreider’s father told local newspapers in 2014 that when his son confessed to him, he never offered a motive, “only said something about Kevin annoying him lately.”\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:23:45.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
