Intro \nNittany Lions, bring the heat, for 46 we’re on our feet \nStand tall, stretch it out, time to show what THON’s about \nFTK! Let’s get loud! Crank that volume in the crowd \nRound the world, we unite, all together in the fight Verse No. 1 - Penn State \nBlue and white forever true, Penn State grows. Woah! That’s new! \nEast begins its renovation. Canyon: new location \nDear Mike, we miss you most, favorite mailman leaves the post \n‘All In’ movement takes the lead. Lion’s Pantry seeks to feed \nTarget, is the spot. LionPATH, can we not? \nStorm the field, scream and shout, Ohio State gets whited out \nWrestling: champs again, Nittany Lions win Big Ten! \nSmell the roses, bags are packed, Penn State football! Guess who’s back? Chorus \nIgnite! Electrify! Come on raise your diamonds high \nOne purpose, For The Kids! Hours dancing: 46! \nShake the stands, rock the floor. Hear our little lions roar! \nLook around, take it in. This fight, we will win! Verse No. 2 - Current Events \nAleppo seeks light in the dark. Orlando’s Pulse beats in our heart \nEngland - “Peace out, EU!” Hop on flights to Cuba too \nOrcas will be swimming free. Space X in the galaxy \nElection puts Trump on top. Obama’s out – mic drop \nFinal 5, strong and bold. Phelps, Ledecky made of gold \nFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee: Muhammad’s legacy \nMr. Palmer hits last drive. Peyton Manning says goodbye \nGood year, to be a Cub, curse is lifted, fly the dub \nPens hoist the Stanley Cup. Leicester City turns it up \nCleveland wins the ring, a kid from Akron still the king Chorus \nIgnite! Electrify! Come on raise your diamonds high \nOne purpose, For The Kids! Hours dancing: 46! \nShake the stands, rock the floor. Hear our little lions roar! \nLook around, take it in. This fight, we will win! Verse No. 3 - Entertainment \nSnapChat makes us dogs and deer. Stranger Things happened here \nRain drop, drop top.. where’s the closest Poké stop? \nGilmore Girls continue story, splash around with Finding Dory \nLeo lives his Oscar dream. HARAMBE, make a meme \n“Closer” playing on repeat. Running man on that beat. \nIs it Broadway? Is it school? “Hamilton” makes history cool \nLeia’s force will remain. Prince sings in the purple rain \nWelcome back to life Jon Snow. Sorry if you didn’t know! \nWhy is everything so lit?! What was this year’s biggest hit?! Chorus \nIgnite! Electrify! Come on raise your diamonds high \nOne purpose, For The Kids! Hours dancing: 46! \nShake the stands, rock the floor. Hear our little lions roar! \nLook around, take it in. This fight, we will win! Verse No. 4 - THON \nBJC, now’s our chance. Show the families why we dance \nPast and present volunteers, with Four Diamonds 40 years \nPenn State students show they care, one mission we all share \nDiamonds guide the way, we will celebrate one day \nRise up, strength defines you, wisdom: support behind you \nCourage: to face unknown. Honesty: leads you home \nFireflies in the night, today we spark tomorrow’s light \nBoundaries broken, futures bright, hope within, we ignite \nCan't be at the BJC this weekend or just want to catch up on what you might have missed?
