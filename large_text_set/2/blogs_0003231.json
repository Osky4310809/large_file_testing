Francis Escudero yesterday assured his colleagues in the Senate that the inquiry he is seeking on the Amnesty International (AI) report on extrajudicial killings is not a fishing expedition. \nEscudero, who is planning to file next week a resolution calling for the inquiry, said the objective is to compel AI to present proof of its claims as contained in the report, which it released earlier this week. \nCiting a source from the Philippine National Police (PNP), AI claimed that the police were being paid to kill suspected drug personalities. \nEscudero said AI should back up its claims now that it has damaged the reputation of the country internationally. \n“This is not a fishing expedition. Our objective is for AI to prove the claims against our country. They cannot claim confidentiality. They have already damaged the country so they owe us that much even if it is only in an executive session,” Escudero said in a radio interview. \nHe said if AI’s intention is to help address what it claims is happening in the country, Escudero said it should provide the needed information to give the government the chance to deal with the issue and rectify the situation.   \nThe senator said even if the contents are unsubstantiated, the report has an impact on both tourists and investors. \nHe said if AI does not trust institutions such as the Senate to be objective and to use the information it gathered to remedy the situation, it should come out and say who it trusts. \nSenators Richard Gordon and Panfilo Lacson – chairmen of the committees on justice and human rights and public order and dangerous drugs, respectively – expressed reservations about the inquiry. \nThey said unless AI’s claims are substantiated by evidence, these would be considered nothing but rumors. \nOnce taken up in plenary, Escudero’s resolution will most likely be referred to either of the two committees. \nGordon said he would not allow AI to use the Senate to gain publicity. \nHe urged Escudero to convince AI to submit sworn affidavits from its witnesses before calling the probe. \nGordon suspects the AI does not have any proof to substantiate its claims. \n“If they have evidence then why haven’t they filed a case before the International Criminal Court? It’s because they don’t have any. Why involve us in this? We won’t be used by them,” he said. \nSen. Risa Hontiveros expressed dismay at how the Duterte administration has responded to the AI report. \n“From the House speaker’s ‘it’s none of their business’ remark, to the justice secretary’s ‘criminals are not human’ usual profanity-laced attacks, the government’s lack of commitment to address the country’s human rights issues is appalling and unconscionable,” Hontiveros said. \nShe vouched for the credibility of AI, which she said has a long track record of safeguarding human rights. \n“It will not stake its reputation by issuing baseless reports. Its findings on the country’s extrajudicial killings are a very serious matter. It deserves the government and the country’s utmost serious attention.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:50:49.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
