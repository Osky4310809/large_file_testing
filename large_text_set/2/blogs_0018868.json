His antics on Twitter alone are enough evidence to send him off to an etiquette school. The self-proclaimed critic has taken on many Bollywood celebrities, unwarrantedly in the past, and secured a steady place in our hate list. Latest on KRK‚Äôs troll radar was actress Swara Bhaskar who, to our collective delight, took no time to shut his shitstorm. \nThis sequence of events started with Karan Johar revealing the poster of Swara‚Äôs next movie, Anarkali of Arah . KJo tweeted: Well done @ReallySwara for constantly breaking ground!! 24th march is the date guys ! For this new world and engaging film!!! pic.twitter.com/3zmuUvOIrO ‚Äî Karan Johar (@karanjohar) February 20, 2017 \nInterfering in the narrative, KRK went on to eject a vile tweet from his pea-sized intellect. Here‚Äôs what he tweeted. Sir @karanjohar it will not be a flop or washout, but it will be super duper disaster of the year coz KRK says so. https://t.co/Ugu3GPfFxT ‚Äî KRK (@kamaalrkhan) February 20, 2017 \nAs the Gods of Internet were on the side of the good, KRK had his ass handed to him by Swara who kept it cool and classy with a comeback so savage that we want to make love to it. She tweeted: Kuch logon ki gaali, compliment hoti hai! :) Thanks @kamaalrkhan the unasked filth u spew is a character certificate for us! üôèüèø Appreciated. https://t.co/4rDCWQShio ‚Äî Swara Bhaskar (@ReallySwara) February 20, 2017 \nOf course, KRK wasn‚Äôt going to accept defeat, because that kind of demeanour would be on the lines of maturity (a concept obviously alien to him). He tweeted back, saying: Madam @ReallySwara I don't give Gaali to anybody, neither given you Gaali. I am just talking about a crap film as a critic so just chill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:10:08.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
