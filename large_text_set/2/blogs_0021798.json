Best for Culture: Kannur Beach \nOff the beaten track in India , the small town of Kannur, in northern Kerala, is known for its secluded beaches, mysterious masked spirit-possession theyyam rituals , and hand loom weaving. The theyyam season runs from October until May and Kerala Tourism has a comprehensive calendar of theyyam events . There are some delightful, laid back (and inexpensive) beach houses in the Thottada beach area, such as Kannur Beach House , Waves Beach Resort , Chera Rock Beach House , and KK Heritage Homestay . Kannur district is also home to Muzhappilangad Drive-In Beach. You can drive all the way along its 4 kilometers of sand. www.flickr.com user ஆனந்தம் / a n a n d h a m 5. Best for Luxury and History: Bekal Beach \nBekal beach, in far north Kerala (around one hour's drive from Mangalore airport in Karnataka) is famous for its old fort -- apparently the largest one in Kerala. The beaches are clean and unspoiled, but luxury hotels have already started moving into the area, making it the place for a pampered getaway. The most popular resort is the gorgeous Taj Vivanta . It's possible to stay there for under 9,000 rupees per night, depending on the season. The secluded Lalit Resort and Spa Bekal is located on a private beach with backwaters running through it. However, it's pricey. Room rates are from around 19,000 rupees per night. www.flickr.com user karmadude 6. Best by Boat: Cherai Beach \nThe 10 kilometer long Cherai beach makes an appealing side trip from Kochi. It's located on Vypeen Island , which can be reached from Kochi by ferry and then a bus or auto rickshaw ride through the villages and paddy fields -- yes, it is isolated. A substantial portion of the main beach was recently beautified, which included the addition of a new walkway. One of the remarkable sights there is beach and lagoon so close together. If you explore some of the surrounding lanes, you'll get great views! Stay at Les 3 Elephants , a peaceful backwaters eco resort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:23.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
