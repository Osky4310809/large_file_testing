Inauguration performers, at both the official event and various D.C. balls around it, now include:\n16-year-old Jackie Evancho the Mormon Tabernacle Choir protesting Radio City Rockettes Toby Keith 3 Doors Down The Piano Guys Lee Greenwood DJ Freedom Wii music producer DJ RaviDrums The Frontmen of Country ’80s cover band The Reagan Years Holliday, despite having her name announced by the inaugural committee, has actually “been asked to perform but hasn’t officially agreed to do so yet,” according to her publicist.\nThe odd mash-up of performers at next week’s eventâ€”and its slow, painful roll-out, as organizers continue to insist they are securing A-list names despite all evidence to the contraryâ€”has been heartily mocked on social media. It certainly pales in contrast to the starry lineup at both of Barack Obama’s inaugurations, which included Aretha Franklin, Shakira, and BeyoncĂŠ.\nThe list of musicians who’ve publicly turned down the chance to perform at Trump’s event is also somehow growing longer every day.\nHahahahaha, I was just asked by a booking agent if I would consider djing at one of the inaugural balls for #trump… Hahahahaha, wait, Hahahaha, really? I guess I'd DJ at an inaugural ball if as payment #trump released his tax returns. Also I would probably play public enemy and stockhausen remixes to entertain the republicans. I'm still laughing. Hahahaha. So #trump what do you think, I DJ for you and you release your tax returns? \nA photo posted by moby Xâ“‹X (@moby) on Jan 9, 2017 at 8:52am PST \nTrump and his team, though, stand firm on the inauguration’s popularity. â€œAll the dress shops are sold out in Washington,” Donald Trump boasted to the New York Times last week. (They are actually not .) An organizer described the affair as one of “soft sensuality” (intention unclear); Trump spokesman Boris Epshteyn has also said in defense of the muted lineup, â€œWe are not putting on Woodstock.â€\nBarack Obama, meanwhile, ended his term by partying at the White House with Jay Z, BeyoncĂŠ, Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, and a slate of Hollywood-ites earlier this month. The affair, according to Mike Allen’s Axios newsletter , stretched well into 4 a.m., with several A-list celebrities mourning: “We don’t know when we’ll be back.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T15:34:15.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
