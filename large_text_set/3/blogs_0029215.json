Last month, he said that the media used “mind control and witch craft,” according to Right Wing Watch . \nHe has also claimed that President Trump’s victory was a “manifestation of an enraged demon through the populace.” \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:53:14.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
