We found out that about 20.5% men and 23.1% women said ‘can’t wait to get married’ and 12.2 % men and 10.3% women said, ‘not for me’, while 18.2% men and 13.2 % women stated that they were ‘not sure’. \nThere are quite a few stories that would make you believe most individuals get married because of parents, relatives or siblings push them. The stereotype exists that people get married as they are forced to. At Shaadi.com, we have always believed that getting married is a choice and you should get married only when you’re ready for it. \nWhen you sign up on Shaadi.com, there’s an option that lets you specify whether you’re creating a profile for ‘Self,’ ‘Son,’ ‘Daughter,’ ‘Brother,’ ‘Sister,’ ‘Friend’ or ‘Relative’. We’re sharing some data that shows who really creates a profile on Shaadi.com. \nThere’s a preconceived notion that parents or siblings (given the use of internet in India. Not all parents are comfortable with it) create the highest number of profiles for their child or siblings on Shaadi.com. However, that’s not the case. To be precise, it is 49% not true. Parents and siblings only created a total of 23% profiles on Shaadi.com in 2016. \nOn Shaadi.com, a significant chunk of individuals look forward to getting married because it’s their choice. 72% of the Shaadi.com profiles are created by self! The data speaks for itself: Shaadi.com profiles created by in 2016 \nProfiles created by friends and others accounted for 3% and 2% of total profiles created in 2016. \nThis is it for now. Look forward to our next exciting post.
