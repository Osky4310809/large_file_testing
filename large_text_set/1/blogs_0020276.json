I was much excited to be at the stadium on the first day of the season, watching Garage beer being poured and my lacto-fermented sour \"Meister\" alongside. I thought I might be helpful providing recommendations to undecided customers in the beer queue. A group of three men approached and one of them addressed me with a superior snarl: \"Recommendation? I don't think so. I know more about beer than anyone else here!\". Let's leave the obvious condescension about my gender aside (I landed a good burn simply by informing this dud that I made the very beer he was drinking). It's in these moments that I really understand why some people are cynical about artisan \"craft\" movements. DYLAN JAUSLIN \nAnnika Naschitzki, owner and brewer at Tiamana, says there's no place for elitism in beer. \nIt only takes a few arrogant, high-handed individuals spewing their ego-fueled judgement about \"real\" beers to confirm any notions people may hold about craft beer being elitist, aloof and overrated. \nI think those people are a minority, but unfortunately they are loud and noticeable. They're not helping anyone, least of all themselves. \nI've never heard a brewer or brewery owner utter anything near the hybris and self-importance that leaves some \"connoisseur's\" piehole. Take this episode. A bar manager told me about a meet-the-brewer event with Soren Eriksen from 8 Wired. The place was packed when an 8 Wired fan made his way to the bar proclaiming \"I get to buy a drink for Soren! What barrel-aged, specialty-fermented, amazing bottles do you have? It must be perfect, I mean, he's a brewing god!\". As the fan-boy was quivering over the burden of this epic decision, the bar manager spotted Soren walking by and shouted \"Soren, what do you want to drink?\". Soren replied (insert beautiful Danish accent) \"Ehm, any Pilsner, thanks\". The fan-boy was in shock. Should a \"brewing god\" settle for something as pedestrian as a Pilsner? *thunder roll*. SCOTT HAMMOND/FAIRFAX NZ \nEven \"beer gods\" such as Soren Eriksen want to drink simple beers sometimes. \nLet me be clear - the enthusiasm and passion that people have for beer is the very reason why it's fun to be in these circles. \nPeople are experimenting, discussing, broadening their knowledge, and I've been on the same journey ever since I arrived in New Zealand six years ago. \nHowever, where it gets exclusive, judgmental and elitist, it's no fun anymore. \nIt may even become a barrier, keeping people from giving local small-scale beers a go because they don't want to be like \"one of those nerds\". \nI want this scene to grow and diversify in all directions. \nA big part of that is to respect the different ways in which people approach beer. \nI know for myself, I am now equally (if not more) impressed by a balanced, flavoursome low-alcohol beer than by an aged-fruit-and-spice-barrel-something. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:26:58.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
