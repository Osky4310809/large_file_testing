But, you would think that after a few decades on this planet, this sexily-misinformed Wheel of Fortune contestant named Kevin would’ve heard of a little movie called A Streetcar Named Desire (someone Kevin’s caliber of thirst would not know Streetcar was a Pulitzer-winning play and might think Tennessee Williams is a honey-flavored whiskey). \nSo here he is, in all his glory, calling out, “A Streetcar Naked Desire” for some reason. What even is A Streetcar Naked Desire? According to a brief Google search, there are only eight cities with surviving first-generation streetcar services available to the public. Does Kevin just have a little sauciness on the brain, or is this a highly-specific fetish? This naked streetcar-ing? \nTwitter joined in the confusion/exasperation. He was so close! A \"k\"? Really? Pat's \"n \" is amazing. #wheeloffortune pic.twitter.com/ylfUxwRulo \n— Sarah VanMetre (@sarahvan24) March 21, 2017 Share This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:33:21.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
