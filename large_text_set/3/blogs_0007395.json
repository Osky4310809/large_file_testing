In the video, the company has let slip a few new features of the family-friendly SUV – some of which will make their debut on the Thai-market car. \nThe first and most important is the addition of a third row of seats (the US-market version is a five-seater only), making it the first-ever seven-seater CR-V. Also seen is the lack of a traditional gearlever, replaced by an NSX -style selector with buttons for P, R, N and D. \nHonda also highlighted the new 1.6 litre i-DTEC turbodiesel engine , which makes 160 hp at 4,000 rpm and 350 Nm of torque at 2,000 rpm. Paired to it is a nine-speed automatic transmission – both the new mill and gearbox originally made their debut on the facelifted version of the outgoing European-market CR-V . \nAside from the diesel, the new CR-V should also be offered in Thailand with the same petrol engines as the US. These include a 2.4 litre naturally-aspirated mill that churns out 184 hp at 6,400 rpm and 244 Nm of torque at 3,900 rpm, along with a 1.5 litre VTEC Turbo unit producing 190 hp at 5,600 rpm and 243 Nm of torque from 2,000 to 5,000 rpm, slightly higher than the one in the Civic. \nCompletely redesigned inside and out, the new CR-V is even more practical than before, with a longer wheelbase – 2,660 mm vs 2,620 mm – providing the car with a more spacious cabin. New features include LED head- and tail lights, an Active Grille Shutter, an optional powered tailgate with handsfree opening and a new seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. \nThe new CR-V also adds the option of Honda Sensing driver assists, including Collision Mitigation Braking System, Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), Road Departure Mitigation, Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). However, it is unclear if all these features will be offered in ASEAN markets. \nCloser to home, the new Honda CR-V is likely one of the four cars that Honda Malaysia plans to launch this year. Do you think there will be a market for a diesel seven-seater model over here? \nGALLERY: 2017 Honda CR-V", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T14:16:16.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
