I’ve seen it a few times since I joined my first commercial health club in 1980. \nIt doesn’t take much—a new owner, neglected maintenance, disgruntled or poorly trained employees. Next thing you know, you’re fighting to cancel your membership. My last bad gym, no kidding, made me write a formal letter of resignation, and then forced me to schedule an “exit interview,” all to chisel me out of an extra month’s dues. \nBut getting out of a bad gym membership is only half the battle. Next you have to search for a good one. \nWe can help you with that. We looked into the national gym chains, soliciting opinions from readers and knowledgeable friends while visiting local branches when we could. \nMost gyms these days, big and small, are filled with similar cardio and weight machines. Bigger ones just have more of them. But we don’t care about any of that. \nWe focused on the free weights they tuck into the far corners of the workout floor, and the space they allocate for the kind of training you see in Men’s Health : heavy lifts with barbells and dumbbells, challenging exercises with kettlebells and suspension systems, and multi-directional bodyweight exercises for mobility, core strength, and metabolic fitness. \nSo a chain like Planet Fitness, which discourages heavy lifting and in most locations doesn’t allow barbell squats or deadlifts, is out. (Although you can still get a decent workout at a gym like that. Here’s how . \nThese are the best places to snag a membership in 2017. Best Overall: Life Time Fitness \nLet’s start with a quick note about money: \nThe average monthly fee for a gym membership is $55, according to Club Intel, an industry report. But that’s not a typical membership fee. About two-thirds of us pay less than $50 a month, and those gyms are the fastest growing part of the health-club industry. \nLife Time Fitness goes the opposite direction, with members paying an average of $105 a month, according to a company spokesperson. Because it’s smaller than the other national chains, with just 122 locations in 26 states, most of you reading this won’t have access to it, even if it’s in your price range. \nBut if you are near one, and you can afford it, chances are you’ll be happy you joined. Readers who train there generally rave about it, especially the amount and range of equipment it offers, like Olympic lifting platforms and bumper plates, kettlebells up to 50 pounds, and TRX suspension trainers. (Here’s a guide to TRX suspension training .) \nThe only complaint I heard was about how crowded it is at peak hours. You’d have a tough time doing a program that requires alternating between two or more exercises. But that’s true of almost any commercial gym. 2/6 Shutterstock Best For Pumping Iron: Gold’s Gym \nI’ve been to the flagship Gold’s in Venice, California, and I’ve been to several others over the years, including a local one that’s newly remodeled. \nThey’re all different (especially the one in Venice), but they all share one important trait: In my experience, they’re designed to accommodate serious lifting. The local one had dumbbells up to 140 pounds, kettlebells up to 40 pounds, a heavy bag, and even a couple of tires to flip. \nOne I used a few years back was a complete dump—broken plumbing in the locker room, filthy carpets in the warmup area—but even there I could get a good workout, as long as I skipped the floor exercises. \nReaders shared similar experiences. Because most Gold’s locations are franchises, and many franchisees own more than one gym, what you get for your membership will be very different from one area to the next. It might be the nicest gym in town, or an embarrassment, or anything in between. \nGold’s Gym has ranked highest in customer satisfaction in two consecutive J.D. Power surveys. I’d guess that the increasingly competitive market has weeded out the substandard franchises. The newer locations, according to the readers who shared their experiences, are great places to lift. \nI was quoted a monthly fee of $25, with a one-year initial contract, after which you can cancel at any time. 3/6 Shutterstock Best For Travelers: Anytime Fitness \nAnytime offers a uniquely travel-friendly feature: A key card system allows members to use any its 3,000-plus locations at any time of day, even when there aren’t any employees on the premises. As a reader who travels more than 200 days a year explained to me, “Unless I’m in a very remote location, like a national forest, I can generally find an AT.” \nThe downside? Anytime is one of the most aggressive and fastest-expanding franchisors in the fitness industry. As you might expect, the size and quality can be wildly different. One club might be huge, with everything you’d want in a gym, while another might be tucked away in a strip mall, with hardly any equipment or room to use it. \n“The signage is pretty standard, but that’s about it,” the reader said. “But no matter where I go, they’ll always have at least one squat rack, a barbell, and an assortment of dumbbells heavier than the ones I can find in the hotel.” \nMonthly fees vary, but the average price of membership seems to be $30 to $40. 4/6 Shutterstock Hit-or-Miss Gym: 24 Hour Fitness \nThis chain, with more than 400 clubs in 13 states, elicited the broadest range of opinions from readers. A reader based in Los Angeles, who said he’s been a member “virtually forever,” offered this critique: \n“Quality varies enormously, almost comically, from one franchise to the next. At the one I use the most, the roof is a sieve, there’s one tiny window in the whole place, and the water fountain most convenient to the weight area is constantly broken. Ten miles away, there’s another 24 Hour that’s huge, well-lit, with massive windows and high ceilings. They constantly update their equipment and even added a turf area with big tires for flipping and a prowler. The place is a dream to use.” \nAnother reader agreed that equipment differs from gym to gym, but said that overall, “they’ve embraced heavy lifting, even if it means some chalk and noise.” \nFor $30 to $40 a month, you might get the best gym in town, and a great place to work out when you’re on the road, if you mostly travel to bigger cities. Or you might be disappointed. You just have to judge each location on its own merits. 5/6 Shutterstock Most Frustrating: LA Fitness \nThe parking lot of my local LA Fitness was packed on a cold, rainy, crappy Sunday morning a week before Christmas. Inside, the club was bright and warm and filled with people working hard. The manager who took me on a tour was friendly and engaging. \nRight away, though, I felt a disconnect. He asked me where I currently work out. I lied (sorry about that) and mentioned the bad gym I fought to leave. He told me he’d worked out there, but was disappointed because they didn’t have any “ab training equipment.” \nI asked what he meant. He seemed confused by my confusion. I didn’t tell him that I wrote a book on core training , with dozens of exercises that require either no equipment, or basic stuff like a cable machine, TRX, or Swiss ball. But I figured out what he meant soon enough. As we started our tour of the workout floor, he proudly pointed out his club’s six ab-training machines. Six! \nSo it went throughout the tour. Tons of machines, all shiny and seemingly well maintained. Lots of benches for every conceivable type of barbell press—flat, incline, decline, overhead. The setup would be perfect for someone who wants to isolate muscles and work them from every angle. \nSince I don’t use many machines, and my shoulders have filed a restraining order to prevent me from doing barbell presses, I looked for the things I might use. That was disappointing. For starters, I would have to use hexagonal weight plates for deadlifts , which makes for an awkward setup. (Lots of readers complained about flat-sided plates, and not just at LA Fitness.) \nBut the biggest problem is one multiple readers described. “If they have any specialized equipment, it’s for trainers only,” one said. Another added: “The area of the gym with the TRX and kettlebells is cordoned off. They frown on box jumps—personal training only.” \nAll of which is a shame, because it was easily the best-looking health club I’ve seen in recent memory, and it was a good deal. I was quoted $100 up front and $30 a month, with no contract and access to hundreds of clubs in dozens of cities. But just because it’s not for me doesn’t mean it isn’t a good choice for you. 6/6 Shutterstock The Wild Cards: Local Chains \nSome of the biggest raves I heard from readers and fitness experts were for local gym chains—EOS in San Diego, Club Fitness in St. Louis, Formula Fitness Club in Chicago, the Bay Club in L.A. \nThose readers offered some of the best advice for anyone looking for a new place to work out: \n“Just because a gym has all the bells and whistles doesn’t mean it’s a good fit, and just because a gym is perfectly equipped doesn’t mean it will be well managed,” one said. \n“Maybe the measure of a good gym or a chain isn’t the equipment or the price,” said another. He believes the professionalism of the trainers on staff is the best indication of the workout environment. \nFollow this guide to finding the perfect gym beyond this list. And for pure out-of-left-field weirdness, here’s a pro tip that trainer Roger Lawson II shared on Twitter: “Have you ever looked up mid-set and saw a butt so good that it inspired you to be a better person? If not, switch gyms.” \nLou Schuler is an award-winning journalist and contributing editor to Men’s Health.
