There’s the space-travel world of Firefly . (And the space travel world of the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy 2. ) Also the musical superpowered world of Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog . And the modern-day, black and white Shakespearean world of Much Ado About Nothing. Then, of course, the you-have-to-solve-a-mystery-every-week world of Castle. \nThat said, we think we’ve finally found the one place where Nathan Fillion doesn’t look completely comfortable. Or suave, or smooth, or hyper-confident-borderline-cocky, or any of the traits we typically associate with Mr. Fillion.\nWe present, for your viewing pleasure, an Instagram of Nathan Fillion in an disco party bus Yes, that’s right, a disco party bus.\nWatch and enjoy.\nDon't ask, because I don't know. \nA video posted by Nathan Fillion (@natefillion) on Feb 2, 2017 at 2:38pm PST \nOmigod, his eyeballs. His motherflipping, everloving eyeballs. Comedic gold, we tell ya. We can’t stop laughing, watching him quietly look around the silliness of a disco party bus with a look of pure suspicion/confusion/mild horror. It’s basically like he’s got a thought bubble floating over his head that says “Am I in a stress dream or, oh God, IS THIS REAL LIFE?”\nTBH, it seems like Fillion has had quite a few adventures over the past few weeks and this disco party bus is just a small part of the madness.\nThere was that Sunday when he joined a motorcycle crew: Thanks to @iamvictorwebster for setting up a great Sunday ride. Perfect day. \nA photo posted by Nathan Fillion (@natefillion) on Jan 31, 2017 at 1:32pm PST \nAnd that time he “personalized” his brother’s luggage:\nMy brother said he wanted personalized luggage. Consider it done. \nA photo posted by Nathan Fillion (@natefillion) on Jan 4, 2017 at 6:14pm PST \nAlso, that time he got super friendly-like with a live scorpion:\nQuick! What's the protocol for scorpion on your foot?! \nA photo posted by Nathan Fillion (@natefillion) on Jan 2, 2017 at 10:45am PST \nAnd that time he bestied up to Deadpool Ryan Reynolds.\nI cat remember which one of us got a star on the Walk of Fame, but since no one has congratulated me, I'm going to assume it was @vancityreynolds. \nA photo posted by Nathan Fillion (@natefillion) on Dec 19, 2016 at 1:53pm PST \nNathan Fillion, living life! We can’t wait to see what hijinks and adventures this actor cooks up next! Til the next bit of mischief and mayhem, sir! We will be following along on Instagram!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:41:59.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
