PUBLISHED: 07:06, Sat, Mar 25, 2017 | UPDATED: 09:05, Sat, Mar 25, 2017 \nThere’s no question that Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge is the best phone currently available on the market. \nWith stunning looks, a gorgeous curved display and decent camera it’s very hard to find another smartphone that offers such a good user experience. \nHowever, like most things in life, the Galaxy S7 Edge isn't perfect. \nNow Samsung is about to reveal its next generation of smartphones with the impending launch of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ on March 29th. \nIf rumours are to be believed, these phones should be better than anything anyone has seen before with an upgraded display, new processor and improved camera possibly making the S8 the phone to beat in 2017. \nSamsung already has some fierce competition with LG, Huawei and Google all recently launching new devices. \nApple will also unveil a fully refreshed iPhone in September which is expected to include some ground-breaking new technology. \nSo, to get fans reaching for their wallets the S8 is going to need to be very good and these are some of the things Samsung needs to get right to help it top the award-winning S7 Edge. PH The seven mistakes Samsung needs to fix Samsung Galaxy S8 - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 Samsung Galaxy S8 looks set to be the smartphone to beat this year. Following a swathe of rumours from the Chinese supply chain, a number of graphic designers have cooked-up high-resolution renders of what the smartphone could look like, when it launches in the UK in April 2017 STEEL DRAKE • BEHANCE 1 of 36 Samsung Galaxy S8 will get a dramatic new design, with no buttons, and an edge-to-edge display FASTER ANDROID UPDATES \nGoogle released its latest Android Nougat operating system last year with it including a range of new features. \nSadly, although Nougat is slowly rolling out for the Galaxy S7 Edge, many owners are still being left without access to this new OS. \nWhat makes this issue even more frustrating for Galaxy fans is the news that Google could soon reveal another major update in May at their yearly I/O event. \nThe S8 will no doubt launch with Android Nougat installed but Samsung needs to make sure its users get access to Google’s next operating system much faster in the future. PH The S8 needs more power to make sure it takes on the competition SPEED THINGS UP \nThe Galaxy S7 Edge featured a super-fast processor but the flagship phone still failed to impress in speed tests. \nThe S7 Edge was comprehensively beaten by both the iPhone and Google’s Pixel . \nHowever, rumours suggest the S8 will include the new Snapdragon 835 processor which could bring huge improvements to this latest smartphone’s power. \nSamsung’s new flagship needs to start beating its rivals when it comes to speed and the firm will be hoping this processor boost will finally place it ahead of the iPhone and Pixel. PH The S7 Edge was accused of having problems with light bleeding from the display LIGHT BLEED FROM THE CURVED DISPLAY \nAll rumours point to the S8 having another curved display. \nSamsung makes some of the best screens in the business and this new phone will no doubt be bigger, better and brighter. \nHowever, the firm was accused of having issues with the S7 Edge with some users reporting problems with light bleeding from the edge of the display. \nSamsung responded to the claims saying that “due to the curved display, light can spread around to the curved areas of the screen. \n“This usually appears when using the device in dark places, the device is not faulty rather this is a normal phenomenon called the light leak phenomenon.” \nWith display technology getting more advanced by the day, hopefully Samsung has sorted this irritation on the S8. PH Samsung fans will be wanting fasters access to Android updates \nMAKE WIRELESS CHARGING BETTER \nThe S7 Edge already features wireless charging but there's a reason why most users still fill their phones via an old-fashioned wire. \nSamsung doesn’t include a wireless charging dock in the box and the phone still has to sit on this expensive accessory to get a refill. \nThe S8 is expected to follow the S7 Edge with wire-free charging but Samsung really needs to pop a charging dock in the box. \nRivals are also thought to be working on wireless charging without the need for a dock. \nThis would allow phones to be instantly charged the minute you walk into a room. \nDUAL CAMERA \nSamsung has been producing top-notch cameras for a while and the S7 Edge has one of the best in the business. \nHowever, although this device takes an excellent image it doesn’t have some of the features now found in rival phones. \nApple’s latest iPhone 7 Plus now includes a brilliant dual lens rear camera which not only helps provide a superior zoom but also brings DSLR depth of field to images taken with it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T16:46:26.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
