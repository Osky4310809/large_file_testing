Online reports claim that owners have successfully been able to pair the official PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One S controllers to the Shield TV models via Bluetooth.\nSee also: Best Android game controllers October 11, 2016 Both of these Android TV-based set-top boxes recently got big operating system updates to Android Nougat , though it’s unknown if that is the reason why the PlayStation and Xbox controllers can now work with the Shield TV devices. Some users are also reporting that the connections take a few extra steps. One claims that in order to use the PS3 controller, it must first be connected to the Shield TV via a USB cable. After that, you’ll supposedly have to access the device’s Settings app to find the PS3 controller with a Bluetooth connection. In theory, you should be able to use that controller wirelessly with the Shield TV.\nAnother report claims to have the procedure on how to connect the PS4’s controller to the Shield TV, and it’s a little more involved. First, this person says you have to press and hold both the PS and share buttons on the controller until it blinks. Then you will have to go into the Settings app on the Shield TV. You should see the PlayStation controller visible in the app, so it should be selected to enable the wireless Bluetooth connection. Finally, you will apparently have to press and hold the PS button again for about 10 seconds if you want to turn the connection off.\nThere’s no word yet if connecting the Xbox One S controller will need a lot of effort with the Shield TV box. There’s also no confirmation if these controllers will work with any other Android TV box, but that seems unlikely at this time. If you own either one of NVIDIA’s Shield TV devices and one of these Bluetooth-enabled controllers, let us know if you have been successful in pairing them up in the comments!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:37:27.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
