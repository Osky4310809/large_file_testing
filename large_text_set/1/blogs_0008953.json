And in a country where culinary traditions differ every few miles, McDonald's intends to make the most of this diversity.\nOn its new breakfast menu will be items like the \"masala dosa burger\" and the \"molaga podi sauce\" — traditional tastes from the south of India.\nWhile \"masala dosa\" is a pancake stuffed with potato-and-vegetable filling, \"molaga podi\" is a dry spiced powder made from mixed lentils and sesame seeds. And both will take on a new avatar when served with the good old McDonald's burger.\nThis isn't the first time though that the U.S. food retailer has innovated in India.\nIn 2009, it had introduced the McAloo Tikki burger, \"specially crafted for India,\" that was a take on a widely popular street food in this part of the world.
