It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. \nAs for Kmart, which Sears also owns, Perkins does not see much of a future. \nMillions of dollars have been funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert to keep Sears afloat but with sales fading, it is burning through cash. Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy \nAccording to a regulatory filing late Tuesday, Sears Holdings Corp. lost more than $2 billion last year. Adjusted for one-time charges, its loss was $887 million. \nSears has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says its pension agreements may prevent the spin-off of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. \n“Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” Sears said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nSears, which employs 140,000 people, announced a major restructuring plan in February with hopes of cutting costs by $1 billion through the sale of more stores, jobs cuts and brand asset sales. And it’s reconfiguring its debts to give itself more breathing room. \nBut it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it’s selling. \nSales at Sears and Kmart locations that have been open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer’s health, dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. \nThe company plans to use a big portion of the $900 million it got for Craftsman to shore up its pension plan. It will put $250 million in cash and some income from annual payments toward the plan as part of a deal with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., a federal agency that protects private pension plans. \nThe company said in its regulatory filing, however, that its agreement with the agency might stand in the way of more asset sales that would buy it more time. \nLampert has long pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging best-known brands like Kenmore and DieHard, as well as its vast holdings of land. \nThose aspirations have been scrambled by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon for years. \nThere are also new and dynamic players that have also revolutionized the market, namely Amazon.com. \nDepartment stores have been among the hardest hit by those seismic changers as Americans spend money on their homes or on dinners out, rather than on clothing. When they do buy clothes, they’re not spending much, hitting up places like T.J. Maxx for fat discounts. \nSears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major redo. \nLongtime rivals like Wal-Mart and Target are spending heavily to revitalize stores and they’re intensely focused on a new consumer that goes online before stepping into a store. Meanwhile, J.C Penney has been hitting Sears hard by bringing back major appliances to its stores. Penney, Macy’s and others have been shuttering locations as well. But real estate research firm Green Street Advisors says about 800 stores, or 20 percent of all U.S. mall anchor space, would need to close to match the inflation-adjusted sales productivity of 2006. \nSears in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations. \nIn its most recent quarter, Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., just northwest of Chicago, lost $607 million. Revenue declined to $6.05 billion from $7.3 billion during the same period the year before. \nIt was the sixth consecutive quarter of losses. \n“They’ve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,” said Perkins.
