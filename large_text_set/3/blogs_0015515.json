NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported the news and added that sources believe Hightower will re-sign with the Pats. Hightower visited both the Steelers and Jets, but NFL Network's Aditi Kinkhabwala reported Tuesday that Pittsburgh planned on pulling its offer once he left without signing a contract. Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports tweeted Sunday that other teams believed Hightower would re-sign with the Patriots for $10 million per season. The 27-year-old 2012 first-round pick out of Alabama was selected to his first Pro Bowl in 2016, as he registered 65 tackles to go with 2.5 sacks and one forced fumble. Durability has been an issue for Hightower, though, as he has appeared in all 16 games just once. He has missed at least three contests in each of the past three years. Despite that, his presence is key for a New England team that traded linebacker Jamie Collins to the Cleveland Browns during the 2016 campaign. Losing Hightower would likely elevate Kyle Van Noy into a starting role.
