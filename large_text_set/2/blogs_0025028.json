Ono and University of Washington President Ana Mari Cauce at the Emerging Cascadia Innovation Corridor Conference in Vancouver, B.C., in September 2016. (Microsoft Photo) Microsoft is donating $1 million to a new partnership between the University of Washington and the University of British Columbia called the Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative, which seeks to use data to solve urban problems shared by the two regions such as traffic and homelessness.\nIn a blog post Thursday, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote that the partnership represents the “region’s single largest university-based, industry-funded joint research project.”\nThe cooperative will bring together students, researchers and public stakeholders to solve problems in areas like transportation, housing and climate. The goal is to build on research from UW’s eScience Institute , its Data Science for Social Good summer program and UBC’s Data Science Institute . The two institutions have worked together on a couple of projects in the past.\nHere’s Smith explanation for why Microsoft got involved in the partnership:\nWe believe that this one grant will enable the two universities to complete twice as much joint research over the next two years as they have accomplished in the past 10. But our goal is bigger than this one-time gift. We see this investment as a catalyst for broader and more sustainable efforts between these two institutions that will benefit both Washington state and British Columbia, and the U.S. and Canada more broadly.\nMicrosoft has championed collaboration between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., for some time, with a goal of fostering a “Cascadia high tech corridor.” Microsoft opened a new office in Vancouver last summer that will allow it to more than double its workforce in the Canadian city three hours north of its headquarters in Redmond, Wash.\nMicrosoft was instrumental in a conference last year focused on collaboration between Seattle and Vancouver. That event included a rare joint appearance of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and its current CEO Satya Nadella and featured talks from business, education and political leaders . At the conference, representatives from the two cities discussed the possibility of a high speed train between Seattle and Vancouver, an important connection as the two cities become increasingly linked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:22:18.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
