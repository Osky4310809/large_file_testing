Instead, they say they found themselves in murky back-channel negotiations with a representative of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., a right-wing Hindu ideological group that is closely connected with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party but has no official role in governance. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “You think, ‘Wow, am I negotiating with the government or am I negotiating with an ideological movement that is fueling the government?’” said Santiago Mellado, Compassion International’s chief executive officer, in a telephone interview from the charity’s offices in Colorado Springs. He added that a briefing on the situation would be submitted to the Trump administration this week. A spokesman for India’s Ministry of Home Affairs, which oversees regulation of foreign charities, declined repeated requests for comment on the case. A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, following diplomatic protocol, said Compassion International’s partners were violating Indian law by engaging in religious activities, and that the organization declined a government offer to re-register as a religious organization, which would have allowed it to continue its work in India. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Religious charities, which make up half of the dozen top international donors to India, are watching the case closely, Mr. Mellado said. “What we hear from our friends in India is that it would be tragic if they were successful in shutting down Compassion, because that would leave other ministries very vulnerable,” Mr. Mellado said. “They are feeling like they’re next.” India has long had a law regulating the use of foreign aid, but Mr. Modi’s government has applied it in rigorous fashion, canceling the registrations of more than 10,000 nongovernmental groups, mostly small ones, in 2015. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story That summer, income tax investigators began raiding offices affiliated with Compassion International, apparently seeking evidence that funds were being used to convert Indian families. Sam Jebagnanam, a field officer based in Chennai, described the searches as “harrowing,” with staff members questioned through the night and forbidden from leaving the office, summoning a lawyer or ordering food.

Seventy-six percent of the children served by the program are Hindu, and 28 percent are Christian, he said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story At another raid, he said, a top executive was interrogated under oath at 3 a.m. “They kept asking him, ‘Why did you have a spiritual component to the program? What do you do in the area of spiritual development?’” he said. “We said we teach moral values; we do not force anyone into religion.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Compassion International executives learned early last year, from an item in an Indian newspaper, that their group had been added to the list of organizations whose transfers required prior permission by the Ministry of Home Affairs, said Stephen Oakley, Compassion’s general counsel. By summer, $600,000 in donations was stuck in an Indian bank account awaiting permission that did not come. In November, two of the group’s main affiliates — in Chennai and Kolkata — were denied authorization to use foreign funds. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In the United States, Mr. Mellado was pressing, with an increasing sense of urgency, for an opportunity to plead his case with Indian officials. But the only interlocutors they could find were through unofficial channels. In October, a Washington-based representative of the R.S.S., Shekhar Tiwari, reached out to John Prabhudoss, who heads an umbrella organization of Indian-American Christians and has a long association with Compassion International and its leaders, Mr. Prabhudoss said. Mr. Mellado said he was puzzled by the indirect outreach, but decided to give it a try. “We are trying to navigate through understanding of the dynamics on the Indian side,” he said. “We understand that the B.J.P. and the R.S.S. are tied together somehow, so it seems to us that we also need to be talking to the R.S.S.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
