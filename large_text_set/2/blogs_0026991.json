Ok https://t.co/6QT8m5SHwn\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) ID: 10608627 Announced at a Monday briefing , the proposal to circle two unidentified customers around the moon follows past audacious moves by Musk, ranging from now standard landings of rocket stages to sending an unmanned “Red Dragon” crew vehicle to Mars.\n“They have already paid a significant deposit to do a moon mission,” according to a SpaceX statement . The Federal Aviation Administration created new rules allowing for US space tourism in 2016.\nThe trip would send the two people aboard a Dragon space capsule around the moon. The capsule was developed with NASA to send astronauts to the International Space Station. The news comes as NASA contemplates a separate “EM-1” crewed moon trip for its SLS rocket in 2018.\n“By also flying privately crewed missions, which NASA has encouraged, long-term costs to the government decline and more flight reliability history is gained, benefiting both government and private missions,” SpaceX said.\nMusk founded SpaceX in 2002, with the goal of making humanity “interplanetary,” and has spoken often of his hopes of colonizing Mars.\nID: 10608409 5.\nNASA Is Studying A Manned Trip Around The Moon On A $23 Billion Rocket\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10608476 2.\nReady To Die?
