Efe Ambrose \nThe Nigerian has fallen out of favour at Celtic, after a not too impressive start under Brendan Rodgers with two high profile errors in the early games of the manager’s reign. \nAmbrose saw a deadline day move to Belgian side Standard Liege collapse, and missed out on a spot in the official list of the team’s squad for this season campaign, as they expected him to move. \nLinked with a host of teams during the January transfer window, he has reportedly turned down clubs interested in his services as he wants to remain in Scotland, where he is due for citizenship in July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T11:11:51.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
