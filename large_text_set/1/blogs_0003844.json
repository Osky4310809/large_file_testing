These hormones have a positive impact on brain chemistry and its function. \nWomen who had their baby after 24 also faired better on mental acuity tests, problem solving and verbal skills than mothers who conceived between the ages of 15 and 24. \nAh, the magic of childbirth… \nOf course, there’s no perfect “right time” to have a baby. \nYou should always consult your doctor to make sure your pregnancy is as healthy as possible and not, as I would have done, consult a witch doctor. \nJust because they have “doctor” in their name, it doesn’t mean they’ll be able to help you throughout your pregnancy without sacrificing something. \nAlso, if your parents are asking when they can expect some grandchildren, feel free to shoot them this link to quiet them up. \nUnless you’re over 35, in which case, where are my grandbabies?
