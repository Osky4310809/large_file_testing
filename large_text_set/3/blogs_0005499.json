Saxena March 7, 2017 at 8:25am Share on Facebook Share Tweet Email Email Print Advertisement - story continues below \nA routine outing to the Star Buffet & Grill in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, turned into a horrifying affair for one family Friday when two of the children began coughing up blood after downing cups of apple juice. \n“As soon as they took a sip of it, they were throwing up and there was blood you know, and all that stuff,” Richard Zaragoza, Sr., the father of one of the two children affected, told local news station WPMT . \nBoth his 10-year-old son, Richard Zaragoza, Jr., and the boy’s mother’s daughter, 4-year-old Ginaya Mendoza, had to be rushed to a nearby hospital and treated for burns to their throat and mouth. Both were still in critical condition as of Monday morning.

Three of the inspections were reportedly triggered by customer complaints. The latest inspection last month reportedly uncovered violations involving egg rolls and breaded chicken not being maintained at the required temperature. \nAccording to reports, an additional inspection was conducted Tuesday and the cups and juice were being analyzed, though the results of these various tests still remain unknown.
