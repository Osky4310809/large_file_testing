Unfortunately, the best Joell verse that I have ever heard in my entire life is on this album that y’all are never gonna hear. That’s fucked up.” \nBudden added that the project is “dark” and “depressing,” and is something even he wouldn’t want to listen to. \n“I wanted to take a few of them records … The entire group was in such a dark space when we recorded all of that music,” he said. “It’s a very dark, depressing. I don’t even wanna hear any of that shit. I don’t even rap like that. I don’t wanna rap like that. We would have to record all new verses to put that project out.” \nThe rapper later provided additional clarification on his comments about the now-buried project, via Twitter. \n“No, Joe Budden said THAT PARTICULAR SH ALBUM W 5 YEAR OLD VERSES is never coming out,” he tweeted in response to a news story about his Slaughterhouse album remarks. No, Joe Budden said THAT PARTICULAR SH ALBUM W 5 YEAR OLD VERSES is never coming out…. How u fuck up a hot take ? https://t.co/vI98Ovq5RG \n— Joe Budden (@JoeBudden) February 7, 2017 “Joe Budden says he started a podcast so ppl wouldn’t have to get unreliable news on him from unreliable sources“… Print that. \n— Joe Budden (@JoeBudden) February 7, 2017 \nBudden’s reveal serves as the heartiest update fans have received in regards to Slaughterhouse, who last dropped a studio album in 2012, given that the rest of the group has remained relatively silent when it concerns the group and any new music. \nLast month, KXNG Crooked did make the following request on Twitter: “No more Slaughterhouse questions for me in 2017 ok?” You ever made a request that you knew would be denied? No more Slaughterhouse questions for me in 2017 ok? \n— KXNG T'CHALLA (@CrookedIntriago) January 11, 2017 \nThe West Coast MC added another twist to the story as he quoted our tweet, saying the “grim news” is perhaps “alternative facts.” Could be alternative facts https://t.co/67yaKxdvak \n— KXNG T'CHALLA (@CrookedIntriago) February 7, 2017 \nListen to Joe Budden’s “I’ll Name This Podcast Later” show talking about an old Slaughterhouse album below.
