( ADEM ALTAN / AFP/Getty Images ) By John Bacon USA Today Wed., Feb. 1, 2017 The 7-year-old Syrian “peace preacher” who lit up the Internet last year took to Twitter on Wednesday to ask President Trump whether she is a terrorist. Bana Alabed’s social media posts describing life in besieged Aleppo — and calling out the West for failure to end the crisis — drew worldwide acclaim. On Wednesday, Trump defended his controversial executive order implementing travel restrictions for Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries. “Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!” he tweeted. Bana retweeted the president with the comment “Am I a terrorist?” Article Continued Below Bana has called out Trump in other tweets in recent days. After six Muslims were fatally shot Sunday at a Canadian mosque, Bana tweeted: “I don’t see Donald Trump tweeting about the terrorist attack in Quebec. What happened Mr @realdonaldtrump? Because affected are Muslims?” ▶ Syrian Bana Alabed says she began sending updates on Twitter \"for the sake of Aleppo's children, to stay alive.\" (Reuters ) During the siege of Aleppo, Bana tweeted photos and videos depicting a war-torn wasteland. Her Twitter profile —“I am 7 years old peace preacher”— drew worldwide acclaim and 366,000 followers. (Trump, for the record, has more than 23 million followers.) Syrian President Bashar Assad dismissed her Twitter account as a publicity stunt. Bana and her family were feared dead or captured by Syrian government forces when her Twitter account went offline in December. But it quickly returned, and on Dec. 13 rebels and government forces reached a truce. Within days Bana, her parents and younger brother and sister took an evacuation bus to freedom in Turkey, where Bana met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. She thanked him for his efforts to end the suffering in Aleppo.
