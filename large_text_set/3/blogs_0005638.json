Now, you can (theoretically) grab one of Nintendo’s console/handheld hybrids for yourself, if a store has them in stock. Out the box you’ll get the Switch tablet, dock, two Joy-Con controllers, and the Joy-Con grip for a more traditional controller.\nHonestly, that’s enough to get you going. The plethora of additional Switch accessories aren’t nearly as necessary as they might seem. However, they are pretty nice. So tear yourself away from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and complete your Nintendo Switch experience with these accessories.\nWe’ve divided this buying guide into four categories. One thing you won’t find on here, however, are vinyl stickers . It turns out they can damage the casing of your Switch so stay clear.\nExtra Controllers The Nintendo Switch already comes with two controllers if you hold the Joy-Con sideways. But with a console so focused on local multiplayer (like in many indie games ), the more controllers the merrier. Meanwhile, if you’re itching for a controller with a little more substance, you should probably pick up a Pro Controller.\n\nPro Controller: Purchase Here for $95.95\n\nJoy-Con: Purchase Here for $79.99\n\nCharging Grip: Purchase Here for $29.99\nMicroSD Card Each Switch features 32GB of space, and you can use about 26GB for yourself. That’s not terrible, but if you want to primarily download your games instead of buying them as cartridges, you’re going to want to expand that memory with a MicroSD card. Here are some options at various sizes and price points.\n\n256GB Samsung EVO Select Micro SDXC Memory Card: Purchase Here for $199.99\n\nSanDisk Ultra 128GB MicroSD Card: Purchase Here for $49.99\n\nSanDisk 64GB MicroSD Card: Purchase Here for $21.99\nCarrying Cases The Switch is a nice handheld with a great screen, but it’s a little too big for most pockets. So you’re going to want a case to protect it. If you’re lucky, you snagged a Zelda collector’s edition with the slick Sheikah Slate case . But these options aren’t half bad either.\n\nPDP Nintendo Switch Premium Console Case Mario Edition: Purchase Here for $29.26\n\nRDS Game Traveler Deluxe System Case: Purchase Here for $39.99\n\nHori Tough Pouch: Purchase Here for $39.99\nCables and Docks Other little accessories, from internet adapters to extra USB-C cables, will just make the Switch experience smoother. According to Nintendo , extras like additional docks and steering wheel shells are on the way.\n\nNintendo AC Adapter: Purchase Here for $29.99\n\nNintendo Switch Car Adapter: Purchase Here for $19.99\n\nUSB-C Cable: Purchase Here for $6.49\n\nNintendo Switch Ethernet Adapter: Purchase Here for $55.00\n\nJoy-Con Charging Dock: Purchase Here for $29.99\nWant to learn more?
