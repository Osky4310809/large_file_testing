The Venice Simplon Orient-Express departs from Venice, Italy, for a one-night journey to London. The charming upholstered seats, attentive stewardesses, and delectable treats make it look like a scene straight out of a Harry Potter movie. \nWe are especially loving that there's a Champagne bar on board. The Orient-Express also offers afternoon tea with sandwiches, cakes, and pastries. If you don't feel like leaving your cabin, the staff will provide a continental breakfast for you right where you are. Did we mention the scenery as well? This is a spectacular way to view the European countryside. \nCheck out the train line's site for pricing information , and watch the video below to get an idea of what this adventure is like!
