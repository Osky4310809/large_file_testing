ADVERTISEMENT \nGerrymae Pasco, local disaster risk reduction and management officer, said no word has reached their office if residents have moved out of their homes in Matampa and Guinalaban. \n“They (villagers) have not evacuated yet as the encounter is still far away but they could already hear gunshots in the distance,” Pasco said. \nShe said the provincial government has already prepared food packs, stored in a warehouse, in case the people in the two villages evacuate. \nCapt. Joe Patrick Martinez, spokesperson of the 4th Infantry Division, earlier said the military launched pursuit operations against the rebels following an encounter on Monday in Barangay Kaulayanan, Sugbongcogon, where a soldier was killed .
