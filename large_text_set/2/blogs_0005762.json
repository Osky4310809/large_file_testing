The demand is gonna be high for the product,” Forline said. “They grab whatever is on the shelves when that happens. It ain’t about what they want, it’s about what’s there.” \nFor some, it is a matter of survival. \n“Who cares about the bread and milk? As long as I’ve got this it’s okay,” said one customer. “I came in here looking for hard cider but then I found this Icelandic beer and I was like, ‘oh, that’s cool.’ We’re gonna get snowed in.” Kelly and Curley Jacobus (credit: Paul Kurtz) \n“We’re gonna sit back and drink this bottle of wine and get ready for that snowstorm to come in and just relax,” said another. “Take off work tomorrow and enjoy it. The kids will be home from school so we’ll enjoy ourselves and they’ll be out in playing in the snow enjoying themselves.” \nA win-win for everybody…..maybe.
