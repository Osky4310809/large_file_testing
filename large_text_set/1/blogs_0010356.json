King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 13 hours ago 1 \nKirk Hammett said that while Ibanez Tube Screamer has been a key component of his guitar tone since he was a kid, the iconic overdrive pedal still lacks a bit of versatility in his book. \nDiscussing his KHDK pedals series, Metallica guitarist told Bandist : \"When we first started getting ideas together, we decided, 'Let's attack the Tube Screamer and see what we can do.' \n\"Because the Tube Screamer was something I've been using ever since I could remember - since I was 15 or 16 years old. \n\"There's been a lot of times when I felt limited with the Tube Screamer. It's a great-sounding thing, but those three knobs only give you so many possibilities.\" \nPreviously chatting with UCR , Kirk explained how he wanted his KHDK Ghoul Screamer to basically be \"a Tube Screamer on steroids,\" saying: \n\"I love Tube Screamers. I've been using them pretty much all of my musical career from the first album on through the last album. I've always been wanting more performance out of them, because traditional Tube Screamers are only three knobs. Basically, I said to Dave [Karon], 'Dave, we need to take the tube screamer, improve upon the basic design - and then throw in all of this other circuitry, so we can morph the sound a little bit more, add to it, subtract from it. You know, just make it a little bit more user-friendly and a little bit more shapeable tone-wise.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T05:27:19.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
