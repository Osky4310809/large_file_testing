A notice about shift times was not included in the letter. \nPreviously ‘expedited deportation proceedings’ only could be applied to those who had been in the Unites States under 2 weeks. \nNow, instead of applying the expedited process to just those here up to two weeks, the process can be applied to those here up to two years. \nThat will go a long way to getting rid of the backlog of cases. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nMoreover, ‘catch and release’ is now dead. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nThe order called for the end of a policy known as “catch and release,” by which immigrants were released from detention and given a date to appear in court.
