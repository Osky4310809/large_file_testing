One of our pre-millennium girl crushes, Raveena Tandon, has taken to the platform amid her stylist-led wardrobe and ultra-exclusive persona. Recently, when the actress shared a BTS video with the one and only legit 90s king, Govinda, we couldn’t help but get high-key nostalgic. The two can be seen coordinating their signature tapori moves, backstage, at Zee Cine Awards. One look at them, and you are instantly compelled to groove to your favourite 90s number (probably performed by these two only). Of all the No. 1 movies that these legends have starred in, Govinda-Raveena continue to be our number ones for life. \nTake a look at this video, and you will know what we are feeling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T02:46:12.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
