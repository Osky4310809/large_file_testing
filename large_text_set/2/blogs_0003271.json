This rage is also turned against critically lauded films. Just today, IMDB users have already given I Am Not Your Negro , Raoul Peck’s Oscar-nominated documentary based on one of James Baldwin’s unfinished manuscripts, hundreds of one-star votes on the first day of its release. \nIMDB is hardly the first site to deal with the question of comments and forums. From YouTube, the scientifically confirmed cesspool of internet comments, to The Mary Sue’s own comments policy , to South Korea’s brief experiment with “real name” logins, any site with a large enough and engaged enough user base has had to weigh the value of a forum against its costs. Answers to the issue have varied. Gawker received criticism for simply ignoring the issue as it applied to Jezebel writers. Comic Book Resources completely overhauled its forum system in 2014 in response to the horrible harassment many of its female contributors had experienced. Yahoo developed an abuse-detecting algorithm for moderating the comments on its news article. Some YouTube channels, such as Feminist Frequency , had to completely turn off comments in response to overwhelming harassment. \nStill, even when a shutdown is the right call from either a moral or a user-experience perspective, it’s a pity when forums for discussion–particularly those as long-lived as IMDB’s–have to be shut down as a result of misuse. For those of you who might miss the IMDB forums when they’re gone, Gizmodo has assembled a pretty hilarious collection of greatest hits . \n(Via Variety ; image via IMDB ) \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:15:33.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
