Among the day’s announcements was the casting of Kate McKinnon in The Magic School Bus Rides Again and the addition of Patricia Clarkson and Campbell Scott to the House of Cards season five cast. It was also revealed that Travelers has been picked up for a second season, Love for a third season and Project MC2 for a third and fourth season. It was also confirmed that two new shows, Free Rein and a Castlevania series, will arrive later in 2017. \n“We aren’t in the business of creating ‘one size fits all’ programming, or building slates to fill a finite number of hours of a programming grid,” said Ted Sarandos , Chief Content Officer at Netflix. “We’re catering to a dynamic world full of people with different tastes – and as a result, no two Netflix experiences are alike – we want to have something for everyone to enjoy.” \n“The beautiful thing about the internet is that it has ushered in a new era of television centered on delivering the best possible experience to millions of people around the world — with the singular goal of connecting people with stories they’ll love,” added Todd Yellin, Vice President of Product. “Human beings have incredibly diverse and unique tastes — each person is more than the demographic group they belong to. At Netflix, we not only have a catalogue that meets the needs of these tastes and moods, but we use our technology to ensure we surface the right story to the right person at the right moment.” \nBelow, you can find teasers for more than a dozen upcoming Netflix 2017 shows.
