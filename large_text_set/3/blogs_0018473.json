50 years, with both set to name much-changed teams for the friendly at Signal Iduna Park.\nThe Three Lions are unbeaten in four matches under Gareth Southgate, although this will represent a stiff test for his men.\nTime for a reality check: Arsenal is as good as it's going to get for Mesut Ozil England beat Germany ahead of Euro 2016 in a dramatic 2-1 win in Berlin, however, Joachim Low is set to name a very different side to the one that lined up a year ago.\nLukas Podolski will captain Die Mannschaft in his 130th and final cap for his country, while other less familiar faces should get a run out.\nHere we take a look at five players who could line up for Germany, who should be watched very closely by Premier League managers.\nAntonio Rudiger Rudiger is on Chelsea’s radar (Picture: Getty) The Roma defender is thought to be a target for Chelsea boss Antonio Conte, while he has been linked to Manchester United in the past.\nCapped by Germany 11 times already, the former Stuttgart centre-back has made 17 starts in a team that have the second best defensive record in Serie A this season, conceding just 26 goals in 29 matches.\nRudiger is powerful, quick and only 24 so he will no doubt be monitored by Europe’s top clubs.\nJulian Weigl Weigl is a serious talent (Picture: TF-Images/Getty) The 21-year-old plays with experience far beyond his young years and is expected to blossom into one of the finest midfielders in Europe.\nNeat on the ball and calm in possession, with an excellent reading of the game, the Borussia Dortmund man would be a fine addition to any side with serious ambitions at the top end of the Premier League.\nWeigl is set to win just his fifth cap for his country but expect him to be a mainstay in this team for years to come.\nTimo Werner Werner could make his debut (Picture: Bongarts/Getty) Hoping to make his debut for the national team, the 21-year-old forward has been part of RB Leipzig’s remarkable rise to the upper echelons of the Bundesliga.\nWerner has banged in 14 goals in 22 league starts as Ralph Hasenhuttl’s team push towards Champions League qualification.\nLinked to Tottenham Hotspur in the past, Werner is a serious talent and one who will no doubt be on the radars of many English sides.\nJoshua Kimmich Kimmich is supposedly unhappy in Munich (Picture: Getty) The 22-year-old is believed to be unsettled at Bayern Munich under Carlo Ancelotti, making just 10 starts in the Bundesliga.\nAfter building a good rapport with Pep Guardiola, a move to Manchester City is believed to be on the cards, although other top English sides are bound to be interested.\nAn extremely versatile player who’s just as adept in midfield as he is in defence, he’d be an ideal addition to any top squad.\nJulian Brandt Brandt is one to watch (Picture: AFP/Getty) The Bayer Leverkusen attacker has been linked with Liverpool in the past and is in line to make his fifth appearance under Low.\nHe’s provided six assists in 18 starts in the Bundesliga this season, scoring twice, and he’s certainly an interesting prospect.\nMORE: England’s starting XI v Germany if based purely on form \n", "external_links": [], "published":
