Are you nuts? But, as you know, we here at Kickin’ It Headquarters are kind-hearted souls. So here’s a gentler reply to your very fine question: A.P. has Hall of Fame written all over him. He runs better with his quarterback under center, which might fit well, if the Broncos retain their basic offensive philosophy from 2016. But Peterson will be 32 years old in March and his recent history of breakdown is scary. He’s a classic set of wheels. To be admired in the garage, not run hard in the street. \nDear Smithers, er, I mean Kiz: Can you suck up any harder to Mr. Burns, er, Mr. Elway? That’s a rhetorical question of course, because there is no way you can possibly grovel any harder than you did by suggesting the Broncos make Elway their general manager for life in your worship piece masquerading as a column. \n– John, Davenport, Iowa \nKiz : I’m so old I remember when making “Simpsons” references was hip. But whatever are you trying to tell me? While Elway does bear a striking resemblance to Mr. Burns, especially when they both smile, I look nothing like Smithers. As beautiful losers go, my attitude is far better represented by Milhouse Van Houten’s mantra: “But my mom says I’m cool.” \nAnd today’s parting shot is a reminder that sometimes there is crying in football. \nI never thought you’d make me cry, Mr. Kiszla – not with your call-the-shots-like-they-are approach, or your tough and searing critiques of players, coaches and games. But you made me cry with your farewell column to coach Gary Kubiak , especially the last paragraph, where you wished him to get well and stay well. \n– Sharon, Denver native", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T04:14:19.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
