Pritzker, the billionaire heir whose father co-founded Hyatt hotels, floated the idea of switching bathrooms in the wake of President Donald Trump's executive order reversing an Obama policy that could have stripped federal funds from schools that maintain separate bathroom facilities based on sex.\n\"As a protest against Trump's rescinding protections for trans kids, everyone should use the other gender's bathroom today!\" he tweeted at 8:36 a.m.\nAs a protest against Trump's rescinding protections for trans kids, everyone should use the other gender's bathroom today! #protecttranskids \n— J.B. Pritzker (@JBPritzker) February 23, 2017 \n\nThe tweet immediately provoked criticism from liberals. Illinois State Rep. Will Guzzardi (D., Chicago), a supporter of the Obama rule, said that Pritzker's tweet was insensitive and mischaracterized the transgender bathroom and locker room debate.\n\"No disrespect @JBPritzker but it's actually about precisely *not* that. We just want to let kids use their own gender's bathroom,\" Guzzardi tweeted in response. \"Your idea suggests that we support ppl going into opposite-gender bathrooms, which plays right into transphobic rhetoric.\"\nPritzker has been called \" the other mayor of Chicago \" for his political influence and massive campaign spending on behalf of Democratic candidates such as Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel. He has close ties to the Clintons, having served as the national co-chair of Hillary Clinton's failed 2008 presidential bid, as well as the Obama administration. His sister, Penny Pritzker, served as Secretary of Commerce under President Obama from 2013 until he left office. J.B. Pritzker and his wife were two of the largest individual spenders in the 2016 election, shelling out more than $21 million to elect Clinton and other Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics .\nPritzker has now set his sights on the Illinois governor's mansion and is exploring the idea of self-funding a campaign. Rauner self-financed a $40 million campaign run in 2014, which helped him overcome steep Democratic advantages in the deep blue state.\nOther Democrats vying for the nomination were quick to criticize Pritzker's protest idea. Tom Elliot, communications director for Chicago Alderman Ameya Pawar's gubernatorial campaign, accused the billionaire of \"missing the point entirely\"\n\"Telling people to use the other gender's bathroom is missing the point entirely and a terrible idea. @JBPritzker #protecttranskids ,\" Elliot replied.\nTelling people to use the other gender's bathroom is missing the point entirely and a terrible idea. @JBPritzker #protecttranskids \n— Tom Elliott (@trelliott) February 23, 2017 \n\nOthers were more blunt in their criticisms of Pritzker's suggestion.\n@JBPritzker is this for real or just a joke\n— jack Llewellyn (@JacklleweIIyn) February 23, 2017 \n@JBPritzker You had my vote and just lost it!! #nutjob !!\n— Curt Sapp (@Sapp00J) February 23, 2017 \n@JBPritzker This plan might need a few more minutes in the oven\n— Max Temkin (@MaxTemkin) February 23, 2017 \n\n \n@JBPritzker what about girls who don't want boys in their bathrooms. Or do women's rights matter less than trans rights?\n— Storm Scotter (@StormScotter) February 23, 2017 \n\nAfter nearly four hours of critical responses, Pritzker walked back the idea saying that it was not meant t0 be taken literally.\nWas not being literal. But I think today and every day we should be standing up for all our kids. #ResistTrump \n— J.B.
