Lest the Kendrick scavenger hunt die down, though, the track ends with another hint of more music on the way. Per Pitchfork , Lamar ends the song by rapping, “Y’all got ’til April 7 to get y’all shit together,” suggesting that might be the date for his next full-length release. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T07:05:28.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
