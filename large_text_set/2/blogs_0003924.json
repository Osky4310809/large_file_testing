Wednesday, May 17, 2006. (AAP) Australian cable TV giant Foxtel is set take legal action against people who streamed their exclusive boxing broadcast live on Facebook. Source: Tweet \nA David and Goliath battle is brewing between Foxtel and people who live streamed a boxing bout between Anthony Mundine and Danny Green on Facebook. \nFoxtel says it will take legal action against people who live steamed the fight through the social media site on Friday night, with hundreds of thousands of people tuning in. \nOne of the men streaming the match, Darren Sharpe, recorded a video of a Foxtel representative calling him to tell him to cease the broadcast. \n\"I think I've got the right to do it, I paid for it,\" Mr Sharpe told Foxtel in the video. \nFoxtel said in a statement that the Facebook broadcast was stealing and legal action would be taken against the people involved. RELATED STORIES I was robbed: Anthony Mundine Anthony Mundine says he was robbed by judges who declared Danny Green the winner of their Friday night fight. Mundine's legacy on the line in Green grudge fight Forty-one-year-old Anthony Mundine is on the cusp of hanging up the gloves, but first he has a date with destiny when he faces his fiercest rival at Adelaide Oval on Friday. \n\"It's harmful to the future of boxing and live sport,\" a Foxtel spokesman said. \nThe fight was played live on Foxtel's Main Event channel for a fee of almost $60. \nAnother man who broadcast the match, Brett Hevers, is raising money through his Paypal account in case he gets sued by the cable TV company. \n\"If Foxtel decide to get their panties in a bunch it will (the money) cover all that nonsense,\" Mr Hevers wrote on Facebook. \nFoxtel has shut down Mr Hevers' account and is yet to reactivate it. \nMr Sharpe has also started a crowdfunding page to raise money for his possible legal fees. \nIt's so far raised over $2000. \nBoth men say they will donate the money to the Cancer Council if Foxtel doesn't follow through with legal action. \nThere is also talk that Facebook may have to answer to the pay TV company but that's yet to be confirmed. \nA Facebook spokesman told AAP that the company works with copyright holders to protect their data. \nThe social media giant launched its Rights Manager tool last year to help protect copyrighted videos and music from being broadcast illegally. \n\"We check every Facebook Live video stream against files in the Rights Manager reference library, and if a match surfaces, we'll interrupt that live video,\" the spokesman said. \nFacebook said publishers need to apply to use Rights Manager. \nFoxtel was asked by AAP if they use the tool but they declined to comment any further.
