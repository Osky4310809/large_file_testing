Moritz to produce. “Highlander,” aiming at turning the fantasy actioner into a franchise. Summit acquired the “Highlander” remake rights in 2008 from Davis-Panzer Prods. and assigned “Iron Man” scribes Art Marcum and Matt Holloway to pen the script. The original 1986 film was directed by Russell Mulcahy and starred Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery, Clancy Brown and Roxanne Hart in a tale of the immortal Scottish swordsman. “There can only be one” became the franchise’s catchphrase with four sequels and three TV spinoffs. \nLongtime “Highlander” producer Peter Davis is also producing along with Moritz. \nStahelski was a stuntman who co-created the stunt company 87eleven with David Leitch. Stahelski worked on the stunts for “The Hunger Games,” “The Wolverine” and “Iron Man 2.” \nHe’s also worked as a second unit director on “Captain America: Civil War,” “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,” and “Escape Plan.” He and Leitch — who will direct Ryan Reynolds in “Deadpool 2”— made their directorial debut on “John Wick.” \nStehelski recently directed “John Wick: Chapter 2,” due out from Lionsgate on Feb. 2. He is repped by WME and by Gang, Tyre, Ramer & Brown.
