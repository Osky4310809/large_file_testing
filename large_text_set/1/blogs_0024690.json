I got the VIP version of Psychomania off of there Juggalo Invasion Tour, Are You Insane Like Me? when they rereleased The Green Book, Nothing To You off of the from The VIP \"exclusive\" MNE 2016 Fall Sampler, and Kill Somebody when I preordered this album off of their official store. Based on the 1/4 of the album I've already heard, this is going to be a dope album. Don't sleep on it, get it now! Whoop Whoop!
