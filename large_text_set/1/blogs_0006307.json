The complaint also alleges that the four worked long hours without meal and rest breaks. \nAt Tustin Nail Spa, the plaintiffs were allegedly compensated based on a commission system where they received about 60 percent of what customers paid for nail services, regardless of the number of hours they worked. Their pay was further deducted for using business supplies, such as spa chairs, and absorbed discounts offered to customers, John Trang, an attorney at Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Los Angeles representing the plaintiffs, told NBC News. \n\"Even though we smiled and seemed happy in front of customers, the truth was that we were quietly suffering,\" Hoang, a plaintiff who had worked at Tustin Nail Spa for nearly a decade, said in a statement . \"We did not fight back because we were grateful to have jobs as refugees who do not speak a lot of English, and we wanted to provide for our family and children.\" Post by NBC News . \nIn 2013, Tustin Nail Spa was investigated by the State Labor commissioner for labor law violations, which resulted in citations of $28,000. Subsequently, the business created falsified documents to demonstrate that employees were working just 40 hours per week, Trang said. Fake paychecks were then created based off of the fake hours, though workers were actually compensated based on the number of customers they served, he added. \"Even though we smiled and seemed happy in front of customers, the truth was that we were quietly suffering.\" \nThe plaintiffs are currently seeking damages from three sets of owners who operated the nail salon at different times from 2005 to 2015. Tustin Nail Spa is currently owned by a fourth set of owners that Trang said they are moving to include in the lawsuit. \n\"We believe there's some coordination among the defendants and lawyers. It makes the lawsuit more complicated because you have more people. Going after one wouldn't be helpful, you have to go after all of them,\" Trang said, arguing the business was sold multiple times to avoid liability. \nFederico Sayre, the attorney representing the third owners, denied the claim that his client had any association with the previous owners. \n\"All that ended up happening is [my client] got sued because she became the nail salon owner, so they sued her for alleged wrongdoing by the previous owners, which she clearly could've had nothing to do with because she wasn't the owner at the time,\" he told NBC News. \nRELATED: New York Nail Salons Ordered to Pay $2 Million in Unpaid Wages, Damages \nUnder the ownership of Sayre's client, Michelle Ta, there was discussion of changing employees to independent contractors. However, Sayre said his client maintained them as employees after the plaintiffs expressed opposition to it. Three of the workers came to the salon demonstrating, and Sayre said his client had to call the police to have them removed.
