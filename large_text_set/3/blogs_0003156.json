Teicher Mar. 6, 2017 Mar. 6, 2017 The America portrayed in Peter van Agtmael’s sweeping new book is a country unable or unwilling, to reckon with its seemingly limitless appetite for destruction. Perhaps it’s an inevitable perspective for someone who has spent much of his career as a conflict photographer in Iraq and Afghanistan, close to the most expansive manifestations of that violent tendency. Mr. van Agtmael , a member of Magnum, looked at those wars through the experiences of soldiers in battle and, later, back home in his 2014 book, “Disco Night Sept 11.” In “Buzzing at the Sill,” which Kehrer Verlag published this month, the wars form the largely unseen psychological and emotional backdrop to a deeply personal examination of the country’s excesses and injustices. “The fact is my vision of America is in some degree sharpened and to some degree clouded by my experiences of America at war,” Mr. van Agtmael said. “Those experiences are going to color my perceptions throughout my life. They force me to dig under the cushions a bit, dig into the cracks and into the margins to find my own reality.” Photo USA. Manhattan, New York. 2010.

The result is a portrait of a people living in the brutal shadow of racism, killings and economic inequity. “On the one hand, I’m searching for subjects that are emblematic or symbolic, but when I arrive in those situations, I don’t know what will be revealed through the photographs,” he said. “That’s the mystery of photography, in a way. That’s also what I love about photography.” Mr. van Agtmael admits that his worldview is characterized by a “deep wariness of humanity” rooted in early brushes with juvenile cruelty. His skepticism, as a result, colors even the most outwardly joyful facets of American leisure, including the Kentucky Derby and the Fourth of July. “We have enough artificial narratives that we’re exposed to all the time,” he said. “I don’t have a particular desire to contribute to the fantasy world.” That’s why for a for colorful photo of a balloon dart game at CityFair in Portland, Ore., Mr. van Agtmael wrote, “The attraction is of course fixed — in fact, it is known as one of the most persistently rigged games at a fair.” Mr. van Agtmael grew up, like many boys, avidly collecting model soldiers, airplanes and military vehicles. The obsession didn’t wane with time, and after studying history at Yale, he wrote, the “desire to photograph war became too strong to ignore.” He took his first assignment covering Iraq in 2006, and he returned to combat zones in the region for much of the next decade, despite a heavy toll on his psyche.

Detroit. 2012. Credit Peter van Agtmael/Magnum Photos Mr. van Agtmael has since taken a conscious step back from the turbulence. Last year, he said, was the first in a decade in which he didn’t cover a conflict. But the impact of those experiences sometimes comes to the fore in the book, as in a 2016 photo of the Nigerian photographer TY Bello playing with her sons. Arms outstretched, her cloaked figure brought immediately to Mr. van Agtmael’s mind the iconic image of the tortured Abu Ghraib prisoner Ali Shallal al-Qaisi. “My memories of traumatic experiences come to me less and less, but they are always defined by their sudden invasiveness into otherwise idyllic settings,” Mr. van Agtmael wrote. For the majority of Mr. van Agtmael’s images, his captions, which are included in a separate booklet, provide historical context or an anecdote about how the image was made. But Mr. van Agtmael occasionally finds that words aren’t necessary, as in the photo of a girl outside a laundromat in Gainesville, Fla. Bathed in golden light, her face points skyward and her eyes are closed — a simple gesture, it seems, of gratitude for the sunshine. “The way I see my role as a photographer and documentarian isn’t necessarily to reflect too much on beauty for beauty’s sake,” Mr. van Agtmael said. “But I do it from time to time, of course.” Follow @ teicherj and @ nytimesphoto on Twitter.
