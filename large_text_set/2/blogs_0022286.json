(ABC Rural: Lydia Burton) \nBut, Mr Phelps said an International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists would also help first world countries share knowledge and resources with developing nations. \n\"It is really important for developing nations to have a spotlight on them to have a greater focus from the United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organisation and the The World Bank,\" he said. \n\"It does focus the efforts of the UN into developing nations and it does actually provide extra funding, so that is really important in that respect. \n\"It can also help us [Australia] focus our overseas aid efforts and focus our expertise. \n\"There are so many Australians being innovative in rangeland environments that this could give us that extra push to help some of the developing nations. \n\"But it can also help shine the spotlight on our own rangelands and pastoralists, on outback Australia and our graziers and it can help shine the spotlight on us for tourism. \n\"Also I guess shine the spotlight on the outback for the innovation and the contribution we can make to the international community.\" \nMr Phelps said he believed there was an excellent chance of the International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists going ahead, but said it was just a matter of when. \n\"We are all so confident it is such a great idea and so important to Australia that the Australian Government, our State and Territory Governments and local governments will all get in behind the cause as well and basically say to the UN 'Hey, this is a great idea. Let's do it',\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:49:12.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
