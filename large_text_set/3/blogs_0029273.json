Mustapha, who admitted being a member of the dreaded sect, told journalists in Maiduguri during a parade by the Borno State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ibrahim Abdullahi, that he participated in a series of onslaughts against villagers by the terror group. “In all the attacks, all I do is to kill persons,” he told journalists. Mustapha said he was arrested when he was sent to spy on Maiduguri by the leaders of the Boko Haram sect. He said he belonged to the Mamman Nur-led faction of the group and was forced to join the deadly sect three years ago, when the terrorists attacked his village in Monguno and left with many boys. He added, “I received extensive training and skills on how to handle assault weapons, especially AK 47 rifles, general purpose machine gun, anti-aircraft gun, rocket-propelled grenade, among others, which I operate for the attack on villagers. “I was forced to join the Boko Haram sect about three years ago when Boko Haram insurgents came to our village and forcefully took many of us away. We were kept in the bush camp near Kala Balge and from there we carried out various operations, during which I personally killed 18 persons.” Mustapha revealed that his last expedition was to sneak into Maiduguri to spy for his group, as he normally did in the eve of any attack. “I resolved to quit the group on my way to Maiduguri where I was directed to go gather intelligence report on when the troops and civilian JTF guarding the entrance of the city will normally relax security surveillance. “I was tired of killing people against my wish. So, I told my two other colleagues with whom we were asked to go on a spying mission that we should abandon the mission and run. Luck ran out on me when I entered into one IDPs camp to look for my parents. “Unfortunately, some of the people in the camp were able to recognise me as member of the sect and quickly alerted the security operatives guarding the camp. So, that was how I was arrested.” Meanwhile, the Commandant of the NSCDC in Borno State, Mr. Ibrahim Abdullahi, said suspected Boko Haram members had invaded Konduga Local Government Area and abducted four women and six youths. Abdullahi told the News Agency of Nigeria in Maiduguri on Tuesday that the insurgents had also invaded Mittiri, Akalli and Arribbari villages in the same Konduga Local Government Area. “Our intelligence report had indicated that the insurgents are now operating in Dalla Fatimiri on about 10 motorcycles. “Our men of the Anti-vandalism and Intelligence Unit of the command on Friday reported the kidnapping of four youths in Kalari village in Konduga Local Government Area,” he said. He explained that the remnants of the insurgents were desperately recruiting more youths to sustain their fight in the state, having been effectively decimated and degraded by the Nigerian military.
