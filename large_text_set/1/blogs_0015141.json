Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images \nSanger and other journalists pleaded for leniency for Cartwright, a retired four star Marine general who was vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2007 to 2011, arguing that he was trying to talk the Times out of publishing the report — not leaking sensitive information. \nCartwright later plead guilty to making false statements during a federal investigation. \nIn all, Obama granted 209 commutations and 64 pardons on Tuesday. \nAlso receiving a pardon was baseball of Hall of Famer Willie McCovey , who is 1996 was fined and given two years' probation for failing to pay taxes on income he earned from 1988 to 1990 from selling sports memorabilia and signing autographs.

He had been convicted of killing two taxicab drivers in 1988 while he was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. He has been on death row for more than 27 years. \nPuerto Rican nationalist Oscar Lopez , who was serving 55 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the U.S. government and an additional 15 years for conspiring to escape from Leavenworth federal prison, had his sentence commuted.
