Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images News\nFour-time major champion Rory McIlroy played golf with Donald Trump at Trump International, Florida, on Sunday and has revealed that the president of the United States returned a score of “around 80.”\nA photograph of Trump and McIlroy with Clear Sports CEO Garry Singer and former Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill went viral recently but the four-ball that took to the field consisted of Trump, world No.3 Rory Mac, ISM agent Nick Mullen, and Trump friend Rich Levine.\nAccording to No Laying Up , McIlroy claimed he was not informed of the grouping until Saturday night and, though a rib injury had been delaying his plans to return to a course, he could not turn Trump's invitation down.\nBig battle today at Trump International with Clear CEO Garry Singer @McIlroyRory @PaulONeillYES @realDonaldTrump Drain the putt... pic.twitter.com/AZJqEVtlBT\n— ClearSports (@ClearSportsLLC) February 19, 2017 McIlroy said: \"[Trump] probably shot around 80.
