In short, the court agreed that Vihaan’s business legitimate.\nMichael Ferreira\nIndia’s direct selling market – for years – has suffered because of iceberg arguments, what’s on surface is not the reality. And what’s not seen has remained unseen. But it’s changing fast.\nFor thousands in India’s direct selling market, the court decision was the second, solid move to accord stature to the much-maligned market, the first being guidelines on direct selling issued last September by the consumer affairs ministry that released its much-awaited paper “The Model Framework for Guidelines on Direct Selling”.\nInterestingly, one of the biggest challenges for the Indian direct selling industry is a lack of an express regulatory framework, as a result, often direct selling companies are compared to pyramid schemes under the Prize, Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act. Hopefully, various state governments will now start implementing the 2016 guidelines which would help distinguish between genuine and malicious direct selling schemes and protect legitimate concerns of consumers and companies.\nGuidelines are important, ostensibly because the Direct selling industry in India has grown in to become a part of the ‘billion-dollar club’ of the global direct selling industry. The Indian Direct Selling Industry has generated approximately $1.18 billion in revenues in 2015 and ranks among the top 25 countries in the world. In India, an estimated 40 lakh people are involved in this industry.\nThis billion-dollar industry has been growing in India despite various issues ranging from a widely misconstrued business model, MNCs such as Amway, QNet and Klink have been charged with multiple violations which are now being proved baseless, mainly due to the regulatory vacuum.\nBut now, the double move, one by the legislature and the other by the judiciary will clear the air for once and all. It was long due because it is a well-established fact globally that direct selling industry generates employment and promotes entrepreneurship. In several countries, it has also boosted the manufacturing sectors and SMEs and MSMEs, perfectly in sync with the government’s agenda of Start-up India, Stand-up India and Make in India.\nThe direct selling industry has the potential to touch Rs 64,500 crore in turnover by 2025, from a Rs 7,200 crore size in 2014, says a report by industry body Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and consulting firm KPMG. In India, direct selling grew by 11 percent in current value terms in 2016. In India, direct selling market is around 0.08 per cent of the GDP as of 2014. According to KPMG, this number could grow to 18 million direct sellers by 2025. Women form a significant chunk of direct sellers, and from 3.4 million women (2014), their numbers could touch 10.6 million by 2025, claimed KPMC.\nThe Supreme Court has ordered a stay on all further proceedings against direct selling company QNet and its franchisee Vihaan Direct Selling Private Limited. If the guidelines were issued by the ministry earlier, crucial business and cash lost could have been averted, India’s direct selling companies could have avoided their losses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:10:06.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
