In the process, Rawat government has foregrounded a false argument. One which says that development can happen only on the heels of environmental degradation. On the contrary, environmental protection is intrinsic to economic development. It is no one’s case that Uttarakhand’s government should not improve connectivity in the state. But not at the cost of degrading an iconic national park which contributes to economic activity generated by tourism.\nDevelopment needs to be viewed holistically. The weight of evidence is in favour of being mindful of the environment. It is precisely this approach which has influenced the Modi government’s commitment to mitigating the impact of climate change by shifting India’s energy mix in favour of renewables. In a similar vein, 14th Finance Commission used a state’s forest cover as a criterion for resource transfer to states and the iconic Corbett Park, which is India’s oldest national park, served Uttarakhand well. The lesson here is that environmental mindfulness should be intrinsic to development policy.\nVehicular traffic through the core area of Corbett National Park will have an adverse impact on both flora and fauna. Eventually, it will take a toll on the park. Given the economic resources generated by the park for the state, it is in the state’s long-term interest to preserve the park from damage. It is also important to remember forests act as carbon storehouses and mitigate local floods. Uttarakhand’s economic devastation on the heels of 2013 floods should be motivation enough to preserve what is left of its forests. Environmental protection has a positive economic spinoff and the Rawat government should find an alternative route.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:03:54.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
