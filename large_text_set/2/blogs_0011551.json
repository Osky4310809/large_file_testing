It was like a moth to a flame. There was so much color and excitement and energy — it was easy to just show up with my camera and document the explosion of decadence every night. Drag queens and sexy people partying with no rules. It was also great networking, and I soon got to know everyone in NYC.\nID: 10538745 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images A group of club kids enjoy a bubble bath set up at the Limelight, 1995.\nID: 10537741 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / WireImage Partygoers cavort at Club USA, 1993.\nID: 10543792 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images Two clubgoers show off their colorful costumes at Club USA, 1993.\nID: 10537711 It was everything you have seen and can imagine. From drug use to sex everywhere, I saw it all. Everyone was less guarded. It was truly about having fun. No one was doing selfies and pretending. New York was affordable, and all walks of life partied together in the clubs. Artists and bankers and celebs and drag queens and musicians and poets. The energy was flowing. There was always the unexpected. Like the time a woman climbed up on one of the go go dancer platforms and began lactating on the crowd of bridge and tunnel kids on the dance floor. They or I never saw anything like it.\nID: 10538955 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images Leonardo DiCaprio and Dennis Hopper celebrate at the Red Rock West party at Club USA, 1994.\nID: 10537771 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / WireImage Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen attend a press stop at Planet Hollywood, 1993.\nID: 10537798 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images Joan Rivers poses with a pair of shirtless men at the Gossip party at Club USA, 1993.\nID: 10537822 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / WireImage Left: Mark Wahlberg flips off the camera at Club USA, 1993.

The club kids dressed up and made the party. It was much more exciting. There were VIP rooms, but the whole bottle service thing did not hit yet. It was much more about how you dressed and if you were fun or not than the money. If you were in the circle, you never paid for admission or drinks. I don’t think that exists today.\nID: 10538826 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images Crowds dance at a party at Club Expo, 1995.\nID: 10537950 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / WireImage Mary J.

I was also on call, so if a celebrity showed up at 3 a.m., they would beep me and I would grab my camera and run over there. One case was in 1992 — my beeper went off at at some ungodly hour. I threw on some clothes and ran down to Club USA to find Julia Roberts on the dance floor with her stylist. I walked up and took a few shots and her bodyguard ask me to stop. I did, but the club’s publicist said, “You got to take more, make sure you got it!”\nSo I went out and shot another, at which point the bodyguard got pissed off and physically pushed me off of the dance floor. The publicist was still not happy, so I went up to the balcony and put on my zoom lens. I shot a couple of more frames and the bodyguard spotted me and immediately started running up to get me. At the same time Julia saw me and was shaking he finger at me and mouthing, “Don’t take one more FUCKING picture.” I escaped through a side door and out of the club.\nID: 10538885 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images Partygoers attend a New Year’s party at Webster Hall, 1993.\nID: 10537939 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images A group of partygoers dance at the Palladium, 1995.\nID: 10537694 Today, everyone has a camera on their phone and can document themselves for social media, which in turn makes people more image-conscious. I don’t know if it’s better or worse; it’s just different. Back then, photography was an art and a science and it felt more special to me. I would show up with some prints from the night before and it was magical. The club kids would gather around, and I felt like I was doing something different and exciting. I got treated like a god because I had a camera and knew how to use it. Now everyone is their own photographer.\nID: 10538851 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / WireImage The band Sky Cries Mary performs at Wetlands, 1994.\nID: 10537907 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images Club kids Michael Alig, Richie Rich, Nina Hagen, Sophia Lamar, and Jenny Talia pose for a portrait at Tunnel Club, 1993.\nID: 10537840 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images The New Power Generation, the backup band for the singer Prince, pose for a photo in 1993.\nID: 10537783 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images Uma Thurman is surprised at the Search and Destroy wrap party at Z Bar, 1994.\nID: 10538016 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images Peter Dinklage sings with the band Whizzy at Columbia University, 1994.\nID: 10537920 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images A young man stage dives into the audience at an unidentified concert venue, 1993.\nID: 10537969 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images Rosie Perez and Yo Yo celebrate at Palladium, 1993.\nID: 10537915 View this image ›\nSteve Eichner / Getty Images François Nars and RuPaul share a moment at Laura Belle, 1995.\nID: 10537884 Right now, I’m in the process of putting together a layout for a book of this work entitled Club Kids — the concept would be all of my best photographs from those days with Quote: s from everyone involved — security people, bartenders, celebs, designers, artists, and the club kids themselves.
