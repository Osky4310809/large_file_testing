Farley Tweet Share Chrissy Teigen, the woman known best for getting witty on Twitter and being married to John Legend, attended the Academy Awards last night — barely. The supermodel and mother of one was caught not once but twice a-slumbering in the audience. Her head on husband John Legend's shoulder, Teigen looked dead to the world, and Twitter is having a grand time with the proof. The first time, it seemed like the 31-year-old slept through Casey Affleck's acceptance speech. While Affleck spoke, a camera caught Teigen snoozing. Her nap seemed to toss shade at the Oscar winner's moment. (She wasn't alone — other celebs also didn't look too enthused during the speech.) Later, she was caught again, but this time her slumber didn't seem so shady. It just seemed innocent, almost as if she were a woman forced to attend some three hour-long awards show with her husband. Had it been anyone else, all this shut-eye might have incited internet ire. But in the eyes of Twitter, Teigen can do no wrong. When she was spotted with her eyes closed, Twitter was delighted. This just adds to Teigen's aw-gee-I'm-normal allure. Sleeping? During an awards show? Why, that's exactly what the rest of us would do. The first sighting: — Travon Free (@Travon) February 27, 2017 I think my favorite part of the Oscars so far has been Chrissy Teigen sleeping on John.
