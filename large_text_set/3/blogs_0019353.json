Bush grew worse. \nManafort pitched the plans to Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. \nManafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work. \n\"We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success,\" Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, \"will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government.\" Read Full Article \nHorwitz said this afternoon that Manafort has long stated that he only worked in Eastern Europe as an adviser to a Ukrainian political party. But Horwitz said Deripaska is \"extremely close\" to Putin and traveled regularly with him. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said yesterday that Manafort had a \"limited role\" in the campaign, while the White House said the new reporting is only on older work done by Manafort. \nHorwitz said the new report shows Manafort's willingness to work on behalf of Putin and advance the Kremlin's interests. \n\"He was a gun for hire that was sort of willing to do this sort of work and had those contacts,\" he said, adding that Manafort served as Trump's campaign chairman during a key five-month period that included the RNC. \nWatch the full discussion above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:06:31.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
