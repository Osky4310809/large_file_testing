First, we should focus on the league game against Westerlo on Sunday, but now we have to recover and enjoy this victory.\" \nPolice to investigate PSG clashes \nAnd Genk midfielder Thomas Buffel also cited Barca's incredible performance as a warning to his side as they look to get the job done on home turf. \n\"Have we already qualified? No,\" he added. \"We have seen the spectacle [of the Barca game] and we must remain humble.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T08:57:06.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
