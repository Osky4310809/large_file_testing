When she went into labor two days later, Austin decided to remain with her at the hospital.\n\"I thought, 'I'm just going to do what I feel is right for my family,' and that's it,\" he told the Post.\nAt around 1 a.m. on New Year's Day, Austin got a text message from his employer, reading, \"As of now, you are terminated.\"\n\"I looked at it and I was like, 'Wow. OK, cool,' and that was about it for me,\" said Austin of his reaction.\nHe added that he was focused on the birth of his son Caiman, the first baby to be born in Concord in 2017.\nThe 30-year-old did not have to wait long until support for his decision poured in. Several organizations gave Austin a job offer, among them the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.\n\"I know how valuable family time is, and if you’re a union member we incorporate that, we understand that, and we don’t penalize you for that,\" said Denis Beaudoin, who encouraged Austin to apply for the position, according to the Concord Monitor.\n\"That's the one I'm going to pursue,\" Austin told the Post.\nComplete strangers also helped out Austin and his family. Sahra Persechino set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds for Austin to help cover the unexpected loss of income.\n\"I don’t think they should have to be worrying about financial issues right now; it should be a joyful time for them,” Persechino said. “Anything we can do to make this even more joyous is worth it,\" she said.\nNew Hampshire is an at will employment state, meaning employers and employees can usually terminate an employment contract at any time.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:10:46.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
