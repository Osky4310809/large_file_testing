Jerry Brown and Democratic leaders of the state Legislature unveiled a plan Wednesday to raise $52 billion over the next decade to pay for a massive program of rebuilding California’s highways and bridges and improving public transit.\nThe plan would be paid for with a combination of revenue measures: an increase in the state’s excise tax on gasoline from 28 cents to 40 cents a gallon, increased vehicle registration fees and a new $100 annual charge on emission-free vehicles.\n“Let’s be clear — our roads suck,” said Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Los Angeles Democrat, one of those who unveiled the plan during a media event on the steps of the State Capitol. “Our bridges are crumbling. Traffic takes time away from our families. … Potholes take money out of our wallets. Delays cost businesses money and raise prices for consumers.”\nBrown argued the revenue plan, to be backed up by a state constitutional amendment that would require proceeds from revenue measures to be spent on transportation projects, would ensure that the state takes care of its infrastructure needs on a pay-as-you-go basis. Backers say the plan would cost most drivers less than $10 a month.\nThe plan would require a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate — a goal that’s within reach for Democrats, who hold supermajorities in both houses. \nBut the proposal, coming after years of party-line disagreement over how much the state ought to spend to pay for its estimated $59 billion in deferred highway infrastructure maintenance and how the investment should be paid for, drew an immediate “no” vote from Republicans in the Legislature.\nAs they have throughout years of negotiations, GOP legislators said that California drivers are paying high gasoline taxes and that the state brings in enough revenue to pay for needed infrastructure fixes and upgrades without increasing levies. \n“Our state has become increasingly unaffordable for ordinary Californians,” a joint statement from GOP lawmakers “We can fix our roads and bridges by simply ensuring that the billions of dollars that drivers are already paying in transportation fees and taxes are actually used for transportation purposes, rather than being swept into the state’s General Fund. We strongly urge the Legislature to reject this historic tax hike in favor of our responsible plan that fixes our roads without raising taxes and fees.”\nCalifornia’s gasoline taxes — which in addition to the current 27.8 cent per gallon excise tax, 2.25 percent state sales tax and an 18.4 cent per gallon federal excise tax — currently total 56.53 cents per gallon. That’s the fifth-highest rate in the country, after Pennsylvania, New York, Washington state and Michigan. \nHowever, part of the pinch on the state’s transportation finances is due to a large decline in the state excise tax — from 39.5 cents in 2013-14 to the current 27.8 cents. \nBrown dismissed criticism of the plan. \n“The only objection is political,” he said. “And I think that political objection is pretty weak.” \nHe said “the vast majority” of the $52 billion raised in the plan would go to existing facilities — and he compared the situation to that of a homeowner. \n\n“What do I say to someone whose roof is leaking?” Brown asked. “Just let it ruin the rug? Let it ruin your nice chairs? No! You gotta fix it. This is life. As grown-ups, we know that things we build wear out and you gotta fix ’em.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:39:20.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
