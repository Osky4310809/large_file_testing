Even the prices have been left alone, and start at RM61,950 for the base Comfort variant, rising up to RM67,950 for the Premium variant and RM74,950 for the Elite . All prices are on-the-road inclusive of insurance and a seven-year, unlimited-mileage warranty. \nThose prices are for models equipped with the six-speed automated manual transmission (AMT), the sole gearbox offering from now on; the five-speed manual has been dropped for 2017. The AMT is mated to a 1.5 litre naturally-aspirated VVT MPI four-cylinder petrol engine producing 105 hp at 6,000 rpm and 138 Nm of torque at 4,200 rpm, all sent to the front wheels. \nStandard kit on the Comfort variant includes reflector halogen headlights, fog lights, roof rails, 16-inch alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel, a digital speedometer and trip computer, fabric seats, reverse sensors and a touchscreen DVD infotainment system. Safety-wise, all models come with ABS with EBD and brake assist, stability control and hill start assist. \nThe Premium model adds leather seats, navigation, a reverse camera, a Battery Alert Sensor (BAS) and a rear-view mirror with integrated SmartTAG reader. Meanwhile, the Elite tacks on projector halogen headlights with LED positioning lights, LED daytime running lights, a centre front armrest, a digital video recorder (i.e. a dash cam) and window tint. After trying to pursue a career in product design, Jonathan Lee decided to make the sideways jump into the world of car journalism instead. He therefore appreciates the aesthetic appeal of a car, but for him, the driving experience is still second to none.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T12:19:20.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
