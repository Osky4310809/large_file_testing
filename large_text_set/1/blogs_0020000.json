By Jeff Bleiler | jbleiler@mlive.com comments \nJACKSON – Three Jackson-area high school bowlers made bids for 300 games within a 48-hour period, and each came up just short. Korey Reichard had nine strikes in a row for a 278 on Monday at Airport Lanes. (MLive file) \nFirst, on Monday during a match against Manchester at Airport Lanes, Vandercook Lake sophomore Korey Reichard rolled nine straight strikes in the second team game before a stoned 9-pin ended his bid for perfection. \nReichard covered the spare and left a single pin on his fill ball for a 278 to add to his 237 game in the first team game for a 515 series. \nReichard is widely known for being the youngest bowler to roll a sanctioned 800 series at 10 years old. He is the Jackson area’s defending Bowler of the Year and moved his average to 236 on the season with the 515 series. Vandercook Lake beat Manchester 29-1 and then beat East Jackson 27-3 on Wednesday to improve to 10-0. \nFast forward to Wednesday, and the Jackson team gave the crowd a couple chances to cheer a perfect game. First was sophomore Keegan Bradley , who opened the first game of the Vikings’ match against East Lansing with the first eight strikes in a row. \nHis ninth attempt was solid but rung a 10-pin, which he converted and then struck out for 279. He added a 215 the second game for a 494 series as Jackson rolled to a 29-1 victory to improve to 5-2. \nOn the pair to Bradley’s left was the Jackson girls team, the anchor of which was closer to a 300 than either Reichard or Bradley. Senior Kaylee Collier punched the first 10 strikes of the second game before the second ball of the 10th frame leaked high and left a 4-pin. She missed the spare but her 288 combined with a 202 start gave her 490 on the day. \nJackson beat East Lansing 30-0 to stay unbeaten at 7-0. Collier has been hot of late, rolling a 277 in the Mason College Prep Tournament on Sunday and a tournament-best 655 series . She became the youngest girl bowler in the Greater Jackson USBC to roll a 300 game when she did so at age 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T03:42:07.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
