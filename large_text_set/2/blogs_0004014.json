His electrifying speed and endless stamina allowed him to score and create goals at one end while preventing them at the other. As Vicente del Bosque once put it: \"Roberto Carlos can cover the entire wing all on his own.\" \nHis successor Marcelo now plays with the same attacking adventure, and the decision to liberate Roberto Carlos was influential in a wider context too. Gradually, the game began moving away from the old, conservative approach. From Ashley Cole at Arsenal to Dani Alves at Barcelona, attacking full-backs became increasingly prominent among Europe's elite. Right-back Dani Alves was a key figure for Pep Guardiola's Barcelona \nIt is only in the last few years, however, that the evolution has truly accelerated in England. This season, Antonio Conte's 3-4-3 has placed extra emphasis on Marcos Alonso and Victor Moses at Chelsea, Danny Rose and Kyle Walker have been among the Premier League's standout performers at Tottenham, while Hector Bellerin's attacking threat has marked him out as the world's best young player in his position at Arsenal. \nFull-backs can be seen bursting into the final third up and down the country, and the stats highlight the shift in emphasis. As recently as 2011/12, there were only five full-backs in the Premier League who created 20 or more scoring chances. Since then, the number has shot up. In 2015/16, there were 21. This season, the number already stands at 12. The number of full-backs creating 20 or more chances per season has shot up \nPatrick van Aanholt is among them. His £14m move from Sunderland to Crystal Palace shows that attacking full-backs are even highly valued in a relegation battle. Indeed, when asked about the Dutchman's arrival at Selhurst Park, it was notable that Sam Allardyce immediately referenced the four goals and three assists that helped Sunderland avoid the drop last season. \nPriorities have changed. Instead of using traditional wingers who hug the touchlines, many teams now look to their full-backs to provide the width. It started with Capello at Madrid when he instructed Raúl to drift inside from his starting position on the left in order to free up space for Roberto Carlos to bomb into. What was once an unusual tactic is now common place. Chelsea's Marcos Alonso scored his fourth goal of the season against Arsenal \n\"Now we see that teams everywhere play very compact in order to create space for the full-backs to go forward,\" says Roberto Carlos. \"Defensive qualities are still important, but now you need power and technique in that position. You need to defend andattack.\" \nIf Roberto Carlos was the archetypal attacking full-back, then Gary Neville typified the different breed. Neville could deliver dangerous crosses on the overlap, but his defining strengths were not technical or physical. Above all, he was an intelligent, disciplined and dedicated defender. In 19 seasons at Manchester United, he won more titles than he scored goals. \nFull-backs in Neville's image are few and far between nowadays, and with the emphasis changing and coaching becoming more technically-focused, they will only become rarer in the years ahead. It's something the Sky Sports pundit touched on in a fascinating column for the Daily Telegraph in October 2014. Gary Neville won eight Premier League titles at Manchester United \n\"With old school coaches, 60-70 per cent of your training ground work would be defensive,\" Neville wrote. \"Where your foot would be, the position of your hips, how often you would have to turn your head to avoid ball-watching. I compare it to a musician stripping a song back to its elements. I started off with a high defensive base. Players now are starting out with a high technical grounding and learn the defending later.\" Arsenal vs Hull City", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:35:54.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
