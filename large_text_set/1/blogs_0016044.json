The Claymores recruited ex-Scotland rugby union full-back Gavin Hastings for a season in 1996 \nThe Claymores were initially based at Murrayfield, before later alternating their games between the capital and Hampden Park. Officials at both venues would be keen to stage the sport again. \nA spokesman for the national football stadium told BBC Scotland: \"Hampden Park was the spiritual home for the successful Scottish Claymores...and a logical choice should the NFL seek to expand their horizons in the future.\" \nAnd the Scottish Rugby Union said: \"We are very open to welcoming NFL matches to BT Murrayfield. We have nothing planned, but always welcome discussions.\" Media playback is not supported on this device NFL: New York Giants beat Los Angeles Rams 17-10 at Twickenham \nThe NFL claims it has 13 million fans in the UK, and its players are happy at the prospect of branching out into new territories. \n\"The more places we can go, the better,\" Christian Kirksey, a linebacker for the Cleveland Browns, who will play Minnesota Vikings at Twickenham in October this year, told BBC Scotland. \n\"It is all about expanding your fan base and letting people see you, rather than just watching you on TV. \n\"I think it is a good idea for us to keep travelling to different spots and get more exposure for the NFL.\" \nThomas Morstead, a kick-off specialist for New Orleans Saints, who play Miami Dolphins at Wembley later this year, would also be happy to play a regular-season game in Scotland. \n\"What's an extra 30 minutes or hour's flight?\" said the 2010 Superbowl winner. \"I don't think it matters where it is. \n\"If there are passionate fans that want to see us play, I am sure if they can fill a stadium and that the NFL would love to play here at some point.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:24:56.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
