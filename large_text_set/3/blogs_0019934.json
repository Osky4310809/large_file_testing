There’s always a relearning curve after we update a champion. In Cho’Gath’s case, this was more notable: few players had been picking him before the update, so there’s more learning than re learning. That being said, we think he’s slightly on the weak side even for those players who have adjusted. He is a giant monster, so we think a bit more base tankiness from Feast should do the trick. R - Feast BONUS HEALTH 80/110/140 per stack ⇒ 80/120/160 per stack MINION/SMALL MONSTER CAP 5 stacks ⇒ 6 stacks Fiddlesticks Q cast range increased. W refunds its remaining duration when its target dies. Fiddlesticks has been having a rough time clearing camps since pre-season’s updates - particularly the raptors. While Dark Wind is a solid AoE tool, it’s the only one Fiddle’s got, so after he’s Drained the Crimson Raptor, he’s left with nothing but basic attacks to slap the remaining little birds with. We’re giving him the option of chain-Draining the chicken nuggets (and other small monsters, like the smaller Krugs), provided he’s got the mana to do so. On a completely separate note, we’re reverting last mid-season’s change to Terrify’s cast range. Our thinking back then was that if Terrify had a lower cast range than Drain, Fiddlesticks would get better mileage out of his Terrify-Drain combo since his target wouldn’t be forced out of tether range as quickly. What ended up happening is that trying to quickly execute the combo only worked if Fiddle was already in Terrify range - otherwise, his attempt to walk up would immediately be overwritten by Drain. This is equally - if not more - problematic than the original interaction, so we’re giving our scarecrow his 50 cast range back. Caw Caw. Q - Terrify CAST RANGE 525 ⇒ 575 W - Drain new I CAN CAST IT TWICE?! If Drain’s target dies before the channel completes, the remaining duration is applied as cooldown reduction Gnar Mini Gnar and Mega Gnar have the same health regen. When Gnar is ahead, his constant basic attacks and ability-casts send him Mega that much more often. But when Gnar is behind, he often can’t safely build the fury he needs to transform, denying access to Mega Gnar’s increased health regeneration. We’re smoothing out Gnar’s regen between forms to make him a little more capable of healing up when he falls behind. That being said, this should be an overall buff to Gnar; he spends more time small than large, even when he’s not behind. Base stats HEALTH REGEN (MINI) 2.5 ⇒ 4.5 health per 5 seconds HEALTH REGEN GROWTH STAT (MINI) 0.5 ⇒ 1.75 health per 5 seconds HEALTH REGEN (MEGA) 6.5 ⇒ 4.5 health per 5 seconds HEALTH REGEN GROWTH STAT (MEGA) 3 ⇒ 1.75 health per 5 seconds Mega E - Crunch Miss Fortune Q damage up. Q and E are smoother to use. Last patch’s shifts to Lethality, Deathfire Touch and Double Up were a big, coordinated swing at Miss Fortune’s strength. While these changes were important to keep MF healthy in the long run, it was overall a bigger power-down than was needed, so we’re adding a few follow-up buffs. Double Up should pack a bit more of its old punch (still not three-quarters of a health bar), especially as she transitions into the mid and late game, and we’ve bundled in some Lucian-style slickness improvements to boot. These changes will help the pirate hunter scale better as she starts to pick up her big-ticket crit items. Q - Double Up DAMAGE 20/35/50/65/80 ⇒ 20/40/60/80/100 RATIO 0.85 total attack damage ⇒ 1.0 total attack damage NOW WE’RE PLAYING WITH POWER Cast range now adjusts based on Miss Fortune’s attack range (ex. Rapidfire Cannon) HAIR TRIGGER Miss Fortune no longer briefly pauses after casting Double Up E - Make It Rain Orianna The Ball no longer returns to Orianna if the target it’s attached to dies. The one-liner below is a one-stop ‘fix’ to a few bugs that occurred when an ally holding the Ball died (more specifically, when the Ball returned to Orianna immediately after). Unintended benefit of ditching the bugged mechanic entirely: one less case of accidentally ulting yourself! E - Command: Protect STAY! If an ally dies while holding the Ball, it now drops in place rather than returning to Orianna Quinn Harrier procs grant more attack speed. Skystrike damage down. Quinn respawns as Valor once R is available. Let’s paint a picture: you’re minding your own business when a blazing-fast bird streaks out of the fog of war. In an instant, your vision disappears. A moment later, you’re dead. Quinn’s burst - combined with her high movement speed - gives opponents little time to react to her entrance. We want Quinn’s kill combo to have a little more room for enemy reaction, shifting some of that burst into extended trade strength. W - Heightened Senses BONUS ATTACK SPEED 20/25/30/35/40% on Harrier proc ⇒ 20/35/50/65/80% on Harrier proc R - Behind Enemy Lines SKYSTRIKE DAMAGE 100% total attack damage ⇒ 40% total attack damage new CATCH THE PIGEON After putting at least one point in Behind Enemy Lines, Quinn respawns as Valor after deaths for the rest of the game Varus Q refund from Blight procs no longer reduced by cooldown reduction. Last patch’s changes to Varus were part of a three-pronged approach to knocking Varus off the bot-lane throne (the other two being Edge of Night and Deathfire Touch nerfs). Speaking to Varus specifically, we tied Piercing Arrow’s cooldown to Varus’s willingness to use basic attacks to nock enemies dead. We’re happy with this direction , but have some room to restore a bit of power. Part of Piercing Arrow’s cooldown refund mechanic included anti-scaling with cooldown reduction: we were hesitant to give him the option of getting Piercing Arrow’s cooldown lower than it was pre-nerf. Ultimately, though, Varus still has to use his basic attack to get his refund, which is the main improvement we wanted to see. Nixing the anti-scaling is a power-up for Varus that also makes the refund easier to understand and feel better in cooldown reduction builds. Q - Piercing Arrow COOLDOWN REFUND ON BLIGHT PROC 4 seconds, scaling down with cooldown reduction ⇒ 4 seconds Lux VO Expansion We’ve added a bunch of new lines to Lux’s existing voiceover. She’s now got about four times as much to say, including many champion-specific interactions! Magic Damage Shield UI Real quick: we’re slightly changing the color health bars use to represent magic damage shields (Morgana, Camille, and now Galio!)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:32:59.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
