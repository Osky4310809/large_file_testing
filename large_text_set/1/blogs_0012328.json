The figures in 2014 were 33 percent and 23 percent respectively, it said. \n\"My mother, aunts, uncles and even my grandmother have helped to arrange four blind dates for me with men they believe might be a good match during the seven-day holiday,\" said Lin Qing, a 33-year-old bank clerk in Shanghai. \n\"Sometimes they also show me photos of a neighbor my age who just got married or of one of their friends who has just become a grandmother, which is their way of telling me that I shouldn't waste any more time.\" \nThe survey highlights a collective anxiety among those born in the 1950s, who experienced social instabilities such as a shortage of necessities and getting laid-off in their prime, according to Xue Yali, a researcher with the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' Family Research Center. \n\"Because of their experiences, they dislike uncertainty of the future and are afraid that their children will suffer losses and failures,\" Xue said. \"They usually can't help with their career development, and can only help to urge them to start a family.\" \nAnother reason for the rising trend, she said, is that the topic of \"leftover\" men and women has had a lot of media coverage in recent years, so people feel more pressure to look for a spouse before it is too late. \nThe survey found that people in Jiangxi province feel the most pressure to get married, with 63 percent of both men and women complaining about the issue. The problem is also acute in Henan and Anhui provinces, the report said. \n\"This is probably because people in these regions still hold to the conservative idea that the best age for marriage is in the early 20s, despite the fact young people are postponing marriage,\" said Meng Yuan, head of public relations in Jiayuan. \nThe report also said the biggest turnoffs when looking for a spouse are men finding women materialistic, unreasonable or narrow-minded, and women finding men stingy, narrow-minded and lacking masculinity.
