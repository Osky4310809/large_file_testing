But who cares? Back to this sexy commercial for scrubbing gunk off of your stove. (WHY?) I literally cannot (mop) handle this. It has been a whole day since the Super Bowl and I cannot stop thinking about this. I just keep waking up screaming, which is really disrupting my previously scheduled passing out from screaming about everything else in reality. Why is he Magic Mike -ing with a Swiffer? GIF Why is he Ghost -ing at the shower door? GIF Why is he giving you \"random handyman from an adult film\"? GIF   WHY DOES THIS SHOT EXIST? How am I supposed to talk to my children about Mr. Clean's package? Why have I watched this commercial 20 times? In concept, Mr. Clean should be a total hottie. He's muscle-bound, bald, he probably smells faintly like bleach all the time so he's got that Sexy Janitor thing going on. You know that thing we all have? For sexy janitor? Anyway, Mr. Clean is like Professor X as portrayed by Chris Meloni. And let me tell you how here for that I am: I built a time machine so that I could go back in time and join myself here. For. That. Chris Meloni can do anything, up to and including, magically erasing stubborn stains from the table. GIF In my head, this is great. In my head I'm even here for those bushy white eyebrows, giving you a romantic Dumbledore moment. GIF But when you pull it out of my head and make me watch it on screen with some sexy R&B music, I have to draw a line. Accio Parental Controls. What's most hilarious about this commercial is that they chose to keep Mr. Clean as a cartoon character when there are literally hundreds of sexy bald men on the earth right now . Trust me, I know where Chris Meloni and Taye Diggs are every minute of the day. The ad execs were like, \"LOL, we're going to make America so thirsty over a drawing.\" This is like that time I rented Disney's Tarzan and had to pause it midway through to stick my head in the freezer. GIF Did you realize how oddly proportioned Tarzan is? His feet are enormous. GIF Most Popular Now I'm thinking about the size of a cartoon character's feet. Mr. Clean has made everything dirty. I have to take a Magic Eraser to my mind. Which, when you think of it, is a brilliant sales strategy. I see you, Mr. Clean. I see you. GIF Follow R. Eric Thomas on Twitter .
