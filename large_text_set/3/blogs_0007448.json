The humiliating second-leg loss condemned Arsenal to a 10-2 aggregate defeat and saw them crash out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage for the seventh consecutive season after a match that was preceded by small protests against Wenger: Bleacher Report UK @br_uk A group of Arsenal fans protest against Arsene Wenger outside the Emirates Stadium ahead of tonight's game vs. Bayern Munich. #AFC https://t.co/hefiQMnVNt 3/7/2017, 7:11:19 PM The Gunners were perhaps unfortunate to see Laurent Koscielny sent off before they conceded five second-half goals. But Wright hinted at Wenger's 20-year Arsenal reign potentially coming to an end after the Frenchman failed to prevent another humbling at the hands of the German giants, per BT Sport (via PA Sport h/t ESPN FC ): \n[Wenger] looks like a lost man... It just seems to be mounting up. You've got the fans, the protests. It's imploding. \nYou can't go down to 10 men and not shore it up against a team like Bayern Munich. We've lost the tie down to 10 men, we maybe should have brought on a couple of defenders and kept it a little bit more respectable. \nIt's a sad day because we've gone out again at this stage and we're going through a period in our history which is the worst that I can ever remember. \nI think with everything that's going on, in the dressing room, performances, you have to say it will take some monumental effort, some cataclysmic effort for Arsenal to turn it round in respect of the attitude of the players and the drive and determination. \nIt seems like something is coming to an end. BT Sport Football @btsportfootball 3/7/2017, 9:45:58 PM Having lost the first leg at the Allianz Arena 5-1 Arsenal were never expected to turn the tie around on home turf. However, they were excellent in the first half and went 1-0 ahead through Theo Walcott 's superb goal. Nine minutes after the break, though, Koscielny hauled down Robert Lewandowksi in the penalty area and, though the referee initially only issued the French centre-back a yellow card, it was changed to a red following a consultation with one of the assistant officials. Lewandowski converted the spot-kick, Arjen Robben and Douglas Costa then both scored, and Arturo Vidal netted a double to condemn Arsenal to a crushing loss. A photo posted by Bleacher Report UK (@bleacherreportuk) Arsenal's season has collapsed in recent weeks. In mid-December the Gunners were in second place in the Premier League, just three points behind leaders Chelsea . They then fell to back-to-back losses against Everton and Manchester City but still looked in good shape for a top-four finish after getting back on track with four league wins in five. However, in a recent run of seven matches in all competitions since late January—culminating in Tuesday's defeat—Arsenal have been beaten five times. As well as being humiliated in the Champions League they also now lie in fifth place in the Premier League and are by no means guaranteed to return to Europe's top competition next season. Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images Reports have also emerged that star player Alexis Sanchez has fallen out with Wenger and his team-mates and could depart in the summer, per John Cross of the Mirror and the Telegraph 's Matt Law and Jeremy Wilson . Per Cross, ahead of Tuesday's defeat to Bayern Wenger was \" 50-50\" on whether he would pen a new deal with Arsenal or vacate the role when his current deal expires at the end of the 2016-17 campaign. Wright clearly believes there is a strong possibility the 67-year-old will call it a day and, despite the successes Wenger has had at the club, there would likely be a number of Arsenal fans happy to see him go.
