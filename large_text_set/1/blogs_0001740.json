This was a pagan custom of the tribes around them, but it was not God's way. \nAbraham was 86 years old when Ishmael was born of that union. Ishmael means \"God hears,\" because God heard Hagar's prayers. But 13 years later, Sarah did give birth, through a miracle of God, to Isaac . Suddenly, through no fault of his own, Ishmael was no longer the heir. During the time Sarah had been barren, Hagar flaunted her child. When Isaac was weaned, Ishmael mocked his half-brother. Angered, Sarah told Abraham to cast the two out. \nGod, however, did not abandon Hagar and her child. They were stranded in the desert of Beersheba, dying from thirst. An angel of the Lord came to Hagar, showed her a well, and they were saved. \nHagar later found an Egyptian wife for Ishmael and he fathered 12 sons, just as Isaac's son Jacob would. Two generations later, God used the descendants of Ishmael to save the Jewish nation. Isaac's grandsons sold their brother Joseph into slavery to Ishmaelite traders. They took Joseph to Egypt and sold him again. Joseph eventually rose to become second in command of the entire country and saved his father and brothers during a great famine. Ishmael's Accomplishments: \nIshmael grew to become a skilled hunter and archer. \nHe fathered the nomadic Arab nations. \nIshmael lived to 137 years old. Ishmael's Strengths: \nIshmael did his part to help fulfill God's promise to prosper him. He realized the importance of family and had 12 sons. Their warrior tribes eventually inhabited most of the countries in the Middle East. Life Lessons: \nOur circumstances in life can change quickly, and sometimes for the worse. That is when we should draw near to God and seek his wisdom and strength . We may be tempted to become bitter when bad things happen, but that never helps. Only by following direction from God can we get through those valley experiences. Hometown: \nMamre, near Hebron, in Canaan.
