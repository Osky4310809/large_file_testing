Meyers marveled at the immigrants, refugees and green-card holders who were detained for hours, only to voice their praise of America afterwards. He singled out the Iraqi interpreter who was detained due to Trump’s new order. \n“He was detained for 18 hours at JFK and he still loves America. If you can spend more than two hours a day at JFK without losing your shit, you should get automatic citizenship,” Meyers said. \nBut the man of the week for Meyers was our new president. \n“Trump did accomplish something truly remarkable. He managed to spark another round of massive nationwide protest for the second time in just the first week of his presidency. And people are willing to go to [bleeped] places to protest. Last week, it was parks. This week, it was airports. Next week, people are going to march for gay rights at the DMV,” Meyers joked, although, the way this administration is going, he could be right about that prediction. \nMeyers noted that federal judges have issued a stay on Trump’s executive order, proving the president might not have had a full chance to think about this. \n“Trump should be the first president that legally has to count to 100 before taking action,” Meyers said. “Not because he will think better of it, but because he will forget what it is.” \nWatch Seth Meyers take a closer look below: Taylor Link is a news writer at Salon.
