Suspended from his side’s 2-1 Coupe de France loss against Lorient following a red card picked up against Bordeaux shortly before Christmas, the Italy international has had the opportunity to break for a few more days longer than he might have wished for. He profited from his extended holiday by spending some time in Paris, and in doing so he has no doubt upset a number of PSG fans by sharing his thoughts on the French capital via a series of Instagram posts. A video posted by Mario Balotelli (@mb459) on Jan 5, 2017 at 10:03am PST \nThe first was a view of the iconic Eiffel Tower, sparkling with lights in the winter sky to mark the hour just as Big Ben does in London. Mario, though, was not impressed by the sight: “Ok, Ok, but Nice is better,” he commented cheekily while having a sly chuckle in the process. Hours later, he posted a similar video, but this time taking a more direct dig at PSG. “This is Paris, but don’t forget who’s on top … it’s Nice,” he smiled in the fashion of a loveable rogue, referring to the fact that his side are leading the capital club by five points heading into the second half of the campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T16:41:25.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
