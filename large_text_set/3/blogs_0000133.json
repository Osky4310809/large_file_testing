Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP \n\"We had the largest gathering of men and women to date in the Oval Office for a picture. These are the presidents and other leaders within the historically black colleges and universities, and they came to visit the White House — of course today the president signed the executive order on HCBUs [sic],\" Conway told Dobbs, adding that many of the people in the room had defended her. \nRelated: Kellyanne Conway's Feet on Oval Office Couch Kick Off Debate \n\"I was being asked to take a picture in a crowded room with the press behind us, and I was asked to take a certain angle and was doing exactly that,\" Conway said. \"I certainly meant no disrespect. I didn't mean to have my feet on the couch.\" \nDobbs said those who had determined Conway was disrespecting the Oval Office were guilty of \"deplorable hypocrisy\" and called it the \"venom of the left,\" referencing pictures of former President Barack Obama with his feet up on the Resolute desk.

I have 24/7 Secret Service protection because there are people out there who do wish us harm, and people should take that very seriously. I'm not a victim at all, but people should take very seriously the import of their words. Especially when they know I meant no disrespect.\" \nShe added that if the photo begins a trend of people talking about showing greater respect for the office of the president and Trump, then she sees the outcome as a positive.
