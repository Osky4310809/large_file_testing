Why it is a “shield of prayer” to be raised by “a prolific council of prelates and prophets.” The following is from the about page of POTUS Shield : \nYOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INAUGURAL CONVOCATION OF THE POTUS SHIELD. \nIt is our time to storm heaven for a New America, revival in our land, and to bring our country back to God! We are the redeemed of the Lord who are coming to raise up a shield of faith and the sword of the Spirit. \nThe Lord has summoned a prolific council of prelates and prophets to convene in Washington, D.C. one week prior to the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States of America. These servants of God are especially gifted to discern the times and to prophesy the Word of The Lord, even so as we seek to prepare the way for transformation, reformation, and revival in our nation. \nWe are called to gather in the nation’s capital and to raise up a shield of prayer and prophetic understanding, grounded in the firm foundation of the immutable Word of God, and inspired with fresh revelation by the Spirit of The Lord… \nThe POTUS shield mission – “To assemble, structure and activate The POTUS Shield”: \nIn this spirit, the inaugural principals of Our Mission include: \nTo assemble, structure and activate The POTUS Shield as a powerfully interactive spiritual, apostolic, prophetic force that acts and reacts in unity, with efficiency and expedience… \nCommenting on the POTUS Shield, Joe.My.God. notes: \nNow that is a caravan of cuckoo crazy. \nAnd of course, this collection of evangelical “prelates and prophets” are asking for money. Because, you know, Jesus needs your money. Always. \nBottom line: The POTUS shield is silly superstitious nonsense for gullible rubes. \nFeel free to weep for America, because the stupid, it burns.
