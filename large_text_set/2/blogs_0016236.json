Sutton goalkeeper agrees to join Arsenal in exchange for six pasties \nWenger says he will make a decision over his immediate future in 'March or April', while the 67-year-old insists he will remain in management beyond this season whether that is in north London or elsewhere. \nFans have long been split over the issue of Wenger's future, but Robbie Lyle - star of popular YouTube channel Arsenal Fan TV - told Standard Sport there was a noticeable change in attitude after the club was crushed 5-1 by Bayern Munich last week. \nLyle said: \"Interviewing fans after the Bayern Munich game, what I found pretty telling was that even a lot of people who have been pro-Arsene Wenger were saying the time has come now for him to go.\" In Pictures | Sutton United vs Arsenal | 20/02/2017 In Pictures | Sutton United vs Arsenal | 20/02/2017 1/50", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:08:45.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
