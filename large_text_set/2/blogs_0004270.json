On Thursday, Lin-Manuel penned a heartfelt love letter (basically) to John Leguizamo — actor, writer, and a pioneer of Latino representation in film, TV, and theater. View this image ›\nScott Nelson / AFP / Getty Images The piece was written for Vanity Fair , highlighting Leguizamo’s return to theater with his show Latin History for Morons , playing at the Public Theater in New York City.\nID: 10475004 3. In the piece, Lin Manuel talks about how Leguizamo’s first one-man show, Spic-o-Rama , influenced the Broadway juggernaut: View this image ›\nyoutube.com “ Spic-o-Rama hit me (and a generation of future Latino writers) like a thunderbolt. As an erstwhile theater kid whose knowledge of it was strictly confined to traditional musicals such as Oklahoma! and Fiddler on the Roof , witnessing a Latino actor write and star in his own show, reveling in the specificities of our culture with brilliant, razor-sharp wit and a uniquely hip-hop energy, exploded my every notion of what theater could be.”\nID: 10475062 4. He also praises the hell out of Leguizamo’s extensive body of work and what it meant to Latinos : View this image ›\nUniversal Pictures “For our Spanglish generation, Leguizamo was our Man on the Inside: we cheered for him as “Benny Blanco from the Bronx” in Carlito’s Way . We watched him hold his own against Leo DiCaprio in Romeo and Juliet and Ewan McGregor in Moulin Rouge! We watched him play fabulously against type in To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar . Because we watched him play everybody in the beginning, we knew simply one role would never be enough.”\nID: 10475094 5. And he finishes off his piece with this perfect Quote: : View this image ›\nyoutube.com “For those of us who discovered, through his work, a link between the theater and our own specific stories, Leguizamo is the young, gifted, and Latino hero we’d been waiting for.”\nID: 10475155 6. And of course, John Leguizamo responded to the piece on Twitter: @Lin_Manuel U sir r a writer's writer! Your turn of language inspires and uplifts! Luv ya!
