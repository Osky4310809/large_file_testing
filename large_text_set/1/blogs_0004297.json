If you are on the shorter side of the scale, you know what I am talking about. Even today, we can’t stop stressing about how the heavy silhouettes and fabrics of Indian ethnic wear would make us look. After all, you can’t wear those heels every day! So, if you are looking for a solution to your problem, you are in luck as we bring you some amazing kurti styles that will make you look tall and slender. Let’s take you through some kurti designs for short women that will work wonders for your look. \n1. Kalidar anarkali style kurti While you would love to wear those floor-length anarkalis, the sad truth is that the long flowy silhouette with bunched up fabric will make you appear shorter. But no need to lose heart, ladies! The short kalidar anarkali is here for you. The long vertical lines of the kalidar anarkali creates an illusion of height and makes you look taller. \nOur pick \n2. Straight silhouettes While the market is afloat with a mind-boggling number of kurti designs, you need to be careful about the length of your kurtis. Short kurtis that end at the knee make you look shorter. So, go for long straight kurtis as they help create an illusion of an elongated frame. In case, you want to pair them with palazzos, make sure the bottoms flow in the same line as the kurti as a neat look will make you look taller. \nOur pick \n3. Deep necks When you are shopping for kurtis , looking just at the fit, colour and prints isn’t enough. Neck designs play a big role when it comes to Indian ethnic wear. So, make sure you pick deep necklines like V-neck or sweetheart neck as they make your neck look more slender as compared to collared or closed neck designs. \nOur pick \n4. Solid colours If you have a petite frame, wearing kurtis with different colours on the bodice and flare might not be a good idea. This will make you appear shorter as it separates your upper and lower half. Go for single coloured kurtis instead as it creates a solid vertical frame and makes you look taller. \nOur pick \nShop for branded kurtis . \n5. Elongated prints We all get carried away by the lovely prints that ethnic wear so generously offers us. But it’s best if you stay away from busy prints. Go for elongated prints like paisleys or diamond patterns instead as they create an illusion of vertical lines that make you look taller. The neat, slender motifs work really well to make your frame look slender. \nOur pick \n6. Front-slit kurtis Move over traditional kurtis with side slits! Go for front slits that begin at the waist, and wear them with solid coloured bottoms. This will create lines that make your legs look longer and also make you look slimmer. \nOur pick \n7. Layers With the beautiful, flowy silhouettes, Indian ethnic wear leaves you with a lot of room to play around with layers. Look beyond the obvious and try pairing your kurti with an ethnic jacket on top and match it with skirts or an interesting pair of palazzos ! The layered long lines will make you look taller. \nOur pick", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:23:11.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
