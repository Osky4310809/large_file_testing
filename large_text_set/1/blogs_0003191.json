The Oilers converted for the victory on Letestu’s shot from the top of the left circle. \nThe game featured the first meeting of the clubs since the summer trade that sent defenceman Adam Larsson to Edmonton for left wing Taylor Hall . \nLarsson has been a major contributor as Edmonton makes a strong bid reach the playoffs for the first time since 2006. \nHall leads the Devils in scoring despite missing 10 games due to injury. Even with Hall's contribution, New Jersey has been languishing near the bottom of the Eastern Conference. \nWood scored the only goal of the opening period as the Devils escaped with the lead despite being outshot 16-7. \nThe Oilers dominated the early play, using their speed to pepper Schneider with shots. He held his ground, fending off bids from McDavid, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Leon Draisaitl as the Oilers piled up an 11-3 shots advantage. \nIt was a solid rebound effort by Schneider, who was yanked in the first period of Friday's 4-2 loss to Toronto after giving up three goals on only five shots. \nWood turned on the jets and sped around defenceman Eric Gryba to tuck a backhander between Talbot's pads at 9:44. \nThe Devils continued to cling to the goal lead through the second period even though the Oilers unloaded another 14 shots on Schneider. \nSchneider stretch across to deny McDavid's wraparound bid early in the period and later blocked Letestu's rebound blast. \nAt the other end, Talbot faced a few challenges sparked by Hall who set up PA Parenteau for a testing shot, and fired his own drive from left circle that was turned away with a pad save. \nThe relentless Oilers pressure finally paid off as Benning scored at 3:33 of the third period on Edmonton's 32nd shot. Matt Hendricks, screening in front of the net, was initially credited with the tally on the point that slipped by Schneider. \nAdam Henrique had a golden opportunity from the slot to give the Devils a lead with two minutes left, only to be robbed by Talbot. \nNOTES: The game concluded a busy stretch at the Prudential Center with the Devils playing here Friday and Saturday nights. Sandwiched in between was Seton Hall hosting DePaul on Saturday afternoon. . New Jersey placed C Jacob Josefson on injured reserve due to illness and recalled D Yohann Auvitu from Albany (AHL). Auvitu suffered a lower-body injury early in first period and did not return. .. Devils saluted Larsson with a video-board tribute during a first-period stop in play. \nUP NEXT: Oilers: Conclude a four-game road trip in Ottawa on Sunday. \nDevils: Host Florida on Monday. %2Fhockey%2Fnhl%2Fletestu-scores-ot-winner-oilers-beat-devils%2F", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T05:10:21.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
