Look away.\nNow, Animal Adventure Park, the upstate New York where the animal lives, is in the market for an advertiser, TMZ reports.\nAnd with April's newfound celebrity status, that spot is worth big money.\nThe stream's original sponsor, Mazuri Exotic Animal Nutrition, locked down the rights for peanuts—or you know, whatever giraffes eat—back when everyone thought the baby would just be a one-and-done deal. The zoo asked only that the company keep the animal fed in return for the advertising space in the livestream description.\nBut that deal just expired, according to the gossip site.\nThe next sponsor will have to shell out more than giraffe feed to land a deal.\nThe video's already attracted half the audience of a Super Bowl to watch a giraffe hang out in a room for two billion minutes. One can only imagine the massive number of eyeballs on that screen when the calf actually pops out.\nApril better have that baby soon or she's going to end up looking like a Nascar.\nThe zoo is reportedly donating a third of the money it makes to the Giraffe Conservation Foundation.\nWATCH: Animal artists paint for charity (and treats)", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/AxEXles8.m3u8", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGEEGDIHDRc?enablejsapi=1&", "http://a.amz.mshcdn.com/assets/lib/aab-3e4af80fa7eef43b2c82c5f3e3a386e50b041bb6ee6b415a5a69b0c863479851.js", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/AxEXles8.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-19T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T00:30:03.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
