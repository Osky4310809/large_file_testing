Those that love British racing surely should. \nConsideration of what might be done to redress this situation is beyond the scope of this article, but among the possibilities - some already raised by the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association - are: \nMaintaining a logical Pattern-race programme regardless of ratings parameters, while strengthening the black-type programme for middle-distance fillies. \nIncreasing the number of two-year-old races confined to horses by stallions that won over at least ten furlongs. \nDeveloping high-value handicaps over 1m4f or more, particularly for three-year-olds. \n\nIncreasing rewards for middle-distance three-year-olds via the EBF, Plus Ten and other potential incentive schemes. \nOf course, if such things are proposed there are bound to be siren voices asking \"where are the stallions to produce more middle-distance horses? After all, there are only 22 in the entire British Isles.\" \nThe answer is remarkably simple. Britain and Ireland are fortunate to have considerable numbers of jumps breeders driven by a passion for their sport. \nThe top jumps stallions are no longer the moderate Flat horses who once plied this trade. Disregard by Flat breeders has meant many high-class racehorses, of the type that 50 years ago were targeted to breed Derby winners, stand as jumps sires. \nA swift search revealed almost 70 middle- or long-distance horses with ratings of over 120 stand as jumps sires in Britain or Ireland, compared with only 19 advertised as Flat sires. \nThe average rating of these horses is 125.3, just below the 127.6 for middle-distance Flat sires (who include Galileo and Sea The Stars) but higher than the 123.5 of milers and 120.9 of sprinters. \nThey include horses who on objective measures of performance - although clearly not commercial ones - were good Flat sires, such as Champs Elysees, Dylan Thomas and Mount Nelson; outstanding racehorses and now successful jumps sires that were scarcely used as Flat stallions, like Westerner and Yeats; and newer jumps sires who in former days would have been highly regarded Flat breeding prospects, such as Fame And Glory and Telescope (in whom, for the sake of transparency, it is only fair to say I own an interest). \nFlat owner-breeders with the courage not to follow the herd may find that if they breed middle-distance horses their chances of long-term success are enhanced. Their produce can compete in valuable handicaps or conditions races over distances that most of the thoroughbred population are not bred to stay. \nEventually they might be sold for good money to countries such as Australia or Hong Kong that for various reasons are unable to produce such horses. Patience invested in accepting initially lower returns could ultimately reap much greater rewards. \nFor such breeders, using a jumps-oriented sire who was a top racehorse with a good pedigree can offer excellent value. After all, covering jumps mares doesn't affect their genes. \nFor the long-term benefit of the breed the combination of speed and stamina preserved by jumps breeding could be vital if the constant march to the mediocre monotony of a sprint-obsessed breeding programme is to be halted. \nAs well as being co-breeder of high-class jumps horses Lifeboat Mona and Sizing John, Dr Bryan Mayoh is a lifelong thoroughbred-breeding obsessive.
