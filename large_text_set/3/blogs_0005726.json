Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA notorious thug who left a teenager for dead in a brutal attack embarked on a crime rampage just weeks after his early release from prison. \nBrian Ramsay, whose horror assault of 18-year-old Angus Gallacher while on an electronic tag shocked the country, was serving 39 months when he was let out barely halfway through the sentence. \nHe then teamed up with fellow inmates as part of an organised crime gang who have terrorised Edinburgh and the Lothians, the Daily Record reports. \nThe professional mob specialise in break-ins and high-end car thefts but Ramsay is the only member so far snared by cops. The brutal attack shocked Scotland (Photo: SWNS) \nRamsay, 26, gained notoriety after beating teenage Good Samaritan to a pulp while wearing a tag. \nHe left Angus Gallacher with 13 skull fractures, three broken fingers, fractured ribs and a damaged ear drum after attacking him in the street. \nAt the time of the attack, Ramsay was already on a tagging order when he assaulted ailing granddad Iain Hutchison four months earlier.

He was offending again as early as July 18. \nAngus’s dad Henry Gallacher, 58, said last night: “I’m not to sure what you can do with someone like Ramsay. Prison probably doesn’t matter to him, anyway. He’s used to it.” \nRamsay appeared in court on Friday to admit 26 offences from two indictments, which had 72 charges. \nWell-known gangsters from the Edinburgh area have been named in police reports as his suspected accomplices. \nRamsay also fled police in high-speed escapes with stolen cars.

But he could serve as little 21 months under early release rules. \nFiscal depute Aidan Higgins told the court: “The accused’s offending in this case arises from his significant involvement as a principal member of an organised crime gang.” Angus was left with 13 skull fractures after being beaten to a pulp (Photo: SWNS) \nRamsay’s well-drilled team of crooks targeted a Pizza Express in the capital last August, with men wearing balaclavas descending through the skylight before stealing a safe holding £2000. \nThey struck at a city shop, where gang members including Ramsay were in and out in two minutes with a £2,200 haul of cigarettes. \nThe raiders also targeted posh family homes, grabbing valuable contents and stealing keys for the owner’s expensive cars. \nThe vehicles, including a £45,000 BMW X4 and £36,000 Audi Q3 from one address, were then used as getaway cars for further burglaries.

But Ramsay drove at up to 50mph on the wrong side of the road to escape. \nThe next day in Niddrie, Ramsay evaded police cars in a Corsa, mounting pavements and taking blind corners at speed, while several children played in the street. \nThe court heard a “vast amount of evidence’ had been gathered against Ramsay, who was arrested in September. \nHis lawyer Elspeth McPartlin said her client had attempted to go straight upon release but “things began to unravel”. \nOnce free, Ramsay, who is from Gorebridge, Midlothian, went to live with his partner and their young daughter and got work as a roofer. \nBut the relationship quickly broke down and Ramsay then took up with Charlene Gilroy, 28, from Niddrie. \nGilroy was his co-accused on several charges but her not guilty pleas were accepted. \nMcPartlin said Ramsay had started to “associate with people he encountered in prison” and became “increasingly reckless”.
