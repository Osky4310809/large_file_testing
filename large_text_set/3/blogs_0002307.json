The six-time Pro Bowl receiver is reportedly going to be cut by the Jets, according to Newsday’s Kimberley A. Martin and Adam Schefter .\nFor a player of Marshall’s talent level, it’s a somewhat surprising yet similarly predictable move for New York. After all, while the receiver is only one year removed from setting Jets franchise records for single-season receptions and receiving yards (as well as tying the mark for touchdowns), he will be 33 next season and is coming off one of the poorer seasons in his career.\nGranted, the Jets had issues at the quarterback position, but Marshall’s 59 catches, 788 receiving yards and three scores were disappointing nonetheless. Teammate Quincy Enunwa led New York in both receiving yards and touchdowns last season, with Eric Decker sidelined after sustaining an injury early on in the year.\nOriginally slated to make $7.5 million in 2017, Marshall will now become a cap casualty (with no dead money for New York). The impending free agent is still a playmaker who, in the right situation, could remain one of the best wide receivers in the NFL.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T05:02:15.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
