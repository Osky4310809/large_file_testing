Recently, the “Master of Puppets” narrated a new documentary about the subject called, Addicted to Porn: Chasing the Cardboard Butterfly .\nDirected by Justin Hunt, the film traces the affects of pornography around the globe, specifically how it’s “Blackened” brains, “Hardwired” kids, and “Broken, Beat & Scarred” families everywhere. Basically, it’s arguing that porn is “The Thing That Should Not Be”.\n(Read: Metallica’s Top 20 Songs ) \nThis isn’t the first time Hetfield’s worked with Hunt. The two initially collaborated on the filmmaker’s 2011 documentary, Absent , which zeroed in on disengaged fathers who raise kids to feel like “Nothing Else Matters”, inevitably creating a “father wound” on society.\nMetallica puns aside, these are serious documentaries and it’s good to know Hetfield is attracted to these important projects like a “Moth Into Flame”. Sorry, sorry, these puns are just too damn easy, and yet highly immoral given the subject matter, which makes me wonder: “Am I Savage?”\nCheck out a trailer for the documentary above and catch the movie on VOD this April.
