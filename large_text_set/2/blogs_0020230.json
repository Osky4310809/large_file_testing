Trump narrowly topped Democrat Hillary Clinton, but fell shy of a majority even as Price cruised to re-election with more than 60 percent of the vote.\nIt's a dynamic Democrats must capitalize on around the country if they hope to reclaim a House majority next year, and it leaves a wide-open Republican field in Georgia to decide whether to run alongside the president or establish some independence from a White House off to a rocky start.\nIt could pose a particular challenge for one potential candidate, Price's wife Betty, who now serves in the Georgia General Assembly.\nAdding to the mix is a quirk of Georgia election law that makes special congressional elections a \"jungle primary\" with all candidates on the same ballot, regardless of party. If no candidate wins a majority on April 18, the top two finishers — again regardless of party — would advance to a second ballot set for June 20.\nBusinessman Bruce Levell, an African-American who led Trump's campaign diversity coalition, announced his candidacy this week, saying in a statement that he's running to be \"President Trump's strongest ally on Capitol Hill.\"\nAnother candidate, Bob Gray, has hired the GOP operative who ran Trump's Georgia campaign, and the Johns Creek city councilman's aides say he is running \"on the Trump agenda.\"\nOther GOP hopefuls are more circumspect.\nA state senator, Judson Hill, has been perhaps the most visible early Republican candidate. He casts himself as a \"proven conservative\" with \"Georgia values,\" but makes little to no mention of Trump. The closest he comes to backing the president is promising in campaign materials \"to help HHS Secretary nominee Tom Price repeal and replace Obamacare.\"\nA wealthy former state senator, Dan Moody, mentioned Trump only indirectly in a Monday statement confirming his candidacy. Moody referred to Price as \"President Trump's\" health secretary. He otherwise stuck to the safe GOP themes of \"tax cuts, job creation, repealing Obamacare and shrinking the massive size of the federal government.\"\nTom Price listens to opening remarks prior to testifying before a Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing on his nomination to be Health and Human Services secretary on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 24, 2017. Reuters/Carlos Barria\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Betty Price had not announced her intentions.\nKaren Handel, a Georgia politician well-known to social conservatives nationally for her aggressive criticism of abortion-provider Planned Parenthood, is expected to enter the race, as well.\nGeorgia's 6th Congressional District spans from the wealthy neighborhoods of east Cobb County, northwest of downtown Atlanta, to the ever-growing suburbs of north Fulton and north DeKalb counties, northeast of the city.\nChip Lake, who has run previous campaigns for Tom Price, said Republicans trying to succeed the new secretary must \"tread very, very carefully\" with Trump. \"It's risky aligning yourself with this president,\" Lake said, \"but it's not easy to distance yourself from a figure like him either.\"\nMore than two weeks into his presidency, Trump's job approval rating stood at 37 percent among self-described moderates and 41 percent among independents in the latest Gallup polling.\nDemocrats will have at least one well-financed candidate.\nJon Ossoff, an Atlanta native and former congressional aide, insists he's trying to reach \"every kind of voter\" from anti-Trump liberals to disenchanted independents and Republicans.\nOssoff confirmed in an interview that his strategy is to make a runoff against the top Republican finisher. He will benefit from at least $550,000 in fundraising on the liberal Daily Kos website. He also boasts endorsements from Atlanta Reps. John Lewis and Hank Johnson, his old boss, and Ossoff emphasizes the importance of congressional oversight in the Trump era.\nYet he also says the election should revolve around Trump.\n\"I think the divisiveness of the political atmosphere right now makes people hungrier for candidates who are willing not to play into lowest-common-denominator politics and instead offer solutions,\" he said.\nNational Democrats' House campaign committee lists the Georgia district among its 59 targeted seats in the 2018 election cycle. Still, it's not clear how much the party will invest; the district was not among the 20 where the party recently dispatched full-time field staff members.\nMore from Associated Press: Rescuers search collapsed buildings in Italy after another powerful earthquake hits region near Perugia Texas Longhorns jump all the way up to No. 11 in latest AP poll after beating Notre Dame A college professor has promised to consume only water and sports drinks after the university's president overrode a nearly unanimous decision to grant him tenure Craig Sager is hoping to return to NBA sidelines by November after receiving a rare third bone-marrow transplant David Ortiz honored with a corn maze cut in his likeness SEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton urges Trump to address anti-Semitic threats: 'Everyone must speak out, starting with' him NOW WATCH: A Navy SEAL explains what to do if you're attacked by a dog Associated Press Georgia Donald Trump Tom Price", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:18:33.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
