However, the legislature also just passed a “right to work” bill that makes union dues voluntary. \nSo apparently what they mean is: Republican contributions good. Democratic contributions (by voluntary union dues)? Now illegal. \nKentucky Speaker of the House Jeff Hoover can’t even explain why in this excellent interview on a news show called Hey Kentucky! \nMatt Jones’ interview is literally the first time I’ve ever seen an interviewer pin a legislator down on air about the agenda behind “right to work” laws: Less pay, less benefits. x \nImagine if 60 Minutes did a segment like this instead of their commercials for Amazon . \nHere’s a transcript of my favorite part of the interview: \nHost (Matt Jones): The last 5 states, in that particular state, not compared to other states, in that particular state, all 5 states, the average wage has gone down within the next 5 years. All 5 states. It’s understandable, the reason the business community wants it is because the wages will go down, right? \nSpeaker Hoover: No. You want it so you can attract jobs and create jobs. \nHost: But why is it attracting jobs? Because the wages are lower, right? \nSpeaker Hoover: But I don’t think the wages for a particular job are going down. Maybe when a company comes in the wages are maybe less than what had been earlier. \nHost: That’s a fair point. But let’s be real. The reason the Koch Brothers and the Chamber of Commerce want Right to Work is because they know it will make jobs available in that state that will cost less than jobs that will potentially have unions, right? \nSpeaker Hoover: But … if you create jobs, you are expanding your tax base, right. \nJones goes on to ask Hoover how he can justify limiting union political contributions when they’re now voluntary (after right to work). \nHost: Are you anti-union? \nSpeaker Hoover: No. Not at all. \nHost: So let me ask you this. If that’s the case, why ban union donations to political groups? If it’s the case that now people don’t have to pay dues … then why can’t the dues they pay be used for politics? A: Because that employee should have that choice … \nSpeaker Hoover: They will. They don’t have to pay the dues. You all have made it so they don’t have to pay dues now. So for the ones who want to pay dues, why can’t they be used for politics? \nHost: They can pay dues. \nSpeaker Hoover: Then why can’t they be used for politics? Why can’t those dues be used for politics? A: Well … \nHost: I think you’re having it both ways here. \nSpeaker Hoover: I see what you’re saying. That is a valid argument. \nLet’s be honest. The real reason for these bills is: Republicans like Jeff Hoover believe that the only way to create jobs is to lower wages and benefits They’re anti-union because unions donate mostly to the Democratic Party (see #1). \nKudos to host Matt Jones for an amazing interview. Many people think of Kentucky as a flyover state, but when was the last time you saw an interviewer in New York or L.A. interview a legislator like Jones did? \nIf you liked the interview, thank Matt Jones and Hey Kentucky! We need more media asking the tough questions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:15:47.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
