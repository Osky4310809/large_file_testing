A number of news outlets reported that the documents revealed that Signal, WhatsApp, and other messaging apps that use high-level encryption to ensure that messages are sent and received safely had been compromised.\nWikiLeaks #Vault7 confirms CIA can effectively bypass Signal + Telegram + WhatsApp + Confide encryption https://t.co/h5wzfrReyy\n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) ID: 10655638 Cybersecurity experts, however, were quick to point out that the documents simply stated that if a phone was compromised — which is to say if the CIA hacked into the phone itself — any apps on that phone would no be longer secure. This is the equivalent of saying that if your house is broken into and bugged, whispering softly on your phone in your bedroom is not going to make that conversation secure.\n\nPSA: This incorrectly implies CIA hacked these apps / encryption. But the docs show iOS/Android are what got hacked… https://t.co/iMhyPVD7kk\n— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) ID: 10655718 In other news, if somebody looks over shoulder while you text somebody in Signal, your comms aren't secure. https://t.co/tPlBLg6pu6\n— Rob Pegoraro (@robpegoraro) ID: 10655616 \n\nThat's not what it says. Not about Signal. If your phone is hacked, *nothing* is foolproof.

Last year the group released thousands of emails detailing the communications of top Democratic Party leaders — which were widely believed to originate from a Russian government–sponsored hack . US intelligence agencies accused Russia of trying to meddle in the US elections and said WikiLeaks had assisted in that cause.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:36:37.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
