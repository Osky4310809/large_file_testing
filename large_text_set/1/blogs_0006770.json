State changes often involve hard cuts by default which can make them difficult to follow. Functional animation ease users through these moments of change; it smoothly transports users between navigational contexts and explains changes on a screen by creating visual connections between transition states. \nNavigational transitions can be hierarchical (parent to child) or sibling transitions. Hierarchical transitions are used when users explore deeper levels or screens of an app, which are children to the current (parent screen). Motion highlights movement away from the parent towards a destination (a child element). Animated zoom-in transition guides a user’s attention from parent-to-child (detailed view).

For example, this animation is used when a user navigates through tabs. 19 The content and surface of each tab stays at the same level and the animation simply guides focus between views. (Image credit: Behance 20 ) \nIn both cases, functional animation helps the eye see where a new object comes from upon its reveal and where a hidden object goes (and can be found again). It provides visual cues, making the interaction easier to follow and reinforcing what has occurred. Purposes: Link Define the spatial relationship between screens and elements Avoid a surprising transition by helping users comprehend the change that has just happened in the page’s layout Branding Link \nWhereas the previous roles of animations are quite logical, this one is full of emotions. Often, there are dozens of apps that have same exact features and accomplish the same tasks. They might all have a good user experience, but the ones that people love offer something more than just a good user experience. They establish emotional engagement with users. \nBranding animation is responsible for this engagement. It can be used as marketing tool — support a company’s brand values or highlight a product’s strengths — at the same time make user experience truly delightful and memorable. The approach might not be clearly user-centered, but it has a functional purpose. In order to be successful, branding animation should support continuity of the experience . For example, fine animation from Lo-Flo Records 21 website has a power to encourage users to interact more — people look forward to what they are will see next. Branding animation is able to make design feel unique. (Image credits: Lo-Flo-Records) \nPeople do notice the details. Attention to animations can convey an emotion and can make the experience feel crafted. A fine animated waiting indicator, which demonstrates a unique style, can create a truly enjoyable experience. Attention to fine movements can delightfully surprise the user. (Image credit: Creativedash) Purposes: Link Entertain users, bring empathy and fun to design Create a signature of the product; help users relate to the product, increase a brand perception How To Find A Balance Link \nWhere is the balance between useful and pure eye candy? It’s really important to take time and consider when an animation is and isn’t appropriate. Animate With Purpose Link \nAnimations should always serve a purpose. They should never be done for animation’s sake. When an animation doesn’t fit a functional purpose, it can feel awkward or annoying, especially when it is slowing down a process that could be faster without any animation. For example, below you can see an animated concept for a PayPal email receipt. This animation looks great, but at the same time it’s excessive and obstructs the app flow because it takes almost 4 seconds to see transaction details. A simple fade-in animation of the receipt would be more suitable for this purpose, (simply because it takes up less time). An example of superfluous animation. (Image credits: Vladyslav Tyzun) \nKeep in mind that users come to sites or launch the apps for a purpose — we need to show them what they are after in a short space and time-frame. Thus, when deciding to use animation in your app, incorporate animation only when it has a meaning and won’t distract the user from successfully completing what they intended to do. Keep Longevity in Mind Link \nEven good animation can be annoying when it’s overused. When designing an animation, ask yourself a question: “Will the animation get annoying on the 100th use, or is it universally clear and unobtrusive?” Animation shouldn’t be annoying.

Prototyping is the absolute best way to convey how you intend to use animation in your design. If you use interactive prototypes, you will get a clear picture as to what works and where the flaws in your app are hiding. Very often, this leads to a complete rework because the look of your animation differs from how it feels. Thus, iterate often and iterate fast! Iterating numerous times on even the tiniest detail will make your animation great. Create interactive prototypes using Adobe XD.

If you’re going to use animations in your designs, they should be built well, and that is only possible when an animation is a natural part of the design process. When done correctly, animation can turn a digital product from a sequence of screens into carefully choreographed memorable experiences. \nThis article is part of the UX design series sponsored by Adobe. The newly introduced Experience Design app 25 is made for a fast and fluid UX design process, creating interactive navigation prototypes, as well as testing and sharing them — all in one place. \nYou can check out more inspiring projects created with Adobe XD on Behance 26 , and also visit the Adobe XD blog to stay updated and informed. Adobe XD is being updated with new features frequently, and since it’s in public Beta, you can download and test it for free 27 . \n(ms, vf, aa, il)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T14:20:01.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
