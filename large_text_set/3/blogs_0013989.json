The actress dismissed all nepotistic claims on KJo asserting that her experience with the director was barely one movie old. However, owing to actress’ recent statements, this surely wasn’t her final word. Now, in an interview with NDTV, the self-proclaimed fashion icon has drooped off the appropriateness to let her stance known on the issue. To begin with, she finds the entire feud downright distasteful. In fact, she has even called it a “great bathroom read”. Here’s what she said – \n“I said it was very entertaining. Every morning I wake up and it’s great bathroom reading. It’s mudslinging of the worst kind. I don’t know Kangana. I know Karan very well. I find Kangana very entertaining and that’s about it. I don’t want to comment on something that looks opportunistic, honestly. And I believe you are a feminist when you build other people up, especially other women. All I can say is that I respect the choices that she has made in her career till now. I made a decision when I was very young after my second or first Koffee With Karan – it was that I would not do mudslinging when other actors and actresses are concerned because I would not do it for TRP’s, I would not do it for a channel and I felt if I have to give an opinion or be opinionated, it would have to be for something that is relevant and I don’t think dragging someone down or criticizing someone or having this public spat – I find it very distasteful. You can set examples without washing your dirty linen in public.” \nThe actress further went on to not take either side (but slyly did defend KJo for launching 12 directors…nicely done!). \n“Karan has only taken me in one movie – I Hate Luv Storys, 9 years back and if he really was someone who was a flagbearer of nepotism, I’m sure he wouldn’t have launched 12 directors. So, both of them are right in their own way. I just find this argument, something that I feel like, I don’t want to be a part of and I don’t want to comment on. I don’t see anything that is worth commenting on.” \nIn case you are still wondering where Sonam stands on this issue, she is definitely (although, low-key) fielding for team KJo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T04:59:19.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
