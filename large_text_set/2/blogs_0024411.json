Ranieri helped guide Leicester to the most unlikely title win in English football history but lost his job after becoming embroiled in a relegation battle in this campaign. \nSchmeichel wrote: “I would like to thank Claudio for everything he’s done for Leicester City Football Club, and for me personally. He deserves massive respect and huge credit for what he achieved here with us. \n“Thanks boss.” Senior player silence \nThe silence of the rest of the players speaks volumes. It lends credence to the story that senior players went to the board to try to get Ranieri fired. For Schmeichel to be the first to comment after more than a day of silence is strange. \nCraig Shakespeare is the club’s caretaker boss for their game against Liverpool on Monday night.
