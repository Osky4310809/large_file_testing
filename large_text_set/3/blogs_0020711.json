It might not win any safety awards, but the Ruston’s low profile gets you as close to the tarmac as you’re ever going to want to be, so nestle in and brace yourself for some tight turns and even tighter clenches.\nA unique and elegant addition to the Sports class, the Hijak Ruston is now available in GTA Online at Legendary Motorsport.\n\nStunt Races recently received a big addition with the Special Vehicle Circuit update and we’re expanding the toolbox for the Rockstar community to take things up a few notches. In addition to the Rocket Voltic, Ruiner 2000, and Blazer Aqua becoming available in the Stunt Race Creator, we’re adding a collection of new Props designed to highlight these vehicles’ unique abilities, including Hurdles, Boost Refills, and Explosive Crates.\nNew psychedelic Stunt Tubes will send racers on a trip through alternate dimensions, while destructible walls will leave some serious carnage in your wake as you power your way to victory.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:25:51.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
