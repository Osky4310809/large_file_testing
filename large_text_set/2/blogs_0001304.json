PHOTO | JOSEPH KANYI | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary It is essential that the security situation is addressed for all of those who live in Laikipia and for Kenya more broadly. This would require a response to the crimes committed, as well as a discussion of how local needs for water and pasture can be addres   \nIn the past four months, around 10,000 herders with 135,000 livestock are reported to have invaded private land – from large ranches and conservancies to small farms – in Laikipia. The herders have wreaked havoc. An unarmed guard and two herders have been killed. Property has been destroyed and looted. Three lodges have been forced to close, and one burnt to the ground. Livestock has been stolen. Wild animals have been killed, and locals live in fear. Unfortunately, the situation continues to deteriorate, with locals speaking of daily gunfire and increasingly uncertain economic futures. In part, the crisis is a result of an ongoing drought, which is exacerbated by the fact that large swathes of the semi-arid north never recovered from drought in 2014 due to poor rains in 2015 and 2016. This has led to problems of acute malnutrition in many counties. It has also taken its toll on livestock forcing pastoralists to move in search of water and pasture. This includes Samburu and Pokot from Samburu, Isiolo, Baringo and West Pokot counties who are said to make up the bulk of the Laikipia invaders. However, the invasions are not just about grass and water, they are also political. At one level, herders are emboldened by a narrative of historical land injustices. In this vein, and in an interview with The Times , the MP for Laikipia North noted how, “In my constituency there are a million hectares owned by 36 settlers. It’s very clear, it is white and black, and there’s historical injustices”. TO BENEFIT Such statements raise questions about whether some local leaders seek to benefit from events, or have even incited the herders to invade. Thus, according to a nephew of former President Kibaki (also cited in The Times): “It’s all about politics … The government is doing nothing to help the ranchers because nobody wants to lose votes by kicking out the illegal grazers”. For others, the electoral logic is even more direct and is, as one resident explained to The Guardian, about “Votes in exchange for grass and land grabs”. Such claims are difficult to prove. However, a poor security response has clearly encouraged an escalation of the problem. In short, the invasions have not occurred overnight, but slowly over the course of several months with herders from neighbouring counties likely emboldened by the example of earlier encroachers. These invasions are a problem for everyone living in the area, but also for Kenya more generally. Clearly, the greatest toll has been on the people who live and work in the area. Many articles have focused on the big ranches and conservancies, however workers and small-scale farmers have been similarly affected: many have lost small incomes, while livestock has been stolen and killed. In this vein, ‘Laikipia Land Invasions’ gives the example of 61-year-old woman who was planning to sell a goat to buy seeds and fertiliser to plant a one-acre farm when raiders stole her goats. In her words: “Now, we have nothing: no goats, no crop in the ground”. GREAT SUFFERING Such realities lead to great personal suffering. It also has a long-term impact on the local economy, as ordinary citizens cannot afford to cover school fees and other expenses, while the substantial investment and tax revenue from the large conservancies comes into jeopardy. It also increases insecurity in the area as raiders, and potentially other opportunistic criminals, take advantage of the chaos. Certainly, the invasions have gone hand-in-hand with other crimes. This includes the looting of private property and wildlife crimes – with at least six elephants reported to have been killed in the last two weeks. Finally, reports – which have sometimes made a false comparison to a Zimbabwe-style land invasion – do immeasurable damage to the country’s image, which then has a detrimental effect on investment and tourism. The latter only increased by the fact that the invasions have directly affected tourist attractions and lodges. As a result, it is essential that the security situation is addressed for all of those who live in Laikipia and for Kenya more broadly. This would require a response to the crimes committed, as well as a discussion of how local needs for water and pasture can be addressed.
