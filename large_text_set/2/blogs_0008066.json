So without wasting much time, let’s take a look at who make it to Bolly Insta this week. \nShahid Kapoor A photo posted by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST \nShahid definitely tops the list this week simply because he shared Misha’s first ever pic on social media! And this cutie has our hearts.. I mean, look at her pic, how adorable is she! Shahid was recently asked at an event when exactly would the world get to see Misha and he said that he was “waiting for a special occassion” to do it. And immediately on the next day, he shared Misha’s pic with Mira holding her in her arms.. Whattay pleasant surprise it was and within no time, the pic became the hot topic of the day. So, here’s hoping to see more of Misha Kapoor henceforth. \nHarshvardhan Kapoor \nA photo posted by Harshvardhan Kapoor (@harshvardhankapoor) on Feb 6, 2017 at 7:15am PST A photo posted by Harshvardhan Kapoor (@harshvardhankapoor) on Feb 9, 2017 at 4:57am PST \nHarshvardhan and Jacqueline came together for a mag cover and they have KILLED it with their super hot chemistry in these pictures. Both of them have been sharing pics and videos from behind the scenes and all we gotta say is they are too hot to handle! Check out their pics. \nShraddha Kapoor \nA photo posted by Shraddha ~ (@shraddhakapoor) on Feb 5, 2017 at 6:11pm PST \nShraddha is next gonna be seen in Haseena and what coould be a better platform than to introduce her film’s poster on social media? She looks fierce and fiesty on the first poster of Haseena. Don’t you agree? \nVarun Dhawan A photo posted by Varun Dhawan (@varundvn) on Feb 8, 2017 at 4:03am PST \nVarun and Alia have both started their promotions for Badrinath Ki Dulhania, their next movie together.
