Authors KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor Jr., both specialists in legal matters, have written The Campus Rape Frenzy , due out on January 24. Their book explores this phenomenon that has ruined the lives of many students who have been accused of things they’re innocent of, branded sexual offenders, and kicked off campus. It’s a deadly cocktail mixed with one part social justice and two-parts universities abandoning due process and joining the witch hunt. \nHere is a synopsis from the authors: \nThe frenzy about campus rape has helped stimulate—and has been fanned by—ideologically skewed campus sexual assault policies and lawless commands issued by federal bureaucrats to force the nation’s all-too-compliant colleges and universities essentially to presume the guilt of accused students. The result has been a widespread disregard of such bedrock American principles as the presumption of innocence and the need for fair play. \nEven more preposterous is how the Obama administration and the national media have helped fan the flames by spreading false statistics about campus rape and advancing a narrative of indifference to female “victims.” But by giving the many fake rape allegations a platform has unfortunately overshadowed the devastation felt by real victims of proven rape cases. \nThe top misinformation regularly reported is the “1 in 5” statistic — that is, one in five women will be sexually assaulted before she graduates. The Washington Free Beacon explains how this falsehood came to be: \nIt turns out the statistic was based on a single study of only two Midwestern schools that nowhere asked if women had been sexually assaulted or raped, but instead inferred the result from affirmative answers to questions about unwanted advances and sex under the influence. \nThe authors of The Campus Rape Frenzy note that sexual assault at this rate at prestigious Ivy League schools is akin to living in the Congo where rape is a war game. It sounds alarming, but it’s just not happening. Here’s what is happening as noted by The Beacon’s book review: \nIf you… have sex, your partner… can, under current rules, accuse you of sexual assault or rape if you kiss her or reach for her hand without her permission, can say that she was afraid of you when she did give permission and so was coerced, can claim that after a single drink she was under the influence of alcohol and therefore unable to give consent (you can be way drunker, but that doesn’t matter), and can make these claims months after the fact without you being aware that she has made them. \nThink that’s scary? What happens next is even worse. Following guidelines from the Obama administration Office of Civil Rights, you will likely be denied representation by a lawyer, forbidden from presenting exonerating evidence or asking questions of your accuser (who will invariably be referred to as the “victim” or the “survivor”), be subject to the decision of a college administrator who is under pressure to show that her (as it almost always is) institution is eagerly working with the federal government’s esoteric understanding of Title IX, and found guilty if there is a 50.01 percent chance you failed to get consent, or lost it at some point unbeknownst to you. The press will rake you over the coals and your future, now that you’re expelled and branded a sexual malefactor, will be compromised. \nOne only needs to look at the widely publicized Rolling Stone article about a gang rape victim at the University of Virginia which was retracted after the story fell apart, or the art major who paraded the mattress she was “assaulted” on by carrying it around campus. In both cases, the media accepted the claims, the university held kangaroo courts and found the accused guilty, and in both cases, they turned out to be hoaxes — a terrible disservice to actual victims of sexual assault. \nThe authors hope these cases can be tried outside of the university sexual assault review boards and in the criminal justice system where they belong so due process can happen. \nUntil then, The Beacon warns: \nSo men: Don’t go to a flossy East- or West-coast residential college. If you do, make sure you do not look at a woman with lust in your eyes, or touch her, or kiss her, or go further, without asking permission and getting it in incontrovertible form. Otherwise, you may be hauled before a court of extremists determined to find you guilty, expel you, and sully your name. So keep it in your pants, or just bag college and go do construction. Or sign up for courses with the University of Phoenix.
