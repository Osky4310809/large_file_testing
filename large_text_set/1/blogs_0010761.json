By Erin Strout Thursday, January 12, 2017, 11:47 am Dennis Kimetto and Emmanuel Mutai race the 2014 Berlin Marathon, where Kimetto set the world record. They will face off again at the 2017 Boston Marathon. Victah Sailer \nDennis Kimetto , the 32-year-old world record holder in the marathon (2:02:57) from Kenya, was added to the 2017 Boston Marathon professional field, officials announced on Thursday. \nThe men’s competition now includes seven athletes who have run faster than 2:05, including Kenyans Emmanuel Mutai (2:03:13), Patrick Makau (2:03:38), and Sammy Kitwara (2:04:28). Kimetto has struggled since setting the record in 2014, finishing two of the four marathons he started in 2015 and 2016. His best performance was 2:05:50 when he placed third at the 2015 London Marathon, though he placed ninth in 2:11:44 there last year.

She has a PR of 2:19:50 and will face nine other women with personal best times under 2:23:23, including Americans Shalane Flanagan (2:21:14) and Desiree Linden (2:22:38). Gladys Cherono, also from Kenya, enters with the fastest time in the field—2:19:25, set at the 2015 Berlin Marathon. \nBoston Marathon officials previously announced the American pros expected to compete on Marathon Monday. Included is Galen Rupp , who won the bronze medal in that marathon at the 2016 Olympics. He announced Thursday that he has withdrawn from the Houston Half Marathon this weekend, which serves as the 2017 half marathon national championship. \n“Unfortunately I will be unable to race on Sunday due to plantar fasciitis in my foot,” Rupp said in a written statement. “It is improving, but not enough to run a half marathon on.” \nFor more on the 2017 elite competition at the Boston Marathon see our previous stories on the international athletes and American runners .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T09:39:29.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
