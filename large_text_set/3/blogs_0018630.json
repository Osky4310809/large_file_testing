The merger is expected to be completed in calendar year 2018. \nIdea promoters will have rights to acquire an additional 9.5 percent in the company. Both idea and Vodafone will sell their respective tower businesses prior to the merger. \nThe merger has been in the works ever since the commercial launch of Reliance Jio 's operations in September. The entry of the largest private conglomerate into the telecom sector had forced other players, already reeling under high debt and competition to look at synergies and consolidation. \nLast month, PTI had reported that the UK firm and Aditya Birla group company are likely to finalise the deal within a month. \nThe British telecom major has brought its ex-India unit chief Marten Pieters to work on the proposed merger. Vodafone logo. Reuters \nThe combined entity will create India’s largest telecom firm with a revenue share of around 40 percent and a subscriber base of over 380 million, according to India Ratings and Research. \nThe proposed merger of Vodafone India and Idea will create an entity with a revenue of around Rs 77,500-80,000 crore besides eliminating duplication of spectrum and infrastructure capex, the rating agency said in its report. \nFurther, the spectrum of Vodafone India in seven circles and that of Idea in two, whose permits are expiring in 2021-22, is together valued at around Rs 12,000 crore as per last auction price. These permits are not in common circles, and hence there could be potential spectrum capex synergies between the two companies, the report said. \nHowever, given the present spectrum holding, revenue and subscriber base, both the companies need to work on synergy to comply with rules. \nAccording to the merger and acquisition rules, an entity should not hold more than 25 percent spectrum allocated in a telecom circle and 50 percent on spectrum allocated in a particular band in a service area. \nThe merged entity should also not have more than 50 percent revenue and subscriber market share. \nAs per CLSA report, the merged entity would breach revenue market share, subscriber and spectrum caps in five markets. \nThe combined entity as per present scenario will breach spectrum cap in 900 Mhz band in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala, Haryana and UP West and in 2500 Mhz band in Maharashtra and Gujarat, it said. \nCLSA estimated that the excess spectrum which would need to be surrendered or sold off is valued around Rs 5,400 crore and for the merger both the companies will also have to shell out Rs 5,700 crore for liberalising radiowaves that they were allocated administratively. \n(With PTI inputs) \n  09:45 am  08 am Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T06:48:12.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
