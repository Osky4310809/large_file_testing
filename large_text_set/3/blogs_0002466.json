The NFL all but said investigations were not required to be independent when trying to frame Brady for causing NE to be cold in the winter. Mar 6, 2017 8:38 AM \nJerry has his gold coat now. So he’s entitled. factschecker says: Mar 6, 2017 8:40 AM \nNFL owner by day, crime fighting private eye by night. \nQuincy sportoficionado says: Mar 6, 2017 8:41 AM \nOr that maybe the investigation yielded no results? it is now March 2017, this investigation had been ongoing for several months–with absolutely no tangible proof of any wrongdoing–when is it finally time to drop it? otheirony says: Mar 6, 2017 8:48 AM \nLOL…what do they actually do when they investigate? Talk about keystone cop wannabes…..how hard is this? Talk to the witnesses, if any, the main players, review any other evidence and make a decision. \nClowns. The NFL front office and chief BOZO is one Roger Goodell. \nSMH deneb1973 says: Mar 6, 2017 8:51 AM \n“If that’s the case, that suggests that the NFL’s investigations aren’t as independent as they should be.” The Shield has been and continues to be battered (not tarnished) by the inept leadership provided by Goodell – favoritism coupled with childish refusal to consider contrary facts has led to the perception that the NFL has become rife with jealousy and fundamental unfairness but until ownership in Pittsburgh, NY Giants and Dallas are gored by the monster they have created this will continue to be the story. thegronk87 says: Mar 6, 2017 8:54 AM \nJerry Jones: There is nothing to our super bowl aspirations either. Mar 6, 2017 8:55 AM \nWe know all about the legendary “independent investigations” of the NFL…. bradygirl12 says: Mar 6, 2017 8:58 AM \nThis reminds me of the Greg Hardy fiasco. “Nothing to see here, folks”, when actually, the guy WAS a loser. Skilled player, not so great person. Maybe Elliot is the same. Jerry may be in denial again.

Evidence, science, logic, and common sense not required. harrisonhits2 says: Mar 6, 2017 9:11 AM \n“The investigation has yielded absolutely nothing. We’ve successfully buried all evidence and protected another domestic violence abuser, just like the league normally does.” \nThere, fixed his statement for him. 52crabcakes says: Mar 6, 2017 9:15 AM \nagain the NFL does not care about domestic violence, females, males, fans, aliens, etc. They only care about the Benjamin! Whatever it takes.

Time for some testicular fortitude in New England. nhpats says: Mar 6, 2017 9:25 AM \nMaybe Jerry can tell us how the investigation into Andrew Luck’s broken ribs is progressing….
