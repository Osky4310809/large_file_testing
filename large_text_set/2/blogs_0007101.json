If it's to rest him so that he's fresh against Rennes [on Sunday] and he scores a goal for us there, then it's perfect coaching.\" Mario Balotelli has scored nine league goals since arriving at Nice \nBalotelli has scored nine league goals since joining Nice but has not found the net since December as the team have slipped from top to third in Ligue 1. \nOn Wednesday, Nice coach Lucien Favre said he felt Balotelli was \"lacking something\" physically. \n\"He's played a lot the last few weeks,\" Favre was quoted as saying by RMC , adding that the decision to put him on the bench had been \"a feeling -- an intuition.\" \nHe said: \"And that's it. It's one match, and we already have to move on to the next one. \n\"I'm counting on him for the end of the season. Things move quickly in football. I believe in him 100 percent.\" \nMark covers European football for ESPN FC.
