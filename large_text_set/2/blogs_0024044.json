Head chef Stuart Cauldwell has gone and stuffed an entire roast dinner into a burger. \nRead all the latest restaurant news and reviews \nThe so-called Ultimate Roast burger sees layers of carved Welsh Black roast beef stacked with lashings of carrot piccalilli and horseradish sour cream then topped with melted ale and mustard cheddar, curly kale and pickled red cabbage — all sandwiched between a roast potato, rosemary and garlic bun. The best Sunday roasts in London The best Sunday roasts in London 1/28 Blacklock, Soho \nThe roast at subterranean Soho chop house Blacklock is extraordinary. Opt for the All-In which offers a whopping sharing plate of beef, lamb, pork and all the trimmings. Succulent, juicy medium-rare meat is served along with crunchy pork crackling; enormous, chewy Yorkshires; exemplary, ultra-crispy duck fat roasties; a helping of assorted seasonal veg; and a large boat of deep-flavoured gravy made with juices caught from the grill. Come hungry to avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer generosity of it all — this roast is up there with London’s very, very best. Paul Winch-Furness 2/28 The Guinea Grill, Mayfair \nThere are three roast options, but there may as well just be one — it’s the beef which you must come for. The chateaubriand is for a minimum of two and comes with duck fat roast potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, honey-glazed baby carrots, baby parsnips and kale along with optional bacon. It is moist, tender, intensely flavoured and a seductive deep pink colour. There have been no waterbaths or fancy techniques involved, either — this is roast beef cooked as it always has been, only far better than it usually is. It doesn’t come cheap, however. Read our full review of The Guinea Grill's roast 3/28 Smokehouse, Islington and Chiswick \nMeat and fire are the specialities of this gastropub duo, which makes the Sunday roasts a safe bet. The traditional options are given twists that really make them stand out – like an option of pork ribeye served alongside pulled smoked pork shoulder, or a slow-smoked lamb shoulder. The supreme beef dripping roast potatoes are also noteworthy. Visit the website 4/28 The Bull & Last, Highgate \nHighgate might be leafier than some parts of London, but this gastro boozer has so much country pub charm that you’d easily believe you were well beyond the M25. The cooking is the right mix of hearty and cheffy while sourcing top produce (especially meat) is top of the agenda. It gets bonus points for a cracking beer selection. 5/28 Hixter, Bankside \nMark Hix’s Hixter restaurants major in meat, and the Sunday serves are among their best. As with the usual menu, the choice is between chicken or beef. The former comes as a half (leg and foot still attached) complete with stuffing and the latter as a large slab of pink-centred sirloin; both are expertly cooked. Add fluffy roast potatoes, sizeable Yorkshires and your own mini-jug of rich gravy and you’re on to a winner. Sister site Tramshed in Shoreditch is also worth a visit. And, as a bonus, kids eat for free at both restaurants. Visit the website 6/28 Pharmacy 2, Vauxhall \nMark Hix also looks after the food at Damien Hirst's Vauxhall gallery Pharmacy 2. So, if you want to try his signature roast in more unconventional surrounds, this might fit the bill. The choice once again is between chicken or beef. The menu offers two courses for £23.95 or three for £27.95, with a couple of options per course. Visit the website 7/28 Hawksmoor, various locations \nYou might think that Hawksmoor is all about the steak, but the clever team can whip up a mightily impressive roast dinner, too. As you might have guessed, it’s all about the beef. But while it’s the top notch meat that really makes it a winner, a gutsy onion and bone marrow gravy, tip-top tatties roasted in duck fat and pleasantly chewy Yorkshires all have a role to play. Visit the website 8/28 Roast, Borough \nSomewhere that is named after the Great British tradition of a roast dinner really ought to do a good. And thankfully Roast does. Though you’ll find an exemplary roast whatever your meat of choice, the rare, thinly sliced (but not meanly portioned) sirloin of beef is worthy of particular praise. Just bear in mind that it’s a restaurant not a pub – with both atmosphere and prices to match. Visit the website 9/28 Hack & Hop, the City \nThis City pub pairs craft beers galore with a very good Sunday Roast. If you’re in a group, the best way to sample it is by opting for the Sunday Sharing Feast, for three to four people. It features confit pork belly (impressively crunchy crackling), beef (served medium-rare and richly-flavoured), chicken (moist-fleshed and rubbed with lemon and thyme), a chorizo scotch egg, four fluffy Yorkshires, sweet potato mash, buttery greens, an abundance of excellent fluffy and crisp roasties, and plenty of rich red wine gravy. Read our full review of Hack & Hop's roast 10/28 The Marksman, Hackney \nThis Hackney Road boozer has had a bit of a spruce up and isn’t quite the local it once was, but thankfully it still retains a fair whack of character. Its roasts, which have long been a highlight, haven’t changed too much either – in fact, they may have got even better. Gutsy gravy and crispy roasties are high points, along with some well-aged beef that’s best enjoyed Barbie pink. 11/28 The Harwood Arms \nThis is no ordinary pub; it’s London’s first and only Michelin-starred pub. As such you can expect the food to well thought through and cooked with flair, and the prices to be a tad higher than other options. Gutsy portions of excellent quality meat are the star of the show and worth the extra cost, especially if you’re celebrating or feel your dinner warrants a slightly higher level of service to the average pub. Visit the website 12/28 Dean Street Townhouse, Soho \nThis plush but down-to-earth Soho eatery from the Soho HOuse Group is a perfect spot for a special occasion Sunday lunch. Choose between beef and chicken and enjoy the seamless execution of a unfussy British classic, with just a little fanfare. Visit the website 13/28 The Gun, Docklands \nSitting in a rather off-the-beaten-track location in the shadow of Canary Wharf, The Gun is a real find. Alongside its impressive waterside views and atmospheric terraces, it serves some splendid Sunday roasts. A whole free-range chicken for two to share is a highlight, and comes with pigs in blankets, Yorkshire puddings and cauliflower cheese. Visit the website 14/28 The Old Red Cow, Smithfield \nThe meaty main components at this Smithfield venue come from right across the road, and the kitchen clearly knows how to bring out the best in it – as they do the seasonal veg and accompaniments. Of all London’s top roast spots, this is the one where you’ll find the best selection of beer. You find fewer than 15 on tap at any time and there are a plentitude more bottles knocking around, too. Visit the website 15/28 Parlour, Kensal Green \nChef Jesse Dunford Wood has the helm at this Kensal Green gastropub, and that’s a very good thing indeed. Choose from sirloin of beef with fresh horseradish, chicken breast with bread sauce, or pork with apple sauce. Or opt for Dick Whittington's Knap Sack Chicken (which is salt-crusted) to share. The Yorkshires are plump and the gravy plentiful. This is fun, inventive cooking but it stays true to tradition. 16/28 The Duke of Cambridge, Islington \nRun by veg-box stars Riverford , this is the UK’s first certified organic pub. You can really taste how top-notch the produce is here, from the succulent meat to the delicately-cooked veg. Rest assured it’s all as seasonal as can be. Visit the website 17/28 The Dean Swift, Bermondsey \nSet just back from the river near Tower Bridge, this is a proper pub with a very accomplished kitchen rather than an out-and-out gastropub. Slow-cooked beef that makes the most of (rather than steering away from) the full-flavoured fatty parts is a particular triumph. An impressive array of both beers and board games complete the Sunday afternoon package. Visit the website 18/28 The Jolly Butcher’s, Stoke Newington \nThe quantity of meat dished up at Stokie hotspot The Jolly Butcher’s is impressive, but all the more so because it has the quality to match. Rich and plentiful gravy, crisp potatoes and tasty Yorkshires seal the deal. Visit the website 19/28 The Three Stags, Kennington \nThe kitchen operates to a strong eco ethos at this local pub near Lambeth North station. This means that not only can you can be sure of the meat’s provenance, but that much of the veg is locally sourced too – including some grown on a plot next door. If you’re dining in a group, try and reserve the semi-private Chaplin’s Corner at the far end of the pub, so-called because this is where Charlie Chaplin’s father used to sit drinking. Round off your roast with a pudding featuring honey made from the pub’s own rooftop hive. Visit the website 20/28 The Canton Arms, Stockwell \nIt may be the foie gras toasties at this south Lambeth pub which are really famous, but the roasts deserve a spot in the limelight too. The changing selection will often feature hunks of game, while a tendency towards slow cooking means those who like their meat tender are in luck. Visit the website 21/28 The Spaniard’s Inn, Hampstead \nOne of London’s oldest pubs, immortalised by Dickens in The Pickwick Papers, and quite possibly haunted – there’s a lot going on at this heathside boozer. But none of these things should distract from the roasts, which are well worth braving any ghouls for. A roast rib of beef and a loin pork with supremely crisp crackling take equal top billing, while a whole chicken with bacon and sage stuffing is a great option for sharers. Sides such as cauliflower cheese and creamed leeks to share at the table are also well received. Visit the website 22/28 The Mall Tavern, Notting Hill \nBeef, pork, chicken and nut roasts are served each week at this Notting Hill pub where the undisputed high points are well-flavoured meat, crispy roasties and plump Yorkshires. Visit the website 23/28 The Princess Victoria, Shepherd’s Bush \nThis high-ceilinged beauty of a pub used to be a gin palace but on Sundays it could be better described as a regal roast house. The devilishly good food is in the detail: the crackling on the pork is super-crunchy, the beef is tender and full of flavour, dripping-cooked potatoes are crisp and fluffy, and the chewy Yorkshires are picture perfect. 24/28 The Jugged Hare, City \nSunday roasts are cooked on the rotisserie at this meat and game-focused City pub. Choose from whole or half chickens, roast legs of lamb, aged rump of beef or a suckling piglet for two to share. Duck fat roasties are wonderfully crisp-coated, while the rotisserie gravy (made as the varying meats drip their juices while cooking) has to be among the best in London. Visit the website 25/28 Bacchus Sundays, Various locations \nThis roaming Sunday roast residency came about when Bacchus pub on Hoxton Street closed, taking its magnificent roasts with it. But there’s a silver(side) lining – there are now three different sites where you can enjoy the team’s roasts: The George & Vulture in Hoxton, The Star of Bethnal Green and The Star By Hackney Downs . Choose between pork belly with crisp crackling, half a chicken with wild boar stuffing or a 12-hour roasted sirloin of beef which is gloriously pink and tender. The vegetarian nut and seed roasts receive high praise, too. 26/28 The Duke of Wellington, Marylebone \nPossibly the most central of London’s great roasts, this Marylebone gastropub doesn’t hold back. It’s pork offer comes with roast leg meat and pulled shoulder, its lamb is oh-so-slowly cooked and its beef comes from the excellent Ginger Pig butchery down the road. The duck fat roast potatoes are exemplary, while homemade condiments and inventive veg are further pluses. 27/28 Jones & Sons, Dalston \nContrary to its minimalist layout, this Dalston bar and restaurant serves an impressively homely roast. Big portions of big-flavour meat, chewy Yorkshires, crisp potatoes, homemade horseradish sauce and forthcoming gravy top-ups all add to the appeal. Visit the website 28/28 The Anchor & Hope, Waterloo \nThis Waterloo longtimer was an early adopter of gastropub culture and remains one of the best food pubs in the capital despite growing competition. Sunday lunch options include plenty other than traditional roasts – from steak pie to roast and confit mallard – but it’s hard to beat the classics. A particular signature of the menu is the range of sharing plates and joints to carve at the table, such as a recently served seven-hour lamb shoulder and gratin dauphinois for three. Visit the website \nNot enough for you? It’s served accompanied by a red wine onion gravy. \nChef Stuart Cauldwell said: “We wanted to create something unexpected that was different to anything else on our menu, while still sticking to what Roast knows best.” \nThe burger costs a rather hefty £18.50 and is made with the same carefully-sourced produce as the restaurant’s tamer dishes, much of it coming from the neighbouring stalls within Borough Market.
