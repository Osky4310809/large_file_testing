He’s the one I will settle down with and marry,” she told Daily Star on Sunday . \nBut when asked about kids, she joked: “I love him and his company but I’m not prepared to carry something for nine months which would then ruin my body, steal my career and destroy my vagina. After all that what if it turns out to be a pr**k and I don’t even like it. Everyone says you will fall in love with your baby, but why?” \nVicky recently paid gushing tribute to John after he spent Valentine’s Day in hospital with her, where she was undergoing tests. \nShe said: “Happy Valentines to you all but most of all to my favourite human @johnnoblejn!!! I can't believe we're spending valentines in the hospital.. I'm so sorry but as long as I'm with you I am the happiest girl in the world! \n“Love you to the moon and back.” John shared this photo to Instagram (Photo: Johnnoblejn/Instagram) They spent Valentine's Day in hospital (Photo: Johnnoblejn/Instagram) Read More Vicky Pattison flaunts abs in crop top after furiously hitting back at claims she alters social media photos \nJohn, meanwhile, shared two images to his own Instagram showing Vicky lying in a hospital bed.

She's in great shape but had to go to hospital today for a blood test and antibiotics to ensure she's fighting fit again,” said her spokesperson.

He's more than my boyfriend, he's my best friend and the only man who's ever made me feel safe and loved... @johnnoblejn! Sorry I ruined Valentine's Day baby...
