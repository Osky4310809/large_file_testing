And Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs addressed the tough times, as well as the travel ban that may keep Iranian director Asghar Farhadi from the ceremony, in her opening remarks. \n“There are some empty chairs in this room, which has made Academy artists into activists,” she said. “Art has no borders… Strong societies don’t censor art, they celebrate it. America should not be a barrier, but a beacon.” Also Read: Iranian Director Asghar Farhadi Decides Not to Attend Oscars \nBut around the Hilton’s International Ballroom, the talk was more about movies than politics. With more than 150 nominees in attendance, including every acting nominee except Meryl Streep, Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, it was an afternoon for making new friends and renewing old acquaintances. \nRuth Negga chatted with “Kubo and the Two Strings” director Travis Knight before the lunch, and with short-documentary filmmakers Kahane Cooperman and Raphaela Neihausen after; Michelle Williams had to be torn away from a conversation with Isabelle Huppert so she could pose for photos with the rest of the “Manchester by the Sea” gang; and composer J. Ralph spotted Academy governor Annette Bening and talked to her about the upcoming film “Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool,” in which she stars and for which he’s writing the music. \nAt one point, one of the narrow aisles between tables was completely clogged by three of the stars of “The Help,” all of whom had been nominated for different films: “Fences” star Viola Davis and “La La Land” star Emma Stone, who are competing against each other in the Best Actress category, and “Hidden Figures” actress Octavia Spencer, nominated for Best Supporting Actress.

The nominees still make their way to a giant riser to pose for the traditional “class photo.” And the heart of the luncheon is still the mingling, which is both enforced by the seating arrangements and encouraged by the lengthy pre-luncheon cocktails and the post-photo mass of Oscar-nominated humanity. \nBefore that, though, the Oscar show producers got their usual chance to address the nominees, and to encourage them to keep their acceptance speeches short but also interesting. \nProducers Michael DeLuca and Jennifer Todd took a new course to do that: They introduced a film clip in which “Saturday Night Live” star Kate McKinnon played a fictional actress from the 1930s, Gloria Concave, who rather hilariously illustrated all the ways not to make an acceptance speech. \nAcademy governor Laura Dern then read the nominees’ names one by one as they took their places on a riser for the annual class photo. Viola Davis, Denzel Washington, Jeff Bridges and Mahershala Ali were among the nominees drawing the largest rounds of applause, but it’s foolish to read too much into the Oscar Nominees Luncheon Applause Meter: Last year, after all, the big hit of the lunch was Sylvester Stallone, who ended up losing the Best Supporting Actor award to luncheon no-show Mark Rylance. \nAnd hey, why are we turning this into a competition? That’s the whole point of the luncheon: For at least a couple of hours, everyone was (maybe) a winner. \nRead original story Inside the Oscar Nominees Luncheon: Time to Schmooze, With a Side of Politics At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.
