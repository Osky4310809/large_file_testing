The helicopter on a routine sortie when the incident took place in Allahabad’s Bamrauli. It has been learned that a Court of Inquiry has been ordered. \nA few months ago Indian Navy’s Chetak helicopter attached to INS Hansa base in Vasco made an emergency landing in South Goa after it developed a technical snag. Both the pilots on the carrier landed safely, a senior naval official said. \n“The Chetak helicopter developed low oil pressure. Any variation in oil temperature of a helicopter can cause a snag. The pilots adopted emergency procedures and landed safely in South Goa,” Indian Navy’s Flag Officer Commanding Goa Area (FOGA) Rear Admiral Puneet Bahl told PTI. \nThe helicopter had landed at a property owned by Lalit Group of Hotels in South Goa’s Canacona village at 7.15 AM. Bahl said a team of Navy officials has been sent to the spot, which is around 60 kms away from INS Hansa base. \nHe said both the pilots on board Chetak were safe and they followed correct emergency procedures prescribed in such a situation. “We have sent a team which will investigate and only after that we will come to know the exact reason for the possible snag,” Bahl added. \n(With agency inputs)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T06:37:24.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
