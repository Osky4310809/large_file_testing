The athletics program announced Sunday Boeheim's contract was extended beyond the 2017-18 campaign. The program's announcement acknowledged the extension came after Washington hired head coach-in-waiting Mike Hopkins to serve as the Huskies head coach. \"Mike accepting the position at Washington has put us in a unique position,\" Syracuse director of athletics John Wildhack said, per the release. \"The circumstances are different now than they were when he was named head-coach-in-waiting.\" In addition to Boeheim's extension, assistants Adrian Autry and Gerry McNamara will remain on the staff, with Autry moving up to associate head coach. Pete Thamel of Sports Illustrated previously wrote this season that \"Boeheim was essentially forced out because of Syracuse's significant NCAA issues. This doesn't sit well with him. People close to him still hold the belief that he'll somehow figure out a way to coach past next season.\" The NCAA's 2015 punishment of Syracuse included vacated wins and scholarship reduction. While there is the history of NCAA violations, Boeheim is one of the most accomplished coaches in college basketball history. The school's announcement noted only Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski has more wins, and Boeheim's 41 years with the program is the longest active streak in the nation. Boeheim has led the Orange to five Final Four appearances and three national championship games. He won the title in 2003 with superstar Carmelo Anthony and was named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005.
