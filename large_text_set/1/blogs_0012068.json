And that’s thanks in no small part to people like Rupert Myers. \nMyers, political correspondent for British GQ and the Telegraph, decided it would be a good idea to tweet this out earlier today: Members of the press continue to adjust to the post-Nov. 8 world with commendable grace and charm. pic.twitter.com/jUdpe99GN0 \n— T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) January 11, 2017 \nMyers’ tweet didn’t stay up for long. Why did you delete this tweet, @RupertMyers ? \nImagine a conservative said this in '08 about Obama. pic.twitter.com/4E7HhFYAKQ \n— Harry Khachatrian (@Harry1T6) January 11, 2017 @Harry1T6 it was a joke that I quickly realised could be taken out of context. you've proved my point \n— Rupert Myers (@RupertMyers) January 11, 2017 \nAh. So it’s readers’ fault for failing to get his crappy “joke.” Myers didn’t delete the tweet because he felt bad about it; he did it because he didn’t like being called out for his jackassery. LOL guys it's really not that slow a news day. I was just wondering if the president could pardon himself 😂 pic.twitter.com/i6GNmaB9c3 \n— Rupert Myers (@RupertMyers) January 11, 2017 \nExcept that’s not what he asked. And now, he’s paying for it: I'm in the middle of a small tweetstorm being attacked by truly daft & entirely humourless Trump supporters pic.twitter.com/2I2jXnMWkh \n— Rupert Myers (@RupertMyers) January 11, 2017 \nWhat a shame. \n— Scills Matthews (@scillsygirl) January 11, 2017 You called for the president elect to be murdered…… https://t.co/aWs2aMl2sU", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:35:03.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
