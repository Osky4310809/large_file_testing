Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMauricio Pocettino says he will dance on the White Hart Lane pitch with chairman Daniel Levy if Tottenham win the Premier League. \nSpurs made good on their promise to become the first team to stop record-chasing Chelsea’s 13-match winning streak on Wednesday night. \nThe 2-0 victory put Pochettino’s men firmly into contention for a shot at the title. \nPochettino, who previously promised to sing if Spurs win the FA Cup, has now vowed to put on another show if the club finish top. \n“Yes, maybe we try,” he said. “Why not? If we win the Premier League, I will do anything. We are in a good position – third in the table after 20 games.

The physical demand is massive but so is the mental one. \n\"Maybe dance with Levy on the pitch? OK maybe we try. Why not? If we win the Premier League I will do in the middle of the pitch.\" he joked. \nA number of Pochettino's key players are set to be rested for Sunday’s FA Cup third-round tie at home to Aston Villa. \nSpurs have not won the FA Cup since 1991. Pochettino - who clinched the Spanish Copa Del Rey twice with Espanyol, added: “I want to win titles because it means a lot for our players, our club and our fans. \n“We’ve played in a League Cup Final against Chelsea. I would like to go far in the FA Cup. The players too. We have a good tradition in the Cups.
