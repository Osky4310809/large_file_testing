And honestly, this has been the hardest blog entry. I’ve been putting it off. I’ve prayed over it. When Jay read it, I told him that this was not a great blog. It was not flowing right. It didn’t sound good. And Jay’s response was, “That’s because it’s the truth.” And he is right. Please understand that this story is still evolving. We are not over the struggle that we began a year ago. In fact today, before I sat down to post this and clean it up, JD and I had a fight. I spent the morning in tears. As I have stated already, life was happening quickly after the conversation. Things were a whirlwind, and what’s worse is that we didn’t even know everything yet. As if your son telling you he was gay was not enough, we quickly discovered JD had other things he was hiding. When we discovered the secret account, we did what most parents would do. We flipped out. We confiscated his phone and laptop. We demanded him to write down every account he had, the usernames and passwords. We wanted to know everything. Needless to say this didn’t go over well with JD. He did what we asked. But there was a lot of fighting. A lot of screaming. A lot of slamming things. It was not pretty and it was escalating frighteningly fast. Jay cried at night in bed. I couldn’t. I was numb. I held him instead. To make a long complicated story short, JD had gotten involved with an online group. It was, and is not, an inappropriate group. It is, however, not for someone who is young and discovering who they are. For a few months, JD had connected with this group. He had lied about his age, and was finding acceptance where he felt he could. And here I must remind you that Jay and I had not been in a good place for some time. Instead of focusing on JD, we were focusing on our marriage. It was crumbling. And we were barely surviving. And because Jay and I were struggling to come to grips with a marriage that was about to end, we had left JD to his own devices. And for that, we will always regret. It is an embarrassment to us both. Not because that is what “turned JD gay”. Neither of us believe that being gay is “a choice”. What we do believe, and know, is that during a time JD needed his parents the most, we had failed him. And we have apologized to him, together and one on one. And we’ve given our sin to God, and we know that we are forgiven. Let me also point out that Jay and I do not have a church family. We were greatly involved in a church in Montgomery. JD grew up in this church until we moved to Opelika. We tried to find a church up here, but never felt comfortable anywhere. And soon, we just quit trying. This is not something that I am proud of. Because JD has not known the love and teachings of Christ that I did as I was growing up. Another failure on my part as his mother. Also, JD went through a phase in his life where he was scared to go to sleep. It was when he was younger, and it was nightly. I would sit in bed with him and talk to him. I would hold him. He was scared that if he died, what would happen? I explained Christ’s love for him. I did my best to comfort him. This was about the time the book “Heaven is for Real” was out and popular. I’d never read it, so I asked a friend of mine who had if she thought it was age appropriate for JD. She said yes. I bought the book, and JD read it. And as he was reading it, we were actually going to a local church semi-regularly. JD agreed to go to the Sunday School class for his age because he knew the teacher. She taught at my school, and he loved her. He had to have been in about fourth grade I guess. Again, “Mother of the Year Award” to this gal for not remembering his age at this time. One day as we left church he told me, “Mom. I get it.” I asked what he was talking about and he explained to me that they had read the story of Lazarus. It was a short play that they acted out, and he got to be Lazarus. And from that story, he understood the salvation of Christ. It clicked. I was in tears. Never again was he scared to go to sleep. I had to tell you all of that for you to understand this next part...like I said before, this is the blog entry I’ve been dreading. We made JD delete the account he had with this online group. We watched him do it. He did it through tears and a lot of yelling at us. He felt that we were taking him away from the only friends he had. He thought if he let go of this group, he had no one. Looking back on that now, I understand what he meant. But at the time, all we could do was what we knew to do. Protect our son. Jay told him that if he caught him back on that account, that Jay himself would go online and tell these people the truth about JD’s age. And he would tell them not to contact JD ever again. JD was furious, and he shut down. Over the next day or so we attempted to keep dialog open with him. We tried to talk to him, ask him questions. And he would grow increasingly mad. He felt he was just being who he was. He hadn’t changed. Why did we not see that? He was still JD. Being gay was not changing who he was. He was the same, it was us who had the problem. Not him. And in a way, he was right. To us, the whole world was upside down. About a day or two after JD told us he was gay (again the days all run together), I asked him a question. He had shut down, and we were not welcomed into his personal life. But I had a question that had been bothering me since the night of the conversation. You ever say something, and then immediately realize that it did not come out how you meant? That you meant something totally different than the words that just flew out of your mouth? Yeah, imagine that feeling for a minute. I asked, “JD, do you still consider yourself a Christian if you are gay?”...it came out so blunt. I didn’t mean it as it sounded. I just was struggling trying to figure this whole thing out. He looked at me with a dark look and said one word. It stopped my heart, and I know it stopped Jay’s as well. He said, “No.” I asked him why. His response was, “Mom. Why would I want to worship a God who created me the way I am, but tells me the way I am is wrong? I don’t want to be a part of any God like that.” And here is where Jay and I began to realize how much of an influence some of the people in this online group had had on JD. And once again we were heartbroken. That night, Jay cried. He told me, “Tiffani. I can deal with him being gay. But I can’t deal with not seeing him again after death.” All I could do was hold Jay. And hurt with him. I still couldn’t cry. The next day, Jay and I were in a fog. What we’d discovered continued to uncover itself. Jay began digging into JD’s accounts, and was texting me throughout the day with screenshots. We were grief-stricken. And lost. I did the only thing I knew to do. I asked Jay, and with his consent, I texted my hairdresser. A bit of background here, Karesa Adams is the parent of one of my former students. I asked her daughter who did her hair one day, and she said her mom. And from that day forward, Karesa has cut all of our hair. I taught her daughter when she was in the 7th and 8th grades. She is graduating from college this year. Karesa, and her family, are close to my heart. In my text I told Karesa that Jay and I needed to talk to her and her husband, Chuck. (Chuck is a preacher man.) Jay and I needed guidance. We needed help. I told her that it was an emergency, and if at all possible could we come to their house that night. She knew it was something about JD, and that this was out of character for me. She immediately said yes. We told JD that we were going to the Adams’ house. He kind of looked at me. I explained to him that we had to talk to someone. We needed someone to pray with us. Surprisingly, he said ok. It’s funny the little details you remember sometimes. When we arrived at their house, the fireplace was roaring. I immediately took off my shoes and sat down in front of it. Jay never took off his jacket. Karesa had coffee, or hot chocolate, or something. I declined her offer for a cup. Jay sat across from me on their loveseat. It snowed that night. Karesa and Chuck waited for us to begin. Jay looked at me, and I just said it. “JD told us the other night that he is gay.” I remember Karesa saying, “Oh thank God! I thought you were gonna say someone was pregnant.” I just looked at her. She didn’t mean or say it in any type of cruel way. I understood what she meant. I replied, “No. No. I wish that was why we are here.” Because at that moment in my life, that minute, JD becoming a father would have been more preferable to me than him being gay. I’m sure in the \"Baptist Preacher Man School\" they teach you about how to deal with grieving widows, unexpected deaths, sudden illness, broken marriages, budgeting, handling idle gossip, and all that goes on with a church. But I’m pretty sure they don’t teach you how to deal with parents who have a homosexual child. How to help parents who are holding on to nothing more than their faith in God. How to minister to parents who literally show up on your doorstep looking lost and confused. How to comfort these parents over the loss of a child that isn’t dead, but still living. How to embrace their child, who is not what religion or society says he should be. Chuck’s response was unreal. We were desperately looking for answers, for guidance. Someone to tell us what to do. And what was offered instead was unconditional love and support. Not one trace of judgement. Not one negative word. We poured out what we could of our hearts. I gave Chuck JD’s cell number. (When we got home that night, I told JD what I had done. He was fine with it. Chuck would later call JD and leave a message. JD texted back, but never opened up to Chuck. At least JD knew someone, besides us, was there for him.) That night at their house, we told them everything. Shock was still in our system just from JD being gay. Adding on to that with all of this other made it a struggle to even breathe. They listened. Chuck offered words of comfort and of peace. Karesa offered us her warm and loving spirit of hospitality. God knew exactly what we needed that night. We left after standing in a circle and praying. We went home, things were somewhat quiet. And we went to bed. Over the next few days, and unbeknownst to JD, we put a tracking software on his phone. He was allowed to have his phone only at school (at this time he could not drive and we had to stay in touch for rides after school/practice). Very quickly, JD made another account. We were not shocked, but very hurt. After all, we’d told him that we loved him. We supported him. We were there for him. To us, he didn’t need this group anymore. He had us, Chuck, and his friends. Yet in the midst of all of this chaos, we’d still failed to notice how JD had lost touch with a lot of his close friends. We were blind to a lot, but I think it was God’s way to get us through the days. For a long time, Jay and I were living minute to minute. We’d text each other throughout the day “Are you ok?”.... “How are you?”…. “It’s gonna be ok somehow”…“We can do this”…. Miraculously our marriage was beginning to grow stronger. Which was a good thing because once Jay discovered JD had lied and betrayed us, he went online and told the group exactly what he promised JD he would do. Jay and I would soon realize we would need each other now more than ever in our 18 years of marriage. My child, who was once a loving sweet kind-hearted boy began turning into someone we did not recognize. His anger grew into rage. And that rage came at us with a fury. For some reason, I seemed to be the target of most of it. Which hurt me tremendously. JD and I had always been close. We’d always gotten along. But now, he’d turned on his mother. And it was brutal. To say the fighting between the three of us was intense is an understatement. I can’t tell you exactly what the fighting was all about, because it differed day to day. But we lived in a constant state of a broken home. My only sanity was work and the gym. I dreaded coming home. So did Jay. And so did JD. These were dark awful days. As part of his punishment for lying to us, JD had no Internet access. Jay took the router with him to work. Yet no matter how hard we tried to keep him off the Internet, JD still found a way to access it. It’s like running on a hamster wheel. No matter how hard or how fast you run, it doesn’t stop. The constant struggling doesn’t stop. The wheel doesn’t stop. The Internet is everywhere. We were growing increasingly tired of fighting this war of preventing him from getting on the Internet. On top of him sneaking onto the Internet without permission, lying to us, disrespecting us, and having an awful attitude, his anger and his outbursts were becoming more and more aggressive. Jay and I slept in shifts. We hid the knives. We hid the gun. We hid all of our car keys. When we left the house, we took them with us. We were so worried. I called the school multiple times to make sure JD was there. At different times of the day. We were so scared we’d lose him at any moment. Was JD going to run off with some of these people online? Or was he just going to run away? Was he going to hurt himself? And if I’m really being honest with you, and being truthful to the reason for this blog, was JD going to hurt us? We took JD’s door off of its hinges. All electronic devices were taken out of his room. We listened throughout the night for movement. We waited to hear for the sound of a window sliding open. We quietly breathed so we wouldn’t miss the front or back doors opening. All of this night after night after night after night... ​Jay would cry quietly in bed. I would hold him. I still couldn’t cry. We slept holding hands every night. Without each other, we had nothing. JD didn’t want us to tell anyone, not even our parents, that he was gay. So we had noone to talk to. Chuck and Karesa helped and texted as much as they could. But ultimately Jay and I were alone in this hell.
