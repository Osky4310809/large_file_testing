Boeing has publicly debuted what astronauts on its Starliner craft will be wearing, and it looks like a big improvement. \nChris Ferguson, former astronaut and now leader of Boeing’s Starliner Crew and Mission Systems, showed off the suit for the cameras yesterday . \nThis one isn’t for doing spacewalks, but rather for getting the astronaut from the staging area of the launch to the relative safety of the space station, and vice versa. It still needs to be airtight and resistant to extreme temperatures and other “extremis” situations — just not to hard vacuum and cosmic radiation. But there was definitely room to improve on the bright orange Advanced Crew Escape Suits made by NASA since the ’90s. \n“We’ve simplified the suit,” Ferguson said in a Boeing video. “Astronauts formerly had these relatively bulky heavy suits with thick neck rings, and we learned throughout the years maybe we didn’t need that.” 32141923950_c6a9a6069f_k", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T01:57:07.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
