His visit to CIA headquarters on his first full day in office, an overture designed to repair relations, was undone by his ego and bluster,\" Price said. \n\"Whether delusional or deceitful, these were not the remarks many of my former colleagues and I wanted to hear from our new commander in chief. I couldn't help but reflect on the stark contrast between the bombast of the new president and the quiet dedication of a mentor — a courageous, dedicated professional — who is memorialized on that wall.\" \n\"I know others at CIA felt similarly,\" he added. \nPrice described the \"final straw\" as the White House's release of a directive reorganizing the National Security Council (NSC) in January which saw the CIA director and the director of national intelligence removed from the NSC's principals committee and the president's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, included. Due to a public outcry the CIA director was subsequently reinstated. \nRead the full Washington Post's article here . \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:37:06.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
