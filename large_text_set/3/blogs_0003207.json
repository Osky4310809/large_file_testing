It runs a good continuous 12 hours.\nhundreds of hours in a playlist .\n\n\n\nYou’re more a Star Trek fan? Ok, try nodding off to the idling engine noise of a ship featured in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Mr. Nirvosa cleaned up a sample from the show and then looped it for 24 hours. That makes for one long sleep.\n\n\n\nOr how about 12 hours of ambient engine noise generated by the USCSS Nostromo in Alien? \n\n\n\nFinally, and perhaps my favorite, Cheesy created a 12 hour clip of the ambient sounds made by the Tardis, the time machine made famous by the British sci-fi TV show, Doctor Who . But watch out. You might wake up living in a different time and place.\nFor lots more ambient sci-fi sounds (Star Wars, The Matrix, Battlestar Galactica, etc. ) check out this super long playlist here .\nvia Dangerous Minds \nFollow Open Culture on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Google Plus , and Flipboard and share intelligent media with your friends.
