Carmelo Anthony’s future was up in the air around the trade deadline, Charles Oakley was briefly banned from Madison Square Garden, and Brandon Jennings was surprisingly waived last week. \nTo make up for all the miscues, the Knicks experimented with something new Sunday against the Golden State Warriors. Rather than playing music and playing videos on the video board, the Knicks went old-school and kept it completely silent in the first half.
