How bow dah?” \nNow, I can officially say I perhaps misjudged cats… even though I am definitely trademarking “Cats meow outside. How bow dah?” \nOriginally, I believed cats were demons trapped in the form of fur, hellbent on murdering their unsuspecting owners. However, it turns out cats aren’t so bad after all. \nIn fact, I’d even go so far as to claim cats are actually our friends, and that’s coming from a fierce dog lover. \nAccording to a new study from Oregon State University published in “Behavioural Processes,” cats love your company more than they love food. But… how are we just learning about this now? \nThe researchers of the study wrote , \nIncreasingly cat cognition research is providing evidence of their complex socio-cognitive and problem solving abilities. Nonetheless, it is still common belief that cats are not especially sociable or trainable. This disconnect may be due, in part, to a lack of knowledge of what stimuli cats prefer, and thus may be most motivated to work for. \nA total of 50 cats (both pet and adoptable cats) were studied. The cats were not given any human attention, toys and food for a few hours. \nAround half of the cats went for a chin rub first instead of food, while 37 percent of cats wanted food first.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:05:04.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
