The 650S successor will be the first of 15 new cars scheduled in McLaren’s Track22 business plan, and the launch will be the first time McLaren has ever built a second-generation version of one of its road cars. \n-McLaren made the announcement by releasing an image of the the Monocage II, the next version of the company’s carbon-fiber body tub that serves as the structural foundation for its cars. This new one helps lower the new car’s weight to a claimed 2829 pounds, which McLaren said is 40 pounds lighter than a similarly equipped 650S.\n-McLaren says the reshaped Monocage also allows for a bigger entrance and lowers the door sill to allow easier access and better overall visibility from inside the cabin. It was also built to give the new generation Super Series a lower center of gravity.\n- - McLaren MSO HS: This Upgraded 650S Is So Special, It’s Already Sold Out - By Design: McLaren 570S Editions Offer That Bespoke Feeling at a Discount - McLaren 650S: Full Info, Specs, Reviews, Pricing, Photos, and More - -Internally, the new car is code-named P14, and from sources at McLaren, we’ve learned that it will first launch with a traditional powertrain, followed by a hybrid version. As confirmed by spy shots in the accompanying photo gallery, we can expect a wild new design with all sorts of aero tricks and treats. We’ll know more details about power, pricing, and specs when McLaren officially lifts the sheet on March 7. It probably won’t drive itself or move an inch on battery power, so we’re kind of looking forward to the novelty of such a thing at a major auto show.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:48:48.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
