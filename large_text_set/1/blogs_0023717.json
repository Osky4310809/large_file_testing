That wall contains the stars of CIA officers who’ve given their life for this country. That’s as close as you can get to hallowed ground at the CIA. It’s the equivalent of speaking at Arlington Cemetery.” \nHe said Trump needs to understand that he’s president now and “doesn’t have to spend time embellishing himself.” \nPanetta acknowledged that it’s sometimes hard for people to get out of campaign mode and move on to governing, but said, “I just got the impression that when he was speaking there he forgot he was President of the United States.” \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:47:36.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
