The event is part of Rokerthon , Roker’s annual trek across the country to break world records. \nUT is attempting to bring out 4,000 students, faculty, staff, and alumni to break the record. Guinness representatives will be on site to certify the record. \nUT Chancellor Beverly Davenport said the event is a unique way for students, faculty, staff, and alumni to share their Volunteer spirit. \n“Standing together in Neyland Stadium with 4,000 members of our Volunteer family will be a shared memory that will last a lifetime,” Davenport said. \nQueen’s University in Kingston, Canada, currently holds the record . The university earned the record in September 2016 with 3,373 participants. \nRoker is visiting five universities during the week, with UT being his third stop. The Daily Beacon , UT’s editorially independent student newspaper, created the entry video that helped bring Rokerthon to UT. \nGuinness rules require that the T be formed only by students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Therefore, entry to the stadium will be restricted to those participants. \nTo register, visit tiny.utk.edu/WorldRecord .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:03:50.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
