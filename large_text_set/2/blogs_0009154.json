Instead, he’ll embark on putting together the kind of personnel who will be able to run his chosen offense. \nAs a result, it will take some time to get the 49ers offense to the point at which the players can run the offense the way Shanahan wants it to be run — with quarterback obviously being the most important factor. \nNew G.M. John Lynch declined to provide a timeline for the adjustment of the offense to the Shanahan approach during a visit to PFT Live that will be included in Wednesday’s show. For those of you who frequent the website, you get a preview. And by preview I mean the entire, wide-ranging, 20-minute, unedited interview. \nEnjoy. And then tune in for Wednesday’s edition of PFT Live at 6:00 a.m. ET on NBC Sports Radio, followed by a temporarily shortened simulcast that launches at 7:30 a.m. a.m. ET on NBCSN.
