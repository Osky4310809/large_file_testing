Pride weekend \nThe decision to leave the order intact, the statement said, was Trump’s.\nLess clear is whether Trump will put forth any other executive actions that affect the LGBT community negatively. So-called “religious liberty” provisions could allow widespread discrimination, and for that reason alone, it’s vital the public holds the President’s feet to the fire.\nWhile Trump has consistently opposed marriage equality, he has said his view is “ irrelevant ” as the law has been settled by the courts. However, he has stated that on issues like abortion, the law is less iron clad. One of his first actions as president was to ban any federal funding to international health organizations that perform or provide information on abortions.\nRelated: West Coast LGBT protest planned to coincide with National Pride March \nWith a Supreme Court nomination expected Tuesday, both issues have the potential to take center stage.\nIt’s tough to really chalk this up as a victory when, as HRC president Chad Griffin said, “LGBTQ refugees, immigrants, Muslims and women are scared today, and with good reason.”\n \n’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T09:44:35.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
