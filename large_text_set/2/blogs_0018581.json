A Swedish library has landed in hot water for freely offering Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf to its readership, while stopping books that question Sweden's established view of immigration. This has evoked troubling hints at censorship in a country that takes pride in its openness. Fed-Up Swedish Cop Lashes Out Against Immigrant Crime, Political Correctness Recently, the Ekerö library decided against lending Mass Challenge, a new book by the Kurdish-Swedish economist Tino Sanandaji, which addresses the social and economic effects of immigration on Swedish society. The library accused the author of \"supporting racism\" and \"being contrary to basic human rights.\"\nThe book, which flew off the shelves in its first edition, offers an assortment of facts from Statistics Sweden, the National Crime Prevention Council, the National Board of Health and other agencies, which present the recent years' mass migration to Sweden in an unflattering light. \n\"Library collections should be characterized by diversity and pluralism. The goal is not to buy books that support racism, express gender stereotypes, rouse persecution and hatred or are otherwise contrary to human rights,\" Ekerö librarian Nina Sundberg wrote in an e-mail to the Swedish news outlet Nyheter Idag in her attempt to justify rejecting Sanandaji's book. — Eddie Donovan (@EddieDonovan) 3 января 2017 г. \n​Paradoxically, a cursory view of the library's assortment revealed no lack of literature for people seeking to familiarize themselves with National Socialism, including Adolf Hitler's policy book Mein Kampf, which lays the foundations of Nazism and anti-Zionism and has been banned in Russia and other European nations for decades. \"It all becomes very clear. Censorship is hitting you in the face,\" Marina Halkiewicz, an angry reader who unsuccessfully tried to borrow Sanandaji's new book, told Nyheter Idag. © AFP 2016/ TT NEWS AGENCY / DRAGO PRVULOVIC See Not, Speak Not: Sweden Continues to Hide Immigrant Crime Statistics Tino Sanandaji himself is aware of the library ban and believes the Ekerö librarians owe him an apology. \"Municipal libraries are not a playhouse for the cultural left's censorship. It is bordering on libel to claim that rules against 'racism' can justify the exclusion of my book. Ekerö library owes me an apology,\" Tino Sanandaji wrote. \nMass Challenge was written and published as a result of a record influx of Swedish crowdfunding. It was released in early February and quickly became a bestseller at bookshops Bokus and Adlibris, which is highly uncommon for a book on the national economy and social science.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:27:25.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
