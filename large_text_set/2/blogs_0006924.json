The NBA announced its NBA 2K eLeague partnership earlier Thursday, a joint venture in which all 30 NBA organizations could eventually have e-Teams of their own. \nDelaware North, which owns and operates TD Garden, where the Bruins play, announced a strategic partnership with Splyce, an eSports team that has teams and players around the world who compete in such video games as League of Legends, Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. \nJeremy Jacobs, who owns the Bruins, is chairman of Delaware North, a Buffalo-based hospitality and food services company with annual revenue of about $3 billion.
