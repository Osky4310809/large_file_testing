While an exact timetable for Bridgewater's return was difficult to determine given the extent of the injury, it was assumed that Bridgewater would in fact be ready to play next season. Whether or not that will be the case remains to be seen, but Zimmer is going to wait until Bridgewater is fully healthy before looking at any sort of quarterback competition. \n\"We will worry about those things later,\" Zimmer said, speaking about the potential of a QB controversy. \"Sam has done remarkable, the things he's done this year with all the things he's had to do.\" \nAs for Bradford's take on potentially being the starter next season, it wasn't even a thought that had crossed his mind. \n\"That is so far of my radar. I haven't even begun to think about next year,\" Bradford said post-game on Sunday. \" Obviously this year has been a whirlwind since the day I got here...I'm definitely going to take some time and catch my breath for awhile.\" \nBridgewater is continuing to rehab and such a process will be closely tracked, but from everything Zimmer told media members Tuesday - and not surprisingly, I might add - it appears as though Bradford will be the starter until Bridgewater is healthy and ready to play. As Zimmer said, Bradford has earned it. Check out Vikings.com for more information and Minnesota Vikings coverage throughout the year!
