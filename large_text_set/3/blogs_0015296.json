She has revealed her own experience of being objectified and harassed in the professional sphere. \n\"A few years ago, a message on my phone reduced me to tears in the car. I had reached the breaking point after months of suggestive messages from a wealthy, powerful client that I had been pretending not to understand because all I wanted to do was to complete the project in a professional manner. And, so, I ended up as a statistic - the 38% of women who faced sexual harassment at work, according to a survey done by the Indian National Bar association. I am a fairly assertive woman, and married to a man who onscreen punches holes in walls with his bare fists and yet I haven't been spared, so I shudder to think about what happens to the vast majority of working women.\" \nFurther, she says that calling a woman \"'sexy' is an acceptable compliment within a work environment only if she is a stripper and you are her pimp trying to boost her confidence before she takes the stage.\" This was in response to Arunabh's comment in an interview, \"I am a heterosexual single man and when I find a woman sexy, I tell her she is sexy. I compliment women. Is that wrong?\" \nWell, now you know Mr. Kumar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T10:25:48.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
