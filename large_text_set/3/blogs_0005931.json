The controversiality is because it's drugs.\" 'Not unusual' \nMr Hogg said the UK had the highest rate of heroin, cocaine and ecstasy use across the European Union with drug-induced deaths totalling 45 people per million compared with 17 per million in the EU. \nAiming to introduce the scheme \"by the end of this year\", he added the force's public health partners were working out the cost of administering the drug to users twice-daily. \nHe previously mooted such a move in 2013 . \n\"If we go back to the 1960s, doctors used to prescribe heroin as a means of treating someone back to recovery. It's not that unusual,\" he said. \n\"We've got to consider the Misuse of Drugs Act has been in since 1971 and we haven't arrested the way out of the problem, have we?\" \nA Home Office spokesman said there was evidence \"supervised use of [diamorphine] in a medical environment as part of a treatment plan can help keep patients in treatment and out of criminal behaviour\". \nHowever, David Raynes of the National Drug Prevention Alliance, warned the move \"will not stop addicts being addicts\". \n\"It doesn't stop people using street drugs,\" he said. \n\"It may reduce crime marginally, but it doesn't reduce crime permanently.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T14:34:45.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
