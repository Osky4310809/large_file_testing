We've had a week to process the experience, nurse our hangovers, and realize that we're richer for the memories. Things fell from drones, balls were thrown and dodged, people ran around. Truly, it was a revelation. \nThere may not be any drone-related challenges during the Super Bowl tomorrow afternoon, but it should be entertaining enough. And with the good and strong Atlanta Falcons challenging the relentless and potentially evil New England Patriots for some shiny rings, musicians have made their allegiances clear. \nA photo posted by QuavoHuncho (@quavohuncho) on Feb 3, 2017 at 3:44pm PST \nThose right there, according to Quavo, belong to Julio Jones, the Atlanta Falcons' star wide receiver. It's unclear if he'll be wearing his Culture -themed cleats during the game—the NFL hates it when players have fun—but we live in hope. \nAccording to TMZ , Migos have taken their faith in the Falcons to another level, staking a $300,000 bet on the outcome of the game. They join 2 Chainz in betting on the Falcons, though he wouldn't say how much he'd placed on the game (TMZ refer to it as a \"FAT STACK\" so I think it's fine to take them at their word). \nThe Falcons now cannot lose. \nFollow Noisey on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:10:01.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
