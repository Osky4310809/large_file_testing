Where has the time gone?\nThe Love Actually Red Nose Day special airs Thursday, May 25 at 10/9c on NBC.\nTra-la-laaa! It's the first 'Captain Underpants' trailer \nBrilliant cat shows off its ball-finding skills, proving it's smarter than us all \nAttractive people like Zac Efron run down the beach in slow-mo in new 'Baywatch' trailer \nStephen Colbert and Ryan Reynolds ask each other shower thoughts on a cozy blanket while staring at the stars", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:35:46.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
