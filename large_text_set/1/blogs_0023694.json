Trump has repeatedly said he will try to make Mexico fund it and on Thursday afternoon, his administration finally floated an idea of how they might make that happen: a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico.\nSEE ALSO: All the times the former president of Mexico shut down Trump's 'f*cking wall' \nIf that tax were imposed, it would be way more difficult — and way more expensive for regular Americans — to get Mexican imports, among other potential problems. According to the U.S. Trade Representative website , Mexico was \"the third largest supplier of goods imported in 2015.\" \nThe Trump tax, which is not yet a policy proposal , would apply to things produced in Mexico like vehicles, machinery, fruit, vegetables and perhaps even some of Trump's own suits . But the main thing people on Twitter seemed concerned with? The avocado. \nOn Thursday, avocados became a rallying point for jokes on Twitter as people tried to cope with an economically and diplomatically troubling idea. \nBecause if you didn't laugh, you'd cry. \nStock up on avocados and cane sugar cokes while you still can!\n— Dan Francoeur (@DanFrancoeur) January 26, 2017 \nGuys! This is my chance. I'm gonna import avocados into Canada and then smuggle them down into USA. I'm gonna be white girl rich.\n— thirsty Ryan parody (@CharmingGrump) January 26, 2017 \nStock up on avocados and tortillas, everyone. Gonna be a l ng period of dysfunctionally psychotic trade policy\n— Jesse Singal (@jessesingal) January 26, 2017 \nThis will seriously become the first locus of political outrage over Mexican trade: guacamole shortages at Chipotle.\n— Josh Barro (@jbarro) January 26, 2017 \nI'm gonna miss avocados/democracy\n— No Puppet (@eastsidekate) January 26, 2017 \nExiting a meeting to find out avocados will probably be getting more expensive is like reliving Election Day all over again.\n— Shelbie Bostedt (@ShelbieLBostedt) January 26, 2017 \nMiddle America - sorry. Enjoy the last of your Mexican avocados.\n— yobagoya (@EdenMW) January 26, 2017 \nThe attention on the beloved and already expensive fruit is not new: It made cameos on viral post-election protest signs that took aim at America's racial divide. \nTop 3 protest sign @HiMyNameIsSeton #Avocado pic.twitter.com/xhNmDAqITg \n— Barrett Rogness (@barrett92673) November 11, 2016 \nOf course, avocados are far from the real problem here. To start, there's the potential economic impact of a trade feud with Mexico alongside disastrous humanitarian implications.\nBut maybe the protesters were right, sad as it is — threaten the almighty avocado and people pay attention.\n\nBONUS: Here's a clip of Kellyanne Conway's previous (and mercifully brief) career in stand-up comedy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T03:22:03.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
