The Moonlight star, 43, took to Instagram earlier this week to post a sweet photo of himself with his newborn daughter, Bari. A post shared by Mahershala Ali (@mahershalaali) on Mar 20, 2017 at 11:00pm PDT In the shot, Ali is holding his baby girl on his lap, while gazing lovingly at her. The actor and his wife, Amatus Sami-Karim, welcomed their little one in late February, the same week he won the Oscar for Moonlight . Shortly after the birth, Ali spoke with ET about fatherhood, saying, “It’s such a blessing to be a father.” He went on to praise his wife, saying, “Hands down, women are the toughest beings on the planet. I’m not saying that to be cool. I don’t care if you have children, choose to have children. I don’t care if you took every pain medication in the world to have children.” Not only is he a doting dad, but Ali is also a sexy one! Shortly after his film scored big at the Oscars, Ali and his co-stars posed shirtless in a sexy Calvin Klein commercial. Watch the clip below to see the sexy images!
