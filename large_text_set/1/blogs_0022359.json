General Tukur Buratai, appealed to the media to be cautious of reports capable of jeopardizing ongoing military operations in the North East. \nOn the failed suicide bombings, Borno State Police boss, Mr. Chukwu, said: “The first incident occurred around 12:45a.m., Tuesday, when a suspected suicide bomber tried to penetrate the metropolis through Usmanti village. \n“As he tried to cross over near a military checkpoint, he was gunned down by the soldiers on guard and the shooting triggered the explosive he was carrying, killing him alone. \n“The second incident happened this morning around 4:50a.m., when a group of suspected suicide bombers also tried to penetrate the metropolis through Kaleri village. \n“Unfortunately for them, there was a vigilant military checkpoint in the place and one of them was sighted trying to cross the fence and was gunned down.” \nThe commissioner said police bomb squad was invited after the explosive on the suspect refused to detonate. \nHe added: “Unknown to anybody, the remaining bomber had scaled through and moved about 200 meters away. She met some people and detonated her explosive, killing herself and one other person.” \nChukwu added that two persons around the vicinity were also injured and taken to hospital. He urged residents to be more vigilant by reporting strange things to the police and other security agencies. \nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Head of Delegation of International Red Cross, ICRC, and Red Crescent Movement, Mr. Eloi Fillion, yesterday, visited Maiduguri, to commiserate with families of six volunteers killed in last Tuesday’s accidental air strike in Rann, headquarters of Kala Balge Local Government Area. \nBuratai \nBuratai tasked the media to see themselves as partners in the peace, progress and security of the country, saying the Nigerian Army in particular and the military in general have no monopoly of the total security in the defence of the country. \nBuratai appealed to the media to work closely with the military to achieve the needed success in the fight against Boko Haram terrorists in the North-East, the militancy in the Niger Delta and other security threats across the country, saying the task was not only for security outfits alone. \nAlthough he admitted that there were challenges in the Army’s operations in the ongoing fight against Boko Haram , the Army chief, however, said any action the military has taken so far was in the best interest of the country.
