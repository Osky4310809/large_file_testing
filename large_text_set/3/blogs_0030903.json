I’ve found a good salve. ♥ + Who Are Your New 'Great British Bake Off' Hosts? by Mayukh Sen \nI just came across this trove of old videos of Berry cooking, and they’re a total delight. As some television watchers decades older than me may remember, Berry, now 82, got her start on variety shows on the BBC and ThamesTV, including a variety show called Good Afternoon! that aired the 1970s. Advertisement \nThamesTV’s YouTube channel has a nice catalog of these cookery segments, where Berry displays the same tart charisma that’s made a whole new generation fall under her spell on The Great British Bake Off . They're a window into another era that I, a millennial who fetishizes the 1970s, wish I lived through. I daresay I like these better than The Great British Bake Off. I'm hooked. Slade's pie: \nNamed after a woman named Mrs. Slade. Turkey mayonnaise: \nUh, have you ever turned your turkey into turkey mayo? Please let me know in the comments. I'm serious.

Mussels stuffed with snail butter: \nThe butter is green! \nPerhaps the most charming video—she sticks some fish in a blender! \nHave a favorite Mary Berry cooking segment? Let us know in the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:46:04.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
