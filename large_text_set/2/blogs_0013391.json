Gus' Pretzels in St. Louis, a popular draw for nearly a century, makes an urban outpost of Philly Pretzel Factory unlikely, Doug Abbott said. \"Gus' has a pretty good hold in the city\" but there wasn't anything like it in St. Louis County when he began looking at pretzel franchises, he said. \nPhilly Pretzel Factory has 157 locations, although none yet in Missouri. The closest location to St. Louis is in Indianapolis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:02:17.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
