There has to be a broad consensus between the parties who have gone to court on this issue and those at the religious front,” RSS leader Dattatreya Hosabale said in Coimbatore, after a three-day National Council Meet. RSS leader Dattatreya Hosabale. Firstpost \nSangh’s joint general secretary Hosabale said this in response to Supreme Court’s verdict, while reportedly speaking to ANI and a few reporters outside the meeting venue Sri Amrita Vishwa Vidhyashram in Coimbatore. \nThe statement comes in the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s statement, in which it said the construction of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya was an issue of sentiment and religion, and the disputing parties should sort the matter outside the court. \nA three-member bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar said that the matter should be resolved amicably by employing moderators and holding meetings between the disputing parties. He was hearing an appeal from BJP leader Subramanian Swamy. \nThe RSS, which has been holding a three-day meeting of its annual Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS) at Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu concluded on Tuesday. \nThe dispute is about a plot of land measuring 2.77 acre in the city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh that houses the Babri mosque and Ram Janmabhoomi. This particular piece of land is considered sacred among Hindus as it is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of the most revered deities of the religion. Muslims argue that the land houses the Babri mosque, where they had offered prayers for years before the dispute, reports a Firstpost article . \nRSS resolution on West Bengal at ABPS \nAfter its three-day brainstorming at the national council meet, the RSS expressed grave concern over the ‘unabated rise in violence by jihadi elements in West Bengal, encouragement to anti-national elements by the state government due to its Muslim vote bank politics and declining Hindu population in the state’. \n“The ABPS strongly condemns the extremist violence and the Muslim appeasement policy by the state government and calls upon the countrymen to create awareness against this Jihadi violence and communal politics of the state government. It also urges the media to present the prevalent grave situation before the country. The ABPS calls upon the state government to rise above petty vote bank politics and discharge its constitutional obligations. The ABPS also urges the Union government to ensure firm action against these anti-national Jihadi elements of the state in the interest of national security,\" the RSS mentioned in its resolution on the present situation and sufferings of Hindu society in West Bengal, which was passed during the three-day session. \nWhat does the resolution say? \nThe RSS in its resolution passed on West Bengal has painted a gory picture of the state’s decaying law and order situation and rise in cross-border extremism. \n\"Large number of Hindus is being forced to flee from the border areas under the pressure of fundamentalist forces. Smuggling of fake currency and cow progeny along with illegal migration are being perpetually encouraged by these very elements. During the investigation of Burdwan bomb blast, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has found that several terror modules exist across the state and this network of Jehadi extremists is spread on both sides of the border…Just when extremists, fomenting trouble in a planned manner, are being encouraged by giving ministerial berths and other prominent political and government positions at the same time the state government is creating obstacles in celebrating religious activities of the Hindu society. Sometime back, timings for the immersion of Maa Durga idols were unusually curtailed because of Muharram for which the state government attracted strictures from the Kolkata High Court,” the resolution said. \nThe resolution comes at a time when the Bangladesh government has sent a report to the Ministry of Home Affairs over the recent rise in the infiltration of terrorists to India. \nAccording to The Times of India , the Bangladesh government in its report has stated that “approximately 2,010 HuJI and JMB operatives had entered the three states. While nearly 720 men made a safe passage to the Bengal border, the remaining 1,290 are suspected to have entered through Assam and Tripura”. \n“While on one hand, the state government (read West Bengal) is threatening to close down the schools which are instilling the spirit of patriotism, on the other hand, it is turning a blind eye towards thousands of institutions like the notorious Simulia Madarsa, where jihadi and fundamentalist training is being imparted. Original Bangla words in the text books are being distorted under the influence of fundamentalist elements. At several places efforts are being made to stop the traditional Saraswati Puja in the educational institutions. The state government is overlooking the attempts to Islamize the schools on the pretext of observing Milad-un-Nabi… Several incidents of bomb blasts, arson, violence, and molestation of women have been reported in the past few years. The worst sufferers of these atrocities on the Hindu society have been the members of the scheduled castes. This is a matter of serious concern to the unity and integrity of the country,” the resolution said. \nAn RSS functionary from West Bengal told Firstpost , “During Durga puja festival at some of the villages in Bengal, especially in the districts bordering Bangladesh, we found that Hindus couldn’t carry their puja procession through Muslim neighbourhood as the latter didn’t allow them to. In many places, the Hindu Bengalis are so threatened that they can’t perform the ritual of blowing the conch ( Shankh vandana ) due to Muslim threats. Surprisingly, the Mamata Banerjee-government is a mute spectator to this and hasn’t taken any action even after complaints made to her. The Burdwan blast exposed the footprints of Islamic terrorism in the state. This situation needs to be changed. It’s same as in Kerala at present.” \n 26  26 pm Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:05:07.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
