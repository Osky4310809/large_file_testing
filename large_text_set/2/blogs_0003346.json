Install Privacy-Protecting Browser Extensions \nAntimalware is great, but it only really protects you from things you download and execute, barring malvertising or malware winding up on your system through no fault of your own. The next step is to fortify your browser with tools designed to protect your privacy . The Best Browser Extensions that Protect Your Privacy The Best Browser Extensions that Protect Your Privacy The Best Browser Extensions that Protect Your… There are a ton of browser extensions that promise to protect your privacy, which leads to some… Read more Read more \nYou probably already use an ad blocker, but a good, customizable one like uBlock Origin gives you control over what’s blocked and what isn’t when you want it, and can lock out just about anything when you need it to. Disconnect is another great option, and protects you from same-network attacks like session hijacking and clickjacking —both of which are still real threats , and can give people access to things like your Amazon account or Facebook account, even if you’re browsing securely. It's not paranoia: Using public or open Wi-Fi networks without taking your security into… Read more Read more 3. Use HTTPS Everywhere You Can \nAnywhere HTTPS works, use it—and HTTPS Everywhere, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation —can make sure you do. Of course, not every site supports it, but if it’s available, the add-on will try to bump you over to the secure version of the site, and if it’s not there, you’ll roll back to the plain HTTP version. HTTPS Everywhere Updates to Keep You Secure on Thousands More Sites HTTPS Everywhere Updates to Keep You Secure on Thousands More Sites HTTPS Everywhere Updates to Keep You Secure on… Chrome/Firefox/Opera: Using HTTPS is essential for keeping your personal information safe,… Read more Read more \nIt’s not absolutely perfect security, but making sure your connection to a given site is secure means at the very least the information sent to you (and that you send to the site) is encrypted , which goes a long way to making sure that anyone snooping on your communications doesn’t get anything sensitive. And by “snooping,” we really mean someone just soaking up packets from the network looking for credit card numbers, passwords, or session cookies to access logged-in accounts—not Notoriously Strong Adversaries, from which there’s little recourse (and honestly, not who we’re talking about here.) Dear Lifehacker,I'm not a huge nerd, but everyone's talking about switching to HTTPS on… Read more Read more 2. Use a VPN (or Roll Your Own) \nThe best protection from an untrusted network when you have to use one, I think, is direct, encrypted access to a trusted one. That means using a VPN when you’re out and about. Whether you use a third-party VPN service provider or you roll your own VPN at home and connect to it when you’re out and about, using one makes sure that all of your data is encrypted between you and the service provider, locking out anyone on the same network as you who might be snooping around. Why You Should Start Using a VPN (and How to Choose the Best One for Your Needs) Why You Should Start Using a VPN (and How to Choose the Best One for Your Needs) Why You Should Start Using a VPN (and How to… You may know what a VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is; you probably don't use one. You… Read more Read more \nOf course, if you roll your own at home and connect to it, the trusted network we’re talking about is your home network and your home ISP. It’ll likely be slower, but at least you know the equivalent experience is you surfing the web or working from home. If you use a VPN provider, you’ll need to make sure they’re trustworthy , don’t leak your IP address , or leak any other information about you . That goes double for mobile VPNs , which can be riddled with malware and soak up private information while you use them. Dear Lifehacker, I've read about why I really should use a VPN and I've been looking into … Read more Read more 1. Bring Your Own Wi-Fi Instead \nThe real best protection from an untrusted network is not using it at all. Of course, this isn’t a real way to make public Wi-Fi any safer, but if you can, consider ditching the public Wi-Fi entirely and bringing your own. Whether you use a mobile hotspot like a MiFi or a Karma , or you just tether to your smartphone and use your wireless carrier’s data, both approaches get you off of the sketchy public Wi-Fi at the airport while you’re waiting for your layover and onto cellular data instead. Five Best Mobile Hotspots Five Best Mobile Hotspots Five Best Mobile Hotspots Getting access to high-speed internet on the go doesn't have to mean using someone's… Read more Read more \nOf course, prices can vary, and it’s not in the budget for everyone, but some have pay-as-you-use options, like our favorite, Karma . If you’re not down for buying and carrying another device though, you can just use your smartphone—just keep an external battery pack handy, and watch your data caps while you work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T18:04:29.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
