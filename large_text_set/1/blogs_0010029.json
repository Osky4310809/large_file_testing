Donald Trump is so mad . On top of reports yesterday that U.S. intelligence obtained evidence of compromising information linking his presidential campaign to Russia, that particularly salacious (yet still unsubstantiated claim) was revealed by Buzzfeed about Trump‚Äôs penchant for prostitutes and ‚Äúgolden showers‚Äù ‚Äî making the president-elect a laughing stock on top of literally being accused of committing treason .\nEven if the leaked information turns out to be inaccurate, the damage is already done. Twitter exploded in jokes Tuesday evening , causing Trump to lash out in an uncharacteristic ALL CAPS rant . And after having slept on it, Trump appears to still be pretty fired up about the whole thing, unleashing a brand new ‚Äústream‚Äù of tweets Wednesday morning.\nRussia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is \"A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.\" Very unfair!\n‚Äî Donald J.

What is even happening anymore? The internet is truly eating itself. Regardless, the angrier Trump gets, all it seems to do is throw more gasoline on the fire (or urine on the prostitutes, as you will), and #GoldenShowerGate was still the top trending hashtag on Twitter as of this morning.
