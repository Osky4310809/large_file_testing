He is 100 per cent fit. \n\"It's very important that Auba plays again [on Saturday] and plays for as long as he can - and even better if he scores.\" \nThe all-time Bundesliga top scorers \nDortmund's famous south stand will be closed on Saturday as part of sanctions against the club following supporter unrest during the recent match with RB Leipzig. \nThe club were also fined â‚¬100,000 after a number of defamatory banners were displayed in the 'yellow wall' section of Signal Iduna Park, while police were forced to intervene after clashes between fans outside the stadium. \nDortmund said on Friday that they have identified 61 suspects \"who allegedly played an active role in displaying or preparing insulting banners\" and have vowed to take action to prevent a recurrence of the problems. \nAnd Tuchel feels the punishment from the German Football Association (DFB) has unfairly glossed over the more admirable aspects of the supporters, who were given the FIFA Fan Award along with Liverpool for their joint rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' in last year's Europa League tie. \n\"We want to play a typical home game, even if only 56,000 spectators will be in the stadium,\" Tuchel said. \nDembele explains Bayern snub \n\"We're talking about the same stand that was silent against Mainz out of respect for a fan who died, and the one that was recently given an award. \n\"It's a pity that we're the first to go through this experience. We're very sad that it is like this.\" \nTuchel also confirmed that Raphael Guerreiro and Sokratis Papastathopoulos are doubts for Saturday's game and will face fitness tests in the hours before kick-off.
