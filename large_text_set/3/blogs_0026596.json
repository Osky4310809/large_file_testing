Starbucks\nDanhof cited a Business Insider article from February, which reported that the coffee giant's consumer perception levels fell by two-thirds after Schultz announced plans to hire refugees and openly criticized the president's immigration ban in late January, based on YouGov BrandIndex data.\nOn Wednesday, Schultz responded that Starbucks' decisions are based on the company's values of \"humanity and compassion,\" not politics.\n\"I can unequivocally tell you — and we all know this from the research we have done — is there is zero, absolutely no evidence whatsoever that there is any dilution in the integrity of the Starbucks brand, reputation, or our core business as a result of being compassionate,\" Schultz said.\nSchultz also disputed Danhof's claim that the c ompany would have to spend extra money to vet refugee workers, saying that the hiring of refugees would not result in any additional costs to Starbucks.\nSpeaking with Business Insider after the meeting, Danhof said as a conservative, he \"did not feel comfortable sitting in the shareholders meeting,\" and that he believed any conservatives working at Starbucks would feel similarly stifled.\n\"From an investment standpoint, having hostility... to conservatives and conservative leaders — they're diminishing half of their potential customer base,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Schultz has maintained that Starbucks is not anti-Trump, despite his own support for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\"I don't think on any level that Starbucks or the brand is at odds with Trump or his supporters,\" Schultz said on CNBC in December. \"One of the values we feel very strongly as a company is to demonstrate a level of social impact to the community that we serve.\"\nHere's the video of the showdown between Starbucks' CEO and a conservative shareholder:\nSEE ALSO: STARBUCKS CEO: Not every decision in business is an economic one NOW WATCH: We tried on Pizza Hut's new Bluetooth-enabled sneakers that let you order delivery with just a push of a button Loading video...
