Not surprisingly, he reiterated his opposition toward mainstream media claiming, \"the news is fake because so much of the news is fake.\"\nAfter the debacle was over, Fox News ' Shepard Smith gave his take on Drumpf, and boy, he did NOT mince his words!\nRelated: Shepard Finally Comes Out Of The Closet \nFirst off, the news anchor repeated his criticism of the businessman for his terrible treatment of the press, case in point CNN 's Jim Acosta who was told by Trump in January that his network is (once again) \"fake news.\"\nBut then, Smith really gives it to him over his refusal to answer questions about his relationship with Russia. The 53-year-old said on-air:\n\"It is crazy what we're watching every day. It's absolutely crazy. He keeps repeating ridiculous, throw away lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as if we're some kind of fools for asking the question. Really? Your opposition was hacked and the Russians were responsible for it, and your people were on the phone with Russia on the same day it was happening, and we're fools for asking these questions? No, sir.\"\nSmith believes Trump has an obligation to the American people to be forthright with his international dealings, saying: \n\"We are not fools for asking the questions, and we demand to know the answer. You owe this to the American people. Your supporters will support you either way. If your people were on the phone, what were they saying? We have a right to know. We absolutely do, and that you call us fake news and put us down like children for asking these questions on behalf of the American people is inconsequential. People deserve that answer, at very least.\"\nTo hear Shep's rant, ch-ch-check it out (below)!\nFox's Shep Smith fires back at Trump for his treatment of the press: \"It's crazy what we're watching every day.
