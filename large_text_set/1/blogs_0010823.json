When critics charged that the agency’s decision made no sense, Comey said that the FBI would be reopening the investigation. Hillary Clinton voters charged that his announcement, made just 11 days before the election, handed victory to Donald Trump. \nIn his investigation, Inspector General Michael Horowitz will be examining whether Comey broke government protocol, as well as whether FBI officials improperly provided nonpublic information to the Clinton campaign. \nSeveral members of Congress requested the Justice Department look into these matters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T01:56:58.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
