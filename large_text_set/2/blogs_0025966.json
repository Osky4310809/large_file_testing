While the Wii U was a decent step up from the pitiful WiiWare platform, they really didn't come around to the idea of aggressively competing with other platforms until halfway into its life cycle -- by then, it was too late.\nBut in this past week, they've basically turned the notion around that they aren't trying. Fast RMX , and Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment  are now launch titles for the Switch. Also,  just today during their Nindies Showcase stream, they confirmed Steamworld Dig 2, Yooka-Laylee , Overcooked: Special Edition, The Escapists 2 , Gonner  (timed exclusive), Dandara , Kingdom: Two Crowns , Runner3 , Blaster Master Zero , Flipping Death , Graceful Explosion Machine  (timed exclusive), Mr. Shifty  (timed exclusive), Tumbleseed , Shakedown Hawaii  (timed exclusive), Pocket Rumble  (console exclusive), WarGroove , and Stardew Valley multiplayer (timed console exclusive).\nWe're not even to E3 yet and we already have a ton of games that are hitting the Switch.
