Two weeks ago, I was struggling with a raging infection, later diagnosed as sepsis, and within minutes I was being rushed to hospital .” \nAs he was wheeled into A&E shortly after 3pm Barry felt “like I was arriving in a medical battleground. The place was heaving and staff didn’t have time for me. I wasn’t even given any painkillers.

It was freezing and noisy. There were drunks in there and the nurses had to call security.” \nBarry says things finally began to settle down around 6am and someone gave him water and porridge.“In all, it was 16 hours before I was admitted to a ward and given a bed.” \nBarry found the nurses there just as busy as in A&E. “Cancer isn’t pretty. My bandages need changing daily but I went three days with the same dressing. The bandages were sodden. Blood was oozing out. \n“Then on the fourth day I found out I had contracted MRSA. It was a nightmare.

We would like to apologise for any delays.” \n•Barry’s only hope of a cure is a new £200,000 treatment in America involving radiation and immune therapy.
