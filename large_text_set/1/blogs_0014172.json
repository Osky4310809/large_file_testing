New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: Audeze EL-8: The EL-8 is a must-hear at CES 2015 I've got a fever...and the only prescription is more CanJam! offline \n(If you can't see the embedded video above, click here to watch it.) \n\nAs some of you may have seen in another thread here, Head-Fi'er Matias , then long-time Head-Fi'er arnaud , posted an Audeze advertisement (from The Absolute Sound's January 2015 issue) for what looked like a new Audeze headphone called the EL-8: \n\nAudeze hasn't posted any additional information yet. \n\nAs the ad mentions, the Audeze EL-8 will be launched at CES 2015, on Tuesday, January 6, 2015. If you are going to be at CES, make sure you stop by Audeze's exhibit at South Hall, Booth #22018. ( Click here to see Audeze's exhibit on a floor map.) \n\nHere are other places at CES you'll be able to audition the EL-8: Chord Electronics in Venetian 29-222. Meridian in Venetian 30-335. Meridian will be featuring the Audeze EL-8 (and Audeze's LCD models) for personal audio demonstrations of their MQA technology. Burson Audio in Venetian 31-322. \n\nThough still under embargo, I can say that Audeze will be introducing some compelling patent pending technologies in the EL-8, including a very innovative magnetic circuit, and new diaphragm technology (again, with more details about both to follow). \n\nI've been listening to a pre-production Audeze EL-8, and I think it will easily be among the most significant headphone launches in our community this year. More detailed information (including price info) is still under embargo, but when the embargo lifts, I'll be posting more detailed information here. \n\nAs you can see in the photo below, the Audeze EL-8's design is also very striking (and very comfortable):", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T08:36:05.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
