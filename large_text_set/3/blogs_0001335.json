The Crystal Palace game for example, obviously we won 2-0 but right at the end of the game he's cut in, passed it to me and then I shot, but [Wayne] Hennessey just about saved it. \n\"The boys were all happy in the dressing room but Alexis came to me in the shower and he's like: 'My friend, are you going to score?! Oh no my friend... I passed you the ball, you have a cup of tea, you wait... and then you shoot!' I was just laughing like: 'Yeah, sorry my friend...' \nArsenal fans welcome back Sanogo \n\"He always wants assists, he wants goals and that is what makes him the player he is. He is always hungry for that and he passes that onto us all. \n\"We have got a lot of those sorts of characters in the team. Alexis is probably one of the strongest ones that will voice his opinions at all times. He is one of those that keeps demanding and trying to bring the best out of you.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:33:39.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
