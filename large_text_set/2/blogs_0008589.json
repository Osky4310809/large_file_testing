Dad & patriot who works on business, workforce, higher ed innovation & politics. Live Free or Die. 24 mins ago We must protect NH’s clean elections against false political attacks My family voted at the Concord Boys & Girls Club on Nov 8, 2016, assisted by local election officials. On November 8th, I lost a close race for Governor of New Hampshire — the narrowest loss of any Democrat running for Governor anywhere in the country. Without hesitation, I will defend the validity and integrity of those results to anyone. As you’ve probably read, President Trump’s latest false claim is that his own New Hampshire loss that same day (and that of Kelly Ayotte) happened only because ‘thousands’ of illegal voters were ‘bused’ in from Massachusetts. It is the sort of weak, vain excuse we’d expect from an insecure strongman like Russian President Vladimir Putin — right before he announces how much his countrymen really love him. Here’s the truth: President Trump is threatened by New Hampshire’s clean elections, our high turnout, and our independent-minded voters. And that is why he, and some state leaders, are pushing new government regulations to make it harder to register to vote in 2018. It is a weak move that puts misguided political self-interest ahead of New Hampshire’s growth and a healthy, competitive democracy. Real leaders who believe in free markets, capitalism, and democracy should welcome the chance to compete for every vote — not try to invent false myths undermining the integrity of our elections in order to erect self-serving barriers to political competition. If President Trump’s claim sounds familiar — well, it is. “We have same day voter registration, and to be honest, when Massachusetts elections are not very close, they’re busing them in all over the place.” That’s not Trump — the quote is by NH Governor Chris Sununu on a talk radio show this fall. Then, the first new policy he proposed after winning was to “tighten things up” regarding who can register to vote in 2018. Legislation is now pending. Republicans who put facts ahead of political advantage tell us this is false. 100%, totally, unequivocally false. Republican Former NH Attorney General Tom Rath this weekend called allegations of illegal NH votes “baseless” and “shameful” “fantasies.” Former NH Republican Party Chair Fergus Cullen has offered $1,000 for proof of even one voter “bused” to our state to vote. Good for them. In the face of this Republican-on-Republican pushback, Chris Sununu and state legislative leaders have now admitted there is no evidence of illegal votes — but they are still pushing to erect their new restrictions anyway. Don’t let them harm our clean and competitive elections. With so much going on, it can be tempting to appease confusing claims like theirs if they seem harmless. Is it really a problem to “tighten things up” by requiring a 30-day residency requirement to vote, or making sure voters register their cars here, or making it harder for college students to vote in their town, or eliminating same-day voter registration? Yes, it is deeply harmful. Even in New Hampshire, with one of the highest voting participation rates in the country, roughly 1 in 4 of our fellow citizens don’t vote. When researchers ask why, the most common reason given by nonvoters is that they recently moved. This might seem like a small burden to your typical home-owning middle-class voter, but I can relate: when I moved to New Hampshire at the age of 22 after a bumpy childhood, it was the 18th house I moved into. If you believe every person matters, that includes renters, the elderly, students, young people, and yes, families that grow and shrink unexpectedly through hard times. In my case, I found my home here. I voted in NH while getting an MBA in graduate school, and while I was still figuring out what to do with my life; before I got married, before I had kids, before I bought a house, and even before I knew I would make my permanent home here. In New Hampshire I fell in love, put down roots, raised a family, managed a business, helped launch a new college, served for four years as a state Executive Councilor, and ran for Governor. I love our state. Every new New Hampshire voter makes us better and stronger. For our state to have a vibrant and strong economy as we age, we need more students, and veterans, and immigrants, and young people, to make their homes here as I did. Passing new government regulations that create barriers to participating in our civic community weakens our state. It’s just one more way to rig the system. Our New Hampshire elections are clear, they are fair, and they reflect the will of the people of New Hampshire. Anyone afraid of voters doesn’t deserve to serve them in elected office.
