What other evidence does one then need to rightly conclude that Sheriff is just like the wicked woman in the days of King Solomon who would rather have the baby killed since he does not belong to her than see him handed over to the right mother. A man who could work so flagrantly against the party cannot now be pretending to love the same party,” the group said. \nIt further advised the PDP to ensure it goes to the Supreme Court immediately as it was sure of justice for the Makarfi group. “We urge the party to set in motion the processes of challenging the Appeal Court judgement at the Supreme Court since this is still within the right of the party to do.” \n“We cannot leave the party with all its humongous assets nationwide for a graceless character like Sheriff whose activities have shown that he is on a mission for the ruling party to decimate the PDP in order for the APC to achieve its longtime desire of running a one-party state. We trust in the impartiality of the apex court to deliver justice in this matter, hence, the party must not sacrifice its pursuit for justice on the altar of time” the statement read.” \nThe group concluded by saying it is ready to defend the party as usual and its assets nationwide against the ravenous Sheriff and his co-travellers. It further called on the party never to surrender the party to anyone except the Makarfi group. \n“Our discreet investigations have revealed those who are working surreptitiously with Sheriff to undermine the PDP. At the appropriate time when our dossiers on such elements and their dirty deals everywhere are complete, the PDPAction shall expose them to the world for who they are. Sheriff must go!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:41:17.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
