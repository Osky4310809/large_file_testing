These are the players who punch holes in defences no matter how solid they are. \nThey are the big men who carry hard into the guts of the opposition, the powerhouses who make metres virtually every time they carry the ball, the forces of nature who burst through flailing limbs as though they were dried twigs. \nJerry has picked his Six Nations heavy artillery top six - but do you agree? Join the debate below, and use our interactive tool to rank Jerry's selection yourself. \nThe slab-thighed France number eight has a long-standing reputation for being an incredibly destructive runner, and he demonstrated that once more at the weekend. \nDespite standing 6ft 4in he has a low centre of gravity and uses that, combined with impeccable timing and excellent balance, to power through the most tightly packed opposition defences. \nThough he was on the losing team against England, he was my man of the week, with 16 carries, 131 metres made, two clean breaks and seven defenders beaten, and is the number one pick overall when it comes to asking someone to make the hard yards. Tres bon, Louis, tres bon.

He loves the contact. \nOn one of his 15 carries against France on Saturday, he ran full tilt at captain Guilhem Guirado and sat him down on his backside - and not many do that to the ferociously competitive hooker.

At knocking on 19 stone he's got plenty of power and he runs around at a fair old clip as well. \nThe 24-year-old is a baby in prop terms, both in age and experience - he has only started five Tests - but he has done so well he'd be my starting prop for the Lions this summer if he keeps playing as he has. \nHe's very good at hitting into defenders, pumping his legs and maintaining a good body position, which allows him to keep going forward while allowing time for support to get with him. He has not yet had time to make his mark on the Six Nations - don't worry, he will - but anyone who saw him swat aside three New Zealand forwards in one run in the autumn knows this man is a monster with ball in hand. \nAs befits someone who bought a tractor with his first big rugby pay cheque, Sean O'Brien progresses true \"farm strength\" and is an out-and-out bruising runner. \nNicknamed the 'Tullow Tank' for good reason, he will trample all over you if you don't get the tackle technically correct. \nNow aged 29, he has struggled with hamstring injuries but looks somewhere near back to his best and made two clean breaks against Scotland. The first one saw Stuart Hogg attempt the tackle, but he was too low and square into O'Brien and the Ireland flanker just brushed him aside, all from a standing start.

But the 6ft 4in centre has been dropped to the bench for the past two Tests as Scott Williams has taken the 12 shirt, something that was unthinkable a year or two ago. \nJutting of jaw and never happier than when taking crash ball on a hard line into the heart of the opposition midfield, Roberts has been hammering away at the coalface for Wales - gouging out yards of hard-earned front foot ball - for 90 caps, and although he may have slipped down the heavy artillery rankings this season, I would not be at all surprised to see him make England suffer on Saturday.

No Taulupe Faletau? No Cian Healy? No Kyle Sinckler (give it a few weeks...)? Let us know who else Jerry should have included and join the debate below!
