By: ANI | New Delhi | Published: February 24, 2017 6:12 AM BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi (PTI) \nHitting back at Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati for referring Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) president Amit Shah as a terrorist, the saffron party on Friday said that those who give tickets to gangster-turned politician like Mukhtar Ansari should not talk about terrorism. “Who give ticket to people like Mukhtar Ansari, it would be better if they do not talk about terrorism,” BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi told ANI. She further said that Mayawati has been the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh before and people are aware of the administration condition of that time. “Such reactions show their frustration as they are aware of the fact that they are going to lose the election,” Lekhi said. \nYou May Also Like To Watch This: \nShe, however, said that personal attacks are a part of politics, but should not take place as per the norms.

The two were enough for destruction, however, a third one has also arrived. The population of UP must get rid of this KASAB, and by this I mean –‘Ka’ for Congress, ‘S’ for SP and ‘B’ for…,” Shah said while addressing a rally in Chauri Chaura. While he didn’t clearly mention the BSP, there was no denial from his side when the audience shouted ‘BSP’.
