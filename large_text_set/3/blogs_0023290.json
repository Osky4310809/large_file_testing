Puree the herbs in a blender with just a little olive oil and freeze them into cubes.\"\nPractico Kitchen Superb Cube 1.4 Inch Cube Silicone Ice Cube Tray, $14.99 A frying pan Amazon \"These are what I use at the restaurant,\" Farmerie said. \"If you season them properly and take care of them, they will literally last a lifetime. I have a few that are 15 years-old and look (and cook!) like new. The reason I like them is like cast iron, they get a natural non-stick surface so you don’t need to use much oil when cooking. But unlike cast iron, they are lightweight.\"\nEurodib de Buyer Fry Pan, $59.99 Olive oil Amazon \"We use this oil at all of our restaurants and at my house as well,\" Farmerie , who is an ambassador for California Olive Ranch, said.\n\"They have a great range from everyday oils to finishing oils packed with personality, and their products have recently become available all around America. Don’t save it for special occasions or salad dressings — cook with it, deep fry in it, drizzle it over a finished dish, or even put a few drops in your dirty martini.\"\nCalifornia Olive Ranch Everyday Extra Virgin Olive Oil, from $17.20 A wine system Amazon \"This is the budget buster, but truly worth it if you drink good wine or have a bunch of nice bottles on your shelf waiting for an occasion big enough to go through 750ml of deliciousness,\" he said.\n\"Wait no longer. The Coravin system allows you to pour yourself a glass without pulling the cork, and then tops the bottle with a gas that allows the remaining wine to not deteriorate over time. Magic? Perhaps, and a magic worth breaking the budget. \"\nCoravin Model Two Plus Pack, $349.95 A knife sheath Amazon \"If you’ve taken the time and spent the money on a nice knife, go the extra distance and get a nice wooden knife cover to preserve the blade and keep it sharp,\" Farmerie recommended.\n\"If you haven’t taken the time or spent the money to get a nice knife, you have other problems to think about and will need to bust your budget a bit to rectify the situation.\"\nYoshihiro Natural Magnolia Wood Saya Cover Blade Protector, $27.99 Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
