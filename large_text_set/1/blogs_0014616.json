Tremors 6 will pick up story threads from Tremors 5 , which continued Gummer's story as it had been presented in Tremors 1-3 and the Sci-Fi Tremors TV series. \nTremors 4 was set in the Old West and featured Gross not as Burt, but as one of his ancestors. The film is largely regarded by fans as the worst of the series and only semi-canonical. \nThe franchise centers on Gummer now but the first film was about a group of survivors living in a small town in the middle of nowhere, who were suddenly attacked by a race of giant, worm-like monsters who lived underground. Nicknamed \"Graboids,\" the monsters were attracted to vibrations, meaning that they could sense and attack people moving above them on the ground. \nBetween 1996 and 2004, three direct-to-video sequels were made, although when the 2003 TV series failed to get off the ground and 2004's fourth installment was less than a hit, it took a decade to get 2015's Tremors 5 made. A two-year turnaround between the fifth and sixth films, then, is likely to excite fans of the long-running series. \nGross, for his part, has told fans that he will not (as far as he knows yet) be involved with Bacon's TV relaunch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T11:00:31.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
