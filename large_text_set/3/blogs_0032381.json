It’s a few days of madness for the industry, but even more so for developers attending the event . You better get ready for a wild time of learning, announcements and hands-on experience. We know it’s hard to plan it without a schedule, though.\nDon’t you worry – the first wave of developer sessions has just been published in the official site’s schedule. Of course, this includes the keynote and all the “What’s new in ” sessions, as well as plenty of other goodies regular consumers will have no idea what they are about.\n\nAll these sessions will be divided in categories, including topics, themes, types and locations. You can filter all the sessions as you wish and plan your time at I/O. As always, more sessions will continue to be added, so keep checking back for included schedule entries and make sure to make time for some fun!\nOf course, we will be covering I/O live, so also keep it tuned to Android Authority for all things Android and Google I/O.\nGoogle I/O 2017 schedule ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:52:59.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
