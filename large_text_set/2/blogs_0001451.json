While on the UFC Unfiltered podcast this week, White mentioned Rousey has some plans for herself which might include moving to a desolate place to “do her thing.” White also said Rousey has made a lifetime’s worth of money and credited her for putting female fighting on the map. \n\"Her spirits are good and she’s doing her own thing,\" White said . \"In the conversation I had with her, if I had to say right here, right now – and again, I don't like saying right here, right now because it's up to her and it's her thing – but I wouldn't say she fights again.
