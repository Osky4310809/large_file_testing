(Photo: Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports) \nJamaal Charles didn't really want to talk about his childhood, at least for a long time. \nHe grew up in Port Arthur, Texas, with a learning disability and was teased a lot. The Kansas City Chiefs running back was worried about what people might think of him if he opened up. \nBut in the summer of 2015, something changed. Charles gave a beautiful speech at the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics in Los Angeles - in front of a crowd of more than 60,000 people that included Michelle Obama. \n\"When I was a boy, I had trouble reading. I found out I had a learning disability. People made fun of me. They said I would never go anywhere. But I learned, I can fly,\" Charles said that summer, as the crowd cheered. \"When I was 10 years old, I had the chance to compete in the Special Olympics. That's right. The Special Olympics gave me my first chance to discover the talent I did not know I had.\" \nAfter that moment, Charles wanted to share his story. \n\"I feel good in my own skin. I don't care what they say,\" Charles told For The Win in a phone interview earlier this month. \"They can judge me the way they want to. I know there's only one person that can judge me is God.\" \nNow, the four-time Pro Bowler has his own book that details his story from the day he was born to his ascension to the NFL. It's the fourth book of the Middle School Rules series written by the author Sean Jensen. The other three tell the stories of former NFL players Brian Urlacher and Charles Tillman, and WNBA guard Skylar Diggins . Charles' book will be officially released on Feb. 1, though you can pre-order it at a few different sites . Excited to announce my new @midschoolrules book! Pre-order your copy! https://t.co/bR0Xhip9oy pic.twitter.com/8QJxe0v94i — Jamaal Charles (@jcharles25) January 10, 2017 \nCharles described his reaction to being asked to reveal the challenges of his childhood in a children's book as \"kinda weird,\" but he said the process of turning it into something real was enjoyable. He said that everything included actually happened, and he read it a couple times to make sure it was told in a way that was \"as real as possible.\" He added that for this book, Jensen was able to make him open up in a way he never has before. \nThe book covers everything from how Charles would run to his beloved grandma for protection when his brothers and cousins would tease him to the multiple competitive races he had with his athletic friend, Danny Gorrer (now an NFL cornerback), to the time one of his cousins told him, \"Man, you will never go anywhere in life. You're not smart enough for college!\" \nCharles has a simple message he hopes kids take away from his story. \n\"I just learned all of this overcoming adversities in life. People tell you you'll never go nowhere - never give up,\" he said. \"You feel like you always get beat or you're always down on yourself, don't be down on yourself, you can continue to improve in your craft, what you're weak in and get stronger in. People tell you at that age you got a learning disability, most people don't know how to take that stuff. I always tell kids ya'll got a bright future, ya'll very smart. Don't never tell nobody, 'I can never do nothing,' because ya'll can do something in life.\" \nThe book is even more special because Charles has two kids of his own, plus one on the way, with his wife, Whitney. He said his kids recognize him and other family members in the illustrations, and he's excited to have the book \"as a legacy\" that can be passed on in his family for generations to come. I am truly blessed and thankful for my family, and I also want to thank everyone for your prayers and support! Merry Christmas all! pic.twitter.com/a5KgIWpEls — Jamaal Charles (@jcharles25) December 26, 2016 \nAdditionally, sharing the adversities he went through as a child seems fitting considering where he currently is in his pro football career. Charles has already had two ACL tears and is now trying to make his way back on the field after tearing his meniscus last fall. He wrote a lengthy post about it on his website on Jan. 10 . \nAfter having persevered through everything up until this point, Charles said this latest hurdle doesn't faze him as much: \n\"Nah, I think it was gonna happen no matter what. It's God's purpose, it's God's will,\" he said. \"My story's just different from most people that have injuries. Everybody's story's kinda different, but I do want to play football next year. I know that I'm way better off than I was last year. I couldn't even walk last year when I had my ACL, so with my meniscus everything is all healed up and I can run. You gotta be thankful for the little things. I'm thankful I can run again, even though last time this year I couldn't run.\" \nWhether or not he returns to the NFL, Charles will always have his uplifting story that he's not afraid to share anymore. \n\"I'm just thankful to people that because for me speaking, because from my book, I thank God and tell them to be blessed and live a blessed life, and I thank everybody for their support,\" Charles said. \"And just let God control our future.\" Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/01/jamaal-charles-middle-school-rules-new-book-chiefs-injury-special-olympics-family/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T02:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:01:28.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
