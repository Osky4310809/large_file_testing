It just so happens that Apple’s store is scheduled to go offline early tomorrow morning, which is when the company was rumored to unveil new iPads .\nApple notes on its System Status page that the online store will be unavailable on March 21 from 3 a.m. to 8 a.m. EST. Many people have taken this as a sign Apple is using the downtime to update its site with new iPad Pro models—and maybe even a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, which is said to feature minimal bezels.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com There have been several rumors suggesting Apple is planning to refresh its entire iPad Pro line this spring—and today happens to be the first day of the new season. It would be a little unusual for the company to introduce a revamped iPad Pro without the fanfare of an event; there have also been reports the 10.5-inch model will be unveiled in early April at Apple’s new spaceship campus .\nIt could be nothing Apple taking its store offline doesn’t automatically mean new products are on the way. But given the rumors we’ve heard, it’s very likely we’ll see something new, even if it is just a refreshed 9.7-inch iPad Pro or an iPhone SE with 128GB of storage.\nMacRumors notes that Apple typically issues press releases at 8:30 a.m. EST, which is when the company’s store is scheduled to come back online. For those of us on the West Coast, it’s looking like it’ll be an early morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:15:40.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
