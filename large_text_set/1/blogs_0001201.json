Launched on January 1, 2016, Parrot Security OS 3.4 shipped with various updated packages and new features, among which we can mention the addition of the GNUNet open-source framework for secure peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, an early preview of the Freenet installer, as well as brand-new mirror servers for the netboot images. Powered by the latest stable Linux 4.8.15 kernel, Parrot Security OS 3.4 imported various security updates from the upstream Debian GNU/Linux repositories, updates the Geany IDE and zuluCrypt drive encryption tool to their latest versions at the moment of the release, and repairs the beef-xss configuration file. Also new in Parrot Security OS 3.4, the Anonsurf anonymity tool has been reincluded and the I2P package fixed. As mentioned before, the Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 maintenance update was released on January 2, 2017, to upgrade the installer and fix the kernel modules for it. This is now the latest stable release of the OS. By far the most important change brought by these new releases is that the Parrot Cloud Live edition is no longer supported. However, it looks like Parrot Cloud netboot images still exists, along with the project's in-house built Debian installation script and VPS service.
