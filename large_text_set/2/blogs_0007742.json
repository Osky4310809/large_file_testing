Developer Energy Transfer Partners had hoped to have oil flowing through the pipeline by the end of 2016, but construction has been stalled while the Army Corps of Engineers and the Dallas-based company battled in court over the crossing.\nThe Standing Rock Sioux, whose reservation is just downstream from the crossing, fears a leak would pollute its drinking water and will challenge to the Army's decision to grant an easement, though the details were still being worked out, attorney Jan Hasselman said.\nThe tribe has led protests that drew hundreds and at times thousands of people who dubbed themselves \"water protectors\" to an encampment near the crossing. ETP says the pipeline is safe.\nAn assessment conducted last year determined the crossing would not have a significant impact on the environment. However, then-Assistant Army Secretary for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy on Dec. 4 declined to issue permission for the crossing, saying a broader environmental study was warranted given the Standing Rock Sioux's opposition.\nETP called Darcy's decision politically motivated and accused then-President Barack Obama 's administration of delaying the matter until he left office. The Corps launched a study of the crossing on Jan. 18, two days before Obama left office, that could have taken up to two years to complete. President Donald Trump signed an executive action on Jan. 24 telling the Corps to quickly reconsider Darcy's decision.\nThe court documents filed Tuesday include a proposed Federal Register notice terminating the study.\n\"I have determined that there is no cause for completing any additional environmental analysis,\" Acting Assistant Army Secretary Douglas Lamont said in a memo Tuesday.\nThe tribe argues that under the Fort Laramie Treaties of 1851 and 1888, the federal government is obliged to consider a tribe's welfare when making decisions that affect the tribe.\nNorth Dakota landowners sue over Dakota Access easements Tribune news services A group of about two dozen North Dakota landowners is suing the developer of the disputed Dakota Access oil pipeline for alleged deceit and fraud in acquiring land easements.\nAlready, landowners in Iowa await a state judge's ruling in another easement case regarding the $3.8 billion, four-state...\nA group of about two dozen North Dakota landowners is suing the developer of the disputed Dakota Access oil pipeline for alleged deceit and fraud in acquiring land easements.\nAlready, landowners in Iowa await a state judge's ruling in another easement case regarding the $3.8 billion, four-state...\n(Tribune news services) \"The Obama administration correctly found that the tribe's treaty rights needed to be respected, and that the easement should not be granted without further review and consideration of alternative crossing locations,\" Hasselman said. \"Trump's reversal of that decision continues a historic pattern of broken promises to Indian Tribes and violation of treaty rights. They will be held accountable in court.\"\nEnvironmental groups also criticized the Army decision, with the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and the Center for Biological Diversity all issuing statements saying the Trump administration is putting corporate profits ahead of the rights of Native Americans and the environment.\nETP has been poised to begin drilling under Lake Oahe as soon as it has approval. Workers have drilled entry and exit holes for the crossing, and oil has been put in the pipeline leading up to the lake in anticipation of finishing the project. ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Army's decision.\nETP CEO Kelcy Warren told The Associated Press in November that the company should be able to finish the project in a little over three months once it has the go-ahead.\nTrump signs orders advancing Keystone XL, Dakota Access oil pipelines Steven Mufson, Juliet Eilperin President Donald Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines, another step in his effort to dismantle former president Barack Obama's environmental legacy.\nHe also signed an executive order to expedite environmental reviews of other...\nPresident Donald Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines, another step in his effort to dismantle former president Barack Obama's environmental legacy.\nHe also signed an executive order to expedite environmental reviews of other...\n(Steven Mufson, Juliet Eilperin) Those protesting the pipeline at an encampment the tribe set up on federal land have at times clashed with police, leading to nearly 700 arrests. The camp's population thinned to fewer than 300 as harsh winter weather arrived and as Standing Rock officials pleaded for the camp to disband before the spring flooding season. The Corps has notified remaining protesters that the government-owned land will be closed beginning Feb. 22.\nPhyllis Young, a protest leader and member of the Standing Rock Sioux, said she thinks the Army's decision might draw some people back to the camp to stand with those who remain. Opposition to oil pipelines \"is our life struggle, and we're going to continue fighting however we have to do it,\" she said without elaborating.\nAssociated Press\n Dakota Access Pipeline Barack Obama", "external_links": ["https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1Jv-0ZIB0DoqQSuwmelGb9LkQnUjhKbibLXICJHaPIZA&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5880dbf7/turbine/ct-dakota-access-pipeline-lawsuit-20170119", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58878609/turbine/ct-trump-dakota-keystone-pipeline-20170124", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-589a3604/turbine/ct-dakota-access-oil-pipeline-20170207"], "published": "2017-02-08T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:18:22.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
