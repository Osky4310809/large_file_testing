In 3 years, his contract will be viewed as a bargain. jmac1013 says: Mar 6, 2017 10:02 AM \nAll of a sudden Chase Daniel for $7M sounds like a deal. 1captain1 says: Mar 6, 2017 10:09 AM \nThat’s not even 10% of the cap. Not bad for the most important position on the team when the new salary cap is taken into consideration. bigblackanvil says: Mar 6, 2017 10:13 AM \nwhy are so many bad quarterbacks getting so grossly overpaid??? this thing is getting out of hand. bassplucker says: Mar 6, 2017 10:18 AM \nOr, the Bears could just hang on to Cutler for another year for a few mil less. \nAs a Bears fan who finally gave up on Cutler two years ago, that would be a very hard pill to swallow and I think enough bridges have been burned already that it won’t happen. But if you’re looking strictly at the numbers… katientony says: Mar 6, 2017 10:20 AM \nThe Bears and Jets? Is Mike Glennon any better than Brian Hoyer or Ryan Fitzpatrick? Seriously! Imagine being a Bears/Jets fan and learning you have “upgraded” your starting QB to…Mike Glennon? Wow. mantorras says: Mar 6, 2017 10:21 AM \nI don’t know what some of you do for a living but if you think its a good idea to pay Mike Glennon 15 million, I know you are not a GM. fwippel says: Mar 6, 2017 10:22 AM \nI wouldn’t underestimate Glennon. He has played well when given the opporutnity, and with a little more on-the-field experience under his belt, he could turn into something more than a game-manager. \nIs he worth $14-15 million? Not right now, but the team that signs him for something along those lines is betting on his future. Teams could do worse than taking a chance on him. Mar 6, 2017 10:23 AM \nI read this and the first thing I thought was “Scott Mitchell.” therealjr says: Mar 6, 2017 10:28 AM \nI would go fetal if my team signed this guy for $14 million. You aren’t winning anything with Mike Glennon, and what’s worse, you aren’t really dedicating to finding a guy who can win. 5280broncosfan says: Mar 6, 2017 10:30 AM \nThis should be known as the “Osweiler Effect”. Since that atrocious deal, every average QB with a handful of starts will demand to be paid like a star regardless of skill level or length of resume. This is the reason NFL coaches and Owners hate agents. theright0pinion says: Mar 6, 2017 10:31 AM \nMike Glennon deserves a chance and I’m looking forward to watching his opportunity play out. \nIn 18 starts Glennon had almost 4100 yards, 30 TDs, with only 15 INTs (on a bad Bucs team at the time). \nI’d take Glennon all day long over players like Cutler and Kaepernick. mogogo1 says: Mar 6, 2017 10:40 AM \n“Remember when all of the Donkey fans would have us believe Osweiler was the 2nd coming of Elway?” \nWhen exactly was that? Because I recall a team winning with defense in spite of Osweiler and most Bronco fans being relieved after Manning got the starting job back following a 5-turnover game by Osweiler. There were plenty of people on the Osweiler bandwagon but most of those were talking heads in the studio… and Texans executives. milkmandanimal says: Mar 6, 2017 10:46 AM \nHaving watched Glennon a lot, I think he’s clearly got the capacity to be a starter in the league on the right team; he’s big, has a huge arm, throws a beautiful deep ball, and doesn’t force the ball too much. His big failing is he’s unwilling to pull the trigger on riskier throws and is prone to check things down a bit quickly, but he played pretty well on an utterly, utterly awful series of Bucs teams, and didn’t get rattled. There’s something there. \nDo I think he’s a top-flight QB? Lord, no, but he’s got the capacity to be an OK starter or top-flight backup. If you stick him in Denver, he’s a massive upgrade, because that team has some weapons he could work with. You stick him in Cleveland you might as well set him on fire at midfield. \n“More talented Brian Hoyer” is probably a good comparison; he’s going to likely be good enough to manage a decent team, and not good enough to do it all himself. Depends on where he goes. breadmeatcheese says: Mar 6, 2017 10:52 AM \nand the bears will glady just continue to wait for garapolo to return to illinois. \nthe rebuild is nearly complete. go bears! jonathankrobinson424 says: Mar 6, 2017 10:57 AM \n….I see him going to the San Fransico 49’ers……good fit with Kyle Shannhans type of offense he’ll build….. jjackwagon says: Mar 6, 2017 11:01 AM \nSO what do you think? Garrapolo or Glennon? \nI take neither. I would give Chase Daniels a shot at half the money. intrafinesse says: Mar 6, 2017 11:02 AM \nFor 14-15 there needs to be performance clauses. \nIf you perform, you get paid. In fact, you get paid even more than 15MM *IF* you perform very well. \nThe way to do this is with a lower base, say 7MM, and performance clauses though what they would be I don’t know. Maybe yards, completion percentage, air yards (to prevent a big payout on racking up a high completion percentage on check downs. armyravensterpsstrong says: Mar 6, 2017 11:03 AM \nThe NFL market is ridiculous. Overpaying for QBs who haven’t proven anything; who are declining; and who are simply not elite. \nWhat’s also amazing, these teams and coaches don’t even let the QBs call their own plays! This includes my own QB who is not elite. \nRidiculous. patswhatsup says: Mar 6, 2017 11:05 AM \nI always thought Glennon had more potential than he got credit for. He never really got a solid shot at running a team without being hot-swapped out. Crazy amount of money, but it is what it is in terms of QBs. Leverage is everything. I think some team would be REAL happy to get him for under $10m. belligerentbuc says: Mar 6, 2017 11:06 AM \nGlennon gives your starting qb a run for his money….that is if your team does not have a franchise qb. \nWe would have loved to keep him in Tampa. You are getting a consummate pro who has the capacity to be an Alex Smith/Cousins type where he may get you 9-11 wins & a playoff appearance here and there. \nIts an upgrade anytime you can bring in competition…it keeps improving your qb’s play. Mar 6, 2017 11:07 AM \n“He threw the ball extremely well against the greatest defense of all time” \nWas he even alive to play the 85 Bears? Mar 6, 2017 11:14 AM \n“According to Charles Robinson of Yahoo Sports” \nYeah no way that is going to happen. tylawspick6 says: Mar 6, 2017 11:38 AM \nAnyone paying Glennon 14 mil per needs to be put into a straight jacket and removed from the NFL immediately. \nOh, and Jimmy G’s stock continues to rise. TheDPR says: Mar 6, 2017 11:49 AM \nIt’s not a lot of money for a QB under the current salary cap. It’s nowhere close to the mistake Houston made overpaying Osweiler. Glennon’s a good prospect. Well worth a shot, especially if you don’t promise him he’s the starter – make him earn it. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
