Clean the Metal \nWith the utility knife, scrape any labels off the pipes. Then wipe off the oil coating using a rag soaked with mineral spirits. (Wear disposable gloves and do this in a well-ventilated area.) \n2. Paint the Screws \nTwist the short screws and four of the long ones into cardboard so they stand up. Spray the screw heads with black paint so they’ll match the pipe. \n3. Prep the Wood \nMark the center of the square block using a ruler and pencil. Drill a ¾” hole through the block for the funnel. Sand; rub with tung oil. \n4. Make the Base \nSet the nicer-looking board on your workbench so its best side faces down. Stack the other board on it, edges flush; drill ⅛” pilot holes in the corners. Join with 1” unpainted screws. Flip. Sand. Add tung oil. \n5. Thread the Pipe \nSet a flange on one end of the base and mark its four screw holes. Remove it, drill ⅛” pilot holes, and fasten the flange to the base with 1” painted screws. Thread the 8” pipe onto the flange. Add the elbow, the 3 ½” pipe, and tee. Align the other flange with the block's hole. Join with ¾” screws. Twist the connector onto the flange. Spin the block onto the tee so its edge is parallel with the base. Coat the metal with tung oil to stop rust. \n6. Start Brewing \nSet the funnel in the block hole. Add a coffee filter and ground beans; swirl in hot water.
