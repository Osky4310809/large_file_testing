As his teammates talked about the huge game against UCLA, Diallo discussed why he wasn’t on the floor. It grated on him.\n“For any competitor and basketball player, I feel like it’s hard to be on the bench. This is the most I’ve ever sat on the bench,” he said. “Any competitor would feel like they can go out there and give it their all, lead these guys to a victory. Being with these guys, not being able to help them on the court, it’s tough. But it’s part of the plan.”\nMalik Monk Getty Images Diallo’s early enrollment has been a positive, too. He has faced elite competition daily in practice, going against projected top-10 NBA draft picks De’Aaron Fox and Malik Monk, and they have gotten to face him, too, raising their games as well.\n“We’re glad we got him here, because he’s been helping us in practice,” Monk recently told reporters. “He’s going to be a great player. He’s going to be a competitor. That’s what he does. He plays physical with us. He’s not going to give us any breaks. He’s like 6-6. Great length. Great defender. We’re just happy to have him.”\nDiallo graduated from Putnam Science Academy (Conn.) last year, making him eligible for this June’s draft. But Diallo repeatedly has said he wanted to play college basketball. That remains the plan. He will be part of another blockbuster Kentucky team next year, barring a change of heart, a group of elite freshmen that includes five-star prospects and McDonald’s All-Americans Nick Richards, Quade Green, Jarred Vanderbilt and P.J. Washington.\nDiallo has a head start on them. He already has learned Kentucky’s system, already gotten a taste of the pressure and hype that comes with being a Wildcat, already has seen what Calipari expects from his stars. He has gained seven pounds of muscle and feels like his jumpshot — the biggest knock of his game — has improved.\n“I think it made me a better player already. I’m just a much better player than before I came into these doors,” Diallo said. “Much faster, much stronger. My development has been great.\n“I think it was just a great decision I made. I can’t wait to get on the court next year.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:41:27.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
