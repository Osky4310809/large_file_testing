He was in 17th when the race resumed. Sauter won the first stage of three that make up the new race format in the Truck Series, with the stages divided up into 20, 20 and a final run of 60 laps for the race win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:12:43.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
