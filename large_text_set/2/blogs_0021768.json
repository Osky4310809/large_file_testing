Just like the concept of the movie, the filmmakers are trying to make these promotions different than the usual. The movie releases on 24th March. \nCurrently on a spree of these unconventional promotions, Anushka Sharma will interact with her phone but through the medium of WhatsApp. This is also being done to keep in line with the movie's new song called Whats Up.And because the actress plays a friendly ghost in the movie, the makers want to highlight the factor of ‘invisibility' through calls to fans! This is a first in the history of promotions. \nFox Studios' Chief Marketing Officer, Shikha Kapur said: \n\"A celebrity going invisible during a film's promotion is a first and we would like to continue creating ground-breaking ideas that transcend conventional norms of engagement.\" \nAnd now the part that you have been waiting for! The actress has registered a personal number, but in the name of Shashi, her character in the movie. The number is 9867473178. All you need to do now is save this number and add her to your WhatsApp contact list. \nWe can't wait to see how this goes!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:02:37.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
