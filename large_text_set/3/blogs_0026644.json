U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Moscow of hacking to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election. \nDuring the meeting with the National Front leader, Putin insisted that Russia has no intention of meddling in the French election and only wants to have a dialogue with a variety of politicians. He praised Le Pen, saying she represents part of a \"quickly developing spectrum of European political forces.\" \nLe Pen's anti-immigration and anti-EU platform appeals to the Kremlin, which has postured as a defender of conservative national values against Western globalization. She also has called for strong security ties with Moscow to jointly combat radical Islamic groups, promised to work to repeal the EU sanctions on Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and pledged to recognize Crimea as part of Russia if she's elected.

MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV / AFP - Getty Images \n\"I long have spoken for Russia and France to restore their cultural, economic and strategic ties, especially now, when we face a serious terror threat,\" Le Pen told Putin. The meeting was a surprise addition to her meeting with Russian lawmakers, which was announced earlier this week. \nA Russia-friendly approach to geopolitics runs in the Le Pen family. Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front's co-founder, his daughter Marine and her niece Marion Marechal-Le Pen have all made numerous visits to Moscow over the years. \nLe Pen herself has repeatedly visited Russia, and her party borrowed 9 million euros in 2014 from the small First Czech Russian Bank, but the bank's license was later revoked. \nPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the prospect that Russian banks could offer Le Pen more loans to help fund her campaign. \nPolls show Le Pen as the likely winner of the first round of France's presidential vote on April 23, but indicate that she would lose the presidential runoff on May 7 to centrist independent candidate Emmanuel Macron. \nRussian state-controlled television stations and other media have offered extensive, friendly coverage of Le Pen and Fillon while casting Macron in a more negative light, presenting him as a puppet of outgoing Socialist President Francois Hollande. \nFillon on Thursday claimed that Hollande was manipulating the French justice system to discredit political rivals — a charge that Hollande vigorously denied. \nDmitry Kiselyov, the anchor of the main weekly news program on Russian state TV, has echoed that theme, saying that the French judiciary was working \"as swiftly as a guillotine during the bloody French Revolution\" to undermine Fillon and Le Pen.
