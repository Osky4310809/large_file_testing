With a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 4.85, the Chemical Engineering graduate was the school’s valedictorian. He also made history as the first student with the highest CGPA in the Faculty of Engineering. Ikenna shares his success story with FRANKLIN ONWUBIKO (Corps member, NYSC, Katsina) \nWith a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 4.85, Ikenna Henry Ozofor became the overall Best Graduating Student of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK) in Awka, Anambra State. At the institution’s 11th convocation held last week, the valedictorian received several honours and accolades for graduating with the highest CGPA in the history of the Faculty of Engineering. \nWhen he stepped out for his speech, Ikenna, who studied Chemical Engineering, left members of the audience spellbound when he said: “I never prepared to graduate with a First Class even though I have always had what it takes to be the best.” \nHe attributed his academic feat to hard work, perseverance and persistence, noting that failure was not an option for him despite offering tough courses. \nHaving finished as the best student in secondary school, Ikenna was admitted into the university on scholarship. His sterling performance during his sophomore year school made him to qualify for adittional scholarship offered by firms, including ABC Transport Company, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Chevron Agbami JV, and Allied Energy. \nThe scholarship, Ikenna said, took care of his financial challenges in his undergraduate days, adding that it relieved his parents of the burden to support him. \nIn an interview with CAMPUSLIFE before his valedictory speech at the ceremony, he disclosed that his academic sojourn was replete with misery and challenges he did not plan for. He said he was able to turn his challenges to a success story, having kept his faith in God to whom he dedicated his achievement. \nAccording to Ikenna, his ability to become the best was never doubted. “Like I said, I was convinced I had what it takes to be the best despite my immediate challenges. I always tried to give my best in whatever I did,” he said. \nUnlike many valedictorians, who read for extensive period, Ikenna revealed that he did not spend long hours reading his books. He said he does not have the stamina to read for a long period, noting that the time he used to sleep was more than that which he spent reading. He said he consistently maximised the little time he reserved for reading. \nHear him: “I don’t read for too long hours. My average reading period was four hours and I don’t think I can go beyond this. But, I consistently maximised the little time to understand what was necessary in courses I offered. My daily routine was fixed. I would go for lectures in the morning till evening. When I returned, I would eat and sleep for five hours. I would be awake for four hours to study.” \nUnlike most First Class graduates who normally stay away from social activities while in school, Ikenna is different. He participated in every social event in his department faculty. He described social life as part and parcel of education, noting that he enjoyed his social engagements. \nHe said: “Education is not based on academics alone. A good student needs to be socially-conscious. I participated in every social function organised in my department and faculty since my first year in school. Let me make it clear that, I always studied ahead in courses I offered in each semester before the period for social activities. I would have been through with each course outline before Students’ Week and other social events.” \nIn his valedictory speech, Ikenna said: “My academic path has been decorated with God’s special grace and providence as I enjoyed sound elementary and secondary education at Adonai Foundation School and Dennis Memorial Grammar School (DMGS), both in Onitsha. \n“Having graduated with flying colours from DMGS and met the requirements set for university admission, I was admitted to study Chemical Engineering in a reputable institution, where giants are trained and nurtured. \n“As demanded by its worth, everything about UNIZIK requires tenacity of purpose from students. I was admitted into the university with little expectation. I did not know what CGPA meant, neither did I know what First Class was. My priority then was to make sure I made ‘A’ grade in all the courses. The goal demanded much sacrifice, which I tried meeting through consistency and commitment to my studies. \n“It has been five years of interesting mission. All through my academic journey, there was period of miseries, but God’s grace saw me through all challenges and made me the best.” \nWhile advising his colleagues in junior classes, Ikenna urged them to study hard and pray for God’s guidance. He said: “There are no shortcuts and secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work and learning from failure. They should not give up.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:43:03.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
