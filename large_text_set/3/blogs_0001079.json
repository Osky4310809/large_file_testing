The closed-casket service will be held March 11 at 2 p.m.\nWheeler, a UCF graduate, also spent time as an assistant coach at Colonial, Edgewater and Boone. He served as a dean of students at Bishop Moore while overseeing its baseball program from 1994-2010.\nBishop Moore coach Tony Mehlich, who played for Wheeler from 2000-03, said students considered him a friend and that fellow coaches respected his knowledge and approach to the game.\n“He got the best out of every kid, whether you were the last one on the bench or the star on the team,” Mehlich said. “His passion for the game left an impact on all of my teammates.”\nBishop Moore held a moment of silence for Wheeler on Thursday during the dedication of its newly refurbished field, named in memory of Joe Skinner.\nSkinner, then a 17-year old senior, died last April in Dallas while awaiting a procedure to fight off leukemia.\nWheeler’s son, Matt, is a junior on Edgewater’s varsity baseball team and was a former Bishop Moore bat boy during Mehlich’s playing days. Matt Wheeler was invited into the Hornets’ dugout for their game following the ceremony.\nBishop Moore will pay its respects to Dave Wheeler once more on March 31 when they celebrate the anniversaries of the 1977 and 2007 state title teams.\n“He built an awesome tradition here that we still try to keep intact,” Mehlich said. “Everything that I run here has kind of kept the tradition of what Coach Wheeler was about.”\nCaption State wrestling tournament Preview video for the state wrestling tournament\nPreview video for the state wrestling tournament\nCaption State wrestling tournament Preview video for the state wrestling tournament\nPreview video for the state wrestling tournament\nCaption Edgewater girls lose 7A state basketball semifinal game Edgewater High versus Fort Myers High Class 7A state semifinal game at the Lakeland Center on Thursday, February 23, 2017.
