Applications for the Mercedes-Benz Advance Modern Apprenticeship Programme are currently open for the 2017 intake (July 3), where you’ll be trained to become a Passenger Car Technician, \nIn the process, you’ll also earn a host of Mercedes-Benz internationally recognised qualifications including a diploma from City & Guilds. Furthermore, you’ll also have the opportunity to work alongside qualified professionals from Mercedes-Benz Malaysia as part of a enriching job experience. \nWhat can you expect from the apprenticeship? For starters, all costs (excluding lodging) will be fully sponsored during the three-year programme. Those who are selected will be considered a full-time Trainee, and will get to earn while you learn, as an allowance of RM800 per month will be given for the duration of the programme (three years). \nTraining will take place at the purpose-built Mercedes-Benz Malaysia Training Academy at the company’s Head Office site in Puchong, Kinrara, Selangor. Apprentice Technicians will spend four week blocks there before heading out for on-the-job training at a dealer workshop for eight week blocks. During this time, they will be guided by a dedicated mentor, with regular visits from Mercedes-Benz Malaysia (MBM) staff. \nUpon completion of the programme, participants will receive the following qualifications – NDTS Level 3 (endorsed by JPK), City & Guilds VRQ Level 3 (Vocational Related Qualification), QMT (Qualified Maintenance Technician), QST (Qualified System Technician). \nThese qualifications also contribute to another certificate graduates will receive – the Apprenticeship Framework from Mercedes-Benz. After that, graduates will also be guaranteed employment within MBM’s dealer network, backed by guaranteed increases in salary for four years. Some may even be recognised at the Apprentice of the Year Awards. \nNew Passenger Car Technicians will initially begin their duties by performing routine maintenance and basic repairs. Moving on, they will then progress to complex fault diagnosis and repair, using Mercedes-Benz specialist diagnostic equipment. \nInterested? Well, as stated earlier, the programme has already started accepting applications, which you too can submit at www.mercedes-benz.com.my/AMA . All you need is a minimum of four credits in your SPM results (forecast or actual) or equivalent (IGCSE, O Level UEC), an interest in the automotive industry, good interpersonal skills and the ability to converse in English. Oh, you’ll also need to be between 17 and 22 years of age. \nShortlisted applicants will then need to go through two stages of assessment, where the first involves a mechanical and technical understanding test (MTVT), along with five aptitude tests. Those who successfully pass the first stage will need to attend a face-to-face interview in the second stage, and the results from the assessments will be announced by the first week of June 2017. \nSo, if you’re a school leaver with strong passion for cars, and would love the opportunity to work on Mercedes-Benz vehicles, the Advance Modern Apprenticeship Programme is a perfect fit for you.
