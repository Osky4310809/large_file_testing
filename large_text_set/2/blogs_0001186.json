More notably, there hasn’t been much news on Cash Money’s future outside of known releases from Drake and Nicki Minaj. \nThough the question of whether or not Tha Carter V will drop remains to be unanswered (unless you ask Martin Shkreli) , Baby looks to drop some unreleased music from the legendary New Orleans label soon, according to a recent Instagram post. \n“Wen in my VAULT today found thousands of OLD CASHMONEY MUSIC will release 500 songs this Year #CASHMONEY COLLECTION,” the caption says. \nThroughout the company’s over 20-year history, numerous artists have come and gone. Does this mean we could hear more pre-internet fame Weezy or pre-breakup The Hot Boys? Who knows? See the Instagram post below.
