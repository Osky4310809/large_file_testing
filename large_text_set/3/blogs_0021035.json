Dave Hyde and the Dolphins seem a fit. Whether it works out remains to play out. Brown visited the team last night, and there’s no word that meeting ended, suggesting this is an over-night camp stay.\nAt some point, this is about money, and there’s a simple way to do that from the Dolphins side: Release Koa Misi to free up $4.2 million and transfer that money to Brown’s bank account. \nEasy, right? \nBrown would check off another item on my Dolphins’ to-do list this off-season. But there are a couple of things they’d have to be satisfied with in signing him. The first one is tactical from what would be an improved linebacking corps. Namely, how do the talents and positions of Brown, Lawrence Timmons and Kiko Alonso complement each other? \nAll three played inside last year (Brown and Timmons in 3-4 defenses in Buffalo and Pittsburgh, respectively). Brown did play outside in 2012 and 2013 in Tennessee. New Dolphins linebacker coach Frank Bush coached Brown as a rookie in 2012. \nCan Brown run like he did playing outside for Tennessee? He had three interceptions (two returned for touchdowns), 5.5 sacks and 93 tackles as a rookie. After another good year in 2013, he was hurt in 2014 (pectoral tear) and played only five games in 2015. \nThat led to a show-me year last year with Buffalo. Moved to the inside, he had 149 tackles, four sacks, four passes defensed and two forced fumbles. \nUpgrade? No doubt. His health and contract desires are crucial to any signing. The Dolphins and Brown felt good enough after meeting Monday to evidently not end it. We’ll see what Tuesday brings. \n2. The Jets didn’t fall for the trap in signing Jay Cutler. Too bad. That could’ve been highly entertaining. Instead, they actually made a smart move with 37-year-old Chris McCown. He’s a solid, stop-gap veteran who, if he stays healthy, can be a bridge to whoever is tomorrow. The contract is for $6 million with a comical $5 million in incentives if this rebuilding team makes the playoffs. \n3.Glad our national nightmare is over and the FBI found Tom Brady’s jersey.
