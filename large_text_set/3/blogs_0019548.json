Police suspected Kimberlin had used the bombings to distract from the murder of a woman who was the mother of an employee at a business he used to launder money from his drug-dealing activities. Kimberlin was a suspect in that murder, according to Breitbart . \nLater, according to Time , Kimberlin engaged in a campaign where he offered to pay anyone who had evidence that President George W. Bush rigged the 2004 election. If you’re beginning to notice a pattern here, you’re not alone.   \nKimberlin was part of a plot involving the purchase of documents which, according to BuzzFeed, concluded that Rex Tillerson had made a “$1.6 billion wire transfer from petroleum giant ExxonMobil to a European office of a Chinese mining company, which a day later transferred 1.4 billion euros to the Trump Organization, the privately held conglomerate founded by President Trump.” \nThe documents were supposed to show that Tillerson had paid for the secretary of state job. Wonder of wonders, the documents were an elaborate (well, not that elaborate) hoax. \nAccording to The Daily Caller , when Chalupa, Kimberlin, and Ariel met in Washington, Ariel informed them of the existence of the “documents,” and Kimberlin later agreed to pay the $9,000 asking price and Alex’s three plane tickets to Rome in order to procure them. \nNeedless to say, the whole thing didn’t quite turn out the way they had planned.
