Credit Karsten Moran for The New York Times When I want a satisfying snack, more often than not I opt for something salty, spicy or crisp — a slice of pizza, a taco, an empanada. If I pop into a bakery, it’s the savory cheesy items that appeal, not the sweets. Photo The filling is placed on sheets of phyllo dough, then rolled up and baked. Credit Karsten Moran for The New York Times I recently found myself craving a borek, remembering the delicious flaky little pies I had tasted in Istanbul. (You find similar savory pies throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and neighboring regions.) Had I been in Queens or New Jersey, where Turkish shops and restaurants abound, it would have been an easy yearning to satisfy. Some exist in Manhattan, but not in my neighborhood. Follow NYT Food's board The Best of David Tanis on Pinterest. Instead, I picked up a box of phyllo dough and proceeded to make my own. A borek can be filled with any number of things — spinach, onions, potatoes, eggs, cheese, meat — in any number of combinations. Like baklava, a large borek can be made on a baking sheet and cut into smaller shapes after baking. But often they are made individually, like hand pies, in triangular or half-moon shapes. I’m especially fond of the long sigara borek, rolled to look like a cigar. Photo An egg wash is painted on the boreks before baking. Credit Karsten Moran for The New York Times Some recipes for boreks have very simple fillings: a little yogurt and beaten egg, some mild fetalike cheese. But I was fascinated with recipes that featured complex fillings, with salty, sweet and sour elements. The version I came up with has a meat filling with caramelized onions, ground lamb and a good pinch of cinnamon, cumin and hot pepper. I added raisins and pine nuts as well, and balanced the flavor with the sour taste of sumac powder and the sweet-sour tang of pomegranate molasses. These last ingredients are available in Middle Eastern groceries and online, but you could make do with lemon juice, sweet vinegar and honey.

Credit Karsten Moran for The New York Times I wanted to smear a bit of cheese filling inside, too, and settled on a mixture of thick yogurt and feta laced with parsley and mint. When I asked a Turkish friend if I had gone overboard with two fillings, she kindly hinted that perhaps a plainer rendition might be more traditional. But even if my recipe isn’t entirely authentic, my borek does taste very much like ones I admired in Istanbul. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Though I had planned to roll the pastries into tight cylinders, I adopted a looser, flatter shape, which ended up looking more like a blintz. Once they were painted with egg, sprinkled with sesame or nigella seeds and baked, they emerged bronzed and fragrant. Served whole, these boreks are impressive. But I usually cut each one into two, three or four pieces, making it easier to feed a crowd of snackers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:20:04.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
