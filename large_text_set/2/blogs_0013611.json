Garcia.nProsecutors said Fierro's ex-girlfriends told investigators Fierro had a propensity for using objects during sex, and described some of the same sex acts Fierro and Rodriguez apparently engaged in before Rodriguez's died.nHowever, the court decided a charge of dating\\/family violence aggravated assault with a weapon was dismissed.nThe newspaper said Rodriguez's body was found in an apartment, and Fierro, a kinesiology student at the University of Texas at El Paso who worked as a personal trainer, told El Paso police homicide detectives that he and Rodriguez had spent the night drinking and had engaged in \\\"rough sex\\\" and fell asleep.nPictures on Fierro's mobile showed Rodriguez unconscious and lying on a mattress \\\"with blood surrounding her body\\\".nPreviously, El Paso County medical examiner Dr. Juan Cont\\u00edn testified Rodriguez was still alive when she was fatally injured but was more than likely unconscious based on the amount of blood found at the scene.nIt was determined Rodriguez bled to death from severe internal injuries that apparently took place during sex.nShe had also drunk five times the legal drink drive limit.nFierro's lawyer Thomas D. Carter had argued in court that the couple were \\\"in love\\\" and had engaged in consensual \\u00bf but rough \\u00bf sex after a night of binge drinking while celebrating Valentine's Day.nEndsnn\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"Chico Fierro1.jpg\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}\" data-image-title=\"Student murdered girlfriend during rough sex on Valentines Day\" data-image-description=\"<p>Fierro has been jailed for 25 years (Photo: Chris Murphy)</p> \" data-medium-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nfrom-chris-mur.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=225&strip=all\" data-large-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nfrom-chris-mur.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=768&strip=all\" class=\"img-align-none size-full wp-image-6449359\" src=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nfrom-chris-mur.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&strip=all\" alt=\"Student murdered girlfriend during rough sex on Valentines Day\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1365\" /></div><figcaption>Chico Fieroo, 26, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison (Picture: El Paso Police Department)</figcaption></figure> <strong>A student has been jailed for 25 years for murdering his girlfriend during rough sex on Valentine’s Day. </strong>\nChico Fierro, 26, pleaded guilty to killing Karyna Rodriguez in 2015 following a night of drinking, in which he also took pictures of her unconscious body covered in blood.\n<a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2017/02/14/gardener-on-the-run-after-having-sex-with-a-clients-dog-has-been-caught-6449072\" data-track=\"zone-post-thumbnail-link\" data-track-destination=\"6449072\" class=\"thumbnail-link\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ac_mug_shot_comp.jpg?crop=180px%2C0px%2C842px%2C630px&resize=150%2C113&quality=80&strip=all&ssl=1&w=100&h=75\" data-aspect=\"1.3274336283186\" class=\"thumbnail-link-image\" data-rewritten=\"false\" /><span class=\"mor-title\">Gardener 'on the run after having sex with a client's dog' has been found</span></a> Rodriguez had told police that he and his girlfriend had ‘rough sex’ and then had fallen asleep but officers later found photos on his phone of her lying on the mattress surrounded by blood.\nMs Rodriguez, who was also a student at New Mexico State University, was found in an apartment at midday the following day.\nA preliminary autopsy determined she bled to death from severe internal injuries that apparently took place during sex, the <a href=\"http://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/crime/2017/02/13/el-paso-man-sentenced-rough-sex-murder-case/97871674/\">El Paso Times</a> reported.\n<figure class=\"alignnone img-container shareable-item\" style=\"max-width:620px\"><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a id=\"item-attachment_6449360\" class=\"anchor\"></a><div class=\"item-share-buttons item-share\"><a class=\"share-item share-item-facebook btn\" title=\"Share this on Facebook\" data-track=\"share-item-facebook\"><span class=\"icon icon-facebook\"></span></a><a class=\"share-item share-item-twitter btn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share this on Twitter\" data-track=\"share-item-twitter\"><span class=\"icon icon-twitter\"></span></a><a class=\"share-item share-item-pinterest btn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share this on Pinterest\" data-track=\"share-item-pinterest\"><span class=\"icon icon-pinterest\"></span></a></div><img data-attachment-id=\"6449360\" data-permalink=\"http://metro.co.uk/?attachment_id=6449360\" data-orig-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/countycourt.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&strip=all\" data-orig-size=\"1124,673\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"Lynzy Billing\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1487144981\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"Student murdered girlfriend during rough sex on Valentines Day\" data-image-description=\"<p>Fierro was jailed at 384th District Court (Picture: Google Maps)</p> \" data-medium-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/countycourt.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&strip=all\" data-large-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/countycourt.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1024&strip=all\" class=\"img-align-none size-full wp-image-6449360\" src=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/countycourt.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&strip=all\" alt=\"Student murdered girlfriend during rough sex on Valentines Day\" width=\"1024\" height=\"613\" /></div><figcaption>Fierro was jailed at 384th District Court (Picture: Google Maps)</figcaption></figure> During a bond hearing in 2015, the defendants lawyer Thomas D.
