The Italian is 5/4 (2.25) to take over at the King Power Stadium with Paddy Power. \nFrank De Boer left Inter Milan after failing to produce satisfactory results at the San Siro. The ex-Ajax boss, who has been regularly been linked with Premier League jobs is 5/1 (6.0) at the time of writing. \nHis high-profile status would follow in the same mould as Ranieri's appointment but a return to a relegation battle is hardly the most tempting offer he's likely to receive in the next few months. \nAlan Pardew is an 8/1 (7.0) shot to take over after parting company with Crystal Palace earlier this season but his poor spell with the Eagles doesn't spell much confidence in taking over a side who have picked up just one league point in 2017. \nGary Rowett, another former player, is priced at 8/1 (9.0) and could be an interesting value selection. While the former Birmingham boss lacks the worldwide appeal of Mancini, he is an up-and-coming manager with a fine reputation for his work at both Burton and in his previous role at St Andrews where he was harshly treated by the club's owners. \nThe same firm offer those 8/1 (9.0) odds that Nigel Pearson, the man sacked before Ranieri's arrival, makes a sensational third return to the club, although the sour note upon which he left suggests that price is unlikely to prove a fruitful investment. \nNeil Lennon has plenty of managerial experience both in England and most notably with Celtic and he is listed as a 12/1 (13.0) chance to return to the side where he played a pivotal role in several Premier League campaigns. Another member of that side, Gerry Taggartt is a few ticks bigger at 16/1 (17.0) with Paddy Power. \nThere's then a significant jump in the betting to Avram Grant at 20/1 (21.0), Martin O'Neill (20/1) and Garry Monk at 25/1 (26.0).
