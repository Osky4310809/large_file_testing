Â© Carlos Barria / Reuters Donald Trump may have failed to pass his healthcare bill, but if laughter truly is the best medicine, his healing powers are in full swing. An image of the president in the driverâ€™s seat of a semi truck has snowballed into the latest meme. ok what punk band wants to claim this as an album cover? pic.twitter.com/NNAW2lqeJM â€” Dan Ozzi (@danozzi) March 23, 2017 \nThe photograph was taken on the White House lawn as US President Donald Trump met with representatives from the trucking industry. Trump tweeted the video, in which his delight of sitting in the driverâ€™s seat of a truck is clearly evident, inviting the internet to do its worst. It was an honor to welcome so many truckers and trucking industry leaders to the @WhiteHouse today! pic.twitter.com/M1veooVBNE â€” Donald J.
