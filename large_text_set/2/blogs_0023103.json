The paper’s spokesperson, Kris Coratti, said the slogan will be promoted heavily and seen across different platforms as a value statement :\n“We thought it would be a good, concise value statement that conveys who we are to the many millions of readers who have come to us for the first time over the last year. We started with our newest readers on Snapchat, and plan to roll it out on our other platforms in the coming weeks.”\nSome people tipped their hats to the new slogan, while others had a little fun:\n\nThe best thing about the Washington Post's new \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" slogan is the story about Lindsay Lohan directly under it pic.twitter.com/8hH0FhZCeU \n— Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) February 22, 2017 \nPoetry. \nThe new slogan for The Washington Post: pic.twitter.com/8yLcHmXg3l \n— Jennifer Hollett (@jenniferhollett) February 22, 2017 \nExcellent new slogan from the Washington Post.
