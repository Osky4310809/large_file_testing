Paul with James Bond star Daniel Craig (Photo: Gloucestershire Live) \nHe attended various events at Buckingham Palace, meeting the Queen on numerous occasions, and helped organise her 90th birthday and golden jubilee celebrations. \nRecently he was awarded the ceremonial Master Carmen title, which meant he often attended events alongside HRH Princess Anne. \nPaul, born in Stonehouse, but who lived in London, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in October and passed away on Sunday surrounded by friends and family. \nIt comes after he married partner Annemiek in Holland in October, witnessed the birth of his first son Frank 10 weeks ago and celebrated his 50th birthday in January. \nSpeaking from her home in Stonehouse, his mother Valerie Anne Farley described Paul as \"the love of my life\". \nShe said: \"We're heartbroken by his death, he will be greatly missed. \n\"Paul was very funny, loving and caring man who loved his family very much. He lived life to the full and saw so much of the world.

It so sad Frank will not get to grow up with his father by his side. \n\"Paul was very talented and had all kind of hobbies and passions. \n\"He was also an incredibly generous person and was always involved in some kind of charity event or another. \"He was recently awarded the ceremonial Master Carmen title, which meant he often attended events alongside HRH Princess Anne. \n\"He once spent Christmas in Haiti with Sean Penn, where they worked together building a school and a hospital for people whose communities had been destroyed.

We were all so proud of him and all he had achieved.\" \nPaul joined the cadets at 11, igniting a passion that would endure the rest of his life. After leaving school aged 16 he then joined the Royal Corps of Transport. \nOver the next three decades years he progressed through the officer ranks from Second Lieutenant to First Lieutenant, Major, Captain and on to Lieutenant Colonel. \nHe was also commanding officer of the Scottish Transport Regiment and travelled across the country attending military service events and armed forces days. \nLast year Paul was involved in the celebrations for the Queen's 90th birthday.
