(Photo: Instagram ) More Rihanna gave her fans two powerful looks for Inauguration weekend. While on one hand she displayed a politely reserved “We Should All Be Feminists” tee from Dior , the songstress also turned into the perfect nasty woman. In a bubblegum pink hoodie, tutu by Molly Goddard, Hellz Bellz Middle Finger cap and heels, Riri broadcast a straightforward message to the world and more specifically to the newly inaugurated Trump administration: This P***y Grabs Back. The hoodie, which you can get now for about $40 , broadcast quite the message — clearly a nod to Trump’s own statements about grabbing women’s genitals. To get her message across, the Barbadian princess chose to wear a new brand, launched just last year by model Leomie Anderson. “ I saw Rihanna not too long ago in L.A and got to give her all of my hoodies!” Anderson, a model who recently walked the runway for Victoria’s Secret but also works with younger brands like A Cold Wall, told Yahoo Style in an email about how Rihanna got her hand on LAPP products . “She is a strong, independent role model, and I knew I had to get her in the hoodie as she is everything LAPP represents.” The model has shown her own strength and independence as well. In the past, she became the topic of articles when she took to twitter to talk about the struggles of being a black model in the makeup chair backstage at fashion shows . In fact the brand hopes to build strong women not only by creating pieces with fun, affirmative phrases that reclaim the word ‘no’ for women and reinforce the importance of consent but also hopes to build an online safe space for women to discuss issues related to them. But the Rihanna moment is a big deal. “This moment means a lot to myself and the brand for so many reasons, the fact she chose to wear it to the iconic #womensmarch in NYC over anything else she had in her wardrobe is crazy,” Anderson wrote. “She is one of my biggest inspirations, she works hard, owns her sexuality and is genuinely so talented, everything that LAPP represents, and I hope that in her supporting the brand will draw more women into the blog aspect as well as the clothes and be interested in submitting a piece for LAPP.” And of course there were the sales. “The sale went through the roof; the site even crashed at one point but it’s all good now,” Anderson admitted. “I have managed to sort it with the manufacturers to get a huge quantity out at one time so I’ll definitely be restocking — the pink, of course, is nearly sold out!” Sounds like it was the perfect match all around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:01:53.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
