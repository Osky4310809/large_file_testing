Lucky you. \n\n\n\nWhile I suspect that Chad and Bodhi might be fucking around here, nothing they said is incorrect at all. Paul Walker absolutely deserves a statue in San Clemente, California, the town where his cousin attended high school. \n\nAgain, while I have a feeling that these guys were messing around and trying to go viral don’t let that distract from the facts they were spitting. Paul Walker was the American dream, and that’s who he portrayed on screen. From Varsity Blues to The Skulls to Fast and the Furious , Paul Walker depicted all that was good in this world. He was the handsome and cool surfer bro with a thousand watt smile who could brighten your day in a heartbeat. \n\nThe most important argument Chad and Bodhi brought up? Rocky . Philadelphia has long claimed Rocky as a son of the city, why can’t America do the same for Paul Walker? Rocky, as a franchise, is worth a paltry 4 billion dollars. The Fast franchise has already exceeded that number and is showing no signs of slowing. I think you’d be hardpressed to find someone sane of mind who would argue that Rocky is a more important franchise than Fast , as the facts speak quite loud and quite clear. \n\nIf you ask me, it’s a n0-brainer. A Paul Walker statue, 12 feet in height, must be erected in San Clemente and I’d even go so far as to say that we need one in Washington, DC right next to the Lincoln Memorial. If a statue isn’t feasible then perhaps a robot. We wouldn’t even need to make sure the plug is short so the Walker Robot can’t go rogue, as Paul was too kind a soul and even his robot would never think of harming the American people. \n\n\nPS – I did not appreciate the headlight joke from Chad and Bodhi. Too soon. Poor taste. Feitelberg |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T17:20:35.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
