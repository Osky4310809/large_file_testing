The tool allowed one to quickly check the activation lock status of an iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch by entering its IMEI or serial number. \nThe tool was especially helpful for consumers buying a refurbished or second-hand iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch to check if it was a stolen unit or not. \nApple has removed all references to the Activation Lock status page from its support page when it updated it on January 24th, with the direct link to the tool also not working. Instead, the company now recommends consumers to check the Activation Lock status in person on the device, though this is not a viable solution when buying online through eBay or other channels. \nThe removal of the tool can lead to an increase in scams where a seller with malicious intent can easily sell an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch with its Activation Lock triggered to an unsuspecting buyer. \nWith Activation Lock, an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch owner can lock the device from being usable until in case of a theft. The device can only be used again if one disables Activation Lock using the Find My iPhone app or by logging in with the Apple ID that was already added to the device. Like this post?
