Lonnie Chavis, who plays young Randall Pearson (Sterling K. Brown's character) on the hit NBC series This Is Us , showed up for his very first award show looking adorably dapper in a gray suit jacket, metallic pants, cool kicks, and a bow tie. Eight-year-old Lonnie shared an Instagram photo of himself arriving in a limo with Khloe Thompson , a 9-year-old girl who went viral last year after launching her own charity, Khloe Kares , and passing out homemade bags of necessities for homeless people in her community. What a cute little date night, right? \nLuckily for us, the show, which has been making fans ugly-cry since its premiere, was just renewed for seasons two and three at NBC — so we'll hopefully get to see more flashbacks featuring little Lonnie in the near future.
