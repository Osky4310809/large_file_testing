Kane has another trophy in his collection (Photo: @SpursOfficial /Twitter) \n\"My diet has changed since January,\" he said. \n\"I've got a new chef who I've been working with to help with my nutrition, to get me a bit leaner and quicker and that seems to be working.\" \nThe 23-year-old will be hoping his hot streak continues when Spurs host Millwall in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday, but paid tribute to his team-mates as he accepted the award.
