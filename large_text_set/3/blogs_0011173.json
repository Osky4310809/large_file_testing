The Trans-Pacific Partnership, another disaster, threatens states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania and more, with the loss of countless more jobs.” \n“I am proud to say I followed through on my promise — and by the way many other promises, you’ve seen what’s out there — and pulled out of TPP.” \nWATCH: \nTrump reminded the crowd that he invited automakers to the White House during his first week in office. \n“None of them had seen Oval Office before,” he said. “They employ tens of thousands of people, but none of them had been there.” \nThe president then announced he would rollback the Obama-era executive order that increased fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks. \n“We are going to restore the originally scheduled midterm review and we are going to ensure that regulations protect and defend your jobs, your factories. We are going to be fair. This is an issue of deep importance to me.” \n“We have been abused,” he continued. “No country can lead the free world if it does not protect its industries and care for its people and protect its borders. America will be respected again, and you as workers will be respected again. I think it’s already happened.” \n“May God bless the American worker. May God bless the Motor City. And may God bless the United States of America.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T21:36:41.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
