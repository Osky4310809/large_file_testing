(Photo: Jack Daniel's) \nWith a new, multiyear partnership announced Thursday, Jack Daniel's became an official marketing partner of the NBA, pairing two of America's most beloved pastimes — basketball and whiskey. \nThe partnership, which also spans to the WNBA, D-League and USA Basketball, is the largest partnership with a professional sports league in Jack Daniel's 150-year history. \n\"We saw that (the NBA) shares a lot of the same values that we share. They talk about respect, teamwork, integrity and innovation, and we talk about authenticity, integrity, loyalty and independence,\" John Higgins, VP North America brand director for Jack Daniel's, told USA TODAY Sports. \"We thought, from a Jack Daniel's standpoint, as we look to continue to build lifelong friends, Jack Daniel's and the NBA was a great opportunity for us to reach new friends.\" \nThe partnership will tip off during NBA All-Star 2017 in New Orleans with Jack Daniel's House No. 7 — which will feature musical performances, basketball-themed activities, southern cuisine, and of course, some Tennessee Whiskey. \nAfter the All-Star festivities, Jack Daniel's — also a partner with five NBA teams (Atlanta Hawks, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and San Antonio Spurs) — plans to develop NBA-themed programs at retail stores and restaurants and create custom marketing and advertising campaigns. \n\"I sit back a lot and say, 'If Mr. Jack was here today, would he be happy and proud with what we're doing?' And I do think it's funny ... here's a gentleman who was 5-foot-2, size four shoe, now involved in the NBA. I'm sure he's feeling a lot taller, but I do think it's ironic,\" Higgins said. \nFollow AJ Neuharth-Keusch on Twitter @tweetAJNK 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
