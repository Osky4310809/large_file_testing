Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester United are ready to sanction Wayne Rooney’s transfer to China inside the next month. \nAnd the deal on the table means that the England captain will make more money in three seasons in the Far East than he has in 17 years in the Premier League with United and Everton . \nA number of Chinese clubs have made it clear they are prepared to offer Rooney a contract worth a bank-busting £140million. \nThat is less than the £1million-a-week some sources have claimed, but Roo will still overtake £650,000-a-week Carlos Tevez as the world’s highest-paid footballer by some distance. \nSunday Mirror Sport understands that the move has been approved by boss Jose Mourinho and the United hierarchy. Rooney has struggled to make the starting XI this season (Photo: Alex Livesey) \nWhile the European transfer window closes on Tuesday, China’s mega-rich clubs can keep recruiting until February 28. \nFor the next four weeks an auction will develop to tempt 31 year-old Rooney before the next Chinese Premier League season starts in March. \nThe marketing value of buying the current captain of United and England is massive in China. \nRooney’s former United team-mate Carlos Tevez overtook both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the superstar pay stakes when he recently signed for Shanghai Shenhua. Tevez and Rooney could be set for a reunion (Photo: Getty) \nThere has been a growing feeling inside Old Trafford that the parting of the ways with Rooney was imminent even though he has 18 months remaining on his current £300,000 a-week contract. \nThat means United will save more than £20million on wages alone as they look to put together a package to tempt Atletico Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann in a world-record £100million deal next summer. \nUnited and Rooney want to part on good terms. \nSenior United officials accepted recently that they would review Rooney’s future once he had broken Sir Bobby Charlton’s goal-scoring record as the club’s most lethal marksman.
