CBS \nStephen Colbert had a little fun with dead-eyed Trump advisor Stephen Miller on Monday, releasing a video that responded to Miller’s weekend ravings about voter fraud . Colbert simply takes Stephen’s boast that he is “prepared to go on any show, anywhere, any time” literally, inserting the man and his blathering into The Walking Dead , Game of Thrones , and more. \nThere’s not really much more to the gag: it’s just Stephen Miller ruining your favorite shows with the kinds of voter fraud fear mongering that is usually safely locked away on Fox News. The joke comes from hearing the same sound bite over and over, past the point it has any meaning (not that it had much to begin with). Advertisement \nIt’s unlikely to provoke the kind of response Saturday Night Live gets from Trump, however. Campus conservative columnists like Miller are a very particular breed, who build an identity around gleefully provoking and annoying with what they consider inconvenient truths. (If you don’t know the type, this column by Miller serves as a great introduction.) In other words, this is not a guy who will be stung by the thought of popping up on HBO like a racist jack-in-the-box. It may just be his fondest dream. \nMatthew Dessem is Brow Beat’s nights and weekends editor and the author of a biography of screenwriter and director Clyde Bruckman .
