On Thursday, Ivanka Trump was not listed on Nordstrom's master list of brands available, as Business Insider previously reported .\nTrump's brand did not respond to a request for comment.\nAvailability of Trump's products has been declining on Nordstrom's website for weeks. \nShannon Coulter, who launched the anti-Ivanka Trump boycott last fall , has been tracking the brand's inventory levels on Nordstrom's website for the last couple months. \nAs recently as the first week of December, there were 71 different Ivanka Trump products available on Nordstrom's website, according to Coulter. \nLast week, that number dropped to 26. On Wednesday, there were nine products available. \nCritics of the Trump administration have called for boycotts against dozens of retailers for carrying Trump-branded products.\nBut Nordstrom became one of the main targets of the boycotts after a shopper's open letter to the retailer went viral in October. The letter called Ivanka Trump's brand \"toxic\" and demanded that Nordstrom stop selling it.\nNordstrom responded to the letter in November with a Twitter message that said it wasn't taking a political position by selling Trump's products. \n\"We hope that offering a vendor's products isn't misunderstood as us taking a political position; we're not,\" the company said at the time. \"We recognize our customers can make choices about what they purchase based on personal views and we'll continue to give them options.\" \nReuters \nNOW WATCH: Macy's is closing 68 stores â€” here's where they will shut down \nSee Also: \nIvanka Trump's brand has mysteriously disappeared from Nordstrom's website amid boycotts An anti-Trump movement is calling for the boycott of these 33 retailers Ivanka Trump's 'tone-deaf' photo taken after her father ordered an immigration ban could be a brilliant political move SEE ALSO: Ivanka Trump's 'tone-deaf' photo taken after her father ordered an immigration ban could be a brilliant political move ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T13:40:29.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
