Thanks a bunch, Nick! \nIn the promo, we get a tease of what happens after former Bachelorette Andi Dorfman showed up at Nick’s door last week. (You know, the woman who dumped Nick in season 10 of “The Bachelorette.”) Andi Dorfman surprises rejected ex Nick Viall at his hotel room To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nNick and Andi are catching up over a few drinks, and unsurprisingly, Nick doesn’t seem very happy to see (one of) the woman who broke his heart. \nIn the clip, Nick says to Andi, \nThis is blowing my mind. Super weird. Last time you knocked on my door, surprisingly, you broke up with me. You dumped me on national television. \nAndi fires back with, \nBut now, you’re dumping 29 girls. \nThat’s a pretty fair point, and Nick seems to realize it. But then he just has to go and ruin everything by responding, \nI know, maybe 30. \nU EXCUSE ME? WHAT? \nNick’s really just going to waste all our time like that? \nAnd let me guess — he’s going to be a contestant on the next season of “The Bachelorette” with Rachel Lindsay , the very woman he’s about to dump, right? \nBecause for whatever reason, ABC thinks we just can’t get enough of Nick Viall. (Spoiler alert: We have gotten enough. More than enough. Way, way too much.) \nPersonally I’m still rooting for Corrine to win. What’s more wife material than cheese pasta? \nAnyway, if you’re some kind of masochist, you can continue watching this pointless season of “The Bachelor” this Monday at 8 pm ET/PT on ABC.
