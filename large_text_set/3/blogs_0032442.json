We’re going to keep our citizens safe,” the president said. “The danger is clear. The law is clear. The need for my executive order is clear.” \nTrump said the presidential authority is there to act as he did. \n“This is… an unprecedented judicial overreach. The law and the Constitution give the president the power to suspend immigration when he deems… it to be in the national interest,” Trump said.
