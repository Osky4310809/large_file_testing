Governments in this country have no business organizing trips to Kan Ham’s monument to ignorance. The Ark park is designed to convert people to a factually incorrect belief and it discriminates against LGBTQ and non-Christians in hiring. It cannot be constitutionally supported by our governments.” \nI am happy to see the town do the right thing. I am sure once news of this reaches Ham, we will get a nice long winded article about Christian persecution.
