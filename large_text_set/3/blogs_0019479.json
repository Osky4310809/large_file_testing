The new nighttime show will start on April 21 and run through November. \nAlthough it’s well-known magical knowledge that human beings cannot see dementors, the park will bring them to life with nighttime projections across Hogwarts and the Black Lake. \nVisitors should be sure to keep a respectful distance from the dementors lest every good feeling and happy memory be sucked out forever. However, in addition to the appearance of dementors, the Osaka park announced a way for guests to protect themselves: wand magic . Much like the technology available at the Wizarding World in Orlando, guests will be able to use interactive wands to cast fire and snow spells. \nThere are also rumors swirling that dementors will come to Universal Studios Hollywood as part of their nighttime spectacle, although nothing has yet been confirmed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:31:47.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
