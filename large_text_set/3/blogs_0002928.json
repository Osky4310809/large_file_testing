Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. \nIf you count 1987's Overboard among your favorite films, you may not be happy about this news: a remake is on the way. Anna Faris is starring . . . in Kurt Russell's original role. That's right, the new movie is flipping the genders of the main characters , and \"will see spoiled playboy from one of Mexico's wealthiest families (Eugenio Derbez) who falls overboard off his yacht, and is convinced by a single, working-class mom (Faris) that he is her husband.\" Derbez is one of Latin America's biggest movie stars, and you may recognize him from the 2013 comedy Instructions Not Included . He's also starring in the upcoming films How to Be a Latin Lover and The Nutcracker and the Four Realms , so you'll definitely have more chances to see him before he turns up in Overboard . \nAs a lifelong fan of the Goldie Hawn original, I don't feel great about this news. Why bother updating what is already a fantastic movie? There are so many great moments ! I have a hard time imagining that a new take on the story can top Hawn proclaiming, \"That Elk Snout mountain man is still working on my closet. Sweating all over the place.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:56:54.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
