God judges.\" by Ron Capshaw January 7, 2017 at 3:40pm Share on Facebook Share Tweet Email Email Print Advertisement - story continues below \nThe View is known for lively debates, but co-host Whoopi Goldberg may have taken it up a notch. \nA day after Speaker of the House Paul Ryan promised that Planned Parenthood would be defunded along with Obamacare, Goldberg went ballistic Friday in a debate with co-host Jedediah Bila. \nWhen told by co-host Sara Haines that more than 80 percent of Planned Parenthood’s patients live below the poverty line, Goldberg turned her anger toward Bila. Advertisement - story continues below \nGoldberg said the proposed defunding would target low-income women. \n“The only people who are going to eat it when Planned Parenthood goes away are women who need the services,” she said.

I’m not there to judge. God judges,” she said. \nBila, a self-described libertarian , said people on the pro-life side of the aisle aren’t telling women what to do with their bodies. They just don’t want their taxes going for abortions.

We’ll be right back! God!,” she shouted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T02:09:15.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
