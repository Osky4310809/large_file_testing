Ex-Cyclone Debbie has now been downgraded to a tropical low, and has moved inland. The latest advice from the Bureau of Meteorology puts the tropical low 80 kilometres west-southwest of Colinsville. It is continuing to move west-southwest at 14km/h, and continues to bring rain, and winds of 55km/h per hour with wind gusts to 85km/h near its centre The situation remains dangerous. Severe weather warnings are in place for Queensland’s central coast, Whitsundays, the Central Highlands and Coalfields, Capricornia and parts of the Central West and Maranoa and Warrego Forecast Districts Authorities continue to fear major flooding, as heavy rainfall continues to swell rivers across a broad region. A flood watch is current for the coastal catchment regions The state emergency service received about 700 calls for help, and is waiting for first light before responding. The army is also ready to help with the recovery effort There are early reports of serious injuries, including to a man who was injured in a wall collapse. Authorities are warning to prepare for further reports of injuries or deaths Phone service and power remains out for thousands of homes in the region. Power was lost to at least 50,000 homes on Tuesday afternoon. That means authorities are still waiting for reports of the extent of damage and destruction across the region Roads are cut off and closed all over the region. Downed power lines and trees have cut off access to some areas, making it difficult for emergency services BOM Queensland (@BOM_Qld) #CycloneDebbie is now a tropical low, though the situation remains very hazardous.
