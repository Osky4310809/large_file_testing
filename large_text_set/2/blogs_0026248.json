With integrated ZigBee to support mesh sensor networks, it is also well-suited for logistics use cases such as inside of a warehouse Digital Signage and Retail, Model 3003 , for general purpose IoT applications and media use cases such as vending, point-of-sale, streaming video, etc. includes I/O for graphic displays 2560×1600, 3.5mm line in/line out audio \nUbuntu Core is officially supported on the Dell Edge Gateway 3000 series. Ubuntu Core is an OS built entirely of snaps , the universal Linux packaging format. With snaps and their transactional update capabilities, enterprises can easily deploy new software onto their gateways with the certainty that their device will continue to operate whether the update is successful or not. Enterprises looking to deploy IoT solutions also benefit from the large number of developers and system integrators offering IoT solutions for Ubuntu. \nThe Dell Edge Gateway 3000 Series will be available early summer 2017 in select countries, starting at $299 USD.
