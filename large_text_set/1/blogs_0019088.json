The crime drama comes from executive producers Graham Yost and Bryan Cranston, the latter of whom originally pitched the pilot to CBS with David Shore. It stars Giovanni Ribisi as Marius/Pete, a con man trying to get one over on beloved character actress Margo Martindale (which we simply won’t stand for) and a crime boss played by Cranston. \nThe first season’s been a bit of a bumpy ride, but Amazon Studios wants to see more. Joe Lewis, head of comedy and drama, said the streaming company took into account the “the critical response” and subscriber engagement in making the decision. This gives Sony Pictures Television a 1-for-2 record with Amazon, which pulled the plug on the Good Girls Revolt earlier this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:41:40.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
