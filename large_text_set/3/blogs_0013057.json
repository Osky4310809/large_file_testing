Having said that, Internet access has been declared a basic right just like water, food, and education for each and every Kerala citizen. \nAs per the Finance Minister, this move falls in line with UN, which said that all people must have access the Internet to practice their right to express and opinion. \nProject named as K-Fon, the government is planning to lay optic fiber cable just next to Kerala State Electricity board (KSEB). Moreover, the government wants to implement broadband to all households and Wi-Fi hotspots in public areas and joints. The so-called K-Fon is expected to be completed in 18 months with the budget of Rs. 1,000 crore. \nFinance Minister, Mr Issac said: \nInternet will now become a right for the people and within 18 months the internet gateway would be set up through the K phone network at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. \nIt is estimated that by 2017-18, almost all government transactions will become IT-based. Thus the right to basic Internet facility will become a prerequisite for providing civic services universally through the electronic medium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T16:14:23.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
