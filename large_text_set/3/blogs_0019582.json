World Water Day is part of a global mission to get safer water for all.\nIt’s a day for people to learn, get involved and take action.\nThis is the 24th year, and it’s organised by UN Water in collaboration with governments and partners.\nThe United Nations organisation sets a theme each year.\nWhat are its origins? (Picture: AFP/Getty) The UN decided back in 1992 there needed to be more global awareness on water issues.\nThe United Nations General Assembly decided March 22, 1993, would be the first World Water Day, and it has been held annually since.\nOne of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to make sure everyone in the world has access to safe water by 2030.\nWhat is the theme for 2017? This year World Water Day’s theme is wastewater.\nWhat’s that? Wastewater is water that has been used.\nThis includes water from homes, businesses, industries and institutions.\nThe term covers everything from sewage and bathwater to washing up water.\nThis year’s campaign, ‘Why waste water?’, is about reducing and reusing wastewater.\n\nHow can I waste less water? UN Water suggests taking these simple steps –\n1. Turn off the tap while you’re brushing your teeth\n2. Turn off the tap while washing up or scrubbing vegetables.\n3. Put rubbish, oils, chemicals and food in the bin, not down the drain. The dirtier your wastewater, the more energy and money it costs to treat it.\n4. Collect used water from your kitchen sink or bath and use it to water your plants\n5. You cans also collect and use this water to wash your bike or car.\nHow else can I get involved in World Water Day 2017? You can take part in Water Aid UK’s campaign to raise awareness and funds.\nWhether you decide to dye your hair blue, bake blue cakes to sell in the office or simply use the hashtag #Blue4Water on social media to explain why you’re supporting the day, is up to you.\nMore information on Water Aid UK can be found here .\nFurther information from UN Water can be found here .\nMORE: Tap water is ‘better for you than bottled water \nMORE: Does water go off if you leave it by your bed overnight?
