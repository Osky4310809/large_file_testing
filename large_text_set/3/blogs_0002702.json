The idol pulled out two bags and surprised everyone when she revealed that they would be trying mealworm and grasshopper. \nHer father joked that grasshoppers are great with milk and that they regularly eat them for breakfast. However, when he tried showing off by pouring them into his mouth, his expression changed almost immediately, proving that was definitely a lie. \nJeon Somi then tried a few herself and was surprised by the taste, saying it tasted “similar to black beans.” However, even after offering to “rip the wings off” for her, she could not convince the show’s MC Seo Yuri to try them. \nShe then casually began snacking on the mealworms and compared them to fish jerky, which piqued Seo Yuri’s interest. When she finally popped a couple into her mouth, she was surprised to find how accurate the description was, and even joined the idol in recommending them to viewers! \nCheck out Jeon Somi’s bravery in action in the clip below! \nWould you be able to take on this challenge?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T05:29:41.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
