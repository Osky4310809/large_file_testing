Careless: Suitcases were tossed onto the runway at Luton \nMr Ozolins told the Standard: “Me and my brother were watching the plane parking next to the gate and the staff started to unload. \n“The two gents parked with the luggage vehicle and started unloading. The first bag was thrown at the back of the truck. My first thought was that he misjudged the throw and that it was an accident. Then the other bags kept flying. I got my phone and started recording to help the owners of the bags if something valuable got broken.” Throw: A suitcase is hurled onto a truck at Luton \nHe added: “I travel a lot in my work, with expensive equipment that provides my living and I saw myself in the owners’ position. I got really upset by the unprofessional behaviour.” \nA spokesman for the company said: “Menzies Aviation considers the safe conveyance of passengers’ luggage to be a matter of the highest importance. The behaviour displayed in this video is unacceptable. Probe: the footage was filmed at London Luton Airport \n“We will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that such behaviour is stopped, and our professional standards are upheld properly in future.” \nLondon Luton Airport and easyJet said they were working with the handling company. \nEasyJet added: “We work closely with all of our airport partners to ensure our passengers’ bags are handled securely.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:21:23.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
