Photo release \nMANILA, Philippines — News of older sister Anne Curtis’ wedding to Erwan Heussaff hit Jasmine Curtis like rain after a long dry spell. \nJamine shed tears of joy, knowing that Anne no longer has to answer nagging questions about getting married. \n“It’s so overwhelming,” Jasmine admitted after the press con of \"Baka Bukas,\" where she plays a 20-something lesbian secretly in love with her best friend. \nJasmine explains that she turned emotional because Anne needs to deal with fans, members of the press and others curious to find out why she has not walked down the aisle the way her friends Georgina Wilson, Solenn Heussaff and Isabelle Daza, have. \n”It (the pressure) is not something she told me, but you can feel it as a woman yourself. It’s been going on for years. Like ‘Why are you rushing me? It will happen at the right time',” added Jasmine. \nUnlike her sister, Jasmine admitted she cannot take it when people are forever asking her about when she will get married.   \n“I might refuse to be interviewed,” Jasmine pointed out. \nShe cannot give details about the wedding – date, venue, entourage, etc. – yet because the sisters have yet to talk about it. But one thing is sure - nothing will change between Anne and her family when she becomes Mrs. Erwan Heussaff. Anne will always be there for her loved ones. \n“I know my ate , ” said Jasmine. “She never neglects her family. She’ll always have time for us if we ask for it. Only her (civil) status will change.” \nAs for her, Jasmine is noot even thinking of marriage. She and surfer-boyfriend Jeff Ortega are still getting to know each other better. They are grabbing every travel opportunity, the latest of which was Japan with Jasmine’s family. \nJasmine does not mind rushing to catch a plane or train because of Jeff’s “lack of understanding about time management.” In fact, Jasmine sees this “male trait” downright amusing. \n“I found someone who shares my interest in travel,” she gushed. \nJeff knows her dreams are many, her plans big. Jasmine wants to explore more roles – different, intense, like Alex, her character in \"Baka Bukas,\" which is now showing in theaters nationwide. \nThe Cinemalaya Best Supporting Actress (for \"Transit \") wants to do more indie films because she loves the “wide story range and freedom” they offer. \nShe also wants to make it clear that everyone – male, female, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender -- are equal; free to express love. \nFreedom, however, is not absolute, even for someone as liberal as Jasmine. \nShe insisted that “kaya mong pakiligin ang tao” without kissing on screen. Of course, she talks to her director about it. But she has survived for six years in the business without kissing scenes that are supposed to bring people to the movies. Critics still notice her. Moviegoers still watch her. \nBesides, Jasmine has a life outside her career. “There has to be work-life balance. Industry people are overworked. They lack sleep. They get sick,” she observed. \nJasmine wants to “treat my career as a career, not my life.” \nShe took two months off from showbiz to catch up with her parents in Australia. This time, there were no shootings or tapings that got in the way -- only months of laughing and sharing stories with mom and dad. By going back to her roots, Jasmine is proving she can reach for the stars and keep her feet firmly planted on the ground. She knows what lasts and what does not. Not everyone – actor or otherwise – knows that.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T11:52:27.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
