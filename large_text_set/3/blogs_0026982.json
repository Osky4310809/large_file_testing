March 23, 2017 | 3:42 PM 0 \nAfter teasing four new songs on various radio stations earlier today (March 23), Gorillaz has returned with the official announcement of the United Kingdom-based duo’s fourth studio album, Humanz . Along with the title and cover art reveal, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett — the musical geniuses behind Gorillaz — have generously shared all four songs, including “Ascension” featuring Vince Staples, “Andromeda,” with D.R.A.M., the reggae-flavored “Saturn Barz” and “We’ve Got The Power.” \nThe announcement comes only days after a leaked tracklist surfaced online unveiling the high-profile collaborations, which also include Pusha T, De La Soul, Danny Brown, Anthony Hamilton, ’70s folk singer-songwriter Carly Simon, rock icon Grace Jones, and popular Jamaican artist Popcaan. True to form, the music is animated with Gorillaz’s signature cartoon characters — Noodle, 2D, Murdoc Niccals and Russel Hobbs. \nRecorded in London, Paris, New York, Chicago, and Jamaica, Humanz is expected to arrive on April 28 and can be pre-ordered here . Check out the 360 video for “Saturnz Barz” below and all four tracks above. Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You!
