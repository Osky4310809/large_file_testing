However, now it has been further postponed by a month to 12 May. Amit Sadh, Yami Gautam, Amitabh Bachchan, Manoj Bajpayee and Jackie Shroff in the poster of Sakrar 3. Twitter \nThe production banner of the film, Eros Now took to twitter to announce the new release date. It attributed the decision to delay in post-production work of the film. It also stated that the decision to push the date has been made in mutual agreement with the director Varma and the lead actor Amitabh Bachchan. We, at Eros along with @SrBachchan , @RGVzoomin and Wave took a mutual decision to postpone the release of Sarkar 3 to 12th May 2017! \n— Eros Now (@ErosNow) March 21, 2017 \nThis delay is due to delay in post production work! #Sarkar3 — Eros Now (@ErosNow) March 21, 2017 \nUnfortunately, on its new release date, the film will clash with three films - Anurag Basu's action comedy adventure Jagga Jasoos , Akshay Roy's romantic comedy Meri Pyaari Bindu and Saket Chaudhary's Hindi Medium . \nJust like that of Sarkar 3, the release date of Jagga Jasoos saw several delays. While the director Anurag Basu stated the ongoing exam season as the reason, other reasons of delay was reported as well, including the re-shoot of a few scenes and the brewing tension between former lovers and lead actors of the film, Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif, over promoting the film together. \nThe other two films can prove to be formidable competitors to Sarkar 3 as well. Meri Pyaari Bindu stars the fresh pairing of Ayushmann Khurrana and Parineeti Chopra, backed by Yash Raj Films. Hindi Medium stars Irrfan Khan and Pakistani actor Saba Qamar. \nInternational Business Times reports that the producers of all three films, besides Sarkar 3 , are trying to figure out a solution that ends up benefiting all parties. Though the three films are believed to belong to three different genres, they may end up eating into each other's business, given that they feature top stars of the industry. \nSarkar 3 also stars Jackie Shroff, Yami Gautam, Amit Sadh, Manoj Bajpayee, Ronit Roy and Supriya Pathak Kapur. \n 11  11 pm Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T11:56:46.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
