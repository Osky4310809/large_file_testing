Coast Guard Finds Helicopter Wreckage in Water Near San Pedro; 1 Victim Identified by Family Erin Myers reports for the KTLA 5 News at 3 on Jan. 5, 2016.\nErin Myers reports for the KTLA 5 News at 3 on Jan. 5, 2016. \nVeronica Rocha \nThe passenger of a helicopter that crashed into the Port of Los Angeles on Wednesday night was veteran freelance photographer on assignment to capture rare photos of a trio of cruise ships inside the harbor. \nMichael Justice, 61, of San Pedro, and pilot Christopher Reed, 41, of Hermosa Beach, were aboard the black Robinson R-22 helicopter when it crashed near the breakwater that juts out from Cabrillo Beach, killing them. Their bodies were recovered from the aircraft’s wreckage Thursday morning. \nJustice was a port photographer and had commissioned a flight on Wednesday after three cruise ships made a rare stopover at the harbor, said port spokesman Phillip Sanfield. The port, he said, doesn’t usually get a visit from three cruises at one time. \nHe wanted to capture the vessels in the fading sunlight, Sanfield said. \nReed and Justice took off from Zamperini Field in Torrance in one of the copters registered to JJ Helicopters Inc. and flew over the harbor. \nSeveral passengers aboard a cruise ship told authorities that the helicopter circled one of the ships three times before it went down about 5:45 p.m., Sanfield said. \nSeveral other people in the area called 911 notifying dispatchers of the aircraft, which was believed to have crashed near the Angels Gate Lighthouse. The lighthouse sits at the end of the breakwater. \nThe U.S. Coast Guard and Los Angeles Port Police searched for the wreckage of the plane, but did not find it. \nJustice and Sanfield never reported back to the Torrance airbase, Sanfield said. \nThen on Thursday, police used sonar equipment to locate the aircraft. \nJustice worked with the port since 2010 and has shot for several publications, including the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, National Geographic Adventurer and Time magazine. He photographed Mother Teresa in Calcutta in 1996. \n“He was really an extended member of the harbor family,” Sanfield said. “He lived and breathed on the docks.” \nReed was an accomplished pilot, Los Angeles Port Police Chief Thomas Gazsi said at a news conference Thursday, adding that he “will be greatly missed.” \nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash.
