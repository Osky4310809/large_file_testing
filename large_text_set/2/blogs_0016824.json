His last few spars have been absolutely top class and exactly what we need to do for this fight. \nFighters can always show you how you can win a fight but also how they lose a fight but Gavin's consistency is the main thing I have been looking for and that is exactly what he's been doing. Gavin McDonnell is in the best shape of his career, says David Coldwell \nHe has been following the gameplan and executing it perfectly; doing the right shots at the right time and also defending what he will need to defend. The more and more I have watched Vargas and the more and more I've seen Gav in the build-up, that gap is getting smaller and smaller. David Coldwell \nRey Vargas is clearly a fantastic prospect and has a great amateur pedigree whereas Gavin hasn't had a single amateur fight. He is only 18 fights into his career full-stop and it is going to be a tough, tough fight and the gap between them tells us it is going to be a hard night. \nBut Gavin McDonnell will be at the best he possibly can and the more and more I have watched Vargas and the more and more I've seen Gav in the build-up, that gap is getting smaller and smaller. You can book the Sky Sports Box Office event here... \nVargas hasn't beaten anyone that Gavin couldn't beat - and vice-versa - but everyone who gets in the ring with Gavin McDonnell thinks they are going to beat him. Gavin doesn't do anything outstanding and if you are sat watching him on TV, you might even think he isn't very good, but the one thing is, he always finds a way to win. \nVargas has always boxed in Mexico and as such a good prospect, he has been expected to win every one of those fights and the guys getting in with him might see if they can pull off a shock but aren't believing they could win. Gavin McDonnell will be in it to win it, believe me. Tale of the Tape - Gavin McDonnell v Rey Vargas \nHis boxing skills are under-rated and he has so much desire, so much heart and he wants the WBC title. He has shown me he can do that on Saturday night. \nIf he does beat Vargas it will be fantastic. He is genuinely such a nice kid and he's always been in his brother's shadow but has never complained or moaned. He has to wait for his opportunities to get on those big fight nights but Eddie Hearn has done it, got him to No 2 in the WBC rankings and done his job. Stefy Bull (r) was behind Gavin's rise and remains a good friend \nIn fact, everyone has done their job with Gavin. Stefy Bull is one of his best mates and he guided him when it came to turning pro and bringing him through. His previous trainer did his bit, Jamie will always do his bit and I have done my bit to get him where he is. \nNow he is in the best place possible to become a world champion. He is in the best shape ever, he is just coming together when it really matters. Rey Vargas has amateur pedigree and is the favourite \nIt is all new for Gavin, doing the media stuff, being the centre of attention and out of his brother's shadow, but he is a very strong-minded kid and I think he will control his emotion and stay focused and if he can do that for three minutes of every round, I believe Gavin McDonnell will become the WBC world champion. \nWatch Gavin McDonnell vs Rey Vargas from Hull, live from 8pm, Saturday, live on Sky Sports 2.
