Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester City have targeted young France winger Kingsley Coman to be part of their £200million summer rebuild . \nBlues boss Pep Guardiola brought Coman to Bayern Munich from Juventus on a long-term loan at the start of last season, and is keen to be reunited with the highly-rated 20-year-old. \nBayern have the option to sign Coman on a permanent basis, but Guardiola's successor Carlo Ancelotti is said to be unlikely to trigger that clause. \nThat has left the door open for City, and sources in France suggest they are ready to spend around £40m to land Coman ahead of rival interest across Europe. Coman played for Guardiola last season, but successor Ancelotti appears less keen on him (Photo: Bongarts/Getty) \nComan has no interest in returning to Juve and had hoped to take advantage of the fact 33-year-olds Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery are nearing the end of their stellar careers to earn a permanent move to the German giants. \nBut with Bayern seemingly reluctant to make him their player, City are ready to move to land a precocious talent they have had scouted extensively during this season. \nGuardiola is looking to add Coman to his young and formidable front trio of Leroy Sane, Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus, which would give him one of the most exciting attacks in European football. Signing Coman would add to City's stockpile of pacy young forwards (Photo: Getty) Read More Why boss Guardiola has banned chocolate for EVERYONE at City's training complex \nCity are looking at a huge rebuild this summer, following their shock Champions League last 16 exit at the hands of Monaco last week, where they held a two-goal advantage from the first leg but still went out. \nAs many as a dozen players are likely to leave the Etihad this summer, with Guardiola looking to strengthen the entire spine of his team for a sustained challenge at home and abroad next season.
