Grease or line a 12-cup standard muffin tin with paper liners. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla until no big lumps of brown sugar remain. Pour the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture and fold together with a rubber spatula until just combined. Fold in the chocolate. Divide the batter among the muffin wells. \nBake until a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs (test in several places in case you hit a pocket of melted chocolate), 15 to 20 minutes. Let the muffins cool 10 minutes before removing from the pan. If you greased the pan, run a thin knife around each muffin to loosen it from the pan first. Serve warm or at room temperature. Recipe Notes Storage: The muffins can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. They can also be individually wrapped in plastic wrap. Freezing the muffins: These muffins freeze very well; store them in an airtight resealable plastic bag. If packing in lunch boxes, I like to individually wrap them in plastic wrap before freezing so I can just throw one into a lunchbox or backpack to thaw.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:13:51.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
