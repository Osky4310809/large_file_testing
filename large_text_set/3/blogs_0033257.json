I’m already thinking about how that previous sentence could’ve been phrased better: Would \"and\" have fit better than \"yet?\" Did I really need to use \"upon\" at the end there? These are the questions that both haunt the minds of writers and drive their desire to get better.\nIt's also a universal skill that can help you regardless of your job title, and can help you excel at work in countless ways. Whether you’re a student, a blogger, working on a cover letter for a new job, or simply looking to improve your email etiquette, Udemy is currently offering a course entitled \" Ninja Writing: The Four Levels Of Writing Mastery \" that could help you engage more with the writing you already do everyday.\nThe course is instructed by Shani Raja , a former editor at \"The Wall Street Journal\" with writing credits from \"The Economist,\" \"Financial Times,\" and \"Bloomberg News,\" among others. He is also the instructor of \" Writing With Flair: How To Become An Exceptional Writer ,\" one of the top-selling writing courses on Udemy.\nIn this new course, Raja aims to teach students to improve their work by examining their writing on four separate levels: narrative, paragraph, sentence, all the way down to individual words. By analyzing your work through these different lenses, you’ll have a wider perspective of what your story is trying to say, and the different ways you can weave together your message in order to best convey it to the reader.\nNormally, the course would cost $2oo but through the end of March you can improve your writing skills with this course for just $1o — just be sure to use the code \" ENDMARCH10 \" at checkout. No matter what writing evel you're at, there is always room for improvement, and this course can help make your writing sharper and more engaging.\nNinja Writing: The Four Levels Of Writing Mastery, $10 (originally $200), available on Udemy .
