Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times President Trump came forward with a nonsensical statement on Wednesday as he dangerously backed away from the two-state solution, which has been central to America’s Mideast policy for more than 20 years and remains the only just answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “So, I’m looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like,” Mr. Trump, who has no experience in Middle East peacemaking, said at a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel , adding, “ I can live with either one.” There is no conceivable one-state solution that both parties will like. Smiling by Mr. Trump’s side, Mr. Netanyahu, who has steadily undermined the prospect of a Palestinian state, clearly believed his vision was the one the new American president had in mind. The two leaders seemed almost giddy in their first official meeting, which was intended to show how Mr. Trump can be a better friend to Israel than President Barack Obama would, even though Mr. Obama completed a new 10-year, $38 billion defense agreement with Israel. Mr. Trump voiced optimism about getting a “great peace deal” between Israel and its neighbors. While Mr. Trump did urge Mr. Netanyahu to “hold back” on settlements in the West Bank and said Israel must make compromises, he offered no details on any peace initiative, and the vagueness of his remarks suggests he has no inkling of how to move forward. His willingness, however, to lend credence to those who would deny a separate state to the Palestinians will certainly make peace harder to achieve. Palestinians have long sought their own state and are sure to reject the idea of having their lands annexed by Israel, even if they were offered some kind of limited autonomy.
