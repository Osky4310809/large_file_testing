Streep declared President-elect Donald Trump a bully while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award at the glitzy ceremony. “Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence,” Streep said. “And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” WATCH: Meryl Streep Slams Trump Upon Accepting Award at Golden Globe Awards McCain then Tweeted that Streep’s speech was “why Trump won,” adding that, “if people in Hollywood don't start recognizing why and how - you will help him get re-elected.” In response, the Billy on the Street star tweeted a series of replies in which he called McCain “a fu**ing moron,” while defending Streep. “Um she asked him not to make fun of disabled people and advocated for the freedom of the press and the arts you fuc**ng moron,” wrote Eichner. McCain hit back, accusing Eichner of living in a bubble, to which he replied that he would rather live in a bubble than “with people who don't feel a need to respect the disabled, freedom of speech & the arts!!” “Love being told I live in a bubble by the daughter of a millionaire politician who sometimes guest co-hosts Hoda and Kathie Lee,” Eichner added. . @MeghanMcCain Oh & another message from my bubble-can u ask dad to give back the MILLIONS he's received from the NRA? MERYL FUCKING STREEP! — billy eichner (@billyeichner) January 9, 2017 Eichner then turned his attention toward Trump’s tweet about Streep, calling her “over-rated .” \n“It doesn't matter what Trump thinks of Meryl,” he continued. “What matters is he's ignoring American intelligence agencies, which is a threat to our nat'l security, pushing a racist to be Attorney General & Congress sidestepping standard ethics reviews of cabinet members. FOCUS ON THAT.” \"Never get in a wrestling match with a pig because you both get dirty and the pig likes it\". Done talking Hollywood and d-list comedians. WATCH: Meryl Streep’s Powerful Golden Globes Speech: Celebs React McCain attempted to end the dispute with a tweet that appeared to be aimed at Eichner on Monday. \"Never get in a wrestling match with a pig because you both get dirty and the pig likes it,” she wrote. “Done talking Hollywood and d-list comedians.” \nBut Eichner got the last word in, tweeting, “Imagine being one of the greatest artists in the world and getting attacked for making a plea for EMPATHY. What a sad world.” See more on Streep’s acceptance speech in the video below.
