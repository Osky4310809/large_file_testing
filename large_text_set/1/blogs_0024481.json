Piers Morgan did as he was told (Photo: ITV) \nThe two presenters went up on stage to present an award, with Piers sporting a black band of material wrapped around his jaw to stop him talking. \nSpeaking about how she'd managed to get Piers to shut up for five minutes, Susanna told the audience: \"It's been a controversial week on Good Morning Britain. We've had tears, we've had tantrums – we've even had a walkout. \n\"So I've done what people have been urging me to do for some time… I've finally gagged Piers Morgan. Just enjoying this moment.\" Piers Morgan booed on NTA stage while gagged by Susanna Reid (Photo: ITV) \nThe crowd clapped and cheered for Susanna, having booed Piers when he first got up in front of them. \nIt came after Piers took his public spat with Ewan McGregor to the next level - by insisting the actor have a fight with him on live TV. \nThe controversial host, 51, was filmed on the National Television Awards' red carpet where he was heard telling the Trainspotting performer to \"be a man\" and debate him.
