The full aerokit, which also included sportier side skirts, was previously offered as a RM2,045 option . \nAside from that, specifications and equipment are identical, and include projector halogen headlights with LED positioning lights, sportier front and rear bumpers, side skirts, a rear spoiler, clear lens LED tail lights and 14-inch turbine-design two-tone alloy wheels. \nInside, there’s silver interior trim, red instrument cluster lighting, semi-bucket fabric seats, an anti-snatch handbag hook, a Bluetooth-enabled head unit and four speakers. The Advance adds door visors, leather seats, coiled floor mats and a touchscreen infotainment system with a reverse camera. All models get dual airbags, and the SE and Advance also gain ABS with EBD and brake assist. \nPower comes from a 3SZ-VE 1.5 litre DVVT four-cylinder engine that produces 102 hp at 6,000 rpm and 136 Nm of torque at 4,400 rpm. The SE model gets a choice between a five-speed manual gearbox and a four-speed automatic; the Advance is auto-only. \nAs mentioned, prices have been retained – the SE is priced at RM49,968 ( RM50,368 metallic) for the manual model and RM52,968 ( RM53,368 metallic) for the auto, while the Advance auto is priced at RM56,178 ( RM56,578 metallic). All prices are on-the-road inclusive of insurance and a five-year/150,000 km warranty. \nGALLERY: 2017 Perodua Myvi 1.5 SE GALLERY: 2017 Perodua Myvi 1.5 Advance Research Perodua Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T07:48:38.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
