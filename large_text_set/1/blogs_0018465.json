And by issues, we mean, it sounds like someone slowly dying.\nDonald Trump's inaugural concert kicked off Thursday with acts such DJ Ravidrums, singer Sam Moore and a whole lot of country music. But anyone trying to get their hit of 3 Doors Down on the official inauguration committee's online stream, has been in for a painful time.\nSEE ALSO: 6 ways to push your online activism into the real world in the Trump era\nFWIW, the sound on the Inaugural Committee's YouTube stream sounds like a dying cassette player pic.twitter.com/HhfutEjJT3\nâ€” Marcus Gilmer (@marcusgilmer) January 19, 2017\nIf you'd like to save your ears the agony, let us assure you, the opening acts sound more like car tires screeching to a agonizing halt or listening to a group of high chipmunks scream at each other.\nThe inauguration channel attempted to fix it, but the problems persisted with choppy noise and the vocals going in and out. After barely 20 minutes the livestream completely stopped, so good luck if you were keen to catch The Frontmen of Country .\nDespite the horrendous sound, at one point 372 people were watching the stream. Those are some devoted concert viewers. Here's hoping the sound issues clear up in time for Friday's inauguration.\nBONUS: Trump praises tech leaders", "external_links": ["https://t.co/HhfutEjJT3", "https://twitter.com/marcusgilmer/status/822191981363429378", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsGeX6AjlfB5Q9UHVV8Y1wA", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LLP67hieMuWVFBmMUL21yrtWaRw=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F354175%2F7a7aa7f6-e418-496c-b8d1-a397e1b8b0f2.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/TXZx03lM.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/TXZx03lM.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/97UQrq-idhRrgjV2YX_CHfHvSvg=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F354175%2F7a7aa7f6-e418-496c-b8d1-a397e1b8b0f2.png"], "published": "2017-01-20T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:57:30.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
