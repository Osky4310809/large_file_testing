Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara , £19 View this image › \nToo Faced / Via debenhams.com “It’s flaky, and always gives me raccoon eyes, even the waterproof version. The brush is huge and you can’t get to the inner corners of the lash line nor the lower lashes.”\n– Stephanie Safko, Facebook\n“I love to get as close to my lash line as possible by wiggling the brush down and you can’t do that with this mascara, because it goes all over your eyelids. I would recommend the Butter London Double Decker mascara, it’s my favourite.”\n– Jennifer Fink, Facebook\nID: 10729748 2. Urban Decay Naked Eyeshadow Palette , £39.50 View this image › \nUrban Decay / Via urbandecay.co.uk “It hurts to say this, but the Naked palettes are not worth the money. Not because they’re bad, but because there are so many palettes out there that are just as good and cost a fraction. Try NYX , they have some kickass palettes, that a pretty cheap.”\n– Emmay Friedenson, Facebook\n“I’ve had the Naked 2 eyeshadow palette for a while now and barely use it. The colours aren’t anything special and the products aren’t insanely good. You’re better off buying something else. I personally love the Too Faced Chocolate Bon Bons eyeshadow palette.”\n– Gracit \nID: 10729851 3. Marc Jacobs Re(Marc)Able Full Cover Foundation Concentrate , £37 View this image › \nMarc Jacobs / Via harrods.com “Marc Jacobs Re(Marc)able foundation turned me into an oily mess.”\n– sarahmariee \n“It was really cakey and the design of the applicator is really stupid.”\n– alexandrap410c1af75 \nIf you’re looking for a new foundation, why not try the Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation , it’s good for oily skin, and feels lightweight and super comfortable.\nID: 10729949 4. Kat Von D ‘Tattoo Liner’ Liquid Eyeliner , £16 View this image › \nKat Von D / Via debenhams.com “This liner has zero pigmentation and it’s really streaky. I would recommend the Stila Stay All Day liquid liner, it’s so much better.”\n– micaeluhh \n“It’s not pigmented and the brush tip gave practically no control.”\n– Emily Perlstein, Facebook\nID: 10730358 5. Charlotte Tilbury Instant Hollywood False-Lash Effect Mascara , £25 View this image › \nCharlotte Tilbury / Via charlottetilbury.com “The mascara goes on beautifully but an hour later it starts to flake and leaves giant smudges under your eyes making you look like a panda. I was gutted as everyone had raved about it and I usually love their products!”\n– alexandraa4cffb03af \nA good alternative is the L’Oreal Paris Voluminous Mascara . It’s an affordable mascara that will add so much volume to your lashes.\nID: 10730548 6. Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder Invisible , £29 View this image › \nJohn Lewis / Via johnlewis.com “Heavily bought into the hype with this powder, and I was thoroughly disappointed. It made my foundation look really cakey, especially around the the nose, under eye, and the area in between the brows. I would apply it, and then 20 minutes later I’ll be oily again. No matter how light or how heavy handed I went in with this powder the cake face was out to play.”\n– celinek41bce7d14 \n“I’m sorry but I have tanned skin and it still makes me look like a ghost. Everyone was swearing that it works no matter skin colour you have, but it doesn’t,”\n– madisonvandew \n“Laura Mercier translucent setting powder was the BIGGEST waste of money. Not only was it overpriced but it made my face cakey as heck and made the creasing under my eyes 20 times worse than it already is. I’ve used and prefer the NYX Studio Finishing Powder .”\n– sarar4cf194305 \nID: 10730628 7. Becca Champagne Collection Shimmering Skin Perfector Pressed , £32 View this image › \nBecca / Via cultbeauty.co.uk “I bought the Becca Champagne Pop Highlighter after hearing about it from everyone. It was so dark on my skin, so if you’re fair, it won’t work. It was also super glittery and looked unnatural on my skin.”\n– Alliemoose \n“It looks very sparkly and does not blend well on my skin, it just looks like just a streak. Maybe I’m too light skinned for this. Plus it broke super easily.”\n– Arianna Rodell, Facebook\nThe Nars Illuminator is a great alternative, it’s literally magic. It’s a liquid highlighter which blends perfectly and leaves you looking radiant.\nID: 10730697 8. MAC Lipsticks , £16.50 View this image › \nMAC / Via maccosmetics.co.uk “Controversial but I don’t like MAC lipsticks. You need to constantly reapply and it never, ever looks as good as you think it will. Even when you pair it with the lip liner it’s disappointing. So many more lipsticks out there that are way better.”\n– lauraelizabethx \n“I have to reapply every 30 minutes, and it clumps so easy. For me the NYX Lip Lingerie is a much better purchase, I never have to reapply them and they’re less than half the price.”\n– baileeanne \nID: 10731004 9. Tarte Shape Tape Concealer , £19 View this image › \nTarte / Via tartecosmetics.com “This is very hyped by many YouTube makeup gurus, saying it was ‘the best concealer they have ever used.’ Bought it and it didn’t blend very well, no consistent coverage, and creased under the eyes. You’re better off trying the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer it works way better.”\n– jessicar44651f81e \n“I’m probably going to be crucified by the makeup community, but I really don’t like the Tarte Shape Tape concealer. It’s way too drying for my under eye area. I would recommend trying the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer because it’s phenomenal.”\n– Janillaice92 \nID: 10731225 10. Lipstick Queen Frog Prince Lipstick , £22 View this image › \nLipstick Queen / Via feelunique.com “It’s not a bad product, but it isn’t worth the price tag. It’s a fun concept, changing colour from green to berry, but it’s a subtle colour and doesn’t last very long. I’d rather spend that money on a longer lasting lippie with a more vibrant colour.”\n– kaseyw490152883 \n“I much prefer the Barry M lipstick. it has the exact same concept for something like £5.”\n– Alwlac \nID: 10731304 11. Too Faced ‘Born This Way’ Liquid Foundation , £29 View this image › \nToo Faced / Via debenhams.com “This foundation was my worst purchase, makeup wise, of 2016. It oxidised a lot throughout the day, and the shade Snow was still far too orange on me. It’s not flattering. Did not enjoy this foundation at all.”\n– ashleighelizabetht \n“This foundation oxidises like crazy and the shade is very orangey. The coveage is average but it’s oily and greasy and slides about my face even when I prime, powder and set with spray. I don’t even have oily skin to begin with!”\n– laurenelliotti \nIf you’re looking for a long wear foundation, then give the Bobbi Brown Long Wear Even Finish Foundation . It will stay in place all day, and the coverage if great too.\nID: 10731458 Some responses have been edited for clarity. \nID: 10738839 Be sure to follow the BuzzFeed Community on Facebook and Twitter for your chance to be featured in future BuzzFeed posts.
