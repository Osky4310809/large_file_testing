This is the Vietnamese-inspired po' boy that we fell in love with in New Orleans' French Quarter and the one we're sharing here today. \nWithout the fried trappings of a traditional shrimp po' boy, this take is lighter, more piquant, and much easier to recreate at home than its namesake. \nShrimp po' boys are a staple of New Orleans cuisine. Whether they are assembled from fried, pickled, or steamed shrimp, you'll find them everywhere, from fine-dining restaurants to sidewalk carts and even the back of bars. And everyone in town has their favorite spot — the place that makes the best shrimp po' boy. \nThis recipe is inspired by one such place: Killer Poboys was started in the back of Erin Rose, a dive bar (which also happens to be the best place in town to get an Irish coffee). Chef Cam Boudreaux's interpretations of classic po' boys — made using top-quality, locally sourced ingredients — earned such a following that the outfit opened a second location just a few streets away. \nYou can't really go wrong, but the \"Seared Shrimp Poboy\" is definitely a winner and we love that it incorporates the influence of the city's Vietnamese community. Fun fact: Many po'boy shops, including Killer Poboys, get their rolls from Vietnamese bakery Dong Phuong . \nTo make these at home, consider seeking out similar rolls at your local Vietnamese grocery and grabbing a deli tub of the carrot/daikon pickle to make building these sandwiches even faster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:24:36.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
