The Beats boost helped Drake perform overwhelmingly better than on Spotify where the album was streamed a record 61.3 million times the first day. \nThe top streamed song on More Life is currently the first song on the playlist called “Free Smoke.” Rounding out the top 3 are “Portland” and “Passionfruit.” The album is also available for sale on iTunes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:30:32.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
