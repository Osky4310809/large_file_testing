The South Korean carmaker , which is owned by Indian automotive company Mahindra & Mahindra, expects the technology to be available to the public before the end of the year. \nThe system allows drivers and passengers to open and close a car’s windows by simply touching them. However, the technology will need to undergo further verification and market studies before it finds its way in mass-production models. SsangYong says a concept car that showcases the system will debut at a motor show later in 2017. \n“The company will continue to develop next-generation products that will meet the needs of its customers while setting a new trend by encouraging creative ideas and innovative research,” said SsangYong CEO, Choi Jong-sik. \nOther companies that have flaunted the same idea is Jaguar, which announced last year that it was working on windows that could be opened and closed by touching the glass, although it did not reveal when the tech will enter production.
