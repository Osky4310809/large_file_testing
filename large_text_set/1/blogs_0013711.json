Of course Hawai’i offers an abundance of daytime activities and Aulani, a Disney Resort & Spa , has no shortage of options. However, once evening arrives, the resort transforms into a magical setting with even more guest experiences. Here are my top 5 evening activities:\n\nA Hula For You \nJoin our beloved Uncle and hula dancers for a special sunset celebration at the Waikolohe Pool . Lively music and beautiful dance are the perfect combination to welcome the evening. Teen Aloha House Party! \nTeens are welcome to “crash” Aunty’s Beach House for an exclusive, after-hours party. Get ready to battle with new friends in karaoke, dance challenges, games, Hawaiian crafts and more! \nDinner at ‘AMA‘AMA \nOur signature restaurant, ‘AMA‘AMA , resides in an elegant, yet comfortable beach house. For dinner, enjoy contemporary interpretations of island cuisine, including guest favorites like the Maui Onion Soup and Hawaiian Snapper Laulau. ‘Imi Loa Na Hoku (Explore the Stars) \nHead out from the Pau Hana Room with your guide and explore the night sky! This premium experience will show you how ancient Polynesian voyagers traveled the Pacific Ocean using the stars to navigate. \nKA WA‘A luau \nOur newest evening experience, KA WA‘A luau , is a fete for the senses! A sumptuous luau buffet is followed by an immersive show experience with music and traditional Hawaiian dance. Before the luau, you can enjoy special entertainment and family activities such as lei making and ku‘i kalo (taro pounding). Be sure to check the daily activities schedule, the Daily ‘Iwa , for timing and more information.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:17:28.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
