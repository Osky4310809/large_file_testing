Her favorite was Ekachai Prasertkaew ’s photo “ Enjoying time at home .” \nGabriela Tulian explains what drew her eye to this image: “A simple scene beautifully composed and enhanced by the softness of the light coming through the foliage of the trees. We can clearly appreciate the power of light creating a magical composition. An idyllic moment between a mother and a daughter.” \nWhen asked about his photography, Ekachai Prasertkaew says he feels happy every time he holds a camera. Check out his profile on 500px , and take a look at the runners up below for more great images of women driving change! \nDid you miss this Photo Quest? Check out our upcoming Quests here !
