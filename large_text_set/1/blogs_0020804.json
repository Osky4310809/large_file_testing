It’s always a very difficult time when you lose someone you love, but when you have the comfort of your friends, sometimes it makes the recovery process get better. So when Jordyn Wood’s dad suddenly died and best friend Kylie Jenner donated $10,000 to the funeral and memorial fund , we couldn’t help but feel our hearts burst . If we didn’t know already, now we know that Jordyn and Kylie are BFF’s through thick and thin.\nJohn Woods, Jordyn’s father, passed away from stage 4 Adenocarcinoma which also metastasized to his pancreas, liver and brain. As the family begins to prepare for the funeral services, and paying off his medical expenses, they’re hoping to raise $50,000 to cover expenses. On Friday, Kylie Jenner donated $10,000 to the fund and left the comment “I love you guys very much”.\nMy Fire Ox, My Brother, My Soul Sister. Give Jordy & her family some support and prayers right now. I love you the long way @jordynwoods . The other half of me .. When you cry I cry. \nA photo posted by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Jan 19, 2017 at 9:44am PST \nGoFundMe “This hit us from nowhere,” Jordyn’s mother, Elizabeth Woods, wrote in her emotional message to their supporters . “We are emotionally, mentally and financially impacted and are still not aware of how this devastating loss will truly impact our family. As we begin to plan for John’s services, we are still saddled with a portion of his medical expenses”. Last night heaven Got Another angel. My Daddy. Just two short weeks ago he was diagnosed with cancer and by that time it was too late. I appreciate everyone's kind words and it means the world to me. It still doesn't feel real.
