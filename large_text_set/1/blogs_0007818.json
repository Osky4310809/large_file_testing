In the most important news we‚Äôve heard all week, every episode of Golden Girls is coming to Hulu on February 13th. So if Hulu‚Äôs new feminist historical drama Harlots wasn‚Äôt enough girl power to get your business‚Ä¶ Well, we‚Äôre pretty much sitting here screaming ‚Äútake my money!!!!‚Äù Golden Girls is long overdue for a slot with one of our fave streaming services ‚Äî especially considering that the show celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2015 . But hey, as they say: better late than never.\nWe already knew that the internet loves Golden Girls ‚Äî but could it be that Twitter actually helped to get them on Hulu? Users of the social media network spent years calling for the show to get picked up by any streaming service. In response, Hulu‚Äôs support team repeatedly promised to pass along requests from customers. You can actually see it all unfold on Twitter.\nIt was the question on everyone‚Äôs minds‚Ä¶ But really... why is Golden Girls not on Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime yet?\n‚Äî Jaimelynn (@jaimelynnpease) December 24, 2016 If Golden Girls was on Netflix or Hulu I would probably never leave the house.\n‚Äî Phil from the 90's (@fillup_90) December 13, 2016 Until Hulu had to do something about it‚Ä¶ @BeachyRachie We don't want you to have to figure out that DVD player so we'll share your request for Golden Girls with our content team!\n‚Äî Hulu Support (@hulu_support) September 7, 2016 @BlairPeyton No promises, but we'd like to thank you for being a friend by sharing your Golden Girls request with our content team!\n‚Äî Hulu Support (@hulu_support) December 1, 2016 @WilliesLife101 Hi there! We'll share your request for Family Matters and The Golden Girls with our content team.\n‚Äî Hulu Support (@hulu_support) December 29, 2016 But another year came and went, and still we waited‚Ä¶ First random question of 2017: why isn't Golden Girls streaming on Netflix or Hulu? Have we gotten to the bottom of that yet?\n‚Äî Cara Beara (@cara_kula) January 2, 2017 For the love of God when will someone let me stream Golden Girls @netflix @hulu @AmazonVideo \n‚Äî crisis mama (@Corey_Alice) January 6, 2017 And then, finally! We're officially on @hulu . Now we're as on demand as Blanche's sex life. pic.twitter.com/5uOT6mZwXG \n‚Äî Golden Girls Now (@GoldenGirlsNow) January 8, 2017 GAME. CHANGER. The Golden Girls is coming to @hulu on Feb. 13 -- Galentine's Day! #YCA17 \n‚Äî Chris E. Hayner (@ChrisHayner) January 7, 2017 Of course, for those of us outside the US, there‚Äôs still one tiny hiccup‚Ä¶ The bigger gift would be making Hulu available in Canada so I can give up all responsibility and watch Golden Girls! https://t.co/XSsfjHzM9E \n‚Äî Rachel Osbourne (@rachelosbourne_) January 8, 2017 And fans have some questions about exactly what they‚Äôre getting‚Ä¶ These are VERY important questions. Full broadcast makes @hulu very appealing; Golden Palace - not so much. #goldengirls https://t.co/VwOjlm8WPR \n‚Äî Amelia Deschamps (@amelinda4ever) January 8, 2017 But all in all, we can agree: this is going to be HUGE. SO MUCH YES‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúEvery episode of The Golden Girls is coming to Hulu in February‚Äù https://t.co/67AtYo6Inv \n‚Äî Ashlie || 5SOS ü§ò (@AshAttack1D) January 8, 2017 Whether or not Hulu really pursued the rights to the show in response to fans‚Äô Twitter requests, it‚Äôs a huge win for the streaming service. Hulu‚Äôs other new offerings include their adaptation of Margaret Atwood‚Äôs dystopian classic , The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale (starring Elizabeth Moss and Alexis Bledel), and Seth Rogen‚Äôs new comedy, Future Man . It also plans to add live TV streaming to regular plans later this year ‚Äì although this will also change its pricing. Altogether, the future is looking pretty bright for the subscription on-demand service.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T00:39:03.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
