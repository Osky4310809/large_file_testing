That’s right, the president of the United States of America had a weird infatuation with the stars of Twilight , and he shared his thoughts on their break-up to millions. \n\nOne tweet went, “Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again–just watch. He can do much better!” Another: “Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion. She will cheat again–100 certain–am I ever wrong?” And another: “Robert I’m getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I’m right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.” And my personal favorite: “Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert.” These are all real, and Stewart brought them up during her SNL monologue.\nThere’s even a well-timed “f*ck,” because seriously, what the f*ck .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T07:02:15.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
