Share Save \nThe first time someone says \" smart stove knobs ,\" you instantly conclude that the technology world needs stopping. But while the Inirv React's concept seems gently ridiculous, the product itself makes you wonder why nobody thought of this before. Essentially, it's a series of powered dials that sit on your gas hob and will let you turn them off remotely with your smartphone. Even more impressive, however, is that a nearby sensor can do it automatically if it senses heat, gas or that you've left the house. \nEach knob is mechanically powered and will physically turn itself to the off position, making it ideal for any existing hob top. A unit packs a battery that's good for six months of life before you'll need to recharge it, as well as the sensor that's mounted close to your cooker like a smoke alarm. Inside, there's a motion detector (to sense if you're actually around) as well as a gas, smoke and heat sensor that will shut the hob off. Own this and you'll never again have to worry about if you've left the gas on while out at the theater. \nThe company is currently crowdfunding the gadget on Kickstarter and early birds can snag the four units and a sensor for $239. If you wait until the campaign has ended, however, it'll wind up costing you $299, although that's probably cheaper than the cost of burning your house down. Each sensor can take up to eight knobs at once, should you be sufficiently baller to have that big a kitchen, and the products should begin shipping by the end of the year.
