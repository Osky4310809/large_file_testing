Manuel Blondeau/AOP.Press/Corbis, Corbis via Getty Images \nZTE has agreed to pay up to $1.2 billion in fines as part of a guilty plea to violating sanctions prohibiting sales of US technology to Iran. \nThe Chinese telecommunications equipment maker agreed to pay $892 million in fines and forfeitures for violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and obstruction of justice, the US Department of Justice said Wednesday. The company will face an additional $300 million in penalties if it violates the terms of the agreement. \nRestrictions against tech exports to Iran have been in place since the early 1980s when the US broke off diplomatic relations with Iran. However, many sanctions have recently been imposed on Iran over its controversial nuclear program. \nZTE has been in the doghouse with US authorities since March 2016 when the Commerce Department accused it of violating rules restricting exports of US technology to Iran. The US government slapped the company with sanctions that hurt the Chinese company's ability to get access to US technology needed for its telecommunications products. \nThe US government lifted those sanctions in August, allowing the company to continue working with US technology suppliers. \nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech stuff is cool. \nCNET Magazine : Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition.
