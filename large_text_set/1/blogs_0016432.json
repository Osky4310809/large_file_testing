King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 12 hours ago 27 \nAvenged Sevenfold vocalist M. Shadows praised Gojira as the finest current metal band around. \nAsked on the whole matter by Live Nation Germany , the musician replied (via Blabbermouth ): \"Gojira, for me. They're awesome.\" \nShadows added: \"I was listening to Wolfmother the other day, and I was listening to Gojira, and I was thinking, 'Man, both these bands probably had the same influences, but they both have done something completely different with them.' It's probably the Sabbath, the Zeppelin influences, but both bands [put] their own twist on what their interpretation of the old rock is.' \n\"For me, a band like Gojira brings something really cool and new to the table. And the latest David Bowie record, to me, is really innovative; ' Blackstar ' is amazing. There's a lot of stuff that's very cool that is very influential.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T07:54:42.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
