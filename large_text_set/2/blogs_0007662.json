Friday by Black Lives Matter protestors. DeVos was set to give a speech and planned to meet with parents, students and teachers. \nNow former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who served under President Obama, is coming to her defense. Agree or disagree w @BetsyDeVos on any issue, but let's all agree she really needs to be in public schools. Please let her in. â€” Arne Duncan (@arneduncan) February 10, 2017 \nA local Fox 5 reporter described the protestors as knocking into DeVos, getting into her face and nearly making her fall.
