Stuff.co.nz \nStuff.co.nz speaks with Helen Clark about her United Nations Secretary General bid. \nIn the email, Clark said \"it has been an honour and privilege for me to lead UNDP for eight years\". READ MORE \nA spokeswoman for Clark said she wouldn't be making a statement. ONE NEWS NOW \n'The UN has failed in its primary role of conflict prevention' - Helen Clark stays well clear of sitting on the fence \nThe 66-year-old, who was prime minister from 1999 until 2008, had hoped to become UN secretary-general last year. \nThe former Labour leader entered the race to become the next UN secretary-general with more than 50 nations campaigning to elect the first female to the top job. However, a series of poor showings in straw polls undermined her chances, as she consistently came towards the bottom of the pack. \nIf the vote was by popular choice, Clark would have been a front-runner. Her bid for the top job had a huge head of steam on social media and elsewhere, thanks to her high visibility on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat. \nHer dream finally ended in October last year, with former Portugese prime minister Antonio Guterres unanimously endorsed by the UN Security Council. \nForeign Affairs Minister Murray McCully said at the time the Government had no regrets about throwing its weight behind Clark, but the odds had been \"very heavily stacked against\" her from the beginning, given the geopolitical considerations. The cost of Clark's taxpayer-funded campaign was fairly insignificant, and had been \"well worth it\", McCully said. \n\"It's very very infrequently that we have a New Zealander able to contend for the position of secretary-general with that sort of track record, so I think we were absolutely right to nominate Helen Clark.\" \nIn 2016, Clark was alongside Oprah Winfrey in a list of the world's most powerful women . \nForbes magazine's 100 \"power women\" ranked Clark at number 22. \nThe UNDP administrator is appointed by the secretary-general and confirmed by the General Assembly for a term of four years. \nIN FULL: CLARK'S RESIGNATION EMAIL \nI am writing to advise all staff that I have informed the Secretary General that I am preparing to leave my position as Administrator at the end of my second term on 19 April. \nThis will allow the Secretary General to appoint a new Administrator as soon as possible. I stand ready to support the transition to the new leader of the organisation. I have full confidence in our Associate Administrator, Tege Gettu, to act as Administrator if there is a gap between my departure and the arrival of the next Administrator. \nThis is not my final message to staff - there is much to be done between now and 19 April. There is, for example, a timetable for tabling the draft of the next Strategic Plan to enable it to be discussed at the Executive Board's Annual Meeting on 31 May. It is my desire to see all aspects of the organization in a strong and sustainable state when the next Administrator assumes office. \nThese are times of change across the UN system. There are post-QCPR reviews being commissioned which may impact on UNDP. While these processes are unfolding, I urge you all to continue to deliver to the high standards for which UNDP is known. Making progress on the SDGs and on supporting national development achievements must continue unabated. \nIt has been a privilege and an honour for me to lead UNDP for eight years. Our staff are our greatest strength, and I will miss you all. I will offer my thanks and gratitude more fully nearer to my departure. \nWith kind regards,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T03:25:21.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
