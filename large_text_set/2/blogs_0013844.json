And it’s no wonder – he’s a Nazi . \nIt’s November 1941, Churchill has been assassinated, the King is a prisoner in the Tower of London and the SS have taken over the police. \nThis thriller is based on a book by Len Deighton , and explores what could have happened if the Germans had triumphed in the Battle of Britain. \nWhen Detective Archer (Sam Riley) is recruited to investigate the murder of a nuclear physicist involved with the British resistance, he stumbles upon evil Nazi plans. He’s forced to collaborate with the German occupiers but also wants to help the freedom fighters.

Producer Sally Woodward Gentle reveals show secrets \n\"Archer is ambiguous,\" explains Sam. \"He’s looked on favourably by the Germans, but he is unsure about his role. He’s not a Nazi, but neither is he willing to join the resistance. \n\"He’s happy to keep his job. He thinks that there has to be law and order or things will fall apart.\" Kate Bosworth as Barbara Barga (Photo: BBC) \nThe handsome copper also begins a romance with beautiful, mysterious American journalist Barbara, played by Kate Bosworth. She might hold the key to why the scientist was killed – but can he trust her? \n\"To play a detective and meeting a femme fatale is number one on the list for most actors,\" says Sam. \"And now I get to tick that off!\" The SS-GB set (Photo: BBC) \nAs well as being a thrilling story, the five-part series is frighteningly detailed in its depiction of occupied London. Script-writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (who collaborated on the past six Bond movies) pored over real plans the Nazis had for running the country after invading. We see landmarks draped in swastikas and Buckingham Palace bombed out and decorated with the Nazi insignia. \n\"It’s a thriller set against the backdrop of what might have happened,\" says producer Sally Woodward Gentle. \"Seeing it is really chilling. The message is that you can never be complacent – you have to stand up and do something.\" SS-GB is on Sun BBC1 9pm Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:40:33.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
