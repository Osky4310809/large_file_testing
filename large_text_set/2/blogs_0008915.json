Safety PrecautionsAll residents should have the following items available:· Flashlight and extra batteries. · Battery-powered portable radio or NOAA Weather Radio to receive emergency information. The radio will allow you to listen to weather forecasts, information, and other emergency broadcasts by local authorities.· Seven to ten days’ supply of food. High-energy food, such as dried fruit or candy, and food requiring no cooking or refrigeration is best. Also stock an emergency supply of bottled water. The recommended amount is one gallon per person per day for 7 to 10 days.· A one-week supply of essential medicines and baby items.· First aid kit and supplies.· Extra blankets and sleeping bags.· Fire extinguisher and smoke detector – test regularly to ensure they are working properly.Safe TravelIt is important for motorists on all roads to note that snowplows travel at speeds up to 35 miles per hour, which in many cases is lower than the posted speed limit, to ensure that salt being dispersed stays in the driving lanes and does not scatter off the roadways. Oftentimes on interstate highways, snowplows will operate side by side, as this is the most efficient and safe way to clear several lanes at one time.Motorists and pedestrians should also keep in mind that snowplow drivers have limited lines of sight, and the size and weight of snowplows can make it very difficult to maneuver and stop quickly. Snow blowing from behind the plow can severely reduce visibility or cause whiteout conditions. Motorists should not attempt to pass snowplows or follow too closely. The safest place for motorists to drive is well behind the snowplows where the roadway is clear and salted.Some of the most important tips for safe winter driving include:· When winter storms strike, do not drive unless necessary.· If you must travel, make sure your car is stocked with survival gear like blankets, a shovel, flashlight and extra batteries, extra warm clothing, set of tire chains, battery booster cables, quick energy foods and brightly-colored cloth to use as a distress flag.· Keep your gas tank full to prevent gasoline freeze-up.· If you have a cell phone or two-way radio available for your use, keep the battery charged and keep it with you whenever traveling. If you should become stranded, you will be able to call for help, advising rescuers of your location.· Make sure someone knows your travel plans.Winterize Your VehiclePreparing your vehicle for winter storms now will help ensure your vehicle is in good working order when you need it most.· Have a mechanic check the following items on your vehicle: o Battery o Wipers and windshield washer fluid o Antifreeze", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:46:49.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
