Varun has always been a fan of the cricketer, and when he asked the director of the film, Shashank Khaitan, who Badri was a fan of, the answer was Virat again. So it made sense for the duo to meet up, to help promote the film. And that's not the only thing they did. Varun and Virat even got matching haircuts, simultaneously! Varun has put up a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts about his meeting with Virat, and their new matching hair in full fanboy style. And we totally get why - we're all fans of Virat, too! Check out the posts, here. Badri is only @imVkohli fan.Thank you virat for being so cool and humble we all have a lot to learn from u #realhero pic.twitter.com/iVBIA7gZ7p", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T12:49:10.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
