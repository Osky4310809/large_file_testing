Perjury. Job killing. \nOn top of that, they knew the water in Flint was toxic for half a year and they didn’t tell anyone. \nReally awful stuff. \nThey also dumped millions of gallons of toxic waste into a river that thousands of people use for drinking water. \nNo one got in trouble for it because that’s how the government operates. \nNow, the EPA is assuring us the river isn’t toxic anymore. \nTheir reasoning is absurd. \nFrom The Daily Caller : \nGood news: high concentrations of toxic metals from a mine blowout caused by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are no longer detectable in the Animas and San Juan rivers, according to an agency report. \nThe bad news is, fall storms and spring snow-melt likely drove 1,115,539 pounds of toxic metals from those rivers to Lake Powell — a vacation spot for millions of people and water source for drinking and agriculture. \nThe report generally agrees with EPA’s conclusion shortly after the mine spill that water quality has returned to normal. EPA workers breached Gold King Mine, unleashing 3 million gallons of wastewater, including 540 tons of toxic metals. \nThose toxic metals are now likely sitting at the bottom of Lake Powell where they could be stirred up by future storms and surges of water. \nGreat. \nLooks like the EPA is going to be dishonest all the way until inauguration day. \nThe silver lining here is that Trump put Scott Pruitt in charge of the EPA. \nTheir reign of terror is finally over. \nThey know it too. \nThat’s why they were reportedly in tears when Trump won. \nTheir job killing days are numbered.
