Prince 16.9k Share Tweet Follow \nA new video purportedly released by the Islamic State shows four men accused of spying against ISIS being executed near the Euphrates River in Syria. The video was released October 29, 2015 and is called “Harvest of the Spies.” It is stated to have been filmed in “Wilayat al-Furat”, an ISIS-occupied area on the Euphrates River that is part of Syria. “Al-Furat” is Arabic for “Euphrates.” \nIn the video, four men donning orange jumpsuits are interviewed by ISIS militants in front of a camera. We are currently working to clarify if these men are charged with spying for the pro-Assad regime or other anti-ISIS rebel groups. As always, we cannot independently verify if these men are even spies. \nAfter being interviewed, the four men are led outside and forced to their knees. ISIS militants take position behind them and shoot them in the head. \nWatch the video above. Viewer discretion is advised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T00:56:33.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
