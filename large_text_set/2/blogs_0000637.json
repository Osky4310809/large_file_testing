It was a disappointing night.” \nRodwell escaped with a booking, but Kane insists referee Lee Mason got the decision badly wrong. \nThe Spurs striker said: “He obviously just saw it as a tactical foul but I think we all know a pull on the shirt or a trip on the foot or the shin even [is one thing]. \n“But kicking someone knee-height on purpose like that, I think it’s a dangerous tackle and for me I think it’s definitely a red card. \n“It’s frustrating. We were trying to play our game, but look, it’s football. We’re disappointed that we probably didn’t play well enough on the night anyway. \n“It’s one of those things, we can’t do anything about it now. We’ve got another important game at the weekend. \n“Arsenal and Chelsea play each other as well so one or both of them might drop points and we’ve got to be ready to capitalise.” \nGETTY Harry Kane says Jack Rodwell should have seen red \nSpurs failed to score for only the third time   all season, and now host Middlesbrough this weekend desperate to make up ground. \nKane said: “I think it’s down to us to play better as well. It’s very frustrating, especially when you come in and find out the teams around us dropped points as well. \n“It was a great opportunity for us. Obviously we’re disappointed now and all we can do is get on with it and try to do something about it on Saturday. \n“I think obviously no-one expected Arsenal to drop points tonight. Liverpool and Chelsea, no-one knew either way but we definitely see it as a missed opportunity to gain some ground. \n“Teams are fighting for their lives. We’ve just got to perform better. It’s a big month for us but I think every month from now until the end of the season has got important games coming up, so we’ve just got to be ready.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:36:13.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
