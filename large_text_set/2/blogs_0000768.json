In the quick clip, Breezy said the fight is still on and took shots at some other unnamed targets along the way. \nFootage of the video was snagged by DJ Akademiks, who reposted the clip on his website. Brown, with a toothpick in his mouth, levied some sneering words at his rival while never directly naming him. The obvious nod being Brown stating something about a “superhero costume” toward the end. The transcription of the video is below. \n“When I pull up on you, it’s going down,” Breezy says. “We gon’ set this fight up, we went through all that. But niggas is always going to slick talk. And they know, when I’m in the same room, they chest deflate than a motherfucker. Boy, stop putting that superhero costume on before we torture you.” \nBrown is reportedly being trained by Mike Tyson and, after firing Floyd Mayweather as a boxing coach, Soulja Boy has turned to former light heavyweight and heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield to teach him the pugilistic ropes. This comes after the human “Draco” said he’d put on the fight himself. \nThere is also that pesky felony gun charge Soulja faces in California after a mini Draco AR-15 was found in his Los Angeles home. The firearm is illegal in the state. Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!
