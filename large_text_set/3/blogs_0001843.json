There are various legitimate ways of doing this. Paul’s approach with the Colossian error is particularly instructive.\nThe Colossians had a sound beginning, learning the saving good news of Christ from Paul’s associate Epaphras (Col. 1:7). They had made a healthy start (Col. 1:4-6, 8).\nBut now a personable, dynamic individual had come with a strange mix-and-match set of doctrines . Like modern charismatics, he made much of his own experiences (2:18). He posed a real danger to these young believers (2:4, 8).\nPaul’s way of responding is striking. He doesn’t name the man, or go into detail about his teachings. Instead, what Paul does is make a great deal about Christ and His salvation . He shows what a glorious Lord Jesus is, and what a great salvation Christ has accomplished (see all my online studies, starting here ).\nAs promised last time , I want to do this same sort of thing in marking off genuine Christianity from false teachings. Get a hold of these points of distinction, and you’ll be prepared to resist error – or be delivered from the error that enslaves you.\n1. Sound doctrine spotlights the person and work of Jesus Christ\nThis is a matter of emphasis . Christ saw all parts of the Old Testament as pointing to Him (Luke 24:27, 44) and said that the ministry of the Spirit would be to continue to glorify Him (John 16:14). Understood correctly, then, everything in the whole Bible tends to the glory of Jesus Christ, and to prompt us to center our lives around Him (Col. 2:6, 7, 10). False teaching always ends up focusing our attention elsewhere and has us chasing in a different direction.\n2. Sound doctrine is based on the saving work of Christ, conveyed to us in the Gospel\nIt glories in every aspect of Christ’s work redeeming helpless, lost sinners (Romans 3—5; Ephesians 1—3; and on and on). Everything – whether issues of personal ethics, marriage, family, church life –is directly related to who Jesus is to us, and what Jesus has done for us (cf. Eph. 4:1—6:9). False teaching has little time for such matters, being obsessed instead with the esoteric, private experiences that only the false teacher and his movement has had or can provide.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/faith/2017/02/28/how-to-distinguish-genuine-christianity-from-false-teaching/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://teampyro.blogspot.com/2010/02/colossians-city-its-inhabitants-its.html", "http://teampyro.blogspot.com/2010/03/colossians-studies-4-false-teachers_04.html", "http://teampyro.blogspot.com/2010/02/colossians-studies-3-false-teachers.html"], "published": "2017-03-01T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T06:56:27.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
