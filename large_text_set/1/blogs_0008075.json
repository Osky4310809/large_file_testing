Mike Pence Stumble \nWhen Vice President-elect Mike Pence and his family move into the Naval Observatory, they’ll be accompanied by a new furry friend: a rabbit named Marlon Bundo. \nMarlon the rabbit, whose name is a play on the name of actor Marlon Brando, accompanied the Pences to D.C. on Monday on Air Force Two. The Pences also have two cats, Oreo and Pickle. \nPresidential pets are a tradition both at the White House and the Naval Observatory: the Obamas have two Portuguese water dogs, Bo and Sunny, and the Bidens have a German Shepherd named Champ. \nPence posted a photo of the family on board the plane, with daughter Charlotte holding Marlon and Oreo and Pickle visible next to his wife, Karen: Thanks to @usairforce for a great flight to Washington, DC with Karen, Charlotte, Oreo, Pickle and our rabbit, Marlon Bundo. pic.twitter.com/zKzZYcI9OE — Mike Pence (@mike_pence) January 9, 2017 © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
