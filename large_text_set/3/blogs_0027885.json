This is the antithesis of putting #ConsumersFirst, ” FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and FTC Commissioner Terrell McSweeny said. The Senate just voted to dismantle #broadbandprivacy . My reaction w @MClyburnFCC here: https://t.co/ghFEn5VWSA — Terrell McSweeny (@TMcSweenyFTC) March 23, 2017 \nThe FCC rules were put in place in 2016 to prevent consumers’ private and sensitive information automatically getting into the hands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon. \nUnder the FCC rules, an ISP would be required to obtain “ opt-in ” consent from consumers before gathering sensitive information such as “ geo-location information, children’s information, health information, financial information, social security numbers, web browsing history, app usage history, and the content of online searches and communications such as the text of emails. ” That rule is scheduled to go into effect on December 4, 2017. \nIf the resolution becomes law, an ISP would be able to use that information or sell it to advertisers or other companies without the customer’s permission or knowledge.

I spoke against @SenateGOP bill that will sell your private & personal info to highest bidder. #BroadbandPrivacy https://t.co/nm5h3Bz3K8 — Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) March 23, 2017 \nSenator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona), who originally proposed the resolution, released a statement after the Senate vote, saying it “ will not change or lessen existing consumer privacy protections. ” My statement on the repeal of FCC midnight broadband regulation - https://t.co/RsfoMdyR2Y — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) March 23, 2017 \nFlake argues that the FCC rules would “ impose unnecessary and static regulations on a dynamic and innovative internet ecosystem. ” \n“ Additionally, it’s likely that these regulations would only confuse consumers and give them a false sense of security, ” Flake said. \nOther Republicans argue that the FCC rules would infringe on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which ensures internet companies like Google and Facebook respect consumers’ privacy. \nHowever, according to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler under the Obama administration, “ there are currently no rules in place outlining how ISPs may use and share their customers’ personal information. ” \nIn 2016, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decided the FTC no longer had jurisdiction to regulate ISPs when it came to privacy issues, and without the FTC, there is only one agency that has the jurisdiction to protect consumers from ISPs - the FCC. \nSince the Senate used the Congressional Review Act, which allows them to overturn administrative regulations, the resolution would also prevent lawmakers from addressing something “ substantially similar ” in the future. \nThe resolution will now go to the House. \nSeveral lawmakers have opposed the resolution, and on Thursday, many of them took to Twitter to protest the Senate’s decision. . @SenMarkey is right: the @FCC protected consumers by adopting #BroadbandPrivacy rules – on how companies collect/use/share/sell our data. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 22, 2017 . @SenateGOP wants corporations, not consumers, to control personal information. Join me in standing up to protect #BroadbandPrivacy — Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) March 22, 2017 If Republicans are committed to protecting privacy, why are they letting corporations sell our personal information? https://t.co/Ulyy9roP1U — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) March 22, 2017 That means, @SenateGOP , you should uphold #BroadbandPrivacy instead of voting to allow Americans' personal info to be sold to ↑ bidder. — Sen.
