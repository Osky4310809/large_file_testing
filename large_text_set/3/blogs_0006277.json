For a while it seemed to work -- between 1970 and 1979, Pyongyang established diplomatic ties with more than 60 countries, including India, Argentina and Australia, according to US-based non-profit the National Committee on North Korea . But acts of violence like the assassination attempt on then-South Korean President Chun Doo hwan in 1983 in Myanmar, in which North Korea denied involvement, and the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s slowly pushed North Korea further and further into isolation, Pinkston said. North Korea's only friend? There are currently 24 foreign embassies in Pyongyang, and North Korea has about 47 diplomatic missions in countries scattered across the world, according to the National Committee on North Korea. But having a diplomatic outpost inside North Korea is no guarantee of close or even friendly ties, experts said. \"Even when they're friendly with other countries they're suspicious of them,\" former British Charge D'Affaires to North Korea Jim Hoare told CNN. \"I remember talking to the defense attaches in Pyongyang, the ones from friendly countries, and they said, 'We never see a North Korean (military) exercise ... Nothing is disclosed to us.'\" The only country with extensive trade and diplomatic ties to North Korea is China, one of their closest neighbors. About 88% of all North Korea's imports come from China, about $3.5 billion worth , and the vast majority of the exports head straight back, around 86% or $2.67 billion, much of it coal. But even then, Hoare says it can be a complicated relationship. \"They depend on China   they like China or want to deal with them ... I mean basically no international relations are of major importance to North Korea.\" Andray Abrahamian, director of research at Choson Exchange, an NGO working with North Korean entrepreneurs, said North Korea has tried to boost ties with Russia and reduce its reliance on China. \"They just haven't found a way out of it,\" he said. \"Over the last couple of years they really made a big effort to try and shift relations to Russia, that didn't work out for a number of reasons. They're really stuck with China.\" Future of North Korea's diplomacy Abrahamian said North Korea's current foreign policy is based around only two things -- surviving and respect. \"Ultimately they want to be recognized as a nuclear power and then reset their relations with some of their antagonists, South Korea and then the US, as a nuclear power,\" he said.
