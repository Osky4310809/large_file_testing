In fact, they and their mothers seem to have been expressly sought out for killing and maiming. \nA spokesman for medical charity Edhi said the attacker appeared to have targeted the women’s wing of the shrine, and around 30 children accompanying their mothers were dead . \nAllah will be pleased with ISIS’ bold and decisive action on his behalf: \nIslamic State, the Middle East-based militant group which has a small but increasingly prominent presence in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack , the group’s affiliated news agency AMAQ reported. \n150 people were wounded, and the death toll will surely rise. \nSaid one worshiper, \n“We were there for the love of our saint, for the worship of Allah,” a wailing woman told the Dawn News television channel outside the shrine, her headscarf streaked in blood. “ Who would hurt us when we were there for devotion? “ \nTo Wahhabis and other Islamists, Sufis and Ahmadis are infidels, no better than Christians or atheists. All such inferior beings may be attacked and killed like vermin. \nThis point bears repeating in every discussion about alleged Islamophobia: on the world stage, the biggest victims of Islamist terrorists are other Muslims . As of today, there are dozens more, and we can be certain that Allah’s self-appointed henchmen are far from done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:33:32.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
