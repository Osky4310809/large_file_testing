Along with the suspension, a $25,000 fine for Childers, an encumbered finish for Harvick, and the loss of 10 driver and owner points for the team were also handed down. \n“Stewart-Haas Racing has officially requested an appeal hearing regarding the penalties levied against the No. 4 team and have also requested a deferral of the penalties until the appeal process is complete,” Stewart-Haas Racing said in a statement. \nWith NASCAR accepting the deferral, Childers won’t miss a race until the appeals process is complete, and if NASCAR upholds the initial penalties. \nHarvick has been one of the dominant drivers at Auto Club, leading 176 laps in the past two races and finishing second both times. He won the race in 2011 and has finished in the top 10 in six of the last eight races at the track.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:13:25.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
