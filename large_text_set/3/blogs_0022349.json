The firmware with build number G928CXXU3CQC7 is rolling out to these devices over the air in phases, just like it did for the Note 5 last week. In addition to Nougat, the update is coming with March's security patch. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ Android Marshmallow update \nAndroid Marshmallow started rolling out for the Galaxy S6 Edge+. Verizon already receiving updates and now T-Mobile customers will start receiving the update as soon as it hits their region. Updates roll out in waves so be patient. \nThe update for Android 6.0.1 and is 1.34 GB. The update comes with Wi-Fi calling, a feature that's part of previous Marshmallow updates for other devices. The update will also include other features standard in Marshmallow updates like Doze, Now on Tap and on-demand permissions. \nThere is still no word about Marshmallow for the other US carriers but we will let you know as soon as we hear anything more. For more information, visit our Android Marshmallow update overview. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ Android Lollipop update \nThe update comes in at 111.34 MB and brings battery optimizations and enhanced wireless charging features. Our AndroidPIT Brazil colleague noted that there wasn't much difference in the device's performance, in terms of fluidity and response, before and after the update, despite what the changelog claimed (which can be seen in Portuguese at the link). \nAs the S6 Edge+ already runs on the latest version of the Android OS, this update comes as something of a surprise. \nWhat do you think about there being a significant software update so soon after a smartphone hits the market? Does it say something positive or negative about Samsung? Let us know in the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:10:53.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
