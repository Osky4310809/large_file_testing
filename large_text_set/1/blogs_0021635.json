By Gabrielle Levy | Political Reporter Jan. 25, 2017, at 10:37 a.m. Cancel The CNN sign seen outside its headquarters in New York City. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \nCNN fired back at President Donald Trump on Tuesday night after the president tweeted to congratulate Fox News on scoring the highest ratings for coverage of the inauguration. \n\"According to Nielsen cumulative numbers, 34 million people watched CNN's inauguration day coverage on television,\" CNN communications said in a tweeted statement . \"34 million watched on Fox News. There were an additional 16.9 million live video starts on CNN Digital platforms.\" — CNN Communications (@CNNPR) January 25, 2017 \n\"Those are the facts,\" the statement concluded. \nThe tweet was in response to one from Trump earlier Tuesday, in which Trump lauded Fox News for capturing the most peak coverage viewers and the \"smart\" public who chose that network. \n\"Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings. They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN - public is smart!\" he tweeted . Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings. They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN - public is smart! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 \nIn spite of clear photographic evidence and WMATA ridership data, the Trump White House has railed against the fact that Friday's inauguration was less well-attended compared to President Barack Obama's first inauguration – said to be the largest public event in Washington's history – eight years ago, calling the media's attention to the difference in numbers an attempt to \"lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration.\" \nAccording to Nielsen , Trump's television average total viewership during the peak coverage block was of 30.6 million. That's less than Obama's first inauguration in 2009 (37.8 million), President Jimmy Carter's 1977 swearing-in (34.1 million) and President Ronald Reagan's first inauguration in 1985 (41.8 million). RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Trump Calls for Voter Fraud Investigation ] \nTrump may have been referring to Fox News' viewership during the peak times – 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. -- rather than overall inauguration coverage. During that time, Fox News captured 8.77 million viewers, compared to 2.61 million on CNN and 1.38 million for MSNBC. \nBroadcast networks NBC, ABC and CBS, which are more widely available than cable, pulled in 5.9 million viewers, 4.9 million and 4.65 million viewers respectively. \nCNN's statement claiming it had 34 million viewers referred to its total television audience throughout its Inauguration Day coverage. \nWhile online viewership has increased sharply in recent years – and both Spicer and CNN touted numbers for people who watched the inauguration online – digital views are measured differently than TV. Digital stream figures count the number of times the live stream begins – which could include reloading the page, those who may have only briefly tuned in before clicking away, or auto-play videos on other pages – not how many people watch all or even most of an event. Nielsen measures TV viewership based on those who watch the entire broadcast versus those who change the channel, and so its figures are not directly comparable to streaming numbers.
