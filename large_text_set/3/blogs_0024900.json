How boring is it to see every website shower the same stale AAA games with praise at the end of each holiday season? So at Geek.com we’re doing what we can to put a stop to this in Game of the Year , a new column celebrating worthy alternative picks for the year’s greatest game regardless of genre, platform, year of release, or even quality. Here, any game can be Game of the Year! \nI’ll spare you some of the details, but I have a bit of a thing for anthropomorphic food. Islands full of talking fruit. Comic strips about mischievous eggplants. Novels chronicling the drama of mopey pies. Sausage Party . I’ll eat it all up, figuratively speaking. Heck, in college a group of friends and I taught ourselves Photoshop by turning each other into bread people like “Jordanish Minor.” This week’s Game of the Year stars food that’s decidedly realistic. It doesn’t talk or emote or do anything real food doesn’t do. However, I Am Bread may be the only game that captures what it truly feels like to be food.\nIn I Am Bread you are bread, a slice of white bread to be specific, the biggest thing since The Beatles. Deer and rabbits and other prey animals spend their lives avoiding becoming food, but in I Am Bread transforming into something edible is your driving goal. You need to make your way to the toaster while avoiding dirty surfaces as much as possible and holding onto your butter or jam. Bonus stages include baguette destruction challenges, bagel races, and crackers fighting to stay in one piece. However, getting toasted is the core of the game.\nIf only being bread was so simple. Since bread slices don’t have handy arms and legs like people do, players move by flopping around and strategically attaching their corners to things. You could carefully inch your way across the kitchen, but that increases your chance of picking up germs. Flinging yourself from a spinning fan offers high rewards for a high risk. Shooting yourself into the garbage can is as likely as shooting yourself into the toaster.\nI Am Bread is part of a recent trend of physics-heavy comedy games that derive laughs and difficulty through purposefully awkward, almost glitchy movement and controls. QWOP , in which individual keys controls leg muscles in a marathon runner, might be the best, earliest example of this subgenre. But you can also see the concept in games like Octodad and Goat Simulator and even Snipperclips to an extent. Surgeon Simulator , another game from I Am Bread developers Bossa Studios, applies this idea to a game about being a doctor. It’s as terrible and wonderful as you’d expect.\nIt’s easy for games like this to be a cheap and cynical throwaway Steam games looking to sucker customers through funny YouTube streams. Think modern SyFy channel movies. Fortunately, I Am Bread is clever and well-made enough knowing trash to rise above that legitimate trash.\nYou can play I Am Bread on Steam, consoles, and iOS. Keyboards, controllers, and touchscreens convey its charms just fine. But to take this from Game of the Year to Game of the Epoch, imagine a full-body I Am Bread VR game where players must put themselves in a toaster. Truly, you are bread.\nCheck back next week to read about the next Game of the Year !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:24:07.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
