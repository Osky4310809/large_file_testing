Huber as thrust into the media’s attention earlier this morning after waiting upwards of 13 hours in line in order to get into the hangar for Trump’s rally. \nOnce on stage, President Trump went further, allowing Huber a moment to speak to the crowd. Noticeably shaken, Huber made a brief statement of support for his president: \nMr. President, thank you, sir. We the people, our movement is the reason why our president of the United States is standing here in front of us today. When President Trump during the election promised all these things that he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us. \nLasting only a few moments, President Trump would quickly take back his podium and usher Huber off stage, saying, “A star is born.” \nAnd it appeared that POTUS was right, if only for the remainder of the day, as not long after the rally Huber showed up on CNN, being interviewed by Pamela Brown . \nWhen asked to elaborate on his comment that he had been with Trump “since the beginning,” Huber went on to say that “It’s just the way he speaks that’s truth.” He would continue, calling the base of Trump’s support a “movement”: “There’s never been a movement like this ever. Ever. I’ve never been into politics in my life. Trump taught me everything.” \nAs the interview wrapped up, Huber interjected, “May I say one thing?” Brown acquiesced, “Quickly.” And Huber let he have it, “Let’s just be a little, little nicer to our president.” \nWatch the full clip above, via CNN. \n  \nHave a tip we should know?
