So when George met with team owner Herb Simon in recent days and told him that the Hoosier state was still the place for him, how he would love nothing more than to eventually go down as the greatest Pacer of them all, it came with one qualifier. \nIf they can contend for a title. \nAccording to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, that is the crossroads that Pacers president Larry Bird now faces. If the Thursday deadline comes and goes and the Pacers roster remains the same, the pressure rises in a significant way. Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The fact that the Lakers are in the process of trying to land George right now, with new lead executive Magic Johnson moving fast to fill that superstar hole that Kobe Bryant left behind, only makes these next two days all the more compelling. \nMagic & Bird, together again as NBA power brokers, on Day No. 2 of Johnson’s new job. You can’t make this stuff up. \nBird is known to be searching for options that would ease George's concerns, inquiring about players like Philadelphia’s Jahlil Okafor, the Sacramento Kings’ Arron Afflalo, Portland’s Allen Crabbe and Ed Davis. Yet if he can’t make significant moves, and if the Pacers (29-28, sixth in the Eastern Conference) seem destined to tread water while George ponders the notion of heading West, then maybe it's time for Bird to turn the page on the Paul George era. \nThe George landscape is complicated elsewhere, too, in large part because of his desire to sign with the Lakers if the Pacers experience simply doesn’t pan out. The Boston Celtics, with fellow 80s/90s star Danny Ainge at the front office helm, must ponder factors such as these as they decide the price worth paying. That reality, that enormous risk, exists for all other suitors as well. \nGeorge still has dreams of being bigger than Reggie Miller, of giving this franchise its first NBA championship and one day seeing his jersey up in the Bankers Life Fieldhouse rafters. But his gruesome leg break in the summer of 2014 taught him that time waits for no man, that every day on the court is a blessing after he spent more than a year working his way back. \nHe wants to win a title, and he wants nothing more than to do it Indiana. It’s up to Larry Legend to get these Pacers back in the game now. 154 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
