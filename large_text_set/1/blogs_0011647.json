Unclear what happened. RT aired for about ten minutes before C-SPAN1 came back. pic.twitter.com/mhWVgCoFxF — Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) January 12, 2017 \nSpeculation and conspiracy theories went viral on Twitter after the event happened, with some saying that it was a hack and others calling it cyber warfare. Wow. Disturbing in its own right but notably cutting off Waters who is one of the most vocal opponents of Trump https://t.co/mPfRJexlDA — Sarah Kendzior (@sarahkendzior) January 12, 2017 Why does this give me the serious creeps? #cspan #rt https://t.co/HUNF37s3qg — Chad Nagle (@neveruyushchii) January 12, 2017 @nytimes this is no accident.
