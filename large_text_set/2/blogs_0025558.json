He said that, not me. But the other two details are factual. \nTrump eats his steak well-done with ketchup and somehow gets away with it. If you can get away with the crap he’s said and done, I suppose this isn’t a big deal. \nEh, you know, maybe it is a pretty big deal. I mean, steak with KETCHUP? \nWhat’s not baffling about that?! If I were president, I’d issue an executive order to BAN ketchup on steak for- fucking -ever. There would be NONE of that. Giphy \nOn Saturday night, President Trump was reportedly dining at BLT Steak by David Burke in Washington DC. The upscale, modern American steakhouse offers a 28-day dry-aged steak that is to die for. \nInstead of consuming the steak like anyone with a brain would, Trump asked for his steak well-done. Of course, this isn’t the first time we’ve heard about Trump enjoying his steak burnt to a crisp. Giphy \nAccording to the Independent Journal Review, President Trump double-down on the mistreatment of the fine $54 steak by ordering a side of ketchup with it . Sad! \nAs expected, Twitter is appropriately roasting the 70-year-old real estate mogul and reality TV star for his steakhouse dining foul. The internet is roasting President Trump after reports surfaced alleging he likes to eat his steak well-done with ketchup. Finally have to draw the line with trump:Steak well done, with ketchup-is a threat to the most hallowed institutions of our democracy. \n— Buck Sexton (@BuckSexton) February 27, 2017 Some say this is “the last damn straw.” Trump eating well done steak with ketchup is the last damn straw. Politics aside we cannot allow this barbarism to continue! \n— Tha Berry II (@BerryFarmUnion) February 27, 2017 I think this calls for a Ryan Gosling whispering at the Oscars meme… \"Trump has his steak well-done with ketchup\" pic.twitter.com/iVzuQttNrK \n— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) February 27, 2017 Excuse me, Mr. Trump, but why? Giphy Eventually, Twitter roasted Trump so badly his loyal supporters had to come out and defend his wacky eating habits. @PrisonPlanet Fact: The only people who have a problem with ketchup on steak (or anything) are hipster morons trying to act cultured. \n— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 27, 2017 Their defense wasn’t really effective, though. We all know steak on ketchup is WRONG. \"Trump orders his steak well-done.\"Me: I swore off this fight to focus on real issues, not a classist-\"He put ketchup on it.\"Me: guh \n— Matt Boyd (@3PSboyd) February 27, 2017 The food police aren’t letting up. I already despised Donald Trump. But today I learned he puts KETCHUP on WELL-DONE STEAK. Now I know he's a true monster. Not kidding. \n— Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) February 27, 2017 Unfortunately, this isn’t just a fucked up joke. \"donald trump eats his steak well-done with ketchup\" sounds like a joke i'd make but it is REALITY \n— yung nugget (@mac_and_cheeks) February 26, 2017 Guys, this is bad … The thought of Trump putting ketchup on a steak made me gag more than the thought of Trump paying someone to pee on him. \n— Post-Culture Review (@PostCultRev) February 27, 2017 This could be grounds for IMPEACHMENT. If Trump really orders his steak well done and eats it with ketchup we need to take this man out of office. It’s hard to believe the man is 70. Nalisa agrees. Donald Trump actually eats his steak well done….. with ketchup. It's official. He's an overgrown child. \n— nalisa alia amin (@nalisaaa) February 27, 2017 \nAll jokes aside, President Trump is entitled to order and eat his steak however he likes. At the same time, we’re all entitled to call him out for his wrongdoings, and this is certainly one of them. \nNow, before 62 million people think this is socially acceptable, let’s get this trending: #StopPuttingKetchupOnSteak2017 The Oscars are 'absolutely terrible' says Donald Trump To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
