Roses? Dinner reservations? Yawn. These are some of the most common Valentine’s Day gifts people buy for their significant others. Since, your partner is probably tired of these Valentine’s Day cliches, its time to get a little creative and think outside the box.

Below Rs 1,000 \nIf you are a little tight on budget this V-Day, fret not. There are plenty of tech accessories that will fit your bill while being romantic at the same time. We’d recommend you to head over to dailyobjects.com and design a customised case for your partner. You can choose a custom image, text or both which will go on the case making it as personal and romantic as you’d like. The website currently has a sale for a limited period where you can buy two cases and avail a maximum discount of Rs 2,000. Below Rs 3,000 \nListening to romantic songs whilst stargazing with your partner never gets old. The Sony MDR-XB70AP or the SoundMagic E50S offer crisp vocals along with decent base to let you enjoy your favourite tracks even more. Both the headphones retail for Rs 2,999 each. Alternatively, you could also go the healthy route and gift your specific other a fitness band. The Xiaomi Mi Band 2 is a great option as it retails for just Rs 2,000 and comes with all the bells and whistles you could think of. Below Rs 5,000 \nYou are vacationing in a cabin, the firewood is crackling and the champagne is being chilled. All you need to make the evening more romantic is some music.

We’d recommend you to buy the JBL Flip 2 speaker as it comes with a good battery life, has decent sound and priced at Rs 4,299 sits well within the Rs 5K mark. Below Rs 10,000 \nIf you’d like to end Valentine’s Day with a big bang (pun intended), why not try to spruce up your activities in the bedroom with the Lovely sex toy?
