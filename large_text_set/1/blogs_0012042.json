Los Angeles is a mega media market, and a move here will inflate the value of the Chargers and turn it into a possible goldmine should Spanos ever sell. Even the lowly Clippers found a buyer — former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer — at a whopping $2 billion in 2014. \nTeam value does the rest of us little good, but that's the game. The Chargers were stuck with a city whose voters turned down public funding for a new stadium in November. The team, playing in the '60s-era Qualcomm Stadium, has been angling for a new home for more than a decade. And it faced a use-it-or-lose it deadline this month to claim L.A. or let the mighty Raiders take a shot. \nSpanos acknowledged the move, which will include play at StubHub Center in Carson before a jaunt to Stan Kroenke’s $2.6-billion stadium in Inglewood when it's ready, will present an uphill battle for the hearts of Angelenos. \n\"We must earn the respect and support of LA football fans,\" Spanos writes. \"We must get back to winning. And, we must make a meaningful contribution, not just on the field, but off the field as a leader and champion for the community. The Chargers are determined to fight for L.A. and we are excited to get started.\" \nYou can feel sorry for San Diego. But remember that as the Chargers entertained fans there, the NFL used L.A.'s empty nest — we lacked an NFL team from 1995 to 2016 — as a perpetual threat to cities that wouldn't build stadiums for football billionaires. L.A. is gaining a second NFL team, yes, but somehow it feels like a loss for Southern California team spirit.
