I have had horrible experiences with doctors and she made me feel comfortable from the start. She came in and smiled and welcomed me to her office. She took time to listen to what I had to say and would probe for more information and then allow me to continue. We spoke about my current illness and history (both medical and personal) and then examined me. She is very knowledgeable and made several recommendations that would help with the immediate issue and others that may be related now and down the line. She is also very understanding and nonjudgmental when it comes to issues of gender and sexuality (sexual orientation and sexual practices). She made sure to ask but not be intrusive and made me feel comfortable enough to share things with her that I would not have otherwise done so. Overal I'm so excited to have met with her and I'm looking forward to seeing her exclusively. One thing that stood out was her saying that if anything changed I should call her right away. She was legitimately concerned for my health and well being and Im hopeful that I've found my PCP! Go see her! You will not be disappointed!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:46:45.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
