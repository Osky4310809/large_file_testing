I wanted to do it my way, research my own way and inquire my own way.” \nThroughout that process, Lewis kept Roughead in the loop as the tall forward continued his recovery from a melanoma scare. \nAnd while Roughead, who has previously shown some interest in list management, wasn’t originally vocal about the specific club he should go to, he still played a key role in supporting Lewis. \nBut when asked whether Roughead was an advocate for the Demons, Lewis said his best mate gave his blessing come decision time. \n“As a mate of mine I wanted him to be involved in the process,” Lewis said. \n“I didn’t want him to pick up the newspaper and read that I’ve left. I wanted to him to be over it throughout the process. “ \n“I think from afar, what we’ve seen with Melbourne last year is that certainly they’ve improved, there’s stability in the club now. \n“Speaking with Todd (Viney) and delving a bit deeper into that before I made the decision, it was evident that they were on the right path.” \nLewis said he couldn’t wait to see Roughead make his AFL return for Hawthorn on Saturday night against Essendon, but added he was disappointed he couldn’t attend the game as the Melbourne-St Kilda clash finishes just minutes before the Hawks-Bombers clash commences, \n“It’s just one of those things that we didn’t expect. We thought he’d still be going through treatment at this stage,” Lewis said. \n“For him to put that aside and captain the club in his first game back, it’s an unbelievable story.” \nLIVE stream every game of every round of the 2017 Toyota AFL Premiership Season on FOX SPORTS.
