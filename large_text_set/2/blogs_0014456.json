It’s much longer By Benjamin Newman   Arsene Wenger, four more years \nArsenal Fan TV is about to meltdown. \nIn huge news from the Star on Sunday, it’s reported that Arsene Wenger isn’t going to stay at Arsenal for just two more years, after it’s been well documented that the club have offered the French boss a new two year deal. \nAccording to the Star, Wenger wants a new four year deal to remain at the Emirates Stadium. \nIf that happens, Wenger will be 71 when his new Arsenal deal expires. Will the club agree a four year deal? \nSadly the Star’s back page offers no insight into whether Arsenal will agree to offer Wenger a four year deal. \nInstead the Star’s story reflects Wenger’s apparent intentions, as the story is couched in from quotes from the Gunners boss: \nMaybe I can do more than four years, maybe less. I don’t know. \nI’m not making threats about leaving. My preference is always to manage Arsenal. Sunday Telegraph running the same sort of story pic.twitter.com/cYobEUJPz5 \n— 101 Great Goals (@101greatgoals) February 18, 2017 The backlash \nIf Wenger does stay for four more years, what will the fans do? \nArsenal supporters are in despair at the moment following a recent run of three defeats in four games which has effectively ended their season in mid-February as they appear to be out of the Premier League and Champions League races.
