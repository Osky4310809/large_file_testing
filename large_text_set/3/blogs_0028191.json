Andrew Neil said Khalid Masood was \"pathetic\" (Photo: PA) \nNeil continued: \"He was brutally stabbed to death by a jumped-up jihadi, not fit to breathe the same air as the man he killed.\" \nHe then went on to warn terrorists that they \"cannot defeat us\".

This is the country that stood up alone to the might of the Luftwaffe - the air force of the greatest evil mankind has ever known. \n\"If you think we will be cowed by some pathetic, Poundland terrorist in an estate car with a knife, you're as delusional as you are malevolent. \n\"Yes, you have the power to hurt us. Sometimes the hurt is more than we can bear - but you cannot defeat us. Read More \n\"Because for every brainwashed, brain dead Islamist you send to do us harm, we have thousands upon thousands of Keith Palmers. \n\"You find them in every walk of life and every part of the land. \n\"They come in all shapes, all sizes, all colours, and all faiths. \n\"They are the British people and against them you will never prevail.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:58:02.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
