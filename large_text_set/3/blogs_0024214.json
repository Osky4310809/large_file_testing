And it’s funny when something like that happens in your hometown, you don’t have a feeling of being glad that you’re so far away.\nWhat you feel is that you wish you could be there with loved ones to stand alongside them… London is a diverse and proud and brilliant city, and one thing is for sure: if this act of terrorism was supposed to divide the people of London. I know for a fact that all something like this does is bring them closer together as one.\nTonight we send our heartfelt thoughts to everybody in Britain.
