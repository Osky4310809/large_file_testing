The op-ed comes shortly after Trump was sworn in as 45th US president. \nSteinmeier wrote that he is committed to Berlin’s vision regarding free trade, fighting extremism and terrorism, as well as maintaining trust in transatlantic relations, but added that “turbulent times” lie ahead. \nThe 60-year-old Social Democrat is highly respected at in Germany where he is regarded as a balanced and open-minded politician. In November last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that her ruling coalition will back Steinmeier as Germany’s president. \nThe announcement effectively paves the way for Steinmeier to be elected by the Federal Convention – which includes members of the Bundestag and the same number of delegates from parliaments of German states – on February 12 to the largely ceremonial post now held by Joachim Gauck. \nThe top German diplomat has recently emerged as a vocal critic of US President Donald Trump. When the US election campaign was in full swing, Steinmeier branded the tycoon-turned-politician “a hate preacher,” stressing that he and the European far-right “make politics with fear.” \nLast week, he also mocked Trump’s habit of making political statements via Twitter, telling the audience in Berlin: “I would not be in a position to formulate a foreign policy concept in 140 characters.” FM #Steinmeier on #Trump + @Twitter : Every President coins and develops own style.

Commenting on messages embedded in the US president’s inauguration address, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said that the “highly nationalistic tone” was reminiscent of the “the political rhetoric of the conservatives and reactionaries of the 1920s,” according to Die Zeit . \nGabriel, also a long-standing member of Social Democratic Party (SPD), added: “We must take the man seriously, and I think... we must be neither submissive nor afraid.” \nMerkel’s comments on Trump’s speech were more reserved. Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, she briefly noted that the new president “made his convictions clear in his inauguration speech.” \nRelations with the US, Germany's biggest trade partner, should be based “on rules, common values and joint action in the international economic system, in the international trade system, and... our contributions to the military alliances,” Merkel was quoted as saying by Spiegel .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T13:48:27.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
