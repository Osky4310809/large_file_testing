Alexander Acosta, did not pursue federal indictment of a billionaire accused of sexually abusing dozens of female minors, The Washington Post reported Tuesday . \nAcosta, who then served as a U.S. attorney in Florida, reached a non-prosecutorial deal with money manager Jeffrey Epstein a decade ago, the newspaper reported. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state charge of solicitation of underage girls and served 13 months in jail, but critics have said he could have faced a tougher sentence federally, according to the Post. \nIncreased scrutiny has surrounded Acosta's handling of the case as he faces a confirmation hearing in the Senate on Wednesday. \nIn a 2011 letter, Acosta explained his decision: \"The bottom line is this: Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire, served time in jail and is now a registered sex offender. He has been required to pay his victims restitution, though restitution clearly cannot compensate for the crime.\" \nTrump is also on the witness list in the case, according to the Post, and called Epstein a \"terrific guy\" in 2002. \nCNBC has contacted the White House and Acosta's email at Florida International University College of Law for comment on this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:48:52.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
