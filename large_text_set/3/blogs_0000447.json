However, we do have some theories.\n— It was one of his first matches and he was very nervous.\n— He heard about that whole “cooties” thing.\n— He was just trying to tire her out before making his move.\n— He heard about that whole “ringworm” thing.\n— He has a crush on her and he’s playing hard to get.\n— He’s just practicing for track season.\nAll of those seem plausible and understandable, if you ask me. Regardless, context isn’t really important in this case. What’s important is that this is an all-time great youth sports clip and we are all indebted to this fleet-footed hero.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:13:03.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
