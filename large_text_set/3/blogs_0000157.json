Chelsea's unbroken foundations \nIt speaks volumes that drawing twice away from home -- wastefully at Liverpool, grittily at Burnley -- represents only the second discernible stutter from Chelsea this season. The lack of a continental distraction -- particularly given the roller coasters that Tottenham and Manchester City have been on in Europe this season -- might undermine the magnitude of Chelsea's seemingly imminent Premier League title win, but that emphatically is not manager Antonio Conte's problem. \nOn either side of those dropped points were 3-1 home wins over Arsenal (who were barely given a sniff of a result) and Swansea (who presented a rather different challenge at Stamford Bridge before being swept aside). While Chelsea's undroppable operators maintained their level -- N'Golo Kante continues to speed around like it's August, David Luiz is a perfect advert for the 3-4-3, and Eden Hazard still has a smile on his face -- Conte still knows when to tweak the lineup. Even if fatigue isn't an issue, he knows he has the tools in reserve depending on the task at hand. \nThe midfield axis of Kante and Nemanja Matic dominated Arsenal before Cesc Fabregas belatedly joined the party; against Swansea, Matic's telescopic interventions were switched out for Fabregas' forward-thinking. Both jobs were completed with the near minimum of fuss -- just as, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests, the Premier League title will soon be. \nWho lost the month? Leicester City... just about \nWhichever scriptwriter is in charge of the Leicester fairy tale must now be wondering where the nice, tidy point to wrap it all up exists. After all, the fall has been almost as compelling as the rise. \nManager Claudio Ranieri's departure, somehow framed as both an inevitability and a shock, served to rubber-stamp Leicester's befuddled surrender of a Premier League title they may still scarcely believe they held in the first place. February turned a run of four league games without a win into five defeats in a row and extended their search for a top-flight goal in 2017 to more than nine hours of game time. By the time of their latest attempt to kick-start their fortunes, with interim manager Craig Shakespeare now in the technical area, they had sunk into the relegation zone. The FC panel try and dig into how Leicester performed the way they did against Liverpool after poor performances all year. \nWhat came next said rather more about the emotional malleability of the modern footballer than it did about tactics, training methods or selection policy. All those 50-50 tackles were now being won, the ball was zipping across the King Power Stadium turf like it was 2015, and ultimately, Leicester's back-to-basics approach in their 3-1 win vs. Liverpool on Monday was an uncanny flashback to last season's counterpunching form. \nMildly melodramatic claims that the players should hang their heads in shame rather than celebrate a comprehensive 3-1 victory were wide of the mark, but unless such momentum is maintained in March, this final flourish in February simply highlights Leicester's front-to-back inadequacies of the weeks and months before it. \nPlayer of the month: Zlatan Ibrahimovic \nEven looking beyond the statistical suggestion that Ibrahimovic has been getting better with age, he's also improving as the season wears on. Indeed, almost half of his Manchester United goals this season have come within the last 15 minutes of a match, a habit that's likely to endear himself to the Old Trafford faithful raised on a diet of Sir Alex Ferguson-inspired late winners. Ibrahimovic's 87th-minute winner in the EFL Cup final against Southampton -- beginning with a towering clearance of a corner at one end, and then a bullet header at the other -- neatly encapsulated his enduring worth. \nHard as it is to ignore the impressiveness of this feat from a 35-year-old with nearly 850 games under his belt, the idea (mooted a few times recently) that he gives hope to other ageing forwards is a little misguided. There are no strikers like him, of any age, let alone with the all-round ability to keep the ravages of time at bay. \nThe talk around the extension of his United contract has graduated from \"nice to have\" to \"must-have.\" Someone like Antoine Griezmann would undoubtedly flourish in the Premier League, and a budget-busting signing by United remains the long-term plan, but the club stand to lose more than just goals if the Zlatan roadshow rolls on to somewhere new. His almost copyrighted brand of confidence, arrogance and an air of sheer superiority has been a shot in the arm for a club riddled with uncharacteristic self-doubt for almost four years. The flip side of that, of course, is that nobody tells Ibra what to do. The FC boys praise Zlatan's showing in the EFL Cup and debate whether this is crucial for Man United going forward. \nMatch of the month: Manchester City 5-3 Monaco \n\"A lot of things happened.\" \nEven the micromanaging, analytical freak of nature that is Pep Guardiola could find no better postmatch summary than that. This was a match for anyone beginning to tire of the TV-friendly Champions League format of strung-out first legs; there was enough distilled drama here to fill 180 minutes and more. \nSetting the eight goals momentarily aside, there was a freshness about this spectacle even before kickoff -- one you wouldn't associate with Bayern Munich vs. Arsenal, Part 138. Monaco had already sailed past 100 goals for the season before Valentine's Day and arrived in Manchester with a rebooted Radamel Falcao, the thrilling prospect of Kylian Mbappe and the gloriously elusive Bernardo Silva. \nBy the hour mark, this red-and-white sports car of a football team had left Manchester City's juggernaut in its wake, allowing themselves the luxury of Falcao's saved penalty kick before he atoned with an astonishingly cool chip over City goalkeeper Willy Caballero -- not to mention giving a nervous City a one-goal head-start before storming into a 3-2 lead of their own. Throw in a yellow card for simulation by City's Sergio Aguero when it looked as if he'd actually been toppled in the area, and this game already had plenty to write home about. \nThen, as Guardiola might put it, some more things happened. Suddenly City clicked into fearless gear, Monaco's defence melted, Aguero equalised with a stunning volley that he had no right to be presented with direct from a corner kick, and the Etihad roared City back to 5-3. In terms of self-contained theatre, with the healthy promise of more to come in the return match, there haven't been many better first legs than this ultramodern classic. \nGoal of the month: Eden Hazard vs. Arsenal \nThere remains a nagging feeling that Hazard should be scoring more freely and more spectacularly for Chelsea. The 26-year-old is now fully hardened to the rigours of the Premier League -- you could fill a whole YouTube reel with footage of him picking himself up after scything fouls -- but now is the time for him to move into another gear. \nHis goal against Arsenal at the start of the month, in yet another dismantling of the Gunners at Stamford Bridge, might not feature in the top five goals of the season come May, but its blend of goal scorer, context and execution is impossible to ignore. \nHazard's pace is a subtle weapon. Over 50 yards, chasing a ball over the top, he's perfectly catchable. Unfortunately for Arsenal -- first Laurent Koscielny, then Francis Coquelin, then Koscielny again and finally Shkodran Mustafi -- Hazard's ability over 15 yards is peerless. In skipping past one, holding off another as if it was something temporarily stuck on his shoe, and then slaloming into the area to finish, he produced a master class in what I'll call \"staccato dribbling,\" dealing comprehensively with one obstacle before moving on to the next. \nThe sum of those parts was not only a reminder that Hazard has emerged from his 2015-16 cocoon of indifference but also another ritual humiliation for Arsenal's perennially soft centre. Hazard could, and perhaps should, be doing this every other week. Rumours continue to swirl around Wayne Rooney, but does Paul Mariner feel he's a good fit for MLS? \nA good month for: Easing Wayne Rooney quietly toward the exit door \nPerhaps it's the totemic contribution of Ibrahimovic, the continued bedding-in of Henrikh Mkhitaryan or just Jose Mourinho's chess grand master approach to man management. In any case, the conversation about Wayne Rooney's looming departure has moved smoothly from the \"ifs and buts\" to the \"whens and wheres.\" With the club's scoring record now safely added to his CV, Rooney has been carefully set aside, so effectively that his place among the substitutes for the EFL Cup final wasn't worthy of any debate. \nHaving repositioned Rooney as a well-regarded, well-behaved but near-peripheral squad member, Mourinho has solved the issue once and for all: There will be no shoehorning of the England captain into the United team, no matter where they are in the league or which competition becomes their priority. From this moment on, it's all about where Rooney himself wants to continue his career, not about how Old Trafford engineers his awkward removal. \nA bad month for: Opportunistic marketing stunts \n\"Modern football\" is becoming a pejorative term by association, used only with a deep sigh when reflecting upon the latest depressing trend. It's too easy to slip into a curmudgeonly, better-in-my-day habit, but there are some things we could do without. \nThe year 2016 taught us not to be surprised anymore, so the sight of a 23-stone nonleague goalkeeper tucking gleefully -- and very conspicuously -- into a pie (or possibly a pasty, if you're really into the details) just because a Premier League team have brought the TV cameras with them, should be just about par for the current course. There were plenty of losers in the ensuing fallout, but the winners -- as always -- were the betting companies. FOXED OFF! We sent a hearse to Leicester this evening to signal the death of football following the sacking of Claudio Ranieri. RIP 🙏 pic.twitter.com/R5otpH0ygF - Paddy Power (@paddypower) February 27, 2017 \nNever shy to squeeze the last few topical drops out of the sponge, the marketing geniuses were out in force before Leicester's first fixture after Ranieri, apparently to lament the death of football. You either have to admire their self-awareness or wonder where it is. \nWhat March needs to deliver \nWith Chelsea's comfortable lead still intact, this month may constitute a veritable last-chance saloon for Tottenham and Manchester City if they're to present a credible challenge to the Blues. Spurs have a relatively pleasant set of fixtures with which to do just that, while Guardiola's City side have a tripleheader of Liverpool, Arsenal and (crucially, perhaps) Chelsea hovering on the horizon. \nIf that mission fails, we'll have to pin our hopes on City's trip to Monaco to live up to their first instalment. \nAdam Hurrey analyses the language of football.
