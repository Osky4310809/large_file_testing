But she certainly wouldn’t mind it if she did. “I would like to see her retire. I would have liked to see her retire a long time ago. Who wants to see their kid get hit? She’s got a lot of talent in a lot of other things. Movies, writing, producing, she’s really smart. I told her that at the very beginning when she started this, I said ‘You’re smart and beautiful, let the stupid people get punched in the face.’ Sorry, stupid people!”\nRonda’s mom seems to have a good head on her shoulders. Ronda would be wise to take her advice. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T03:17:21.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
