Well, George Blanda threw three passes at age 48 back in 1975, but no NFL quarterback has had an effective season as a full-time starter past age 42. And Tom Coughlin parted ways with the Giants two offseasons ago at 69, the oldest age ever for an NFL coach. \nSo the odds seem long that Brady and Belichick can do what Kraft is hoping, but it wouldn’t be the first time they did what no one else had before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:13:15.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
