The Americans seemed in control much of the time, but a 89th-minute Ellen White goal gave the Lionnesses a huge victory over the world's No. 1-ranked team. \nHere are some things we learned about the USWNT's second match of the SheBelieves Cup: Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP 1 The experimenting continues in a big way \nWhen the USWNT's starting lineup was announced Saturday, it saw seven changes from the previous lineup. Not only that, coach Jill Ellis was also asking players to take on different roles than they had before. Lindsey Horan was a holding midfielder, Mallory Pugh was up top as a striker, and Rose Lavelle was put on the wing. It's pretty clear Ellis isn't holding onto preconceived notions about how the USWNT should look as she continues to search for the right path forward. ©Icon Sportswire (A Division of XML Team Solutions) All Rights Reserved contact: info@iconsportswire.com http://iconsportswire.c Icon Sportswire via Getty Images 2 Is Mallory Pugh's future at striker? \nThe 18-year-old attacker has been a winger under Ellis since she broke into the senior USWNT ranks, but did she find a new spot on Saturday? She started up top as a striker next to Alex Morgan and she certainly looked the part, connecting with Morgan inside the box and offering dynamic off-the-ball movement. One of her strengths as a winger has been her ability to cut inside with the ball, but maybe she can just start more centrally and focus on scoring goals? Gary Rohman Gary Rohman/MLS/USA TODAY Sports 3 The three-back experiment keeps getting better \nAs shaky as the three-back defensive line looked when the USWNT first started trying it, it has looked decent enough through the SheBelieves Cup, which was supposed to be a serious stress test. The competition has gotten tougher, but the USWNT's new tactical identity looks stronger. An even better sign is that Saturday saw a new three-back line, with Becky Sauerbrunn, Julie Johnston and Ali Krieger, looking steady in their first time together in the formation. Getty Images Getty Images 4 Set pieces, set pieces, set pieces \nIt was clearly an issue in the USWNT's win over Germany days ago , and it was an issue again. The Americans don't seem to have a very clear sense of their responsibilities on set pieces – both attacking them and defending them – so of course that's where England scored. A corner kick in the 89th minute led to a bit of a scramble in the box, and a dagger of a goal at the last minute before fulltime, despite the USWNT otherwise defending well.

AP 5 The USWNT has too many good central midfield options \nThe Americans already had a pretty stacked-looking central midfield when a trio of Morgan Brian, Samantha Mewis and Carli Lloyd started vs. Germany on Wednesday. By Saturday, it became clear that Lindsey Horan is just as good of an option there, and Rose Lavelle, who started in a winger role, looks ready for the USWNT level if Ellis wants to start her in her natural No. 10 spot. When Andi Sullivan returns from injury, she'll offer yet another good option. 6 The USWNT goalkeeper battle continues \nWhen Alyssa Naeher put in a solid performance on Wednesday, it seemed she jumped ahead in the head-to-head goalkeeper battle with Ashlyn Harris. But on Saturday, Harris did her own part to show she's still a somewhat viable option. She came up with a huge save in the 32nd minute and made a crucial double-fisted punch on a dangerous cross late in the first half. But it wasn't a perfect outing for Harris either, making it clear the goalkeeping spot is far from settled. In the 71st minute, Harris slapped away a ball that she should've caught and she was lucky no England players were able to pounce on the loose ball. The goal won't go down as her fault, but it wasn't her best display either. Kyle Terada Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports 7 Will Alex Morgan and Christen Press start together? \nWhile the Americans have a lot of striker options, with newcomer Lynn Williams and now Mallory Pugh getting a try-out in the role. But for now, the USWNT's two best strikers appear to be Morgan and Press. And yet, they've only played together few times over the years, with the last time before almost exactly one year ago. As the USWNT changes its tactics and its identity, should a Morgan/Press combo get another look? They've replaced one another twice in this SheBelieves Cup, but the prospect of them playing together grows more and more interesting. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
