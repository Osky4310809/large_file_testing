Some 378,000 people have “liked” our Facebook page . But only a fraction actually see Open Culture posts in their newsfeed. That’s because a Facebook algorithm started making the decisions for you, showing you material from some people/publishers, and not others. \nNow, Facebook has finally introduced a new feature that will let you control what you see. Please check out the instructions below. When you’re done reading them, consider giving us a Like on Facebook , and then set your newsfeed accordingly. (You get bonus points if you Follow us on Twitter too!) If you’re using a mobile phone , open the Facebook app, click the “More” icon along the bottom of the app, then scroll down and click “Newsfeed preferences,” then click “Prioritize who to see first,” and make your picks. (You can select more than one item.) If you’re using Facebook on a computer , click on the downward facing arrow on the top nav bar, then click “Newsfeed preferences,” locate one of the people or publishers you follow, and change the setting from “Following” to “See First.” \nHope all of that makes sense. 1.7k", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:27:30.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
