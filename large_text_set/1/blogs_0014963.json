Sure, fans got to see Tony and Pepper do their thing on the big screen, but it is Claire Temple and Luke Cage who are taking control of television. The two characters found themselves in a budding romance by the finale of Luke Cage, and it seems like their affair is only going to continue. UP NEXT: Krysten Ritter Is On Board For A Second Season Of The Defenders \nIn a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly , Mike Colter and Claire Temple spoke about their characters’ tryst and teased what is to come for the couple. Colter, who plays Luke Cage, described how the romance felt between them. \n“Anytime you’re smitten with someone and hanging out with them for the first time, there’s a spark,” he said. “That newness makes everybody excited.” \nAs for whether Claire and her other vigilante friend Daredevil ever hooked up, Colter needs some convincing. “Daredevil didn’t have a romance [with Claire], we didn’t see that,” the actor explained. \n“I didn’t see it. My story is that she spent the night and then she slept in another bedroom. So I’m sorry, I need some kind of evidence that Claire and Daredevil did it. This is just hearsay. She’s my girl.” \nOf course, that relationship may be a bit difficult for another member of the Defenders. There's no telling how Jessica Jones will react to the pair's love affair given her prior romance with Luke Cage. And, beyond that, Luke will have to share his time with Iron Fist's Danny Rand. The impulsive martial artist will share a special bond with Luke Cage, and Colter took time to nod towards it during an interview not long ago. \n“He’s a young guy. There’s an exuberance that Iron Fist comes with that Luke Cage wants to temper a bit,” Colter tells Entertainment Weekly . “It can’t help but have a wisdom-versus-youth quality… Danny comes out like a bull in a china shop in some ways, and I think Luke has seen the world and knows certain things. It’s a cool combination that’ll work out.” (Photo: Marvel Entertainment ) \nJones will then reprise the role for Marvel’s the Defenders , which teams Iron Fist up with Marvel Television’s other Netflix stars: Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), and Luke Cage (Mike Colter). \nMarvel’s The Defenders premieres later in 2017.
