T+L Newsletters \nIf you thought the half tent, half home design was cool, you're going to be into this spot in Russia. 3D printing has been around for decades, but you don't see many 3D-printed homes lining the streets of suburbia. \nApis Cor—the business that created a machine with the ability to 3D print entire homes from the inside—announced that they were going to 3D print a full-sized home in December 2016, and they've finally done it. \nAt the end of February, Apis Cor shared a video of the process behind the completed project. You can find the 400-square-foot home near Moscow in a town called Stupino. All in all, it cost a little more than $10,000 to complete, according to Mashable . The walls and partitions were made using a concrete combination, and the windows and other fixtures were added once the structure was set. \nAccording to the company, the home will stand for up to 175 years. Up until now, large 3D-printed objects have been created offsite in various parts and later assembled in the preferred location. \nThis isn't the first time a home has been 3D-printed onsite. 3DPrint.com reports that a Chinese company printed a two-story home onsite in 45 days. \nPrinting of this home's \"self-bearing walls, partitions and building envelope were done in less than a day: pure machine time of printing amounted to 24 hours,\" according to Apis Cor. \nYou can check out their process video above, and read all about the construction details on the company's blog .
