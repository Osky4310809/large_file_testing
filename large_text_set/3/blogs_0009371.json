I am proud to present the NEW trailer for #WonderWoman ! ✨ pic.twitter.com/7q7SQ80ut1 \n— Gal Gadot (@GalGadot) March 12, 2017 \n\nWith the tagline, “Witness the future of justice,” the trailer gives us loads of footage on the gorgeous island of Themyscira, and our first look at some of Steve and Diana’s interactions. Diana also encounters London for the first time, concluding, “It’s hideous.”\nMost importantly, we get to hear her declare, “I am Diana of Themyscira, daughter of Hippolyta” and battle her enemy “in the name of all that is good.”\nWhat’d you think?\n(Via Twitter; image via screengrab)\nWant more stories like this?
