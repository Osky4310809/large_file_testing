The beauty of the new facility, in terms of the specific needs of the sun-soaked island in the Pacific, is that it can capture energy from the sun during peak daytime productiondf hours, and then keep that power ready for peak consumption hours at night. \nThis is a relatively new reality for solar power generation, made possible by Tesla’s Powerpack tech, which is essentially the commercial version of its Powerwall home storage batteries. Hawaii is already a big solar power consumer, which makes sense for the same reason it makes sense that the state is such a draw to ctourists, too. But Tesla’s initiative is the first to answer the problem of peak production time overlapping almost exactly with times where need for power is at its lowest. \nTesla’s new solar facility in Kauai isn’t going to completely reduce its dependence on fossil fuels – the island will still rely on diesel shipped in to provide someof its power requirements. But the new facility will offset some of that use of dirty burning fuel, reducing overall usage of fossil fuels for power needs by around 1.6 million gallons per year. \nThe new energy project was developed by Tesla for the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, and it’s the biggest solar storage facility in the world, according to KIUC President and CEO David Bissell. The project is a key part of Hawaii’s goal of using 100 percent renewable energy by 2045, and for Tesla, it’s the perfect way to demonstrate how it can deploy these kinds of facilities to fit similar needs around the world.
