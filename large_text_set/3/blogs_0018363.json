Named A-XMP (how clever), MSI has essentially adapted Intel's XMP (eXtreme Memory Profile) for the AM4 platform. A-XMP enables support for higher rated DDR4 memory kits, enabling them to work without any hassle. You are probably reminded of AM4 and Ryzen's peculiarities when it comes to memory support. A-XMP aims to at least mitigate those issues, whilst allowing for increased performance in a platform which is particularly sensitive to memory performance. MSI is calling A-XMP \"the world's first 1-second DDR4 performance and stability feature\", and has announced the feature will be rolled out in soon to be available BIOS updates for all MSI AM4 motherboards.
