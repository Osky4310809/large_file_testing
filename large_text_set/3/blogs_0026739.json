That was his dream, that the sky, and the way the water [looked the way it did].\" \nThe singer further noted: \"As far as the album covers, we all chip in, in one way or another. \n\"I can tell you that the ' Mother's Milk ' cover was directly inspired by a Sly and the Family Stone poster. I was in love with Sly in the '80s, and he had a poster where he was standing large and holding his band. \n\"I thought, how cool would it be if there was a big beautiful woman holding us? So it was kind of a steal and ode to Sly Stone, that particular cover.\" \nChad chimed in: \"Flea saw it somewhere, ' The Getaway ' image.\" \n\"Yes, on Tumblr,\" Anthony responded. \"He was like, 'Hey, does anyone know who did this? Because I really like it.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:51:39.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
