While largely dramatic, Ade’s film contains a substantial amount of humor, including an extended sequence late in the film performed by Hüller completely in the nude. \nAdam McKay is set to produce the film alongside Will Ferrell and Jessica Elbaum of Gloria Sanchez Productions. The director and writer of the original “Toni Erdmann,” Maren Ade, will executive produce alongside Jonas Dornbach and Janine Jackowski. \nParamount is still looking for a director and writer. \nNicholson hasn’t been in a feature film since 2010, when he starred in “How Do You Know,” costarring Reese Witherspoon and Paul Rudd. His other most recent credits include “The Departed” and “Something’s Gotta Give.” Also Read: 'Toni Erdmann,''The Salesman,''My Life as a Zucchini' Advance in Oscars Foreign Language Race \nLast May, Sony Pictures Classics acquired the North American and Latin American rights to the film. After its first press screening at Cannes Film Fesrival, which was greeted with sustained applause, TheWrap called “Toni Erdmann”“the most delightful surprise of the festival so far,” and added, “Ade has made a generous, hysterically funny but deeply touching father-daughter story that lasts for two hours and 42 minutes but never drags and feels far less than that.” \nNicholson is represented by Bresler Kelly & Associates, while Wiig is represented by UTA and Relevant PR. 16 Biggest Oscar Snubs and Surprises, From Ruth Negga to Amy Adams (Photos) \nThis year's Oscars field is out, and its one of the strongest -- and most diverse -- that we've seen in years. But as always, there are nominations that surprised us and absences that left some grumbling. Here's a short list of those. \nSURPRISE: Ruth Negga nominated for \"Loving\" \nEmma Stone, Natalie Portman and Amy Adams were early and clear frontrunners in this category, so while Negga’s performance in “Loving” was lauded by critics, it was surprising to see her replace Amy Adams in the final ballot. \nSNUB: Annette Bening for \"20th Century Women\" \nThe actress was nominated for her role for the Golden Globes (but didn’t win) and was completely overlooked by the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Turns out, Bening’s role as the mother of a male teenager coming of age in “20th Century Women” didn’t impress the Academy enough to score a nomination. \nSURPRISE: Victory for \"Hidden Figures \nThe feel-good drama about a group of African-American female NASA scientists topped the box office for two consecutive weeks and has now piloted itself to a Best Picture nomination. Awards favorite Octavia Spencer landed an Oscar nom for Best Supporting Actress \nSNUB: Amy Adams for \"Arrival\" \nAmy Adams had been a clear frontrunner for her leading role in “Arrival,” especially after having been nominated for a Golden Globe and a SAG Award in the same category. But the Academy left out the actress. \nSURPRISE: Lucas Hedges for \"Manchester By The Sea\" \nOdds-on Best Actor favorite Casey Affleck has dominated the coverage of Kenneth Lonergan's beautiful and tragic drama, but Hedges' breakout performance as 16-year-old Patrick Chandler added an element of levity and innocence to the film. While he didn't manage to get a Golden Globes nomination, the Academy took note of Hedges' performance. \nSNUB: \"Birth of a Nation\" strikes out \nConsider this one an expected snub. After its mammoth success at Sundance, \"Birth of a Nation\" was seen as the film that was going to carry the Academy out of its #OscarsSoWhite debacle. Instead, its wide release brought weak box office returns, historical accuracy criticism, and bad publicity after rape allegations surrounding director Nate Parker resurfaced. Instead, \"Moonlight,\" \"Fences,\" \"Hidden Figures' and \"Lion\" are the movies that are bringing diversity to the Oscar race. \nSURPRISE: Mel Gibson for \"Hacksaw Ridge\" \nIt seems that Hollywood is finally ready to take Gibson back. After getting a standing ovation at an Academy screening last fall, Mel Gibson has landed a Best Director nomination for \"Hacksaw Ridge\" in a competitive field that includes Damien Chazelle and Barry Jenkins \nSNUB: \"Silence\" \nDespite its enormous critical acclaim, \"Silence\" will be only the second Scorsese film in the last 15 years to not get a Best Picture nomination. Weak box office numbers and late screening releases hampered the film's campaign, and it will have to settle for just a Best Cinematography nomination \nSURPRISE: Isabelle Huppert for \"Elle\" \nThe French actress was a surprise winner for the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama for her star turn in \"Elle,\" after most people assumed the ceremony would be another coronation for \"Jackie\" headliner Natalie Portman. And she continues to defy predictions, landing an Oscar nomination as well. \nSURPRISE: Viggo Mortensen for \"Captain Fantastic\" Mortensen continues his surprise run for his work in the hidden Sundance gem \"Captain Fantastic,\" adding to his Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA nods. \nSNUB: Tom Ford for Adapted Screenplay \nIt probably wasn't easy for the famous designer to take Austin Wright's novel \"Tony & Susan\" and adapt it for the big screen. The film was lauded by critics and Ford was nominated for two Golden Globes for writing and directing the film -- yet the Academy left him off the list. Getty Images \nSURPRISE: \"Passengers\" nominated for Original Score \nThe film score nomination went to \"Passengers\" starring Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, shutting out other contenders like \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.\" Sony \nSNUB: Best Director for \"Hell or High Water\" \nDavid Mackenzie didn't receive a nomination for directing \"Hell or High Water,\" one of the most critically successful films of 2016. Instead, Mel Gibson snagged a nomination for \"Hacksaw Ridge.\" CBS Films \nSNUB: \"Gleason\" \nAmazon's heart-wrenching and inspiring documentary about former National Football League player Steve Gleason, who is paralyzed from the neck down due to complications from ALS, scored big with audiences -- including Best Supporting Actor nominee Michael Shannon -- but failed to pick up an Oscar nomination in one of the deepest documentary fields in years. \nSNUB: \"Deadpool\" gets zilch \nSorry, comic book fans. The Merc's run ends here. Surprising nominations at the Golden Globes and the Producers' Guild Awards couldn't be converted into Oscar nominations, and we sadly won't see Ryan Reynolds in full Deadpool uniform goofing around on the red carpet. Unless, you know, he decides to show up anyway and demand an explanation for why he wasn't nominated. Fox \nSNUB: Taraji P. Henson \nThe \"Hidden Figures\" star may have gotten a Golden Globes nomination, but she fell short with the Academy. Previous Slide Next Slide 1 of 17 \n“Hidden Figures” and Ruth Negga are pleasant surprises while Annette Bening and Martin Scorsese are left out in the cold \nThis year's Oscars field is out, and its one of the strongest -- and most diverse -- that we've seen in years. But as always, there are nominations that surprised us and absences that left some grumbling.
