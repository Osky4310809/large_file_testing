Udoma-Adeosun-Emefiele \nSpokesman of the House of Representatives, Abdulrazaq Namdas, revealed this in a chat with journalists, yesterday. \nAccording to him, the whole exercise is designed to enshrine transparency in the budgetary process in Nigeria and restore confidence in the appropriation processes of both legislative chambers. \nHe said: “This is the first time in the history of Nigeria that we are involving such stakeholders, all in a bid to ensure that Nigerians have confidence in the whole process. \n“The inputs of the stakeholders will go a long way in making the whole process to be transparent, thereby allaying the fears of Nigerians from any wrong doing from our own side. \nOn the 18 bills assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari, Namdas said 17 of the bills emanated from the House, while the Senate passed one. \n“Again, we’ve eight bills that are on the verge of being endorsed by Mr President and out of these, the House passed seven.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:29:48.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
