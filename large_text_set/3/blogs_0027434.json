Kristi Yamaguchi tried lending her support to fellow professional ice skater Nancy Kerrigan earlier this week, but her poor choice of words caused a major stir on Twitter. WATCH: 'Dancing With the Stars' Host Tom Bergeron Wants to Make Peace Between William Shatner and Nick Viall Yamaguchi, who won Dancing With the Stars in 2008, sent a tweet to current contestant Kerrigan, writing, ‚ÄúSo excited for you @NancyAKerrigan!

The incident was linked to fellow skater Tonya Harding and the footage of Kerrigan clutching her leg and crying out, ‚ÄúWhy, why, why?‚Äù has become iconic in pop culture. But Kerrigan herself didn‚Äôt seem concerned by Yamaguchi‚Äôs word choice, replying to the tweet, ‚ÄúThank you so much Krisiti! I‚Äôm excited to get started said for the advice you had for me.
