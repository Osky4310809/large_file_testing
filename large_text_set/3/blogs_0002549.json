Another source said of De Luca, “I don’t think he would be disqualified because of some idiot,” meaning PwC’s bonehead bean counters.\nOthers in the running for Grey’s post include former Warner Bros. movie boss Jeff Robinov, former Paramount COO Rob Friedman and “Ted” producer Scott Stuber.\n“They are looking at Friedman and Stuber, though the gossip in Hollywood is that Scott is going to get a senior creative position at Netflix,” said a source, adding that Jim Gianopulos is in the picture and that Les Moonves passed on the gig. “Sadly, there doesn’t seem to be any women in the mix,” said the source, noting Sherry Lansing was Paramount CEO for more than 12 years, like Grey.\nThe source added, “Hollywood is going through a transition . . . The studios either want big franchise movies or indie hits like ‘Moonlight.’ But they are looking at the wrong people,” and mentioned “Moonlight” producer Dede Gardner and Jason Blum — who brought “Paranormal Activity” to Paramount — as smart picks. But we hear Blum’s focused on his Blumhouse Productions, which just made the M. Night Shyamalan hit “Split” for Universal.\nMeanwhile, Paramount’s parent Viacom wants more synergy between the studio and struggling cable networks like MTV and Nickelodeon, which some candidates for Grey’s job would find “less appealing.” A rep for Viacom had no comment, and De Luca did not return our call.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T04:03:12.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
