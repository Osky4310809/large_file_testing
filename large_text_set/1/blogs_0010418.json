Trump, who allegedly encouraged the workers to urinate on a bed, called the report \"fake news\" — and now Penthouse is offering $1 million for the tape.\nSEE ALSO: Can we please stop branding compassion as 'liberal elitism?'\nThe memo had been circulating for months among journalists and politicians, but was never published in its entirety because the allegations couldn't be independently verified . So who better than Penthouse , a softcore porn magazine, to do the hard, real work of paying for the tape?\n\"We, along with the rest of the free world, are intrigued by the report alleging President-Elect Donald Trump employed sex workers to perform a 'golden showers' show in the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton hotel in Moscow,\" Penthouse said in a statement to The Wrap . \"However, while many media outlets are content running a story based on conjecture and rumor, we at Penthouse are committed to the value of getting the story right rather than getting it first. So we are offering up to $1 million to secure exclusive rights to the FSB tapes documenting Trump’s Russian hotel hijinks. After all, seeing is believing.\"\nPenthouse stressed that they weren't trying to shame sexual diversity or people's sexual preferences.
