(seriously)\" and she will reveal them at 9ET tonight. \nIn October, the New York Times reports that \" Trump Tax Records Obtained by The Times Reveal He Could Have Avoided Paying Taxes for Nearly Two Decades .\" Specifically, it reports that according to a previously undisclosed 1995 tax filing, Trump reported a $916 million loss on his income tax returns that year which could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income tax for up to 18 years. As it explains, \"the 1995 tax records, never before disclosed, reveal the extraordinary tax benefits that Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, derived from the financial wreckage he left behind in the early 1990s through mismanagement of three Atlantic City casinos, his ill-fated foray into the airline business and his ill-timed purchase of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.\" \nThen just last week, the New York Times' columnist Nicholas Kristoff urged IRS employees Sunday to break the law, and leak Donald Trump’s tax returns to his publication: “If you’re in IRS and have a certain president’s tax return that you’d like to leak, my address is: NYT, 620 Eighth Ave, NY NY 10018,” Nicholas Kristof wrote on Twitter. But if you're in IRS and have a certain president's tax return that you'd like to leak, my address is: NYT, 620 Eighth Ave, NY NY 10018. https://t.co/ujYe100Tn9 \n— Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) March 6, 2017 \nAs the Hill reminds us, the release of an individual's unauthorized tax returns is a felony. While reporters who publish illegally obtained information that they did not solicit are traditionally not prosecuted - recall that in September 2016 the NYT released an old Trump tax return without legal consequences- the legal picture becomes less clear if the reporters are involved in the leaking of the information. \nOn this issue, the U.S. code on unauthorized disclosure of information states quite clearly that \"It shall be unlawful for any person to whom any return or return information (as defined in section 6103(b)) is disclosed in a manner unauthorized by this title thereafter willfully to print or publish in any manner not provided by law any such return or return information... Any violation of this paragraph shall be a felony punishable by a fine in any amount not exceeding $5,000, or imprisonment of not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. \" \nAnd now... BREAKING: We've got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC. \n(Seriously). \n— Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 14, 2017 \nWe will just have to see what she has. And how long it takes for the leak to be discovered and someone to serve some serious jail-time. \nWe look forward to President Trump's reaction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T02:09:05.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
