Energy drinks mask that, so people may underestimate how intoxicated they are, end up staying out later, consume more alcohol, and engage in risky behavior and more hazardous drinking practices.”\nAccording to another study by Purdue University , mixing these two substances had an identical result on mice’s brains as doing cocaine.\n“It seems the two substances together push them over a limit that causes changes in their behavior and changes the neurochemistry in their brains,” Richard van Rijn, an assistant professor at Purdue University, wrote in a press release. “We’re clearly seeing effects of the combined drinks that we would not see if drinking one or the other.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:04:36.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
