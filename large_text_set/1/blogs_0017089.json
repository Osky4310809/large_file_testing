Admittedly, some of these games are showing their age. But as far as pricing, everything's $5 and under, so unlike some of the recent sales, no one title is going to break the bank here.\nEven though getting into the PlayStation 4 re-release of Dark Cloud 2 right now is a bad idea for me in terms of timing (I don't just want to \"add it to the pile\" and forget about it), that's what I'm eying.\nIf you're at all into story-driven adventure games, you may want to consider Asemblance . It fell short of my expectations, but it pulls off some cool things and is much easier to recommend at this price. Otherwise, the list is a whole lotta games you're probably well aware of, so take your pick.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T01:49:06.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
