It’s a problem now. IT’S A PROBLEM NOW. What a cold-blooded, reptilian, king-stay-the-king finishing line. LaVar Ball wanted a dad battle, and he has himself a honest-to-goodness dad battle now. The man broke the number one rule that dads aren’t supposed to break: Never, under any circumstances, especially when that person is a three-time world champion and one of the fittest people in the world, talk trash to another dad about his kids. Liam Neeson taught us that lesson in Taken , and now LeBron’s about to school us again in real life. \nWhat could LeBron do now? Well, he could challenge Ball to a game of one-on-one (LaVar already challenged Michael Jordan , for crying out loud) and dunk all over the big-mouthed poppa bear, or he could keep suiting up, going about his business, and being the best basketball player in the world while Ball sits in his sideline chair and cries to Nike about sneaker deals. Numbers don’t lie, even if the Ball sometimes does.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:09:34.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
