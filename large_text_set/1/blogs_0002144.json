UK workers on average salaries will spend 14% of their income on a monthly season ticket from Luton to London (£387) or 11% from Liverpool to Manchester (£292). By contrast, similar commutes would cost passengers only 2% of their incomes in France, 3% in Germany and Italy, and 4% in Spain. \nMick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, the union for train drivers and operators, said: “It is scandalous that the government is allowing privatised train companies to make even more money for providing an ever-poorer service . \n“We have the most expensive railway in Europe and the train companies, aided and abetted by this government, are about to make it even more costly for people to travel.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:17:00.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
