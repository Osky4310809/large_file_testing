Feb. 21 2017 1:41 PM Trump Visited the Smithsonian African-American History Museum. What Might He Have Learned? President Donald Trump and Housing and Urban Development nominee Ben Carson pose in front of the Ben Carson exhibit during a visit to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture on February 21, 2017 in Washington, DC. Photo by Kevin Dietsch - Pool/Getty Images \nPresident Donald Trump spent Tuesday morning touring the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, a makeup visit for the trip he was supposed to have made on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. One of Trump’s companions was Ben Carson, his pick for secretary of housing and urban development, whose career as a neurosurgeon is commemorated in one of the upstairs exhibits. Henry Grabar \nHenry Grabar is a staff writer for Slate ’s Moneybox. \nIt would have been a good opportunity for the developer-president to update his notion of the “inner city” as a stand-in for black America, and perhaps even examine his own role in creating that stereotype.

In 1973, Trump was sued by the Department of Justice for refusing to rent or negotiate rentals with black tenants in the buildings his father had built in outer-borough New York City. The 27-year-old Trump vehemently denied the accusation. The standout detail from the case, which Trump settled in 1975 without admission of guilt but with a formal structure to help black tenants find apartments in Trump buildings, was that applications from blacks were marked with a “C” for colored. A review of some of related documents released last week by the FBI reveals a blunter approach at some of the buildings in the Trump Management Company: A black prospective tenant would be told there were no vacancies, despite a newspaper listing; a white prospective tenant would be shown an empty apartment immediately. \nTucked away on the third level of the underground history galleries at the NMAAHC is a room called “Cities and Suburbs” that to some extent tells the other side of this story: the diverse but largely segregated set of black communities that emerged during this era. Like the rest of the museum, its focus is on black agency—on places like Soul City , the utopian black community in North Carolina that the Washington Post called “perhaps the most vital experiment yet in this country’s halting struggle against the cancer of hectic urbanization.” The endeavor got a $14 million grant from President Nixon’s Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Atlanta, Cleveland, Newark, and Los Angeles all elected their first black mayors between 1966 and 1974, a sign of burgeoning black political power and white flight. But the number of black residents in U.S. suburbs also would double between 1975 and 1985. \nDiscriminatory landlords helped ensure that old patterns of segregation would be perpetuated in neighborhoods where the building stock was nicer and newer. In one 1972 document from the just-released FBI files, for example, a white investigator for the New York Urban League posed as a renter at one of the Trump Management Organization’s Brooklyn buildings—middle-class enclaves in auto-centric parts of New York.

He said the ‘people who made trouble’… were kept within a limited part of the neighborhood which they seldom left, and assured that I would have little contact with them if I moved into the Beach Haven Apartment.” \n“Do you mean blacks?” the investigator asked. \n“You know what I mean,” the representative responded. \nDid Trump’s mind flash back to those days, to his first mention in the New York Times , as he reviewed the museum’s catalog of black communities forged in response to redlining, restrictive covenants, and violence? We know he stopped by the exhibit on Carson's former career; perhaps Carson could also learn something from Trump's.
