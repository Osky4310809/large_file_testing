The roof collapsed shortly after they got there. \nMoses was unconscious and unresponsive when firefighters entered the house. He was removed from the home and transported to Clearview Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. \n“We are all saddened by this life-taking tragedy,” Glass said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims’ families.” \nMoses, a standout pass rusher at the University of Georgia, was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the third round of the 2007 NFL draft , but the Raiders cut him before the season began. Moses was claimed off of waivers by the Arizona Cardinals and released a few weeks later. The Dolphins claimed Moses, and he spent the remainder of his NFL career in Miami. \nHis first career sack came in primetime, during a Monday Night Football matchup against Ben Roethlisberger and the Pittsburgh Steelers . Moses remained with the Dolphins through the 2010 season and finished his career with 35 tackles and 3.5 sacks. \nMoses spent his post-NFL career as an assistant coach with Reinhardt University in Waleska, Georgia.
