Bournemouth Beach, Bournemouth, Dorset Tripadvisor \n8. Rhossili Bay, Rhossili, Wales Tripadvisor \n9. Perranporth Beach, Perranporth, Cornwall Tripadvisor \n10. Hengistbury Head, Bournemouth, Dorset Tripadvisor \nWho needs the Caribbean when there are so many brilliant beaches on our tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic? \nSure, it rains a lot in the UK, but catch parts of the coast on a sunny day and you’d be forgiven for thinking you were sunning yourself in the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean. \nThe trick, of course, is knowing where to look. \nIf you need help narrowing it down, TripAdvisor has released its annual rundown of the top 10 beaches in the UK, based on reviews and ratings from its users. \nThe awards are based on the quality and quantity of comments and and ratings left on the travel site over 12 months - cherry-picking the beaches that really live up to their travel guides. \nIt might be a while before you can lie on one of these beaches with a cocktail in one hand and a book in the other, but come summer, these are the sandy spots you’ll want to be throwing your towel onto. 1. Weymouth Beach, Weymouth, Dorset Weymouth (Tripadvisor) \nClaiming the top spot is Weymouth’s three-mile stretch of sand, which boasts clean water and traditional seaside attractions like Punch and Judy and donkey rides, as well as cheery promenade and free summer firework displays. 2. Fistral Beach, Newquay, Cornwall Fistral beach (Tripadvisor) These are the best beaches in the world to visit this year \nThis surfer’s paradise has some of the best waves in Europe. All the UK surf competitions take place here - from Boarmasters to the Quicksilver Skins. However, there's plenty for visiting tourists to fall in love with too - this beautiful beach is west facing, long and sandy and backed by towering cliffs and wild sand dunes. 3. St. Brelade’s Bay Beach, St Brelade, Jersey St. Brelade's Bay (Tripadvisor) \nPalm trees, soft sands, seaview dining, clear blue waters.... There are plenty of reasons to take your next beach holiday at this Jersey beauty spot. 4. Luskentyre, Isle of Harris, Scotland Lukentyre (Tripadvisor) \nHarris is famed for its beaches, and Luskentyre is the jewel in its crown. This spectacular sun trap is famed not only for its miles of sands, but also for its clear waters and abundant wildlife. 5. Woolacombe Beach, Woolacombe, Devon Woolacombe (Tripadvisor) \nMiles long in size and golden in colour, Woolacombe is a lure for longboarders and beginner surfers who flock here to enjoy the mellow beachbreak peaks. The beach has a wild nature to it - expect sand dunes rather than chippies and arcades. 6. Porthminster Beach, St Ives, Cornwall Porthminster beach (Tripadvisor) \nThis idyllic beauty spot has incredible views across to Godrevy Lighthouse, which was the inspiration for Virginia Woolf’s famous novel ‘To the Lighthouse’. It also has one of the mildest climates in the UK, along with swaying palm trees and translucent waters. 7. Bournemouth Beach, Bournemouth, Dorset Bournemouth (Tripadvisor) \nBournemouth has long been a popular seaside resort for families on a classic bucket and spade holiday. Nestled beneath a dramatic cliff line, the bay is spoilt with its own micro-climate and some of the warmest sea temperatures in Britain. 8. Rhossili Bay, Rhossili, Wales Rhosisili Bay (Tripadvisor) \nIf you’re lucky, you might see some basking seals or dolphins playing in the surf at Rhossili Bay. It also boasts one of the finest views in Wales from the grassy hilltop vantage points that surround the beach. 9. Perranporth Beach, Perranporth, Cornwall Perranporth (Tripadvisor) \nIt’s one of Cornwall’s most popular beaches for good reason - there Instagrammable rock formations, tidal bathing pools, great surf, golden sands and, as reviewers noted - a pub, quite literally, on the beach. 10. Hengistbury Head, Bournemouth, Dorset Heginstbury Head(Tripadvisor) \nThe only pebbled beach to make the list, Hengistbury Head is a great spot to for a long ramble alongside its coastal cliff face. This coastal conservation area is also well loved for its wild flowers, seaside cafes and signs of ancient settlement.
