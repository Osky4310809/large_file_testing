But states without such systems might face challenges from the federal government, he said.\nCole said the federal government's priorities would include preventing distribution of marijuana to children and preventing cartels from getting their hands on revenue from marijuana sales.\nAdvocates of liberal marijuana laws have eyed the arrival of Attorney General Jeff Sessions with unease.

Elizabeth Warren , a Massachusetts Democrat, is leading an effort to make sure vendors working...\n(Tribune news services) In explaining the rationale of greater enforcement of federal marijuana laws, Spicer cited growing problems with other illicit drug use.\n\"I think that when you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people,\" Spicer said. There is still a federal law that we need to abide by.\"\nIn a statement Thursday afternoon, the National Cannabis Industry Association took issue with that argument.\n\"Science has discredited the idea that marijuana serves as any kind of gateway drug, and the addiction and death rates associated with opioids simply do not occur in any way with cannabis,\" said Aaron Smith, the organization's executive director.\nHe also argued that the current state programs are well-regulated and operating well.\nIn a separate statement Thursday, the Marijuana Policy Project pointed to polling showing a strong majority of voters opposed to the government enforcing federal prohibition laws in states where marijuana is legal for medical or adult use.\n\"The vast majority of Americans agree that the federal government has no business interfering in state marijuana laws,\" said Mason Tvert, the group's communications director. \"This administration is claiming that it values states' rights, so we hope they will respect the rights of states to determine their own marijuana policies.\"\n Jeff Sessions Sean Spicer", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5894dc5d/turbine/ct-medical-marijuana-growing-pains-0205-biz-20170203", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-586abf3b/turbine/ct-elizabeth-warren-pot-banks-20170102", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58afae6c/turbine/ct-feds-marijuana-enforcement-20170223"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:40:21.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
