Share Defoe fights for the ball against Chile in November 2013 - his last England game (Photo: Clive Brunskill)   \nIt's been a while but Jermain Defoe's journey back to the England starting eleven is complete. \nThe Sunderland striker - who has bagged 14 goals for the relegation candidates this season - led the line for England as they took on Lithuania in a big World Cup qualifier. \nIt's the first time the Premier League veteran has pulled on a Three Lions shirt since facing Chile back in November 2013. \nThat's 41 long months out of the national team setup - a period in which A LOT has happened in football, both on and off the pitch. Little did Jermain know he'd have to wait over four years to do this again (Photo: The FA via Getty) \nWe've put together six of the biggest moments which immediately jumped to mind when thinking about that time in the international wilderness. \nYou'll be surprised about some of the big moments in here... 1) Steven Gerrard slipped up in the title race \"Do you really have to bring this up again?\" (Photo: Getty) \nIf you're reading this Steve, sorry - we know it hurts. But it was a fairly major talking point... 2) England failed at two major international tournaments A familiar sight... (Photo: Action via Reuters) \nDon't worry Jermain, it was business as usual in this regard. 3) Luis Suarez got hungry on a football pitch again \"He ran into my teeth!\" (Photo: Matthias Hangst) \n, footballer flesh... 4) Marcus Rashford's gone from youth star to England teammate \"I love sliding, wh !\" (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nRashford was just 15 years old when Defoe took to the field against Chile - he's now in the England camp alongside him. 5) Claudio Ranieri arrived, won the Premier League with Leicester, and left again Happier times for Claudio (Photo: Getty) \nIf you're going to make an impression, you may as well do it in style, eh Claudio? 6) Arsenal have won two FA Cups and flown two planes about their manager above a game \"That message looks little bit disrespectful\" (Photo: PA) \nBecause that's what happens in football in 2017.
