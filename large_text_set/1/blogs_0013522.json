Wilcox spent one season in Madison in 2016 and led the Badgers to become the nation’s No. 7 team in total defense. Wilcox has strong ties to Cal and knows the Pac-12 well. He was a defensive back at Oregon from 1996-99 and was the linebackers coach at Cal from 2003-05 under Jeff Tedford. He left Berkeley in 2006 to become Boise State’s defensive coordinator for Chris Petersen. He later coached at Washington and then ran the defense for USC in 2014 and 2015. \nWilcox would take over a team that went 5-7, despite having the nation’s No. 10 offense. The problem was Cal ranked No. 125 in total defense, were No. 123 in tackles for loss and No. 107 in sacks. Wilcox’s defense at Wisconsin ranked No. 4 in scoring. \nIn the past five years, the Bears are just 12-33 in Pac-12 play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:54:44.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
