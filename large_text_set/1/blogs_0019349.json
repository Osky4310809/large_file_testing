The tireless Clinton defender is reportedly aiming to build a liberal donor network for the left that rivals that of the Koch brothers.\nA confidential memo from Brock, obtained by The Free Beacon, outlined plans to use his numerous organizations to defeat President Donald Trump through \"impeachment\" or at the ballot box in 2020.\n“No other progressive organization has the resources and assets that American Bridge has amassed over the past several election cycles to hold Trump, his administration, and the politicians accountable,” the 44-page confidential memo states.\n“Only Bridge stands ready with staff already hired, Trump’s web of business ties mapped out, and a massive video archive at our fingertips.”\n“The right will bolster Trump aggressively and deceptively. The campaign to stop him must be nonstop. At American Bridge, it has already begun.”\nBrock’s group claims to have more than 20,000 hours of video, 289 candidate research books, and the largest available archive of Trump research in the Democratic Party. Within weeks of the election, Bridge launched a “Trump War Room,” which has already scrutinized Trump’s transition team and will continue to watch the personnel, policies, and practices of the administration.\nThe “state-of-the-art Trump War Room” will strive to “uncover details of Trump’s affection for Russia and Putin.” They are tracking Trump’s foreign and domestic business partners, construction projects in foreign countries, and negotiations on potential future projects that he “could use to put personal profit ahead of our national security.”\n“With so many opportunities for foreign governments and corporations to gain influence over Trump, American Bridge will use every means at its disposal to hold Trump and his administration accountable—including FOIA requests, lawsuits, and regulatory complaints. As the progressive movement’s political research clearinghouse, we will arm our allies to join us in taking on the administration through paid advertising, earned media, grassroots efforts, and legal recourse.”\nBrock seems to be operating under the assumption that Trump will be just as dishonest and corrupt as his political idol Hillary Clinton -- a case of liberal projection if ever there was one. Of course, the danger with ethically-challenged people like David Brock is that they have no scruples whatsoever and will lie, cheat, and steal as much as they can get away with. Brock isn't called a \"psycho dirty-tricks hitman\" for nothing. Even among Clinton's campaign team he was described as \"bat-sh*t crazy\" and \"kind of a nut bar\" in emails released by Wikileaks.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/23/david-brock-memo-lays-out-plan-to-defeat-trump-through-impeachment/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://freebeacon.com/politics/john-podesta-hates-david-brock-continued/", "http://observer.com/2016/03/hillary-clinton-must-sever-ties-with-dirty-tricks-hitman-david-brock/", "http://freebeacon.com/uncategorized/confidential-david-brock-memo-defeat-trump-impeachment/", "http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/11/david-brock-batst-crazy.php"], "published": "2017-01-24T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:44:30.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
