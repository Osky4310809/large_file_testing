The City’s extreme cold weather alert was called off at around 7:30 a.m. Saturday, and a high of -2 C, as well as a 40 per cent chance of flurries, is expected during the day.\nThe temperature will continue to rise on Sunday, peaking at 2 C during the day with a 60 per cent chance of flurries, and dropping to -6 C overnight.\n“Up until Monday night there will be nothing significant,” said Rob Kuhn, an Environment Canada severe weather meteorologist, of the expected flurries. “We have quite the system coming up [on Tuesday],” Kuhn said.\nEnvironment Canada predicts that Monday will have a high of 0 C and a 30 per cent chance of snow. The temperature will rise further on Tuesday, to 3 C, the weather agency reports, with the GTA expected to receive several centimetres of precipitation throughout the day.\nArticle Continued Below With a few centimetres of snow likely on the way, followed by freezing rain, and then regular rain, Kuhn predicts that Tuesday morning will be messy, and that the system “certainly has the potential to muck things up.”\nWednesday will be colder, with a high of 0 C, and a 60 per cent chance of snow. As things start to freeze, Kuhn said, roads may become locally slippery, though strong wind is also expected that day, which may dry out the roads and prevent ice from forming.\nThe temperature will drop Wednesday overnight to -11 C, and rise slightly to a high of -5 C on Thursday. Thursday will also have a 40 per cent chance of flurries.\nThursday night will see a low of -12 C, and Friday is expected to have a high of -3 C. \nDelivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.
