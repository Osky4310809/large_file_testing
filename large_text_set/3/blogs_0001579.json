Although they are similar expressions of his favor and love, they possess a clear distinction. When we experience God's grace, we receive favor that we do not deserve. When we experience God's mercy, we are spared punishment that we do deserve. Amazing Grace \nGod's grace is truly amazing. Not only does it provide for our salvation , it enables us to live an abundant life in Jesus Christ : \n2 Corinthians 9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. (ESV) \nGod's grace is available to us at all times, for every problem and need we face. God's grace frees us from slavery to sin , guilt, and shame . God's grace allows us to pursue good works. God's grace enables us to be all that God intends us to be. God's grace is amazing indeed. Examples of Grace in the Bible \nJohn 1:16-17 For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. (ESV) \nRomans 3:23-24 ... for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus ... (ESV) \nRomans 6:14 For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace. (ESV) \nEphesians 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God ...
