But thanks to New York City’s wintry temperatures, his style got a little more tousled than usual. A photo of Sheeran posing with fan Talia Calandra on a NYC sidewalk is making the rounds, thanks to his hair’s decision to wave hello to the camera. In fact, Calandra seems just as psyched about the wind as she did about Sheeran: “I met Ed Sheeran today and a gust of wind made my pic with him 10x more exciting,” she wrote on Twitter. Unlike another man in the spotlight , the wind didn’t reveal any scalp. I met Ed Sheeran today and & a gust of wind made my pic with him 10x more exciting pic.twitter.com/9TxR1TE1VG \n— Talia Calandra (@taliacalandra) March 9, 2017 Fans are loving the photo, with responses on Twitter comparing him to the Heat Miser and Lewis from Meet the Robinsons. Worth noting: For her part, Talia had a very good day. She also met Louis Tomlinson and ran into the Jonas brothers on the street. Maybe she could moonlight as a New York celebrity tour guide. As Teen Vogue points out, Sheeran has spoken about his hair before. Although being “a ginger” might get you teased as a kid, he told the Daily Mail , “ as a musician it has been my saving grace.” He continued, “Because if you see a ginger kid on TV and there is only one messy-haired ginger kid who plays guitar, it is very easy to find them on YouTube.” Sounds like a solid strategy to us.
