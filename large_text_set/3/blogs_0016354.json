Julia is a 4-year-old redhead who loves to paint and sometimes repeats what her friends say. Also, she happens to have autism. We’re excited to announce a new friend joining us on Sesame Street! She’s Julia, a 4-year-old with autism! #SeeAmazing pic.twitter.com/xDS3x2a5za \n— Sesame Street (@sesamestreet) March 20, 2017 Advertisement   Julia was first introduced into the Sesame Street universe via books and online games, associated with the show's \"See Amazing in All Children\" campaign. But Sherrie Westin, an executive vice president at Sesame Workshop who oversaw the initiative, said she saw that Julia resonated with audiences. \"We realized if we brought her to life appearing in Sesame Street on air as well, she would have even more impact [and] be able to reach even more children,\" Westin told NPR. Most Popular Stacy Gordon, who plays Julia on screen, has been thinking of one such child in particular, her son, who is on the autism spectrum. Julia will make her television debut next month, showing up in two episodes this season and set to appear in more episodes in future seasons. \"She's one of the kids, she's one of the gang,\" said Rose Jochum, director of internal initiatives at the Autism Society of America, which helped Sesame Street develop the new muppet, on NPR. \"It's really meaningful to see her there, singing with Elmo, Big Bird and all the other characters. It's great.\" More from ELLE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:08:29.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
