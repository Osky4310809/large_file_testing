Though she and her show came home empty handed from the 74th Golden Globes, the night had deeper significance to Sansa, as it was the first major public event she was able to show off Jonas. \nMario Lopez caught up with the 20-year-old on the red carpet to talk about her dress, her boy and all the other things about Hollywood’s sloppiest night. (THERE! I SAID IT! THE GOLDEN GLOBES AWARDS ARE A SLOP SHOW! AN ENTERTAINING SLOP SHOW, BUT A SLOP SHOW NONETHELESS!)

The couple reportedly left the venue together along with fellow “GOT” cast mate, Maisie Williams. \nBefore the show, the couple went to CAA’s pre-Golden Globes party together, where one inside source told US Weekly , \nThey were joined at the hip \nThe two have only been going out for a few weeks now. The couple only recently made the relationship Instagram official, an act that is legally binding in some courts. \nThis is the birth of SoeJoe. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
