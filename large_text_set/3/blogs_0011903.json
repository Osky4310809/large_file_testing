Last Thursday, we got Josh Groban’s “Evermore” . Then on Sunday, Ariana Grande and John Legend’s music video . \nAnd now we finally get to hear the new Beauty and the Beast Celine Dion song . \nThe track is called “How Does A Moment Last Forever” . It was shared with the rest of the Beauty and the Beast soundtrack a couple days ago and it’s one of three totally new, totally original songs from the movie. \nBut it’s not the first time Celine’s sung for the Disney film. Remember this?\nDion and Peabo Bryson even won a Grammy back in 1993 for their recording. \n\nThe same way that Dan Stevens is performing Josh Groban’s “Evermore” in the film, Celine’s “How Does A Moment Last Forever” will be sung by Kevin Kline as Belle’s father Maurice as well as by Belle (Emma Watson) herself. Dion’s version will play over the credits with “Evermore” and Grande and Legend’s “Beauty and the Beast.”\nNo Beauty and the Beast soundtrack is complete without Celine Dion’s vocal stylings. Though she passed the title track mantle over to Ari and John, we’re so glad she found another way to be a part of the album. \nAnd Celine’s track is seriously gorgeous. Go ahead and listen. \nWe can’t wait to see this movie. Just a few more days! \nIn the meantime, we’ll be listening to the whole soundtrack on Disney’s Music VEVO channel . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T03:51:43.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
