Peanut butter cups? Plastic-wrapped meat tubes? Nacho-dust-covered chips? C'mon. We're all a little older and wiser now, and it's time to get a little more \"adult\" with our snacking habits. \nNo, we're not talking about undergarments made of fruit roll-ups. We're talking about eating like you actually give a damn what goes into the one body that your mama gave you. \nThis homemade granola comes from NYC's beloved healthy-eating spot Dimes, and it's loaded with good-for-you stuff (like almonds, pumpkin seeds, pecans, coconut oil, and golden raisins) and tastes-real-good stuff (like cardamom, cinnamon, vanilla, honey, and dates). \nRECIPE: Cardamom-Spiced Granola \nAnd hey, no need to equate granola with patchouli and drug rugsâ€”this stuff will win over everyone. Take it on a day hike, eat a couple handfuls after your workout, or just keep a nice big bowl of it at your desk, cuz that's where the snacks attack hit the worst.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:02:52.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
