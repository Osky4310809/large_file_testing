Johannsson has been the subject of several memorable skits, including the Black Widow rom-com solo feature and the series of skits with Fred Armisen that stars her as a show floor model for Mike's Marbleopolis, Mike's Busteria, and Mike's Fountainry. \nJohansson's episode will follow the March 4th show which will have Octavia Spencer hosting the show with Father John Misty as the musical guest. \nJohansson will reprise the role of Black Widow in the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War ( currently sporting a 4.35 out of 5 on ComicBook . com's anticipation rankings ), but there has always been talk of a Widow solo feature. The good news it is nothing like the SNL version, but fans have wondered what is taking so long in getting this off the ground. Johansson r ecently discussed working with Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige on getting it done. \n“We’re creatively really compatible,” Johansson said about the producer. “I think we both agree that the character is right for a standalone, it’s just a case of timing at this point for both Marvel and myself. I f I did it, I would dedicate myself completely to making it amazing,” she said. “It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it.” \nNext up for Marvel is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on May 5, 2017. Spider-Man: Homecoming lands on July 7, 2017, followed by Thor: Ragnarok on November 3, 2017. After that Black Panther debuts on February 16, 2018, while Avengers: Infinity War hits theaters on May 4, 2018. Ant-Man and the Wasp is slated for July 6, 2018, followed by Captain Marvel on March 8, 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:49:55.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
