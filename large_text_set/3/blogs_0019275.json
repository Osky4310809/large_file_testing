"persons": [], "text": "England play Germany on Wednesday (Picture: Getty; Metro.co.uk) It might be a friendly but when England play Germany it’s always for real. \nTime for a reality check: Arsenal is as good as it's going to get for Mesut Ozil Whether it’s the 1966 World Cup final, the 5-1 England win in Munich or the countless times the Germans prevailed – most notably at Euro 96 – this fixture has proven it has the capacity to produce a classic.\nAhead of Wednesday’s game in Dortmund, here’s all you ought to know…\nIt’s a big game for… Gareth Southgate . Wednesday will see the official start of the Southgate era, with the manager taking charge for the first time since he was given the job on a full-time basis. What a place to start. In his short tenure Mr Nice Guy has already shown he does have a ruthless side and an ability to surprise. He left out Theo Walcott (calling the Arsenal man on his birthday to inform him) and in his place picked a few untested players at international level.\nTheo Walcott ‘wasn’t chuffed’ at being overlooked (Getty) A positive result in Dortmund would set the right tone to his reign with the World Cup in Russia just over a year away.\nLikely line-ups… Line-ups for friendlies are notoriously tough to predict with managers often giving fringe players a chance and testing out new systems.\nFor the hosts, we know Manuel Neuer won’t feature due to the Bayern Munich No.1 suffering a calf injury which has ruled him out. Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil is in the squad but may not feature considering he wasn’t considered fit for the Gunners’ defeat to West Brom on Saturday. One player who is sure to feature though is Lukas Podolksi who will make his final Germany appearance – his 130th – before retiring from international duty.\nGermany squad Goalkeepers: Bernd Leno (Bayer Leverkusen), Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona), Kevin Trapp (Paris St-Germain).\nDefenders: Jonas Hector (Cologne), Benedikt Hoewedes (Schalke), Mats Hummels (Bayern Munich), Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich), Shkodran Mustafi (Arsenal), Sebastian Rudy (Hoffenheim), Antonio Rudiger (Roma), Niklas Sule (Hoffenheim).\nMidfielders: Julian Brandt (Bayer Leverkusen), Emre Can (Liverpool), Julian Draxler (Paris Saint-Germain), Sami Khedira (Juventus), Toni Kroos (Real Madrid), Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich), Mesut Ozil (Arsenal), Leroy Sane(Manchester City), Julian Weigl (Borussia Dortmund)\nForwards: Timo Werner (Leipzig), Andre Schurrle (Borussia Dortmund), Mario Gomez (Wolfsburg), Lukas Podolski (Galatasaray).\n\nSouthgate was dealt a few injury blows in the build-up to the international break with strikers Harry Kane, Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge all unavailable. It’s seen Jermain Defoe come back into the fold who will challenge Jamie Vardy and Marcus Rashford for a place up front.\nIt’s possible we could see some of the more surprising call-ups play a part, with West Brom’s Jake Livermore, uncapped Southampton pair Nathan Redmond and James Ward-Prowse and Burnley’s international virgin Michael Keane among those who will be desperate to feature. We could even see Luke Shaw, despite him being unable to get a game for Manchester United.\nEngland squad Goalkeepers: Fraser Forster (Southampton), Joe Hart (Torino, on loan from Man City), Tom Heaton (Burnley).\nDefenders: Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Nathaniel Clyne (Liverpool), Phil Jones (Man Utd), Michael Keane (Burnley), Luke Shaw (Man Utd), Chris Smalling (Man Utd), John Stones (Man City), Kyle Walker (Tottenham).\nMidfielders: Dele Alli (Tottenham), Ross Barkley (Everton), Eric Dier (Tottenham), Adam Lallana (Liverpool), Jesse Lingard (Man Utd), Jake Livermore (West Brom), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Nathan Redmond (Southampton), Raheem Sterling (Man City), James Ward-Prowse (Southampton).\nStrikers: Jermain Defoe (Sunderland), Marcus Rashford (Man Utd), Jamie Vardy (Leicester).\nIf you memorise one stat, memorise this… \nEngland have a remarkable recent record away in Germany, winning on their three previous visits. They won 3-2 last year, 2-1 in 2007 with John Terry scoring a late winner and then there was the 5-1 World Cup qualifier back in 2001. Obviously there have been lots of England defeats in that time too – but all on English or neutral soil.\nEngland memorably won 5-1 during qualification for the 2002 World Cup (Getty) Last time they met… England played Germany on their own turf just a year ago. It was a match that had everyone believing Roy Hodgson’s side had a real chance of glory at Euro 2016 – if only we knew.\nEngland came from two goals down to record a memorable 3-2 victory. Dele Alli was superb as first Harry Kane’s low finish got England back into it, Jamie Vardy then levelled with a cute finish and Eric Dier headed home a powerful injury time winner.\nTottenham’s Eric Dier scored the winner (Getty) From the archive… There are so many to pick from but we’ve gone for the last one in which Southgate was involved. The current England manager was playing in the heart of defence when England hosted Germany in the final international at the old Wembley. It was an awful match in which Dietmaar Hamann’s free-kick settled the match on a rain soaked afternoon.\nDietmar Hamann beats Southgate during the match back in 2000 (Getty) Metro.co.uk prediction… England’s players should be well up for this one as they try to impress Southgate with just a few games left between now and the World Cup. And considering the Three Lions’ recent record in Germany they should be capable of getting a result.\nBut this Germany team looks far better on paper right now and are so much more settled than their guests.\nWe’re backing Germany for the win.\nPrediction: Germany 2 England 1\nMore: Football Arsene Wenger reportedly signs new two-year contract with Arsenal \nBastian Schweinsteiger sends special message to Manchester United fans and Jose Mourinho \nWenger 'furious' with Ozil and ready to sell him after latest slap in the face \nVote… MORE: Germany v England TV channel, kick-off time, date, odds and head-to-head \nMORE: Marcus Rashford reveals how Wayne Rooney consoled England players after Iceland humiliation ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T12:28:45.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
