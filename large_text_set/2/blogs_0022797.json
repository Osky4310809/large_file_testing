For New Testament believers, fasting was neither commanded nor forbidden in the Bible. While early Christians were not required to fast, many practiced prayer and fasting regularly. \nJesus himself affirmed in Luke 5:35 that after his death, fasting would be appropriate for his followers: \"The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days\" (ESV) . \nFasting clearly has a place and a purpose for God's people today. What Is Fasting? \nIn most cases, a spiritual fast involves abstaining from food while focusing on prayer . This can mean refraining from snacks between meals, skipping one or two meals a day, abstaining only from certain foods, or a total fast from all food for an entire day or longer. \nFor medical reasons, some people may not be able to fast from food altogether. They may choose to abstain only from certain foods, like sugar or chocolate, or from something other than food. In truth, believers may fast from anything. Doing without something temporarily, such as television or soda, as a way of redirecting our focus from earthly things toward God, can also be considered a spiritual fast. The Purpose of Spiritual Fasting \nWhile many people fast to lose weight, dieting is not the purpose of a spiritual fast. Instead, fasting provides unique spiritual benefits in the life of the believer. \nFasting requires self-control and discipline , as one denies the natural desires of the flesh. During spiritual fasting, the believer's focus is removed from the physical things of this world and intensely concentrated on God. \nPut differently, fasting directs our hunger toward God. It clears the mind and body of earthly attentions and draws us closer to God. So, as we gain spiritual clarity of thought while fasting, it allows us to hear God's voice more clearly. Fasting also demonstrates a profound need of God's help and guidance through complete dependence on him. What Fasting Is Not \nSpiritual fasting is not a way to earn God's favor by getting him to do something for us. Rather, the purpose is to produce a transformation in us—a clearer, more focused attention and dependence upon God. \nFasting is never to be a public display of spirituality—it is between you and God alone. In fact, Jesus specifically instructed us to let our fasting be done privately and in humility, else we forfeit the benefits. And while Old Testament fasting was a sign of mourning, New Testament believers were taught to practice fasting with a cheerful attitude: \n\"And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\" (Matthew 6:16-18, ESV) \nLastly, it should be understood that spiritual fasting is never for the purpose of punishing or harming the body. More Questions About Spiritual Fasting How Long Should I Fast? \nFasting, especially from food, should be limited to a determined length of time. Fasting for too long can cause harm to the body. \nWhile I hesitate to state the obvious, your decision to fast should be guided by the Holy Spirit . Also, I highly recommend, especially if you've never fasted, that you seek both medical and spiritual counsel before embarking on any type of prolonged fast. While Jesus and Moses both fasted for 40 days without food and water, this was clearly an impossible human achievement, only accomplished through the Holy Spirit's empowerment. \n(Important Note: Fasting without water is extremely dangerous. Although I have fasted on many occasions, the longest without food being a period of six days, I have never done so without water.) How Often Can I Fast? \nNew Testament Christians practiced prayer and fasting regularly. Since there is no biblical command to fast, believers should be led by God through prayer concerning when and how often to fast.
