The EU experiment has been an unmitigated disaster. \nTrump and his supporters were very much aligned with the Brexit movement and the EU apparently isn’t too thrilled that the entire world is against them. \nSo they are going to fight back against Trump… \nFrom Weasel Zippers via Washington Post : \nEuropean Union nations bracing for the looming Donald Trump presidency showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect’s stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the EU itself. \nGerman Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the U.S. president-elect’s view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren’t paying their fair share had “caused astonishment.” \nTrump also said Britain’s decision to leave the 28-nation European Union would “end up being a great thing,” and he predicted that other countries would also leave. \nAt a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple — “it is the unity of the Europeans.” \nGood. \nAnything the EU doesn’t like is a good thing. \nAn EU endorsement is essentially a kiss of death. \nI’m fairly confident Trump isn’t losing any sleep over this one.
