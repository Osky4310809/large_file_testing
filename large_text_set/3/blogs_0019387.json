EastEnders has made me belly laugh twice this week already. \nAnd I was actually laughing WITH not AT it. First up, the timing and delivery of Kim’s response to Denise quoting Jane Eyre on Monday was superb: “Jane Eyre ain’t gonna help you pay no bills.” \nThen one of the team names at the pub quiz was so puntastic it almost winded me: The Quiz Akabusis. \nUnfortunately, once I’d got my breath back I turned to the enemy of scriptwriters everywhere: Google search. \nNow, I’m not saying the writers definitely used the Pub Quiz Team Name Generator online tool.10070668 \nI do however have a feeling they’ve been hitting the Random Soap Storyline Generator button pretty hard lately.
