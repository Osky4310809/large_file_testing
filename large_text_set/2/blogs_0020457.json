The only time they have not won at home this term was when Liverpool beat them in mid-September. \nIt is in stark contrast to last season where they won just one League game at the Bridge in five months under interim manager Guus Hiddink and five at home in the top flight overall. \nHazard told Standard Sport: “Yes, it’s significant. It’s difficult for the opponent to come here and win games. Do I get that feeling that some teams are beaten before kick-off? Yes. We are playing better than last season. Chelsea scout report: How Silva, Bakayoko & Sidibe played vs Man City \n“It’s a little like two years ago when we won the League,” he said. “I remember the second part of the season back then: sometimes the team didn’t play well, but we always scored at least one goal and Thibaut Courtois would make at least one good save, like against Arsenal. \n“We are in full confidence here on this pitch. You know the fans bring everything, they support us. \n“I remember against Tottenham [the 2-1 win] earlier in the season when they scored, but the supporters kept going, they kept singing. It’s great and we feel very good on this pitch. We know everything can happen in football, but we have self-belief and that is very important in football.” The players on Chelsea’s transfer shortlist The players on Chelsea’s transfer shortlist 1/17 \nThe players on Chelsea's wishlist...
