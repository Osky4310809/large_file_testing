If the people of the Internet thought that was going to be the last word in the furore that was caused by Kangana Ranaut’s statements on Koffee with Karan , then they were wrong, of course. Karan has now written a column in NDTV , where he went onto coin a whole new word for the reactions that just won’t stop coming after that fateful KwK episode, “nepospasms.” He did raise a bunch of fair points. One of them being that, as a nation obsessed with Bollywood in general, we do have a tendency to gawk at stars, and he's only trying to leverage that to do business. Given the way star kids are incessantly followed around by the paparazzi wherever they go, and how well their photos and stories sell, is telling in itself. Source: Getty Images \nBut, with a couple of sweeping statements he made light of the whole need for the debate around the topic of nepotism. He seems frustrated at the absolute lack of talent among the non-star kids who come to audition for his movies. Are we really going to believe such a generic statement? India has a population of more than a billion, and so many thousands of them are talented artist. None of them seem to have that illusive X factor that Mr. KJo only spots in star kids? But then again, he did mention that he doesn’t feel like it’s his job to further talent, it’s to do business for himself. He also, generously enough, mentioned recently offering roles to Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Irrfan Khan, both of whom refused, like that settles the whole debate. The point is they have already established themselves as talented actors, one has even done so internationally, and a Dharma brand wouldn’t really do anything new for their positions in the movie industry. If anything, a Dharma production stands to benefit from the presence of a Nawazuddin now, because it will bring in an audience who would otherwise not watch a KJo film. Well, this debate seems to be going on in a circle at this point. The “insiders” can’t stop feeling defensive, and seem to be missing the point entirely. While the “outsiders” are trying hard to make them understand that it’s about that first opportunity; but nevertheless, they are silently striving hard to make a mark within a system that seems like an exclusive club that just doesn’t seem interested enough to let them in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:40:16.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
