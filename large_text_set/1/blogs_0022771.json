It will be for the market to decide where the first spaceport will be established.\" Image copyright Orbital Access Image caption Orbital Access would launch satellite-carrying rockets from under aircraft at altitude \nPrestwick airport's director of spaceport development Richard Jenner said it had done a lot of work in preparation for applying for a spaceport licence. \nHe said the airport was now waiting for the regulations to \"clarify\" what was needed to become a spaceport. \nPrestwick commissioned a report in 2015 which said it would cost between £1m and £3.5m to get the airport to the standard to meet US spaceport regulations. \nHe said the airport would need to make some modifications but it was confident it already had most safety measures in place. \nThe South Ayrshire airport has partnered with a company called Orbital Access, which is developing a hybrid aeroplane and rocket system. \nIt plans to use a wide-body carrier aircraft, with special modifications to carry a rocket under its body. \nThe missile would be released at altitude and fired into space to deliver the payload. \nCampbeltown airport at Machrihanish on the Kintyre peninsula has also announced a technical partnership which is looking at how to develop a spaceport. \nThe Machrihanish plan is being put together by DiscoverSpace UK, which has signed a memorandum of understanding will tech firms QinetiQ and TelespazoVEGA. \nDiscoverSpace UK's managing director, Tom Millar, told BBC Scotland it would look to develop its plans over the next six months. \nMachrihanish has a very long runway and is not close to large settlements, which meets the original government criteria. \nMr Millar also said that the airspace above the runway had very few commercial flights, taking away the concern over interference with passenger aircraft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T04:04:33.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
