We missed this one from last week, but Newsbusters didn’t , and it’s … nteresting . Katie Couric appeared on Ellen DeGeneres’ eponymous daytime talk show to discuss her new documentary Gender Revolution, which focuses on “gender identity in this country.” Couric, who has some history of supporting abortion rights , tells DeGeneres that gender is a “deeply biological thing,” but that identity is also a personal choice based on how a person feels. And that choice begins —Â ta da! — in the womb:\n\nCouric reported that intersex babies provide a â€œgreat foundationÂ to talk about where genderÂ comes from.â€ Rather than â€œimposed,â€ gender is â€œreally a deeply biological thing,â€ she said.\nâ€œJust because you operate on a childÂ and tell that child you’re aÂ certain gender,â€ she added, â€œthat doesn’tÂ necessarily coincide with whoÂ that person feels he or she actually is.â€\nEven in the womb, a baby can â€œfeelâ€ like a different gender, she went on to say.\nâ€œIn the later stages ofÂ development, itâ€™s when your brainÂ is wired, and sometimes a surge ofÂ testosterone can makeâ€Ś a female fetus feel as if thatÂ baby is male or that person is male,â€ she said. â€œAnd the opposite, if there’s notÂ enough testosterone.â€\nAhem . The abortion industryÂ insists that fetuses don’t feel anything , and in fact have absolutely no agency at all. They claim that babiesÂ in utero have no standing to decide anything on their own. How can Couric claim that they have a complex understanding of gender identity, while her allies in the abortion industry claim that they have no understanding of pain — and even more basically,Â life ?\nIf we are to suddenly sensitize ourselves of the “deeply biological” implications of the fetus’ own perception of gender identity, can we finally agree that a fetus is an actual human being with a right to its own life as well as its own gender identity?Â Life too is “really a deeply biological thing.” That’s actually what “biology” means — the study of life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:04:34.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
