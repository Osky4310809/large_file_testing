The project, which includes plans for 728 apartments in two buildings, a BJ’s Wholesale Club, and a new Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists, will be the biggest in Roxbury perhaps in decades and certainly the biggest since Boston’s modern development boom kicked off post-Great Recession. Plans for Tremont Crossing stretch back to the middle of the previous decade. At different points it was supposed to be nearly all offices and offices with a sizable dormitory component . Developers Elma Lewis Partners and Feldco eventually settled on the current plans. The developers still need to finalize financing for the project. Plus, the city may yet intervene on final designs, scope, etc. Stay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T15:06:20.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
