He is a former Army sharpshooter who was kicked out of the military after shooting a cigar out of his commanding officer’s mouth from a half mile away. \nBest known for his Emmy-nominated role on “American Crime,” Cabral turned away from a life of crime and started acting. He first landed a role in the police drama “Southland,” following that up with roles in the film “End of Watch” and “Snitch.” In addition to “American Crime,” he currently has a recurring role on Fox’s “Lethal Weapon.” Also Read: Ryan Murphy's 'Feud' Scores Season 2, to Focus on Diana vs Charles \nCabral is represented by APA and Primary Wave Entertainment. \nHe joins a cast that currently includes JD Pardo, Edward James Olmos, John Ortiz, Antonio Jaramillo and Clayton Cardenas. \n“Mayans MC” is set in a post-Jax Teller “Sons of Anarchy” world, where E.Z. Reyes (Pardo), a prospect in the Mayan MC charter on the Cali/Mexico border, struggles with his desire for vengeance against the cartel, and his need for respect from the woman he loves. \nFX has ordered a pilot for the series, based on the network’s hit Charlie Hunnam-led motorcycle gang drama series. Sutter, who created the original show, co-wrote the pilot for the spinoff with Elgin James, and will also direct it.

It was the highest-rated drama series in FX Networks’ history when it went off the air in December 2014. \nDeadline first reported this news. \nRead original story Kurt Sutter’s ‘Mayans MC’ Pilot Casts ‘American Crime’ Star Richard Cabral  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:19:25.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
