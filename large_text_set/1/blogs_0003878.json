From the entertainment world, to the fashion and beauty industry, the new year brings a host of brand new things for us to look forward to. And, of course, we're most excited about the new make-up products we can get our hands on! Check out the ones we're most looking forward to this month. BeautyBlender Bubble \nIn honour of BeautyBlender's 15th anniversary, the cult favourite make-up sponge brand is launching the Bubble - an original beautyblender which is almost baby pink in colour. While there is no notable change to the shape or functioning of the sponge, it is the colour that is making all the difference. And we're sure brand loyalists will be lining up to buy it. Lanc么me Le Metallique Lip Colour \nBeauty world giant, Lanc么me, is a brand to reckon with. And with their newest launch, we're sure we're going to become even bigger fans of it. The brand is set to launch its newest lip colour range, which is a combination of a metallic liquid lipstick and lip gloss. So, if it's anything like the pigmented metallic colour payoff, with a super-moisturising glossy texture we're expecting, it's going to be our new favourite. Clarins 4-Colour All-in-One Pen for Eyes & Lips \nDo you remember the super entertaining retractable, multicoloured pens we used to have as children? The ones wherein we would have to push the desired colour's tab down to use it? Beauty brand, Clarins, has taken that childhood favourite and transformed it into a multipurpose make-up tool! With three eyeliners in black, blue and brown, and a nude lip liner instead of coloured ink refills, the pen can be used to line our eyes, as well as our lips. Now that's a dream our 12-year-old selves wouldn't even have thought would come true. While we're not too sure how the product will fare in practicality, we'll probably buy it for nostalgia and novelty-sake. Revlon Professional Blending Brush & Ultra HD Gel Lip colour \nRevlon is out with two exciting launches this year - one is the brand's version of a beautyblender (from what we can tell) which comes replete with a thick, triangular-shaped handle, as well as a replacement sponge head. The other one is their range of gel lip colours, with 15 vibrant but wearable shades, that seem almost lip balm-like - smooth and shiny. Stila Heaven's Hue Highlighter \nIn three gorgeous shades, Kitten (the brand's iconic nude pink), Transcendence (an opalescent pink), and Bronze (a glowing, sun-kissed shade), the Stila Heaven's new highlighters are set to become a cult favourite. The part that is even more exciting about these new highlighters is their formula. Departing from the normal liquid or powder highlighters, these have a unique formula that is \"ultra-fine\" and has a \"barely-there feel\", both of which are keywords we're always on the lookout for when it comes to make-up. Make Up For Ever Artist Acrylip \nWith product and packaging inspiration taken from acrylic paints, Make Up For Ever's newest lip colours combine the smoothness of a gloss, with the staying power of a liquid lipstick. The range comes in 10 beautiful shades, and is completely non-drying and weightless.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T09:49:07.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
