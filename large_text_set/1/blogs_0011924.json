The brawl got everyone involved, including goalies Adam Vay of the Quad City Mallards and Michael House of the Cincinnati Cyclones. \nHouse quickly learned his lesson that he shouldn’t mess with Vay—who, coincidentally, enjoys using MMA fighting as part of his training —when one of Vay's left hooks demolished House.
