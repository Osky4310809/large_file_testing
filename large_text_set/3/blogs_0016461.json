(Source: ANI) \nAn incident of mass cheating has been reported from Ballia district in Uttar Pradesh during the ongoing UP Board examinations. As per a report published by ANI, the students were caught copying out of carbon copies of the answer sheets that have been provided to them. Few students went outside their examination hall and exchanged notes. This happened when the class X Board Mathematics examination was being conducted in the UP Board. \nIn an another photo, several students are seen huddled together and discussing answer sheets and taking examination with open books. The incident took place on Monday morning and it would not be wrong to say that law and order still continues to be a big problem in the state. A similar kind of incident was reported in Mathura’s Radha Gopal Higher Secondary School where education mafia had entered the exam hall to give chits to the students appearing for the math paper. \nWatch the video here: #CaughtOnCamera — Touts helping class 10th students cheat in exam in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh | @maryashakil with the details pic.twitter.com/HutcvDw2Op \n— News18 (@CNNnews18) March 20, 2017 \nSuch mass cheating incidents are becoming common in the state. Last year too, hundreds of students sitting for UP Board examinations in Mathura were caught on camera passing notes and sharing answer sheets with one another. These students were freely seeking help from people outside the examination centres. \nPrior to the UP board examination that started from today, the education board was worried about the lack of invigilators. As per a report published by The Indian Express, the board has appointed near about 4,800 invigilators to keep a tab on 149 exam centres across the state. “All schools that have appointed their own teachers for invigilation will have to relieve them and in case of non-compliance, strict action will be taken against the principals,” Umesh Tripathi, Lucknow’s district inspector of school (DIOS), said. \nTo tackle cheating, the board has also arranged CCTV cameras, but as reports suggest, the cameras were either not functioning properly or were inadequate. In total there are 19 government schools, 80 government-aided and 50 self finance schools which will be taking the role of exam centres this year. While the government schools and those aided by the government have enough invigilators, self financing schools are appointing their own teachers to act as invigilators.
