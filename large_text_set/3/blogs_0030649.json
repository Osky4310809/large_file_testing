As ET Online reports, Madonna shared a video of her twin daughters Stelle and Estere receiving their first Barbies Friday on Instagram, and they instantly broke in their new dolls the way everyone knows you’re supposed to: by putting on an impromptu kid-coordinated doll concert.\nAs the daughters of the Material Girl, the 4-year-olds have already started honing their vocal skills (they melted hearts with their version of “ Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star “), so all they needed were a pair of fab Moschino Barbie dolls , “The Finger Family Song” and some natural kid enthusiasm to take their adorable act to another level.\n“What happens when you get your first Barbie Doll! !” Madonna captioned the video. “Pikachu is left in the dust! @moschino ” What happens when you get your first Barbie Doll! ! Pikachu is left in the dust! @moschino \nA post shared by Madonna (@madonna) on Mar 24, 2017 at 9:51pm PDT \nLove it. And we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention Stelle and Estere’s impeccable style, which we’ve come to expect whenever these two make an appearance on Instagram. The matching gowns accessorized with watches, bracelets and a snazzy hat are all screaming “Madge taught us.”\nHonestly, with Madonna for a mom, you have no choice but to be talented, unique and fashionable, and it’s clear that Stelle and Estere have wasted no time embracing their mom’s unrivaled level of chic. When the 58-year-old pop singer shared a snap of her daughters in their matching Adidas track suits , they were in peak #twinning mode, and we were not ashamed to admit that we really wanted to steal the look, gold bows included.\nToday's Blessing brought to you by Adidas! ⭐️ \nA post shared by Madonna (@madonna) on Feb 21, 2017 at 9:20am PST \nSo cute! Stelle and Estere are clearly enjoying themselves, and we are having just as much fun watching them settle into their new lives.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:27:33.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
