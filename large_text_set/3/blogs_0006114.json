Fanette Mellier \nFanette Mellier \nFanette Mellier is another female designer coming from the realm of silk screen. As you can see above, her prints are immaculate, and quite simply mind blowing. The sheer intention and perfection in execution is jaw dropping and deeply inspiring. I highly recommend thoroughly exploring her website! You won’t regret it. 10. Mercedes Bazan \nMercedes Bazan \nMercedes Bazan of San Francisco is a true master of Feng Shui when it comes to print design and layout.

Mind you, this was the medium that design heavyweight Paul Rand used in nearly all his designs, and is also a medium that was sadly lost for the most part in the coming of digital tools.
