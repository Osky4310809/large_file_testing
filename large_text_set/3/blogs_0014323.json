Each student in our class has created one of the questions in this survey.\"\nWell, it turns out the class is getting its responses from way more people from tons more places than expected. After just a day, about 230,000 responses from multiple countries had been recorded . \"You can just watch that number tick, tick, tick, just counting up, and they'll squeal every time we hit a big milestone,\" Porter told BuzzFeed. \"They've been joking that we broke the internet. Every time I go to refresh and it won't work, they're like, 'Ah, we broke the internet again!'\"\nRelated:\n6- and 7-Year-Olds Couldn't Solve This Math Test Question, and We're Not Surprised\nAs for the graphs that were originally going to be made with all of the collected data, Porter says, \"We are planning to graph all of this, but now I don't know how!\" Take the innocent and adorable survey to inform Mrs. Porter's class on your Lego preferences, whether you prefer giraffes or zebras, and whether you would rather eat pizza or soup.", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGYukpjcJPtdEGRCVJr1KFQiyI2bJHfdreTfZ4IxXYx6nk6Q/viewform", "https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=871666822974847&id=724115644396633", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliareinstein/pizza-giraffe-nonfarmer?utm_term=.elDZQL3DM#.ekwaG23MZ", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpermalink.php%3Fstory_fbid%3D871666822974847%26id%3D724115644396633&width=500"], "published": "2017-03-16T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:22:35.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
