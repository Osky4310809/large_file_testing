What’s it like when a woman comes in and asks for a big change? Wes Sharpton: \"There are three camps [of makeover clients]. One is 'I don’t have an attachment to my hair, I’ve never had an attachment, so just do whatever you want.' Love that girl. Cool. The other two are really about true transformation. That's either, 'There's an internal change happening and I need to make a physical announcement to the world,' or, 'I need an internal change to happen, I need you to help me jumpstart it.' That could look like anything. For instance, the person who has told themselves a lie for their entire lives like, “I'm round. I can never have short hair.” And then she decides to cut it off because what would that look like if you could be unapologetic in the world? You can challenge yourself and society just by being yourself. But I think it all starts with a conversation. It’s all about finding what you have to say and how we can express that the best way. And also how you can look really incredible while you do it.\" Do both of you sit down with the person together? Roxie Darling: \"It’s a conversation amongst three people. It’s not a typical stylist thing where we already have a plan before we talk to the person. We’re both coming to the person with the same approach, which is really just wanting to do the best thing for them in that current moment. For makeovers or transformations, sometimes it’s a big change and other times a transformation happens and it's a little change. And the most important part is discussing expectations. What do you want? Do you know what you want? Or are other people telling you what you want? I love when we’re able to help people find out what they want and give them something that best suits them in fulfilling that part of their life.\" \nThe color room at Hairstory Lucy Nystrom Is it a difficult conversation to have with someone who wants a change but isn’t clear about what their limits are? What do you typically ask? WS: \"I usually throw someone in the complete opposite direction and work backwards. I’m like, “Can we go short? What does Mia Farrow mean to you?” [Laughs.] And then you’ve taken them so far beyond the realm of what they thought was possible that there’s a middle ground that suddenly becomes possible. Transformation is very personal. For some people that means they cut off two bits in the front, and that might be the correct thing for that person. What we are continuously trying to work on at Hairstory, and maybe it’s odd to say, is to be a little more feminist about things. I’m saying, I want you to live out of choices not obligations. So if you feel that pretty only looks like blowdried, curled hair but you hate that and you torture your hair and it’s a struggle and obligation for you... I want to liberate you to move into a category where you feel 'I wear my hair like this because it’s my choice.' I mean, people do like to see a big change, but that doesn't mean that I think that everyone needs short hair. I think there’s great ways to be bold and vocal without cutting off your hair. I just want you to be bold and vocal.\" \nA detail of the art in the salon Lucy Nystrom What are you most excited to reveal about the new space? RD: \"It definitely correlates with where we are at as a company and as hair dressers. The energy here is different—it's like we’re at a startup. Where we were before was quiet and vast and expansive. This space is almost like a hive. Everything is buzzing around and we're being productive because we’re really vibe-ing off the proximity of being close to one another, and I think that's what we’re trying to do with the company, too. It’s really important for me personally to work in a space that directly speaks for what we’re trying to do as a brand.\" WS: \"My first thought when we said Flatiron was, 'Oh lord… I don’t do know about this decision.' But then the election happened and I was feeling unsteady. Suddenly, I viewed the world as this silo-ed place. But then I stepped out of a meeting here [at this new location] and I was like 'OK!' [Sighs.] Because there were rich people, there were poor people, there was diversity, and it was all happening together, and it felt like I’m part of that. As silo-ed as New York can get by class, this place still felt like it got it, like it was a melting pot. And due to it’s location, it’s also very accessible. It was the beginning of a conversation about what we want to create in the world.\" Some inspiration for your next salon visit, no matter where you are:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:48:46.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
