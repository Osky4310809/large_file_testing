As exciting as those specs might be (and we've heard the rumors before ), this report has no new evidence to back up the claim.\nThe other details are old news. Two other handsets could be released this year: a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, which will have small internal improvements from 2016's iPhone 7. We've heard this before from a Chinese leak, but the luxe version of the device was then going by the codename Ferrari.\nEven though Arcuri's note was long on speculation and short on any real documented information, many of its claims fit in with the rest of the rumor cycle. The specs point in the direction it feels like Apple should take for the next flagship, too — the iPhone has been stuck in the boring-but-dependable role in the smartphone market for too long now, leaving its challengers to sink or swim with exciting new features and eye-catching designs.\nBy making the move from LCD to OLED, curving its edges and ditching bezels, which is the least of what might come this year, the iPhone can take the first step toward a bold new redesign.\nBONUS: Everything we think we know about the next iPhone", "external_links": ["http://www.cowen.com/", "http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/01/18/new-supply-chain-reports-lend-weight-to-wraparound-58-inch-iphone-8-with-embedded-sensors", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/lBZ16DxG.jpg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-8-features-facial-recognition-laser-sensor-2017-1?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=referral", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/lBZ16DxG.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-19T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:09:19.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
