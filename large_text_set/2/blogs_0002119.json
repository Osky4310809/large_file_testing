The albums tab is now divided into three sections: exploration, photos on device, and user-created albums.\nThe exploration row previously seen in albums contains collections of photos like People, Places, Things etc. — it’s the collections generated by Google’s algorithms to help you find specific types of pictures. This row is now larger and holds more thumbnails — four instead of three — so you know more about the content inside.\nThe Photos on Device row used to be called Device Folders and contains pictures taken with your camera app, your screenshots, as well as media from other apps like WhatsApp or Twitter.\nSee also: Instagram testing multiple photos in one post with some Android users 1 day ago The third row is for the albums you’ve created.
