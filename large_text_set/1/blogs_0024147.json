Hotels Sold Record Number Of Rooms For Trump Inauguration \nPence did not reveal a name or even a list of front-runners, though his earlier comments indicate the nominee will be a strict constructionist — a judge who applies the Constitution and other text as it is written, rather than seeking to enact legislation through his or her rulings. \n“President Trump has been reviewing that list” of potential nominees, he told Republican lawmakers Thursday. “I can already tip you off: President Trump’s going to keep his promise to the American people and he’s going to nominate a strict constructionist to the Supreme Court.” \nTrump reportedly has narrowed the list to three candidates: Neil Gorsuch, a judge on 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Denver; Judge William H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama, who serves on 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Atlanta; and Judge Thomas Hardiman of Pittsburgh, who serves on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
