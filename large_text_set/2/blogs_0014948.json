I worked really closely with Gwyneth. I was so happy with it thought. I was like ‘this is perfect for Bex’. Everything that Bex is feeling has been put into a song. It was great!” \nWhile Bex has found an outlet for her emotions in song, Jasmine admitted it’s going to be tough for her character in the foreseeable future. \n“I think it’s going to be quite hard for Bex in the next few months. She’s having quite a hard time at school and I think she’d very confused. She doesn’t want to hurt anyone; she’s genuinely such a kind-hearted girl. \n“I thinks sometimes Bex needs to speak up instead of keeping it bottled up. She needs to talk to people and let them know how she’s feeling.” \nEastEnders airs on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Fridays on BBC One Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:01:18.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
