After that, it was replaced by the GST,” Sian See wrote, which triggered a string of shocked replies from people following his page. \nSian See said that since 2013, the state’s parking services had already been outsourced to a private company called Alam Indah Sdn Bhd. GST applies since it is a private company. \n“The parking rate of 80 sen per hour is the same before and after GST started. Hence, there is no absorbing nor exemption of any GST,” Sian See said. \nHe mused that to show GST was “absorbed”, one way would be to add an extra 3.83 minutes of parking time for each hourly coupon. \nHe also pointed out that it was an offence not to charge GST if it was due. \nWhen asked, MBPP Financial Committee alternate chairman Joseph Ng maintained that they absorbed GST in all of its services and rentals, including public parking rates. \nInstead of raising prices to account for GST, he said the council kept its rates the same. \n“If we rented a hall for RM400 a day, it should be RM424 with the GST but we didn’t increase it. \n“So we effectively decreased our collection to RM376 for the hall rental and remit RM24 as GST to the Federal Government,” he said. \nGuan Eng also told reporters that besides absorbing GST, the two councils also reduced its collection of assessment rates amounting to savings of about RM55.2mil for Penangites. \nHe said about 80,000 low-cost, low-medium cost and village homes on the island this year were fully exempted from paying assessments, amounting to about RM8.06mil or an average of RM100 saved per household. \nHe said 200,000 owners of other types of property, including commercial and industrial lots, were getting a 6% discount off their assessments on the island. \nThat amounts to about RM12mil or an average savings of RM60 per property. \nBut Sian See pointed out that assessment rates for residential and commercial properties in Penang were increased by 1% in January, 2015, four months before GST took effect. \n“Percentages can be tricky and deftly used as propaganda. \n“Assume that GST increases 2% - from 6% to 8%. This means the amount for a RM100-item goes up from RM6 to RM8 - hence an increase of 33%. \n“Same thing with the assessment rate. It means the amount payable is a bigger difference,” he said.
