Bush to tame his poncho on that rainy Friday afternoon. Some of us are sad today, but others had a great time playing peekaboo with a plastic sheet. pic.twitter.com/yOE0RJkNx8 \n— Kashana (@kashanacauley) January 20, 2017 \nWhether flustered by the elements, or simply due to this residual antagonism for the president, after Trump’s short and dire speech, Bush departed the scene and never offered public comment on the ceremony.

He has kept a low profile since.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:30:33.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
