The judge declined to stay the order, suggesting that travel restrictions could be lifted immediately.\nThe challenge was brought by the state of Washington and later joined by the state of Minnesota. The Seattle judge ruled that the states have legal standing to sue, which could help Democratic attorneys general take on Trump in court on issues beyond immigration.\nThe decision came on a day that attorneys from four states were in courts challenging the executive order. Trump’s administration justified the action on national security grounds, but opponents labeled it an unconstitutional order targeting people based on religious beliefs.\nFor more about President Trump, watch: \nEarlier on Friday, a federal judge in Boston on Friday declined to extend a temporary restraining order that allowed some immigrants into the United States from certain countries despite being barred by U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order.\nAlso on Friday in Virginia, a federal judge ordered the White House to provide a list of all people stopped from entering the United States by the travel ban.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:22:22.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
