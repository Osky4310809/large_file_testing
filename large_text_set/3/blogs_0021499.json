So, you want to get in. But the problem when you get in is that you’re so locked in that you don’t want to let go, right? And so, then the poor clown has to come and knock you off the sheep.” \nAdvertisement Judge Gorsuch smiled. “We can talk mutton busting all day,” he said. They may as well have. As Judge Gorsuch glides through the third day of his hearings on Wednesday, suffering few slips and answering no question he does not wish to, Senate Republicans have been eager to assist. There is a rich tradition of Republicans and Democrats making life easier on their preferred nominees, tossing congressional pool noodles to a judge who might flounder, at least somewhat, under questioning from the other party. But this year, Republicans have elevated the practice to high art — supplying extra cushioning for a nominee who does not appear to need it and adding a measure of time-killing levity to a process that virtually all inside the Capitol agree will end with a confirmation. \nAdvertisement   On matters fraught and frivolous, Senate allies have coaxed Judge Gorsuch to the safest of verbal cul-de-sacs, eager to defuse Democratic lines of attack with whimsy and digressions. “Do you think your writings reflect a knee-jerk attitude against common-sense regulations?” Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah asked on Wednesday. \nAdvertisement “No, Senator,” the judge said. “I don’t either.” In other moments, they have urged Judge Gorsuch to remind the public that no one, even the president, is above the law, or to make clear that his rulings in workers’ rights cases — an area of concern for Democrats — were rendered only in service of the law. More memorable were the flourishes that strayed far from judicial doctrine: “Would you tell me where your favorite fishing stream is?” “Is it true that you have been endorsed by John Elway?” Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
