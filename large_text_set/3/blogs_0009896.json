Some Bible scholars regard the Holy Spirit as the third person in the trinity. Many others understand the Holy Spirit to be the powerhouse of the Almighty. \nWhichever way one looks at it, the Holy Spirit, God the Father and God the Son are ONE. That is, the Trinity. \nThis edition of Joyful homes is not about the definition of the Holy Spirit or the gifts of the Holy Spirit but for us to appreciate the Spirit of God and his influence in our lives. \nAccording to the General Overseer of Laughter Foundation International Ministry, Pastor Gbenga Oso, in one of his sermons, he said that our first contact with the Holy Spirit is recorded in Genesis 1 verse 2 but let’s consider verses 1 and 2 to fully understand the Holy Spirit. \n“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep . And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters”. Jesus on the cross \nDuring the Baptism of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Sprit was again introduced to us. Luke 3 vs. 21 and 22 “ Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened. And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased”. \nOur Lord Jesus Christ introduced the Holy Spirit to us more than any other person. He fully introduced the Holy Spirit in John 14 up to chapter 16. \nLet’s consider, John 16 vs. 7 “ Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you”. \nVerse 13 of the same chapter, “ Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come”. \nBut our focus is on the anointing of the Holy Spirit. \nIsaiah 10 vs. 27 states, “ And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing”. \nThis is our assurance that the anointing is capable of breaking any yoke. \nSo, when men and women of God conduct anointing services, it is the power of the Holy Spirit in the oil being administered that breaks the yoke. \nLet’s not forget that the Holy Spirit can manifest itself in several ways. \nIn this season, by the anointing of the Holy Spirit, every yoke will disappear from your life in Jesus name. \nWhen we receive the anointing of the Holy Spirit, there must be a turn-around. Things must change for the best. No one comes in contact with the Spirit of God and remains the same. \nTestimonies- I ‘ll share a testimony. A friend made an application to a bank for transfer of Dollars to her business partner abroad but there was a long queue and the lady she met was very hostile. \nShe left her and decided to take her case to God. While praying God showed her how his wind would blow in her favour. In her dream, she saw a man ahead of her on the queue but suddenly a wind blew and her paper came forth. The officer said to her, I will give it to you now though it is not supposed to be your turn. This was in a dream. \nWithin days, the bank officer, a man ( he had replaced the hostile woman) called her to come over and sign the documents. \nOn getting there, he said, it was to be the turn of a man but that the man had called in to say he was no longer interested. \nThe lady boldly told him that it was the Holy Spirit that blew the wind to favour her . \nWhat am I saying? The power of the Holy Spirit is unlimited. It can break any yoke. It can make a way where there is no way. It is the manifestation of the awesome power of God. \nWith our connection with the Holy Spirit, we are emboldened to move beyond the ordinary. The Holy Spirit makes our journey of life as Christians easy because the Spirit gives us direction. \nThe anointing of the Holy Spirit sets us free from bondage. It heals and delivers one from evil spirits. It makes the barren to conceive, attracts a marriage partner to the single. \nThe anointing of the Holy Spirit can change the tide in your favour. \nWhat is that challenge that has been giving you sleepless nights? By the grace of God, the anointing of the Holy Spirit will break the yoke in Jesus name. \nFor instance a woman who was declared to have no womb participated in an anointing service, the power of God touched her, a new womb was created in her and to the amazement of those who have declared she would be barren for life, she gave birth to a baby girl. \nThe Holy Spirit is our Comforter. When we come in contact with the Holy Spirit he comforts us. It restores whatever we may have lost. \nOur Lord Jesus said of the Holy Spirit in John 14 vs. 26 “ But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you”. \nThis is one reason why we should take anointing services by genuine men of God seriously. The anointing breaks all yokes. \nAre you unemployed and you have given up? Please don’t . The anointing of the Holy Spirit is available to make you an employer. Very soon, you will forget the pains of unemployment . \nAs Christians, we must connect with the Holy Spirit. \nIn whatever we do, we need the Holy Spirit to give us direction. With the Holy Spirit as our guide, we cannot take the wrong steps. \nHowever, obedience is crucial. Speaking about the importance of obedience in a sermon, Pastor Matthew Ashimolowo of Kingsway International Christian Centre (KICC), said obedience releases the blessings and grace of God. \nHe said as Christians, we should learn to take God by his word. “ God’s word does not agree with your reasoning”. \nIn other words, you must have a good knowledge of the Bible and identity the aspect that mentions God’s solution to your challenge. \nAs you connect with the anointing of the Holy Spirit, your testimony is certain. \nI end this article with a word of congratulations to Laughter Foundation International Ministry that marks its 20th anniversary with an anointing service today in Lagos.
