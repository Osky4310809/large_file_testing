AP Photo/Bullit Marquez \nMANILA, Philippines - Operatives of the elite police Special Action Force (SAF) have been tapped to run after scalawags in the Philippine National Police (PNP). \nPNP chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa yesterday reassigned one company or about 70 SAF commandos to the PNP Counter-Intelligence Task Force (CITF), the unit formed to rid their organization of officers involved in nefarious activities. \n“They will conduct tactical offensives against police scalawags,” Dela Rosa said. \nAside from SAF commandos, other members of the CITF are those from the PNP-Intelligence Group and Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), which will form the investigating arm of the unit. \nBefore they could settle into their new assignments, the PNP needs to clear the building formerly occupied by the PNP Anti-Illegal Drugs Group (AIDG), which Dela Rosa dissolved after some of their members were implicated in the kidnap-slay of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo in October last year. \nDela Rosa inspected the premises of the building including its parking lot where about 50 vehicles seized in anti-drug operations are parked.   \nThe PNP chief said he is finding ways to dispose of the seized vehicles to allow parking space for the CITF. \n“We will seek guidance from the courts on the disposal of these evidence,” he said. \nDela Rosa ordered the suspension of all anti-drug operations nationwide following the involvement of several policemen in Jee’s murder. \nHe ordered former members of the AIDG to move out of the building after receiving their new assignments. \n“They have to move immediately to vacate the offices that will be occupied by the CITF,” he said.
