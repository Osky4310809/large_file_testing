Steakhouse customer snaps viral photo of cockroach in her food   12:07   \nChewed up cockroach and sauteed spinach. Photo: Facebook/Vyna Girilawu 0 \nHolycow! Steakhouse by Chef Afit has once again been hit with a scandal involving a customer finding a dead animal in their food, this time the deceased creature being a cockroach. \nOn January 9, Facebook user Vyna Girilawu posted a now-viral long rant about her recent visit to a Holycow! outlet in Gading Serpong, Tangerang, which she said was marred by terrible service and the unforgettable experience of finding said cockroach in her food. \nIn her post, the self-professed Holycow! fan wrote she and her sister went for a meal at the restaurant. According to Vyna, their orders took so long to arrive that they had to ask their waiter three times before they finally came. And when they did, the steak was too tough “like a sandal” and they returned their meals. \nThe staff apologized and grilled new steaks for them, which turned out to be even tougher than the previous ones. Vyna and her sister once again returned their meals and then ordered different kinds of steaks, which, when they arrived, were still less than satisfactory but Vyna said she was done complaining. \nBut according to her, the culinary nightmare was far from over. When she took a bite out of the sautéed spinach side that came with the steak, she felt an unfamiliar crunch. Suspicious, she spat out the food and found that she had chewed on a dead cockroach. \nVyna said she took a photo of the chewed up cockroach despite some of the waiters trying to prevent her from doing so. She and her sister then left after paying for their meals to prove that she did not make up the story. She said that would be her last visit to a Holycow! restaurant. \nYesterday, Holycow! issued a statement on Facebook saying that they have apologized to Vyna and her sister for the incident and that they are carrying out a thorough investigation into the matter. They gave their assurance that all of their restaurants carry out routine pest control and quality checks on their food. \nVyna also mentioned in her post that Holycow! founder Chef Afit personally got in touch with her to apologize and even offered a refund, which she refused because she said she only wanted to share her experience for the consideration of others. \nThis is not the first time that Holycow! has been hit with a hygiene scandal. Last year, the restaurant chain apologized after a woman posted that she found a dead gecko inside a tiramisu dessert she ordered at one of their outlets. The company said that the dessert was provided by an outside supplier and they immediately cut off business arrangements with them following the scandal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T08:50:11.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
