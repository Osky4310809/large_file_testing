So, we asked IFBB figure pro Felicia Romero for the best exercises to help you get stronger, leaner and fitter. Here are her favorite exercises for women to get a full-body workout. 2 of 6 1. Arms \nCurls are one of the most popular arm exercises out there, yet they are also one of the least utilized by women. To get the best definition in your arms, do curls with 20–25 pounds. Then, immediately go into triceps extensions, making sure to keep your elbows close to your head. Do three sets of 15 reps. 3 of 6 2. Back \nClose-grip lat pulldowns are one of the most common back exercises but they’re frequently performed incorrectly. Using an underhand grip, slowly pull the bar down to your chest, making sure to keep your body and back straight with every rep. 4 of 6 3. Legs \nRomero's favorite leg exercise are plié squats. Make sure to keep your legs wide and your toes pointed outward. Lower into the squat until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor, and as you press up, squeeze your glutes and inner and outer thighs. To make them harder, try holding a weight between your legs. Do three sets of 20. Or, try this Goblet Squat as an inner thigh exercise variation.
