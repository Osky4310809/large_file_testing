I do not agree with the SNP that now is the time to be talking about a second independence referendum Theresa May \n\"The Tories' argument is not about process, it is about their desperate desire to prevent anyone having the chance to reject the hard right Brexit that they are so wedded to. \n\"The truth is it should not be for either Theresa May or the Scottish Government to decide Scotland's future - that choice belongs to the parliament and the people of Scotland, and it is one this party will never shy away from.\" \nDeputy First Minister John Swinney has also issued a stark warning to Westminster that Scots must not be denied the \"right to choose\" the country's future in a second independence referendum. GETTY May said it would it be ‘fundamentally unfair’ to hold a second Scottish independence referendum \nThe Scottish Government minister insisted that the \"kind of country we want to be\" was at stake as the SNP administration in Edinburgh and the Conservative Government in Westminster appeared to be on a collision course over the constitution. \nWhile First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has outlined plans to stage a fresh vote on independence between autumn 2018 and spring 2019, Mrs May intervened on Thursday to say \"now is not the time\" for such a ballot. \nToday, the Prime Minister will pledge to forge a \"more united\" nation as she begins the Brexit process. \nMrs May will stress that the break from Brussels will require \"one United Kingdom, all pulling together to get the best outcome\". \nShe will say: \"The coming negotiations with the EU will be vital for everyone in the United Kingdom. \n\"Every person, every family, every business, every community the length and breadth of the United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\" \nIt was \"essential that we get the right deal\" and that requires working together, she will say, adding: \"That is what we have always done when faced with challenges. GETTY Sturgeon outlined plans to stage a fresh vote on independence between autumn 2018 and spring 2019 \n\"We have pulled together as one and succeeded together. \n\"We are four nations, but at heart we are one people. \n\"And I will always ensure the voices and interests of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are represented as we negotiate to leave the EU. \n\"And I will always fight to strengthen and sustain this precious, precious union.\" Nicola Sturgeon's most outrageous quotes Mon, March 13, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:32:00.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
