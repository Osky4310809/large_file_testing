A visit to Athens to see the remnants of Greece's Acropolis is an absolute must. aslafoto/iStock Nearby, the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, an amphitheater that was built in the second century, is a stunning relic of the past. Music and theater performances are still held at the venue. Lagui/iStock Source: GR Reporter\nWhile in Athens, make a stop at its Central Market to experience the \"agora\" (marketplace), an integral part of Greek culture. It's a place for locals to stock up on fresh fish, meat, and fruit, and catch up on gossip. Baloncici/iStock Athens isn't the only place with gorgeous ruins. In Olympia, you can visit the site of the ancient Olympic Games, which date back to 776 B.C. Zarnell/iStock Source: Penn Museum\nTo see an entire region of beautiful old architecture, head to the Mani in Greece's Peloponnese, where stone houses are staggered across a hilly landscape. Nick Pavlakis/Shutterstock Or marvel at what's left of the ancient city of Sparta, in Laconia on Greece's Peloponnese. PanosKarapanagiotis/iStock And for a mixture of crumbling and modern architecture, the port city of Thessaloniki is a fun place to visit. It has a picturesque waterfront, loads of restaurants and bars, and a thriving student population. kyrsos/iStock Each of the Greek islands has its own distinct character. One of the most popular islands, Santorini, is known for its idyllic tiers of white-washed houses and phenomenal ocean views. iamjiere / iStock The town of Oia, on Santorini, has become particularly famous. It has a reputation as the ultimate place to go to watch the sun set. It's also the dreamy backdrop to Alexis Bledel's summer romance in \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.\" Freeartist / iStock The Greek islands have appeared in other movies, too. Kefalonia was used as the location for \"Captain Corelli's Mandolin,\" based on the book by Louis de Bernières. adisas/iStock They're also home to spectacular beaches. Zakynthos' Navagio Beach — sometimes called Shipwreck Cove thanks to the rusty ship sitting on its shore — is certainly a unique place to sunbathe. verve231/iStock Rhodes' Agios Pavlos Beach has some incredible views of the ruins in the ancient town of Lindos. John_Walker/iStock Crete's Elafonissi Beach is considered one of the best coastal stretches in Europe. Constantin Stanciu/Shutterstock Source: Business Insider\nThe fishing village of Kouloura on Corfu has a striking seafront. Calin Stan/Shutterstock While you're there, head to the town of Corfu (yes, it has the same name as the island it's on) for a dose of small town charm. Kite_rin/Shutterstock The Greek islands are full of natural treasures as well. On the island of Thassos, you can see your toes in the crystal clear water of Giola, a natural rock pool. SonicN/Shutterstock On Nisyros, adventurous travelers can literally climb into the crater of an active volcano (it last erupted in 1888). Sandro Pavlov/Shutterstock And if you're really into volcanoes, Milos is the island for you. A build-up of eroded volcanic rock has left parts of its coast looking almost other-worldly. Lefteris_/iStock If volcanoes are too risky, hike through Butterfly Valley, a nature valley on the island of Rhodes. naumenkophotographer/iStock Take a leisurely lunch at a taverna, like this one in Crete. Ask locals to find the best seafood taverna, pull up a chair (preferably with an ocean view), fill your plate with kalamari and grilled octopus, and order a Greek coffee to finish. mirc3a/iStock You'll also want to grab some souvlakia — grilled skewers of pork or chicken, often served tucked into pita with salad. roxx0r/iStock And for dessert, pick up some loukoumades, syrupy fried dough balls usually sprinkled with cinnamon and nuts. Gary Stevens/Flickr After all that eating, walk down cobblestone streets — like this one on Mykonos — and pass by whitewashed houses with colorful doors. ZoltanGabor/iStock While you're in Mykonos, don't pass up the ultimate Instagram opportunity: the island's windmills at sunset. Jeremy Binger/iStock Many of Greece's churches and monasteries are well worth visiting — like the Monastery of Agios Savvas on Kalymnos. Anna_Jedynak/iStock There's even a cluster of monasteries 1,300 feet high in Meteora, in mainland Greece. baldas1950/iStock Source: Slate\nAnd there are tons of cool castles. This fortress, on the tiny island of Spinalonga near Crete, is just one example. slava296/iStock If you end up souvenir shopping, try to support local artisans and pick up a handmade memento, like these hand-painted ceramic plates. Anna Dudek/iStock To fully immerse yourself in Greek culture, go to a live bouzouki (Greek guitar) performance. Zoran Milosavljevic/Shutterstock And check out a Greek dancing show, like this one in the town of Pefkohori in mainland Greece. If you're feeling brave, you could even give it a go. Opa!
