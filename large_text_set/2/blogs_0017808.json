Winter is coming to a close, and while it's still a sports wasteland, at least things like hockey, the NBA and (especially) college basketball start to mean something. This year, large parts of the U.S. have been blessed with a relatively warm winter, with some places seeing one of the warmest Februarys on record . \nBut what we're experiencing must not be as warm as wherever they shot the 2017 Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition, where it was apparently so hot that cover model Kate Upton decided even a bikini top was too much clothing. \nI somehow missed this video, as it came out on Valentine's Day and seems to have flown under the radar. You probably spent the day/evening with your girlfriend and maybe even saw her boobs, which is nice and all, but they aren't as nice as Kate Upton's boobs because basically no one's are. \nI've noticed that SI makes two types of swim videos, and this is the first kind: b-roll footage of the model in a bunch of swimsuits and/or varying states of undress, set to music. The other kind features some of that, sure, but they also have a lot of cuts of the model talking about how \"rewarding\" it is to be paid to take pictures in tropical places (no argument here), or (God forbid) how \"difficult\" a shoot was. \nI'm not saying one's better or more valuable than the other, but I know which ones get more views on YouTube... Drop This Fact \nThe swimsuit issue isn't just a boon to advertisers — bikini and jewelry designers whose items are featured in the special issue also experience a major boost in sales.
