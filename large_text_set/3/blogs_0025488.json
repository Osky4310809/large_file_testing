Free Fishing Days are the perfect time to take the kids fishing or try it out for yourself as you can fish on public property without a fishing license. Head here to see which days are free in your state.\nNote that some locations will even have free trailers set up during these special free fishing days, with fishing rods and tackle you can use free of charge – check your state’s fish & game website as well for more details.\nAnd be careful not to get a fish hook in the head !
