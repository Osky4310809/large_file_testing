He is ready to take internal flights to extend talks with interested clubs. \nAlthough no deal has yet been struck, Rooney has been told he can leave United by next Tuesday’s Chinese Super League transfer deadline if Stretford can clinch a deal for his client there, writes Mirror Football's David McDonnell. \nStretford is understood to be talking to a series of clubs but recognises he needs to meet a string of criteria for his client and United to make a deal happen.
