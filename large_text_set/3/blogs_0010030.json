I have no idea if he will stay. We will have to wait until the end of the season for that. Wenger has spoken of his dept to Wenger (Photo: Getty) \n“But it is a fact that Arsene has made Arsenal into one of the biggest – and wealthiest – clubs in Europe in 20 years at the club. \n“There is no reason why he should not be given the chance to build another team. He has more than earned that ­opportunity. \n“But if he does decide to stay, there needs to be a big change at the club. They need to start spending the millions that Arsene has made for them. \n“There HAVE to be new ­players coming in to make them a team capable of ­challenging for titles. \n“How many new players? If Arsene stays, he must bring in six or seven. Yes, that many. Wenger is under more pressure than ever...

The team and the squad needs proven players of proven ability. \n“The current squad have quality, but they do not have the ­quality to win ­important ­titles. \n“There is plenty of skill there and, when things are going well, they can be fantastic to watch. \n“The problem comes when things are not going well. \n“They do not have the strength to ­respond. It has been the same story every season for some time now – and the fans deserve more. \n“They play high, high prices to watch the matches there – probably more than anyone else in the Premier League. \n“And they should be seeing top ­players with the money that is now at the club.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:30:26.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
