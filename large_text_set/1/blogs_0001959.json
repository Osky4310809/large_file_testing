Throughout the first half of the game, former OSU quarterback Cardale Jones got increasingly frustrated with the Buckeyes’ play calling. \nIt started like this: \nOk, if we don't get points on this drive, I'm turning this off\n— Cardale Jones (@Cardale7_) January 1, 2017 COME O \n— Cardale Jones (@Cardale7_) January 1, 2017 Anyone have the number to that sideline phone? \n— Cardale Jones (@Cardale7_) January 1, 2017 Then, Jones said during halftime that from now on, the offense should just use the Ask Madden button, the button in the EA Sports game that lets the computer pick your play for you.\nThey need to go in the locker room, turn on the PS4, pop in Madden 17 & hit every play since this play calling has went MIA!!\n— Cardale Jones (@Cardale7_) January 1, 2017 Now Cardale has done this before. Most recently, during this year’s Michigan-Ohio State, he was unhappy about the way that OSU’s offense called plays based on UM’s defensive alignment. \nJones has been active on social media since his days as Ohio State’s signal caller. One of his most memorable and hilarious moments on Twitter was after he tweeted that he was at Ohio State to play football, not \"play school.\" He caught some heat for that, so he changed his tune .\nHe also once famously tried to tweet his way into a date with UFC star Ronda Rousey , which was unsuccessful. \nStay tuned for potentially more Cardale Twitter rants about OSU’s offense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T04:29:23.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
