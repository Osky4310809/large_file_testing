They think he’s shot. I’d put that number around 20 percent,” the anonymous NFL executive said. \n“Second, some teams fear the backlash from fans after getting him. They think there might be protests or Trump will tweet about the team. I’d say that number is around 10 percent. Then there’s another 10 percent that has a mix of those feelings. \n“Third, the rest genuinely hate him and can’t stand what he did (kneeling for the national anthem),” the source continued. “They want nothing to do with him. They won’t move on. They think showing no interest is a form of punishment. I think some teams also want to use Kaepernick as a cautionary tale to stop other players in the future from doing what he did.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:21:40.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
