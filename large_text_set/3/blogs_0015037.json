New Cast Meet the two new Stranger Things cast members (Photo: Netflix) \nTwo new cast members have been announced for the new series. The newcomers include Dacre Montgomery, an Australian actor who will appear in the new Power Rangers movie, and Sadie Sink from American Oyssey. \nIt's rumoured that Montgomery will play the role of Billy, an older brother to Max, who will be played by Sadie Sink. \nThe 80s casting theme also continues as other latest additions include Sean Astin, Paul Reiser and Linnea Berthelsen. Both Astin and Reiser were part of hit movies during the decade including the Goonies and Aliens. For more please follow the link on the new Stranger Things cast . Who is Paul Reiser? \nYou might know him from 90's comedy Mad About You or Aliens, but now he's set to play Dr Owens. A higher-up at the Department of Energy. Who does Sean Astin play? The Goonies starring Jeff Cohen, Sean Astin, Corey Feldman and Ke Huy Quan (Photo: Rex) \nHe plays Bob Newby, Radio Shack employee, and Joyce's new man. There's love in the air \nDavid Harbour, who plays Chief of Police Jim Hopper, has let the cat out of the bag about an exciting new character's role. \nWe already reported that Sean Astin – who brings even more 80s kudos to the show as he was Mikey in cult film The Goonies – will join the cast. \n\"We have Sean Astin... he's Winona's new boyfriend... much to the chagrin to the Chief of Police,\" David Harbour told Hollywood Life . David Harbour reveals season 2 plot details David Harbour (Photo: Netflix) \nHe also let slip further details about Will Byers' return home. \n'\"It's a year later in the story, so there are several things that happened last year, like Will has come back,\" he said. \n\"There are certain people in the town that know what happened, and then certain people that don't know what happened. \n\"So there's a lot of fall out with who knows what.\" \nThere's also justice for Barb. It's a sequel not a new story \nSpeaking about what’s next for the series, Matt Duffer indicated that the follow-up is better described as a “sequel” than a “second season”. \nProducer Shawn Levy said: “The plan is to continue with this set of characters while introducing a few critical key new ones next season,” he told SlashFilm . Stranger Things Season 2 Trailer (Photo: Netflix) \n“So I’ll just say that a lot of the big mysteries get answered at the end of Season 1, but we are very much kind of unearthing new problems and questions that merit future stories and future investigation in the most enjoyable way. So we are in love with our cast and our characters. \n“Things end up being resolved to some extent at the end of Season 1, but not entirely. \n\"And that’s why we’re so hopeful we get another few seasons to live with these people a little longer.” Eleven is alive (Photo: Maarten de Boer/Getty Images) \nIn an interview David Harbour, who plays chief Hopper, revealed the Eggo waffles he leaves in a box at the end of Season One ARE for Eleven. \nHe said: \"He (Hopper) may understand that Eleven exists in some form. And so he’s got this box out in the woods where he gives her food.\" Read More Search Stranger Things on Amazon Read More Hopper is up to something Hooper is definitely up to something (Photo: Youtube/The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon) \nImmediately after the rescue we watched him willingly get into a car with two suits from the Hawkins National Laboratory. But during the closing montage, set a month later, he and Joyce seem perfectly fine indicating he has helped or is helping with a secret project. There are too many unanswered questions Winona Ryder still looks pretty worried \nWhere has the slug that Will coughed up gone? What does it mean for him? It's like Alien when John Hurt is attacked by the facehugger but later seems fine. There is more to come on Sarah Hopper's cancer \nActor David Harbour has said : \"The Duffers and I talked a lot about that backstory, and even where her cancer came from and Hopper’s guilt around the whole situation. \n\"There is more onion to be peeled back in terms of Hopper’s backstory and what he’s been through. And his daughter’s cancer was a lot more complex than what it seemed.\" (Photo: Netflix) They've already got the format sorted \nSpeaking at the Television Critics Association in Los Angeles , the brothers behind the series, Matt and Ross Duffer, said a second series would follow a similar format of eight/nine instalments running for between 45 and 55 minutes. (Photo: Netflix) Upside Down \nThe second season and maybe a third will focus much more on what goes on in the Upside Down. \nThe creators have a 30-page document that answers all the questions about the Upside Down. \nRoss Duffer said: \"The plan in that second season is to get into more of those questions, like why there was only one monster and what the Upside Down is exactly. \n\"We have all those answers and didn’t feel like they were necessary to answer this season.\" More strong females \nIn an interview Matt Duffer said he wanted the female characters to have \"a strong drive and give them badass moments\". \nAdding: \"That was something that was very important to us and we would do well to keep doing moving forward.\" Barb ain't coming back Shannon Purser as Barb in Stranger Things (Photo: Netflix) \nMatt Duffer has confirmed she was killed and was always going to be from the outset of their pilot script. \nAsked if she was coming back, he told IGN: \"I can't see it happening.\" \n\"Barb will not be forgotten,\" he said. \"We'll make sure there's some justice for Barb. People get very frustrated, understandably, that the town doesn't seem to be really dealing with Barb. That stuff is all happening. We're just not spending any screen time on it.\" \nNetflix has recently released a mock news report on Barb's last known location and also discusses a shoplifting incident. The news reporter describes a juvenile who escaped the store with an unprecedented amount of eggo waffles. Not sure who that could be.
