In all, we are graduating 180 in the combined convocation ceremonies tomorrow (today). \nThe Professor of Economics noted that the Catholic-owned University aims to provide all round quality education to Nigerians, especially the poor, adding that despite the incessant increment in the cost of running the institution; standards would not be compromised as the church is providing the necessary subsidy. \nAt a pre-convocation lecture, the former Governor of Cross River State, Mr. Donal Duke, asked Nigerians to excercise more faith in God as a means of solving the myriads of challenges facing the nation. \nSpeaking on the theme of the lecture,“We the creatures and the Lord of all creation”, Mr Donald Duke, lamented the increasing lack of faith by man in the affairs of God. \nThe former governor said, “In this wise, ants, creatures we dismiss and describe as the least of creatures in creation have proven to be smarter and more attune with the will of the Almighty than the human specie. \nDuke said that no event in the world can take God by surprise and drew attention of the audience to some of the recent events which defied world’s expectation because God wanted them to go a different way to prove a point. \nRecalling some political events which defied the odds particularly the emergence of Yahaya Bello as governor of Kogi State and the elections of Barrack Obama and Donald Trump as Presidents of United States as a message from God, Duke asked rhetorically “If we are not of faith as human beings gifted with intellect, shouldn’t we at least ponder these events?” He urged the graduating students not to settle for less by being mere onlookers, adding that they must strive to be change agent by trusting in God whose ways differ from the ways of men. \nThe convocation lecture attracted dignitaries from far and near including the Chancellor of the University and Archbishop of Abuja Catholic Archdiocese, John Cardinal Onayeikan, Pro-chancellor of the institution, Archbishop Anthony Obinna, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, among others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T20:34:45.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
