It includes content from more than 100 accounts, like the White House press secretary’s @PressSec Twitter feed. The archive spans eight platforms including Instagram and Pinterest, according to Anil Chawla, CEO of ArchiveSocial, the company running the platform. Story Continued Below \n“The White House social media archive tells the story not just of how we’ve used these platforms to engage with people wherever they are, but also of how the digital landscape has changed over the past eight years,” White House Director of Product Management Joshua Miller said in a blog post. \nIt’s the White House’s latest effort to preserve the digital product of Obama’s presidency, during which social media has exploded as a force in politics and campaigning. In addition to the social archive, the White House has said it will ensure Obama-era photos and video will be preserved by the National Archives and Records Administration, as well as the content on the We The People petition platform, which Obama created in 2011. \nAs part of the presidential transition — the first to occur since the White House became active on social media — President-elect Donald Trump will obtain access to White House accounts on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms on Inauguration Day. The accounts will retain their followings — the @POTUS Twitter handle has more than 11 million followers — but will start with no content on the timelines, the White House previously said . \nIn addition to the social media archive, the White House announced a handful of projects undertaken by companies, universities and other groups built on social posts from the Obama White House. GIPHY, a search engine for GIFs, has launched a page that assembles all GIFs shared by the White House as well as others related to the president. In a separate effort , a Twitter bot will “relive” White House and Obama tweets in real time, eight years after they were first posted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:21:10.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
