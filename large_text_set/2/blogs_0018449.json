One of them ready with a whole pitch on what their new venture should be called. He asks his partner to imagine a sportsman at the end of his match, grasping and grappling for that last ounce of energy to get him through. And then, an almost miraculous last burst of energy surges through his body, and with an exhale he manages to push through and give it all he's got. Literally. \nThat's the compelling power of a sport. Almost poetic, isn't it? Yeah, the guy in the driver's seat was sold too, and all it took was a comical phone call with a lot of exhaling to win over the third. And so, Exhale Sports was born. \nLet's introduce the players: Uday Jhala, Kanishk Sinha, and Shiv Burman. \n\"If any of the productions look particularly weak, that's on me,\" laughs Uday, who is the Chief Strategy Officer. He worked at NDTV for a number of years, went to film school in New York, and also dabbled in production with his little production company. \"But I realised that it was mostly controlled by client briefs and didn't really allow for any creativity, so it wasn't a very happy playing ground.\" \nKanishk is the adman, the creative guy. In a career spanning almost 10 years, he worked everywhere from Dentsu to JWT to TBWA to finally Samsung's in-house agency. Says Kanishk, \"People don't read ads anymore. If the product looks stunning that's all they care about, and taglines are remembered only when they are repeatedly enforced. Headlines were my skill, and when I found out that nobody reads them, well…\" After working with companies in sectors ranging from automobile and FMCG to technology and sports apparel, Kanishk realised that traditional advertising is dying and everything is moving to social media. “So now I’m the Chief Creative Officer of Exhale. Our jobs go hand-in-hand, creative and execution.” \nAnd then there’s the CEO, Shiv Burman. “I started out in the business of sports with Kings XI Punjab as part of a two-person team. Since it was also a startup at that point, I got to be part of everything, which gave me a great understanding of the sports business and also the commercial aspect of how sports media works,” he explains. After that, he headed sales for Stepathalon, a mass participation sport coupled with online engagement. So he started thinking about opportunities in mainstream sports wherein he could engage both sets of learnings. “Stepathalon was an online engagement portal and had some 100k people we had to keep engaged all the time. Not only do you have to make it happen but also sustain it, which is the hard part. After researching a lot I realised that the future is in sports technology and digital sports media, and since I don’t have a tech bone in me, sports media it was.” Exhale Sports – What it is and what it does \nLike most good plans between friends, it all started over a drink (or three) discussing potential business ideas. “This was while we were still working at our respective jobs, and I would just throw ideas at Kanishk before settling on one.” says Shiv. And with Uday, he was a passionate fan and follower of sports, with production skills to boot. “We always had these intellectual conversations around the culture of sports, what it means to a fan, and so on.” It was an obvious fit, and he didn’t need much convincing. \n“There’s great content for fans in the West that creates loyalty and has a great emotional connect, which was missing here. Brands like Viral Fever were getting this emotional connect in different genres as well as getting brand integration in an authentic and intelligent manner, and we wanted to do that in the arena of sports,” explains Shiv. \nUday adds, “Initially, we thought it was going to be a digital social media agency for sports teams and athletes, but that was not our expertise and what we felt passionate about. More than anything, what we felt was lacking was a platform that could bridge the gap between a fan and a team you follow on TV -- an emotional gap. America and England have a great fan culture/lad culture that revolves around sport. We wanted to create a platform that’s a destination for people to start a conversation or debate about anything.” \nThat’s the beauty of sports, after all. It’s so objective that everybody can have their own opinion and be right in it too. And so, with the understanding that their expertise was not in handling a Twitter account but in creating that culture led by video, they marched on. Who the audience is \n“For us, sports was beyond the score line, and that is also true for a certain section of fans -- the evolved sports fans, if you may. The score does matter, but this kind of fan appreciates the game the opponents played, as well as the larger picture. Therein lies the difference. In India, the focus is still on cricket, and within that on a few star players, but we're witnessing a change in the fans from the frontlines,” says Shiv. \nOne of the ways they engage these fans is by starting conversations posing a question like, ‘Who would you have open in the ODIs?’ “Some comment with just names, and some give proper reasons backing their choices. That’s evolution right there,” he adds. \nAt first, they were their own target audience, Kanishk tells me. “We had this noble intention of creating content that people like us would appreciate because after we met people and went through blogs and websites, it fortified our conviction about the gap. So we figured let’s give it a shot by creating content that we would enjoy,” says Uday. But along the way, they kept adapting and evolving keeping their audience in mind, knowing their likes and dislikes, and trying not to be close-minded about anything as long as there’s a balance. “The one overriding thing about sports is emotion. That’s what we want to tap into. I was talking to Sunil Chettri and he told me that if you meet a kid who plays a sport and one who doesn’t, you can instantly tell. It’s not about the physique or anything, but just the approach to life and camaraderie that comes through. We want people to go out and not just say it’s a good piece of content, but we aspire to inspire people to want to play a sport and join a team and really get involved,” he says with feeling. The creative process \n“What we enjoyed doing, what we thought would do the best, what actually did the best, they're all different answers. But it's been non-stop learning along the way,” says Uday. One series that they are collectively proud of is called Desi Sports. The first one focused on the ancient sport of Mallakhamba . Considering the insane beauty, athleticism, dedication and commitment, they felt like it was a travesty that people don’t know about it and it isn’t appreciated. \nThen there was the Virat Kohli rap that took them a day to shoot, but went viral and got them 10 times the number of views. “You just can’t have a single-minded conviction about what’s going to do well. We have a fair idea now but even then it’s a hit and miss. But we want to still do stuff that we’re not comfortable doing or we think might not even work only to try it out, test the audience,” he says. \nShiv puts it in a different way. “Like any interesting personality, there’s a deep side and a fun, frivolous side as well and we want to be that person as a brand. Deep emotion side by side with banter, trash talk, and everything else.” \nThey also have a series called Perfection Of The Craft that focuses on what goes on in an athlete's mind in that make or break moment. “When we were thinking about how to approach this one, we mentioned it to someone and he said, ‘What does he really do? He just picks up a gun, aims, and shoots -- is that really a big deal?’ We were taken aback and immediately knew we had to break the misconceptions. A pro shooter like Abhinav Bindra lives like a yogi, doesn’t drink or smoke, all because his hands cannot shake. He controls his breathing and heart rate so much that he’s not breathing when he's taking aim. His heart is slowed to such a pace that it is between beats that he takes the shot. It’s incredible,” explains Jhala. What it’s like \nWhile the creative forces are flexible on how they need to get stuff done, there is definitely a structure in terms of what and when. “ It’s a very high intensity space because you have to keep pushing out content ALL the time, because people are on Facebook ALL the time. In that sense, we’ve created a structure that allows us to push out content every day,” says Kanish about working in this space. Also, he explains that the life span is short as compared to other mediums. “The Virat rap did so well for us, got us media coverage, and then 4 days later, it was done. You have to keep moving forward. That’s the most difficult thing – to find a consistent voice and be continuously original,” he explains. \n“We’re different from other sports media companies in that their prime focus is news; we are sports entertainment. I met this guy for work and the Pro Kabbadi League was on TV – and just like that, even though neither of us really follow it, we started having a discussion. It’s just how it is. If you’re a guy and there’s a conversation about sports you want to be part of it. So we’re constantly trying to create content around the conversation guys have all the time anyway,” adds Shiv. And finally some advice \nStarting a business is tricky. Doing it with friends is even trickier. “On the plus side, you share a level of comfort you wouldn’t with anyone else, but you risk getting too comfortable. It has to be a conscious decision about dividing your personal and professional space. In our case it helps that our specific skill sets take us away from each other and we come together to do what we love, which is brainstorm,” says Kanishk. \nMutual respect seems to be an important part of this equation. “Emotional attachment can be a pitfall because sometimes you don’t know how to say things to your partners who also happen to be your friends. We also share the same social circle, so it’s tough to bitch about your colleagues!” laughs Shiv. But Jhala shares the most useful tip of all, when he says, “If you’re starting something with friends, make sure it’s an odd number because then stuff just gets resolved over a vote.” \nAnd finally when I ask if it was tough taking the leap, they all agree that it just happened. “We were very optimistic, but the hardest part is quitting a job. At the end of the month when that salary SMS comes… I mean, I’m still waiting for that SMS!” quips Kanishk. \nBut you can see that he would not trade places with the guy behind the desk, even for that end-of-the-month SMS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:45:19.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
