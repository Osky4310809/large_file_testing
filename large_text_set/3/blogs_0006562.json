They have steadfastly refused to notice anything about Sharia that is oppressive or destructive to the human spirit.\nJeva Lange writes in The Week:\nAlleged “honor killings” are a major concern of opponents of the U.S. refugee programs, although supporters of refugee programs say the language demonizes Muslims and that there is insufficient evidence of such killings by refugees in the United States.\n“Demonizes Muslims”? This is just more Leftist hysteria. In reality, the new version of the immigration ban maintains that the first version was “not motivated by animus toward any religion,” and doesn’t associate honor killings with Islam. Lange is concerned, however, about comments from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the target of the Leftist establishment’s latest attempt to demonize and destroy members of the Trump team:\n[Sessions] has expressed concern about honor killings in the past, such as in a 2016 discussion with a State Department official.\nIn that discussion, Sessions noted:\nTwenty-seven people were killed in the United States for honor killings according to a DOJ report.\nObama State Department official Simon Henshaw replied:\nI have no evidence that there were any honor killings among the refugee population resettled in the U.S., sir.\nSessions:\nWell, it’s from the same cultural background, I would say.\nLange then Quote: d Farhana Khera of Muslim Advocates claiming that while Sessions was in the Senate, he was:\n ... one of the most, if not the most, anti-immigrant senator in the U.S. Senate. … He has a long record of demonizing non-white immigrants, especially Muslim and Latino immigrants.\nWhile making these utterly baseless charges that Sessions is a racist, Khera was apparently silent about the reality of honor killing. (Lange doesn’t mention the fact that it was Khera who wrote to John Brennan in 2011 demanding that all mentions of Islam and jihad be removed from counterterror training materials. Brennan immediately complied.) Was Sessions correct when he noted that immigrants “from the same cultural background” as those who have committed honor killings in the U.S. might share a positive view of the practice, and even resort to it themselves in extreme circumstances?\nTo answer that question, it is useful to know that Muslims commit 91 percent of honor killings worldwide -- and they do so with justification for their actions in Islamic law .\nhttps://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2017/03/07/trumps-new-immigration-order-creates-database-of-honor-killings/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://theweek.com/speedreads/684162/trumps-new-executive-order-requires-log-honor-killings", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states"], "published": "2017-03-07T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:46:05.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
