He made quick work of tearing apart the crowd, saying, “Yes if a Walmart could vomit, this is what it would look like. It’s like a pickup joint for seniors. Last time I saw this much white hair, Madonna was getting out of a limo without panties.” He continued to poke fun at many of the people he saw. The Bikers for Trump, he noted, were clearly not riding exercise bikes, and he called the Trump sons “less motivated Menendez brothers.” Triumph was able to find common ground among people with differing views at the inauguration by asking them to proclaim their love for Betty White. He taped their exclamations of “Betty White Forever” and “Betty White Power,” but sadly, each “Betty” was cut from the recording. Conan airs weeknights at 11 p.m. on TBS.
