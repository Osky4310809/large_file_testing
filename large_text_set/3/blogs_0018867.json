While we love to cover all aspects of pop and geek culture, our roots lie in the comics community and the plethora of characters and stories that have sprung from it. \nIf you speak with anyone in the comics community about what has made the medium successful in North America, you’ll quickly discover one answer that stands far above the rest: local comics stores. They are the bedrock of comics in the United States and Canada, supporting fans, communities, and conventions with open doors and a dedicated staff. \nThis year on ComicBook.Com we are highlighting this important aspect of comics and culture by taking a look at one local comic store each week. These are stores that embody what it means to support culture and community. We hope you can visit some of them throughout 2017. \n\nHow do you change a stereotype? That’s a challenge most comics stores face, at least all of the ones that don’t actively perpetuate the misperception of comics shops as basement-like dwellings filled with knick knacks and boxes of comics exclusively for social outcasts. It’s not the truth of the medium or many of its purveyors, but it’s what is shared in the zeitgeist. This is the issue that Richard Neal, owner of Zeus Comics and Collectibles, was forced to confront when he first opened his shop in 2000. \nNeal says that at the time many of the direct market stores had, “morphed into places that fit the stereotype mocked on the Simpsons.” \nThat’s not what he wanted from his own place of business though. \nThe storefront that Neal imagined was something more like that of the Disney Store where anyone could pass by, become interested, and feel welcome to walk in and explore. “I envisioned making comic shops look and feel modern” says Neal. \nThis was the foundation that built a store which which would win an Eisner Award less than a decade later in 2006. While Neal is proud of the recognition brought by Eisner and notes it as a highlight of his time running Zeus, it’s not the only thing he is proud of. In the 10 years since they received the award the store has continued to evolve, as it tried new things in order to benefit comics fans both new and old. \nAt some point along the way Neal’s approach to running the store changed. He stopped using the phrase “my customer” and began to look at everyone who entered the shop as part of a shared community of friends in fandom. He subscribes to the maxim now printed on t-shirts from Image Comics that “Comics are for everyone” and carries ensures that this is apparent every day Zeus is open to the public. Neal says, “Every day at the comic shop is like throwing a party and I'm the host.” \nClick ahead to see how Neal’s dream of a modern storefront evolved into something even more significant, as it became part of his community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:58:28.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
