Disney has already said it will make a live-action version of \"Mulan\" in 2018, but if these remakes keep doing well, there's no reason to believe Disney will stop making them. \n\"We believe Disneyâ€™s library IP lends itself to similar live action reboots, improving the visibility of revenue growth for the Studio, a major structural advantage relative to other major studios,\" DiClemente wrote. He thinks Disney's string of animated hits in the 80s and 90s can be look at as an \"attractive source of fairly predictable Studio revenue\" in the coming years. \nNostalgia will give Disney a boost, especially relative to its competitors, if it becomes harder to get people into movie theaters. \nHere's a list of titles Nomura-Instinet thinks Disney will consider:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:53:53.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
