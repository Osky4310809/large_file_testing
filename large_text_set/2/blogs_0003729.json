The website says it “contains content deemed too controversial for TV.”\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo2B-vjZ28&w=640&h=390]\nThe website provided by the company appeared to be having some problems, but the full ad was also available on YouTube.\nThe spot posted online runs a little under 6 minutes and shows construction workers erecting a structure. The mother and daughter are then shown coming upon a towering wall, and appearing defeated. As it turns out, the workers were building a massive wooden gate in the wall, and the mother and daughter push through it to cross into the other side.\nRelated Super Bowl 2017 ads aim to bridge divisive political climate: ‘This is the big united game’ A dynasty like no other: Patriots pull off biggest comeback in Super Bowl history The ad ends with the words, “The will to succeed is always welcome here.”\nWhile a few other advertisers hit on relatively safe themes of inclusiveness, the spot by 84 Lumber appeared to take a more direct stand against President Donald Trump’s promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0Uk6ctu7nI&w=640&h=390]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:17:43.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
