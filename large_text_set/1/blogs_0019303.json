PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sun, Jan 22, 2017 GETTY Donald Trump hopes to play golf with the Queen on his first state visit \nDonald Trump’s team are hoping he can play at least one hole with her on the Scottish estate’s nine-hole course as he seeks to create a photo opportunity to rival the images of Ronald Reagan riding with the Queen at Windsor Castle in 1982. \nThe plans were discussed at a meeting last week with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and his deputy Sir Alan Duncan in Downing Street. Related articles Melania, Ivanka and Tiffany Trump dazzle in ball gowns \nAmong other requests put forward by Mr Trump’s team include a dinner at Blenheim Palace, where Winston Churchill was born, an address to both Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall, and tea at Buckingham Palace. \nA source close to the President said Mr Trump wanted the visit, which could take place as early as June, to be “the full Monty”. \nMr Trump’s team were invited to put forward suggestions for the visit in a bid to build bridges after a testing spell in relations between the two countries. \nThe new President has repeatedly called for Nigel Farage to be made British ambassador in Washington. Boris and his team wanted to get inside the mind of Donald Trump Source \nHe is also said to be “unimpressed” by the behaviour of Mrs May’s top aides Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, who publicly criticised him on social media before they took up their posts in Downing Street. \nBritain wants to get Mr Trump on side to secure a post-Brexit free trade deal with the US and to shape his thinking on Nato, Syria and other foreign affairs issues. GETTY The President of the United States hopes to play at least one hole with the monarch at Balmoral \nThe source said: “Boris and his team wanted to get inside the mind of Donald Trump and get into what they described as ‘Trump think’ which is why they were asking for suggestions for the state visit. \n“It is also a sign of the importance with which they now regard striking a strong relationship with the new President who insists he can sign a trade deal with the UK within 90 days.” \nMr Johnson and his deputy were told to think about the biggest honour they could bestow on the President and then “go beyond it”. Donald Trump becomes 45th U.S. PRESIDENT Fri, January 20, 2017 The inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States will mark the commencement of the four-year term of Donald Trump as President and Mike Pence as Vice President. A public ceremony will be held on Friday, January 20, 2017, on the West Front of the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. REUTERS 1 of 40 US President Donald Trump points to the stands as he walks with his wife Melania during the Inaugural Parade. GETTY The plan was discussed at a meeting with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson \nThe source said: “He doesn’t want to do what Obama did during his state visit to the UK, he wants to go one better.” \nDuring Mr Obama’s last visit to the UK in April he had lunch with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor before making a controversial intervention in the EU referendum campaign, saying Britain would be at “the back of the queue” for a trade deal in the event of Brexit. \nBy contrast, Mr Trump has made clear that he is keen to secure a deal with Britain. He has also spoken affectionately about the Queen, saying in an interview last week that his Scottish-born mother was a big fan. \nMary Anne Trump was born on the island of Lewis. GETTY Nigel Farage is President Trump’s first choice for ambassador \nIt is thought Mr Trump would use any trip to Balmoral as an opportunity to visit his mother’s birthplace, where he still has relatives, including his cousin Calum Murray, who sent a message of congratulations to the new President on his election. \nMr Trump last visited the island in 2008 when he flew in on his private jet. \nAny visit to Balmoral in June would mark a break in protocol because the Queen does not normally depart for her Scottish summer residence until August.
