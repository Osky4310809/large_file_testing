King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 7 hours ago 4 \nButch Vig, whose lengthy list of production efforts includes the first two Smashing Pumpkins records, said that Billy Corgan is essentially 90% of all guitars and basses on those albums. \nDuring a Pensado's Place interview, Butch pointed out that Billy was simply superior to his bandmates in terms of musicianship, saying (via Alternative Nation ): \n\"Smashing Pumpkins were a great band. If you ever saw them live, theyâ€™re all badass players, but Billy Corgan is a better guitar player than James, and he's a better bass player than D'arcy. \n\"We would track a song, and we would record it trying to make sure we had a really good feel for it, but primarily I was listening to make sure we got a killer drum take by Jimmy Chamberlin. \n\"Then we would usually go back and overdub everything, and Billy was just better at redoing the guitars and bass. On both [1991's] ' Gish ' and [1993's] ' Siamese Dream ,' D'arcy and James played a little bit, but it's over 90% Billy, because he's a phenomenal musician. \n\"There was conflict - I think the band felt like, 'We are good enough to do it.' Like I said, D'arcy and James are amazing musicians. There were times when I would sit in the studio and give them the time to do that, and I would say at the end of the day, you can track a part, but I think Billy's going to want to come in, and I want to see if he can beat it. So at least they had an opportunity to do that. \n\"There were some times I chose D'arcy's part, or James, over Billy's. To say there was conflict in that band, that's not the only reason there was conflict. There were a lot of things pulling at Smashing Pumpkins. Somehow I made it through two album cycles with them. They were always on the verge of imploding.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:20:17.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
