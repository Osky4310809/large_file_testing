The climate change page is gone , as are a number of links referencing climate change. Featured instead is an “American First Energy Plan,” that regurgitates President Trump’s campaign promises as coherently as if it was written with literal regurgitated vomit:\nFor too long, we’ve been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years.\nThe key to Trump’s stance on environmental protection—other than simply not protecting the environment—is to put policies like Obama’s Climate Action Plan at odds with employment, a false binary that makes it seem like environmental regulations only hurt workers by taking away their jobs. Also, you know, workers presumably want to have a viable planet for their children, too. \nAdvertisement \n\nThe White House website always changes with the presidential transition, but the current absence of any mentions of climate change is in line with this administration’s new “soft denial” of climate change. Rather than calling it an all-out hoax, Mashable points out that Trump’s picks— EPA litigant Scott Pruitt to oversee the EPA, Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, and Department of Energy-skeptic Rick Perry for the DOE—all took evasive stances during their confirmation hearings when asked about climate change. Pruitt said human activity contributes to climate change “in some manner,” but a precise cause “is subject to more debate.” Tillerson echoed Pruitt’s sentiment, saying during his hearing that “Some literature suggests [human activity causes climate change]. There’s other literature that suggests it’s inconclusive.”\nLet us be clear: the overwhelming majority of scientists who study the matter agree that climate change is happening, and that human carbon emissions are the key driving factor.\nThis wishy-washy “let’s wait and see” take on climate change is a clear attempt to stall progress that allows Trump’s picks to come across as somewhat reasonable, at least in comparison to the shameless science denial Trump has peddled before. But, it’s just as dangerous, especially in tandem with the fallacy that regulating corporations always leads to job loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:25:25.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
