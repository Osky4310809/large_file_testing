(We’re low-key bummed about that, because we’re dying for a Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas red carpet debut, TBH.)\nUnsurprisingly, the 27-year-old looked gorgeous in a floor-length black gown with a plunging lace neckline. Complete with a short, curly hairstyle and light makeup, we’re a little mesmerized.\nAnthony Harvey/Getty Images Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images Nathalie has been no stranger to red carpets lately, and at the SAG Awards last month, she dropped a little teaser about Game Of Thrones ‘ upcoming seventh season .\n“I can tell you that this season somehow is going to blow everyone’s minds even more than the last…The momentum that we’ve been building up really kicks into gear,” she told E! News . “Storylines are happening and sort of combining and crashing together. It’s a very, very dynamic season. I’m really excited for people to watch it.”\nWe can’t wait!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:19:34.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
