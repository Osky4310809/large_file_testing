Rec David Luiz continues to be one of the most must-follow footballers on social media. Today he posted a cool video of himself and Willian practicing their free kicks for Nike. For some reason, they had the idea of setting up their pal Nathaniel Chalobah on the goal line to try to score over his head. A post shared by David Luiz (@davidluiz_4) on Mar 23, 2017 at 8:08am PDT While Willian’s curl was too much, Luiz struck a great strike right at Chalobah’s head (I’m sure the medical staff are loving this), thankfully he evaded the shot as it cannoned into the corner of the goal. A one-take masterpiece! However, there’s one Chelsea legend who’s not buying that and wants to see all the other takes that didn’t make the final cut: It’s great to see Frank Lampard on top of this great conspiracy and shinning a spotlight on the truth. Through all of his years of gaining wisdom it’s nice to see he’s acquired such a high level of social media wokeness.
