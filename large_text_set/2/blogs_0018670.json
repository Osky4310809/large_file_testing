A post shared by jason blanchard (@miniblanchard) on Feb 22, 2017 at 2:00am PST \nLosing your passport in a foreign country is never a good thing. It typically takes up to three days for a new passport to be issued, but it’s not always easy to get ahold of the U.S. Embassy and get them to work quickly. \nRELATED: 6 bad travel habits to quit right now \nSURFER Editor Todd Prodanovich is also with the crew in Portugal, and took to Instagram himself to voice frustration over the situation: \n“Ever wonder what happens when you lose your passport at the airport? Turns out immigration takes your phone, your shoelaces, and throws you in a cell for an indeterminate amount of time. Or at least that’s what is happening to @sealtooth right now on our trip to Portugal. Punishment seems a bit over the top, no? #FreeDane” \nNo word yet about how long Reynolds can expect to be held, but hopefully he can get a new passport issued soon and be on his way.
