Expect that to change in April. \nThe following is not a mock draft. No attention is paid to team needs. It simply is my personal ranking of the top 64 prospects, with at least a one-liner for every one of them. \nPlayers are listed by name, position, school, year, height, weight and 40-yard dash time \n1. Myles Garrett, DE, Texas A&M, Jr, 6-4, 272, 4.64 If possible, Garrett exceeded expectations at the combine, registering eye-popping numbers in every drill, including 33 repetitions at 225 on the bench press despite possessing 35.5-inch arms. Garrett’s production (33 tackles, including 15.5 for loss and 8.5 sacks) was way down in 2016 in comparison to his first two seasons (53-14-11.5 in 2014 and 59-19.5-12.5 in 2015) but that was due to a nagging ankle injury which robbed him of his trademark explosiveness. Garrett possesses an ideal blend of burst, bend and power off the edge, projecting as a future All-Pro regular. \n2. Solomon Thomas , DL, Stanford Cardinal , rSoph, 6-3, 273, 4.69 Thomas was the runaway winner of the Pac-12’s Morris Trophy as the most dominant defensive lineman in 2016 by a vote of the conference’s blockers. He was as impressive on a snap-to-snap basis as any prospect in the country in 2016, demonstrating the initial burst, power and advanced hand usage to earn comparisons to Los Angeles Rams star Aaron Donald . \n3. Jamal Adams, S, LSU, Jr, 6-0, 214, 4.56 It is easy to mistake Adams for former LSU Tigers star Tyrann Mathieu , given their similar instincts and highly aggressive playing style. Like Mathieu, Adams possesses the agility and speed to handle coverage duties on slot receivers, possesses soft hands for the interception and is a tenacious run defender. Adams’ kamikaze style of play can lead to occasional mistakes but he is always around the ball. Adams’ father was a former first-round pick of the Giants. USATSI \n4. Jonathan Allen , DL, Alabama Crimson Tide , Sr, 6-2, 286, 5.00 \nAllen slips two spots following a less-than-sterling workout but maintains his year-long perch as my top-rated senior prospect regardless of position. Capable of creating havoc while lining up inside or out, Allen reminds me a little of Seattle Seahawks ’ Pro Bowler Michael Bennett , winning with an explosive upfield burst and powerful, coordinated hands. \n5. Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State Buckeyes , rSoph, 6-0, 193, 4.36 The only thing more impressive than Lattimore’s performance at the combine (including his 4.36-second 40-yard dash and 11-foot broad jump) is his 2016 tape. A history of leg injuries will give teams pause but Lattimore is an easy athlete capable of blanketing receivers and shutting down half of the field. Lattimore impressed at the combine. USATSI \n6. O.J. Howard , TE, Alabama, Sr, 6-6, 251, 4.51 Howard is the most gifted pass-catcher in the Class of 2017. He was not featured at Alabama but was the best player on the field at the Senior Bowl and only built upon that momentum in Indianapolis, showing off a remarkable combination of size, speed and explosiveness (including a position-best 39-inch vertical and an 11-2 broad jump). \n7. Dalvin Cook , RB, Florida State Seminoles , Jr, 5-10, 210, 4.49 Cook was not as impressive as expected in shuttle drills, which makes his March 28 pro day workout one to watch. What timed tests cannot take into account are anticipation and vision, which make Cook a dynamic runner. Cook possesses soft hands out of the backfield, as well as the toughness and selflessness to block, making him a fit in today’s NFL offense. \n8. Malik Hooker, FS, rSoph, Ohio State, 6-1, 206, 4.47 Nicknamed “Malik the Freak” because his combination of size and athleticism stands out even among the talented Buckeyes, Hooker exploded onto the scene in 2016, finishing tied for second in the country with seven interceptions, while wowing with his instincts and sideline-to-sideline speed. Hooker only has one season as a starter and is prone to over-aggression as an open-field tackler but scouts are giddy about his upside. Unfortunately, Hooker missed the combine workouts, undergoing core muscle and labrum (hip) surgeries. Hooker jumps out on tape. USATSI \n9. Zach Cunningham , LB, Vanderbilt Commodores , rJr, 6-3, 234, 4.67 Listed 18th overall on my initial Big Board back in August, Cunningham only reinforced my opinion throughout the regular season that he warrants top-20 consideration. Instinctive, aggressive and athletic, Cunningham offers an exciting and versatile skill set sure to intrigue any creative defensive coordinator in the NFL. Cunningham led the SEC with 125 tackles in 2016 -- 22 more than he posted a year ago, when he earned All-SEC honors despite not starting until the fourth game. \n10. Derek Barnett , DE, Tennessee Volunteers , Jr, 6-3, 259, 4.88 Barnett deserves kudos for fighting through a virus to compete at the combine, showing the intangibles as well as the athleticism to justify this lofty ranking. His 6.96-second time in the three-cone drill was fourth fastest among 59 defensive linemen tested in Indianapolis and it wouldn’t be surprising to see his 40-yard dash time drop at his pro day, March 31. A more polished defender than even the top-rated Garrett, Barnett varies his attack, incorporating quickness, power and refined technique to wreak havoc against the run and pass, alike. His 33 sacks over the past three seasons led the country and he passed Reggie White in the Music City Bowl to be Tennessee’s all-time sack king. \n11. Mitchell Trubisky, QB, North Carolina, rJr, 6-2, 221, 4.67 Though the only 13 starts of his college career came in 2016, Trubisky is my top-rated quarterback in the class. As you’d expect given his limited experience, Trubisky is a work in progress reading defenses and he lacks ideal size. Trubisky grades very well in many of the areas that I believe to be the greatest indicators of future success at the NFL level, including mobility in and out of the pocket, arm strength and most importantly, accuracy to all levels of the field, which he demonstrated during solid workouts at the combine and his March 21 Pro day. Trubisky completed 68.2 percent of his passes in 2016 for 3,748 yards and tossed 30 touchdowns to just six interceptions in 2016. \n12. Leonard Fournette , RB, LSU, Jr, 6-0, 240, 4.51 Fournette tumbled down my board after a disappointing showing at the combine but will get a chance to boost his stock back up at his April 5 Pro day. The undeniably gifted back weighed in five pounds heavier than he played at LSU and his 28.5-inch vertical is further indication that he was out of shape, raising real questions about how seriously Fournette will take the challenge he is facing in the jump to the NFL. \n13. Reuben Foster , ILB, Alabama, Sr, 6-0, 229, 4.72 If Fournette’s combine performance was disappointing, Foster’s expulsion for an altercation (reportedly verbal) with a medical official during the medical checks is downright disturbing. Nick Saban’s quips won’t keep scouts from fully vetting Foster’s character. Like Fournette, Foster is an exceptional talent. He might be the most intimidating hitter in the entire draft and possesses the fluidity and speed to cover but like most teams, I’m more wary of players with character red flags than ever. \n14. Jabrill Peppers , SS/OLB, Michigan Wolverines , rSoph, 5-11, 213, 4.46 Whether at safety or linebacker on defense, wide receiver or Wildcat quarterback on offense or even punt returner until the coaches realize where he fits best, Peppers is one of the elite players in the 2017 draft. Jim Harbaugh and his staff at Michigan correctly identified that Peppers is an exceptional open-field tackler with the instincts and courage to attack, prompting the move to linebacker last season but he proved his ability to handle coverage duties earlier in his career and can make the transition back here in the NFL -- should that be what his future NFL team asks of him. Where does Peppers line up in the NFL? USATSI \n15. Haason Reddick , LB, Temple Owls , rSr, 6-1, 237, 4.52 Reddick starred as an undersized edge rusher for the Owls (recording 22.5 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks in 2016) but it was the agility and acceleration he showed playing off the ball in Mobile and during drills at the combine that has his stock skyrocketing. Reddick isn’t just a ridiculous athlete, he comes with a chip on his shoulder as a former walk-on. \n16. Ryan Ramczyk , OT, Wisconsin Badgers , rJr, 6-6, 310, 5.29 The Badgers are well known for producing quality offensive linemen but Ramczyk (pronounced Ram-check) comes with a unique backstory as a transfer from D-III Wisconsin-Stevens Point. Possessing uncanny agility and balance for a player of his size, Ramczyk possesses the versatility that appeals to zone-blocking schemes and was the most consistent pass protector I saw in 2016, his only at the D-I level. Ramczyk was unable to participate fully at the combine or his March 15 pro day after undergoing surgery to repair a torn labrum in his hip. \n17. Corey Davis , WR, Western Michigan Broncos , Sr, 6-3, 209, 4.48 With his FBS-record 5,212 career receiving yards (and 51 touchdowns), a prototypical frame and polished route-running there is a lot to like about Davis, the most well-rounded receiver in this class. A shoulder injury kept him from competing at the Senior Bowl and he missed both the combine and his March 15 Pro day after suffering an ankle injury during post-season workouts that required “minor” surgery. \n18. Marlon Humphrey , CB, Alabama, rSoph, 6-0, 197, 4.41 Teams prioritizing size and physicality like Humphrey, the son of former Alabama star and NFL first-round pick Bobby Humphrey (Denver, 1989). Just a redshirt sophomore, Humphrey remains a work in progress from a technique standpoint but he possesses the length (including 32 1/4-inch arms) that scouts covet, as well as top-notch athleticism and an aggressive mentality, including in run support. Humphrey’s dad was a first-round pick of the Broncos. USATSI \n19. John Ross , WR, Washington, rJr, 5-10, 188, 4.22 In precisely 4.22 seconds, Ross silenced critics who dared suggest that his 17 touchdowns this season were the result of Chris Petersen’s spread offense. For all of his game-breaking speed, however, Ross comes with plenty of medical concerns, including two surgically repaired knees and a torn labrum which will require surgery prior to the draft. If teams believe he can remain healthy over a full NFL season, however, the DeSean Jackson clone could wind up as the first receiver off the board this year. \n20. Christian McCaffrey , RB, Stanford, Jr, 5-11, 202, 4.48 Despite Stanford’s struggles, McCaffrey was every bit as dynamic as in past seasons -- quietly again leading the Pac-12 in rushing (145.7 yards per game) and all-purpose yards (211.5) in 2016 and therefore his splashy performance at the combine was no surprise. With his easy agility, instant acceleration and soft hands, McCaffrey reminds scouts of another former Pac-12 star, Reggie Bush . Like Bush, McCaffrey lacks the bulk to be a true bell-cow back at the next level but his ability as a returner and as a potential slot receiver add to his value. \n21. Cam Robinson , OT, Alabama, Jr, 6-6, 322, 5.15 As his monstrous size implies, Robinson can be a road-grader in the running game and his quickness and length can make him very effective in pass protection. He reminds me in many ways of recent early first-round picks Ereck Flowers ( New York Giants , No. 9 overall, 2015) and D.J. Fluker ( San Diego Chargers , No. 11 overall, 2013), each of whom are highly regarded by scouts, though often criticized by the media and fans. Robinson, honored as this year’s Outland Trophy winner, has starred at left tackle for the Tide since earning the job as a true freshman but his NFL future may be on the right side or even inside at guard. Robinson also comes with significant off-field concerns after an arrest prior to the season involving a gun and marijuana. \n22. Deshaun Watson , QB, Clemson Tigers , Jr, 6-2, 221, 4.66 Just as he did against Alabama in each of the past two national championship games, Watson shined under the bright lights of Indianapolis, showing surprising polish in the five- and seven-step drop throws that he rarely (if ever) attempted at Clemson and following this up with a solid showing at his March 16 pro day. He was the most accurate passer at the combine, which was a surprise for a quarterback who threw an FBS-high 30 combined interceptions over the past two seasons. Watson remains a polarizing prospect but his dual-threat talents and poise under pressure are undeniable. \n23. Mike Williams , WR, Clemson, rJr, 6-3, 218, 4.52 After a sluggish performance while running routes at the combine, Williams showed better than expected speed (4.51, 4.53 in the 40-yard dash on his two attempts) at his March 16 pro day, easing concerns about his ability to stretch the field. Scouts know that Williams is not a speedster -- his game is posting up cornerbacks and using his height and excellent body control to box them out to win contested passes. \n24. Charles Harris , DE, Missouri Tigers , rJr, 6-3, 253, 4.82 Harris looked better during his positional workout than in measured drills but performing at his best late in the process is nothing new for the two-time Second Team All-SEC pick, who recorded 30.5 tackles for loss (including 16 sacks) the past two seasons after first joining the sport as a junior in high school. Agile, physical and tough, the arrow is pointing up with Harris. \n25. Malik McDowell , DT, Michigan State Spartans , Jr, 6-6, 295, 4.85 McDowell’s highlight reel would be as impressive as any defensive lineman’s in this draft (including Garrett’s) but it his troubling tendency to disappear for long stretches and get nicked up with various injuries that have him ranked this low. If the light ever turns on, McDowell could be a monster. \n26. Takkarist McKinley , OLB/DE, UCLA Bruins , Sr, 6-2, 250, 4.58 McKinley is set to undergo shoulder surgery (torn labrum and broken glenoid) that could keep him sidelined through training camp but I am among those intrigued by his combination of length (34 3/4” arms) explosiveness and tenacity. McKinley recorded 10 sacks and 18 tackles for loss in just 11 games in 2016 and is not “just” a pass rusher, showing the awareness and closing speed to drop into coverage or spy mobile quarterbacks, as well. \n27. David Njoku, TE, Miami, rSoph, 6-4, 246, 4.64 Njoku is a gamble on sheer athleticism. Despite only starting five of 13 games for the Hurricanes in 2016, the redshirt sophomore emerged as one of the nation’s most productive tight ends, hauling in 43 passes for 698 yards and eight touchdowns. He will drop an occasional easy pass but his agility and acceleration are top notch for the position, helping Njoku project as a legitimate matchup nightmare in the NFL. \n28. Taco Charlton , DE, Michigan, Sr, 6-5, 277, 4.92 In a class loaded with exciting edge rushers, Charton’s upside stands out. A twitchy athlete with prototypical length, burst and bend off the edge, he registered a career-high 9.5 sacks in 2016 and scouts are optimistic that he may just be scratching the surface of his potential. \n29. Teez Tabor , CB, Florida Gators , Jr, 6-0, 199, 4.62 Tabor’s route awareness, agility and competitiveness stand out on tape but he ran poorly in Indianapolis, raising significant concerns about his ability to remain on the outside against the NFL’s speed merchants. Tabor’s given name is Jalen but he switched it prior to the season, an appropriate choice given the way he teases with big play potential. Tabor’s stock has taken a hit. USATSI \n30. Dion Dawkins , OG, Temple, Sr, 6-4, 314, 5.11 Dawkins starred at left tackle for the Owls but it was the power he showed when he slid inside to guard at the Senior Bowl that really caught my eye. Dawkins proved his strength at the combine, starring in the bench press with 26 repetitions despite possessing 35-inch arms. A battle-tested three-year starter capable of playing inside or out, Dawkins projects as one of the few relatively “sure things” among offensive linemen in this class. \n31. Garret Bolles, OT, Utah, Jr, 6-5, 297, 4.95 In terms of sheer athleticism and upside, Bolles is the most gifted tackle in this class and he plays with the brawler’s mentality that will appeal to offensive line coaches. He is a gamble, however, as Bolles only played one year at the FBS level and was protected inside by fellow NFL prospect Isaac Asiata , whom Pac-12 defensive lineman voted the top blocker in the conference. After spending two years working as a garage door repairman following high school, Bolles also enters the draft as a relatively older prospect (he turns 25 in July) and lacks the refined technique and football intelligence of most his peers. \n32. Chidobe Awuzie , CB, Colorado Buffaloes , Sr, 6-0, 202, 4.43 Awuzie has not generated as much national attention as his talent warrants. Perhaps that’s because he played for a team few outside of the West Coast watched until late in the year. He was an immediate standout for the Buffs, starting as a true freshman and earning second-team All-Pac-12 honors each of the past two years. Agile, instinctive and physical, Awuzie is arguably the top nickel corner in this class and has the length to play outside. Awuzie is rising up draft boards. Getty Images The Next 32: \n33. Patrick Mahomes, QB, Texas Tech, Jr, 6-2, 225, 4.80 A classic gunslinger with literally a MLB arm, Mahomes could wind up being the best of this quarterback class -- but he will need time to acclimate to a pro-style offense. \n34. Budda Baker , FS, Washington, Jr, 5-09, 195, 4.45 Whether as a nickel corner or centerfielder, Baker’s agility and ball skills deserve first-round consideration. Baker could wind up going in the first round. USATSI \n35. Dorian Johnson , OG, Pittsburgh Panthers , Sr, 6-5, 300, 5.27 Mr. Reliable among offensive line prospects as a former five-star recruit turned four-year starting left guard with the athleticism and length (35 1/4” arms) that project well to NFL. \n36. Fabian Moreau , CB, UCLA, rSr, 6-0, 206, 4.35 Silky-smooth cover corner with rare size who starred at the East-West Shrine Game and combine. Moreau shined in the East-West Shrine Game. USATSI \n37. DeShone Kizer , QB, Notre Dame Fighting Irish , rSoph, 6-4, 233, 4.83 Kizer possesses the arm, size and intangibles to project as a future starter (which makes him worthy of first-round consideration) but he showed a frightening lack of technique at the combine and needs to perform much better at his March 23 pro day. \n38. Evan Engram , TE, Mississippi, Jr, 6-3, 234, 4.42 The Jordan Reed clone who projects best to the NFL as an H-back or slot receiver rather than a traditional in-line tight end. \n39. Forrest Lamp , OG, Western Kentucky, rSr, 6-3, 300, 5.00 He lacks the length to stay outside in the NFL but is a plug-and-play guard (or center) due to his balance, power and awareness. \n40. Curtis Samuel , RB/WR, Ohio State, Jr, 5-11, 196, 4.31 A Percy Harvin-caliber athlete with the versatility to be a matchup nightmare in the NFL. \n41. Adoree’ Jackson, CB/WR/RS, Southern Cal, Jr, 5-10, 186, 4.42 He is among the draft’s best overall athletes, but is currently more polished as a returner than a cornerback, surrendering seven touchdowns in 2016. Watch out when his technique catches up to his talent, though. \n42. T.J. Watt , OLB, Wisconsin, 6-4, 252, 4.69 An instinctive, tenacious pass rusher despite playing tight end until 2016. Watt is still growing into his body and may ultimately become a 4-3 defensive end. \n43. Caleb Brantley , DT, Florida, rJr, 6-2, 307, 5.15 Flashes the burst and power to warrant first-round consideration but struggled with consistency throughout his career. \n44. Kevin King, CB, Washington, Sr, 6-3, 200, 4.43 Long, athletic and a proven difference-maker at cornerback and safety, alike, in the pass-happy Pac-12, King’s reign may be just beginning. King is the other Washington corner with first-round talent. USATSI \n45. Tarell Basham , DE, Ohio, Sr, 6-4, 269, 4.70 \nMAC Defensive Player of the Year who stood out at the Senior Bowl and combine. Long arms (34 1/4”) and powerful hands is a recipe that often leads to success in NFL. \n46. Gareon Conley , CB, Ohio State, rJr, 6-0, 195, 4.44 Overshadowed by talented teammates in the secondary but in comparison, Conley is a relatively proven commodity with the length, feet and hips to handle man to man cover duties. Conley is yet another first-round talent from Columbus. USATSI \n47. Tre’Davious White CB, LSU, Sr, 5-11, 192, 4.47 Elite feet and loose hips make this LSU star erase or “white-out” receivers in coverage; he is not the most physical tackler, though. \n48. Josh Jones, S, North Carolina State, rJr, 6-1, 220, 4.41 A hyper-aggressive defender with the closing speed and size to be an intimidating presence -- when he doesn’t over-run the ball-carrier, that is. \n49. Obi Melifonwu , S, Connecticut Huskies , rSr, 6-4, 224, 4.40 Despite starting four years for the Huskies, Melifonwu is not the most instinctive defender but he stood out at the Senior Bowl and owned the combine with his freakish speed and explosive leaping ability (44” vertical led all participants in 2017). Melifonwu needs to react faster on the field. USATSI \n50. Quincy Wilson , CB/S, Florida, Jr, 6-1, 211, 4.54 Wilson starred at corner but his bulk, big hitting ability (and average feet) project better to safety. \n51. Taylor Moton , OT/OG, Western Michigan, 6-5, 319, 5.18 A mauler in the running game whose game may be best suited inside at guard in a power-based scheme. \n52. Alvin Kamara , RB, Tennessee, rJr, 5-10, 214, 4.56 Twitchy athlete with the wiggle, burst and hands to be effective on all three downs but Kamara was never was asked to be “the bell cow” at either Alabama or Tennessee due to various injuries and suspensions. \n53. DeMarcus Walker , DT, Florida State, Sr, 6-4, 280, 4.86 Possesses some ‘tweener traits which contributed to his running hot and cold, but he times the snap well and shows good coordination in his initial burst and over-arm swim to wreak havoc, especially when inside. \n54. Carl Lawson , OLB/DE, Auburn Tigers , rJr, 6-2, 261, 4.67 He’s a power-packed edge rusher with good initial burst, strength and aggressiveness but has struggled with health and possesses short arms (31 1/2”). \n55. Tim Williams , OLB, Alabama, Sr, 6-3, 244, 4.68 Boasts a first-round combination of burst, bend and snap anticipation but disappears for long stretches (especially against the run) and comes with off-field concerns, as well. \n56. Jordan Willis , DE, Kansas State Wildcats , Sr, 6-4, 255, 4.53 Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year whose hustle and technique stood out at the Senior Bowl and whose raw athleticism wowed at the combine. \n57. Jarrad Davis , OLB, Florida, Sr, 6-1, 238, 4.68 A first-round player when healthy, demonstrating speed, agility and explosiveness to stand out against the run and pass, alike. \n58. Pat Elflein , C, Ohio State, Sr, 6-2, 303, 5.32 Alpha-male type with the square frame and aggression to project as a longtime standout inside in the NFL. He’s best suited to center in a power-based scheme due to just average quickness. \n59. Dan Feeney , OG, Indiana Hoosiers , rSr, 6-4, 305, 5.24 Pro-ready right guard with agility and awareness that projects best to a zone-blocking scheme. \n60. Larry Ogunjobi , DT, Charlotte 49ers , rSr, 6-3, 305, 4.97 Stood out against top competition at the Senior Bowl, using his thick lower body and initial quickness to plug running lanes. An ascending talent in a relatively weak year for defensive tackles. \n61. Marcus Williams, FS, Utah, Jr, 6-0, 202, 4.56 Overshadowed by some of the “top” safeties in this class in part due to his spindly frame but has terrific instincts, hands and underrated overall athleticism. Williams lacks ideal size for an NFL safety but he’s constantly around the ball. USATSI \n62. Cordrea Tankersley , CB, Clemson, Sr, 6-0, 199, 4.40 Long, physical press corner with a knack for making big plays (eight interceptions over past two seasons) despite possessing less-than-ideal instincts and grabby hands in coverage. \n63. JuJu Smith-Schuster , WR, Southern Cal, Jr, 6-1, 215, 4.54 The most physical receiver in the draft, winning with body positioning, strength and simple want-to. May never prove to be a true No. 1 in the NFL but should prove a solid No. 2 for a long time. \n64. Isaac Asiata, OG, Utah, Sr, 6-3, 335, 5.34 Intimidating run blocker with the competitiveness, bulk and strength (combine-best 35 repetitions of 225 pounds in 2017) to project as a starting OG early in his NFL career. Made winning the Morris Trophy as the Pac-12’s top OL a goal for 2016 and earned it.
