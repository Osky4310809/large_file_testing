Prestat \nThe hollow egg is made from milk chocolate flavoured with lemon oil. It‚Äôs then filled with extravagant truffles made with ganache, flavoured with gin and lemon oil, all enrobed in a creamy white chocolate. \nOf course, you can‚Äôt have gin without tonic, so expect to feel a fizz that tingles on your tongue thanks to Prestat‚Äôs ‚Äúsecret ingredient‚Äù. \nThe egg can be purchased directly from Prestat‚Äôs website for ¬£17.50, or savvy shoppers may want to add it to their next Ocado shop for ¬£16.99. \nIt may be more expensive than your average Easter treat, but we think it‚Äôs totally worth it.
