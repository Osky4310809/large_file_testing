(DIT), a pioneer in censorship-circumvention operation. \nFeatures: users access web sites overseas as fast as their local ones requires no installation or change in system setting a single executable file on a Windows platform \nFreegate works by tapping into an anti-censorship backbone, DynaWeb, DIT's P2P-like proxy network system. \nFreegate's anti-censorship capability is further enhanced by a new, unique encryption and compression algorithm in the versions of 6.33 and above. \nNote: \nIf you want to email Freegate through Gmail account, please note that Gmail does not deliver email attachment with \".exe\" or \".zip\" extensions. (Gmail explained this policy here ). \nYou can get around the problem by changing the file extension from .exe to .jpg. For example, you can rename fg742p.exe to fg.jpg. The recipient needs to rename it back to .exe in order to run it. Last time when we tested it, Gmail delivered the file successfully.
