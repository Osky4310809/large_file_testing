Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James was No11 on the magazine’s annual list , which was revealed on Thursday morning.

Under his direction, the long-suffering American League club ended their 86-year title drought by winning the 2004 World Series , adding a second championship three years later. \nHe resigned from the Red Sox in 2011 to join the Cubs, where he managed to bring an end to an even longer title drought. \nThe 42-year-old signed a contract extension in September worth a reported $50m that will keep him with the Chicago club through 2021. \nOthers to make Fortune’s list included Shakira (No27), Canadian PM Justin Trudeau (No31), Chance the Rapper (No46), London mayor Sadiq Khan (No48).
