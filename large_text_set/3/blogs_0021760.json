In the piece, an unnamed AFC general manager was quoted as saying, “Some teams fear the backlash from fans after getting him. They think there might be protests or [President Donald] Trump will tweet about the team. I'd say that number is around 10 percent. Then there's another 10 percent that has a mix of those feelings.”\nAlong with the comment about the nasty tweet, Trump said, “I just saw that,” referencing the article. “I said if I remember that one I’m going to report it to the people of Kentucky. Cause they like it when people actually stand for the American flag, right?”\nTrump’s comments come as FBI Director James Comey confirmed for the first time on Monday that the FBI has been investigating links between Trump allies and Russia . \nKaepernick was one of the biggest stories in the NFL last season for his national anthem protest to bring awareness to injustices that minorities face in the United States. It caused a wave of other protests not just in the NFL, but across the country in various levels of competition and sport .\nSince the season ended, Kaepernick has stayed busy by helping get an airplane to fly food, water, and other supplies to Somalia . There haven’t been any reported visits with Kaepernick and any NFL team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:16:42.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
