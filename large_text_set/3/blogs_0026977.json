UK will rejoin the EU one day, suggests Jean-Claude Juncker Read more \nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Juncker said: “It will be a bill reflecting former commitments by the British government and by the British parliament. There will be no sanctions, no punishment, nothing of that kind.” \nTheresa May is due formally to notify Brussels of Britain’s intention to leave the EU in a letter to the European council on 29 March – four days after the EU’s 60th anniversary celebrations in Rome on Saturday. \nThe letter will set in train a two-year process of negotiation leading to the reduction of the EU from 28 to 27 members on 29 March 2019. \nAsked how he felt about Brexit, Juncker said: “It is a failure and a tragedy. I will be sad, as I was sad when the vote in the referendum took place in Britain. For me, it is a tragedy. \n“I am anything but in a hostile mood when it comes to Britain. We will negotiate in a friendly way, a fair way, and we are not naive.” \nJuncker made clear he places high priority on protecting the status of the 3 million EU nationals resident in the UK and the 1 million Britons living on the continent. \n“I am strongly committed to preserving the rights of Europeans living in Britain and British people living on the European continent,” he said.“This is not about bargaining, this is about respecting human dignity.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:47:05.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
