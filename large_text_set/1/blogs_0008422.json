The simple cookie dough is augmented with mini chocolate chips and finished off with a creamy peanut butter center. You won't be able to stop eating these delightful little bites. Raw Peanut Butter Stuffed Cookie Dough Bites [Vegan, Gluten-Free] This Recipe is : 1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon peanut butter divided 1/3 cup peanut butter powder 3-4 tablespoon agave nectar, to taste 1 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon cinnamon 2 1/2 tablespoon vegan chocolate chips Preparation Place the drained and rinsed chickpeas, 2 tablespoons of the peanut butter (saving the rest for later), the peanut butter powder, agave, vanilla, cinnamon and a pinch of salt into a small food processor. Blend the ingredients until the mixture is thick, creamy and smooth. This could take a good 5-7 minutes, and you’ll need to scrape down the sides to get all the chickpea. Transfer the dough into a bowl and stir in the chocolate chips. Make a heaping 1/2 tablespoon-sized ball of the dough and break it into two small balls. Flatten the two pieces and place 1/4 teaspoon of peanut butter onto the center of one of the rounds. Place the other round on top, seal the sides, and roll it into a ball. Repeat with remaining dough \nAUTHOR & RECIPE DETAILS \nTaylor is the blogger, recipe developer, photographer and general mess maker behind the blog Food Faith Fitness .
