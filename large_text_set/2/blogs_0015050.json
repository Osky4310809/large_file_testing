By: FE Online | Published: February 20, 2017 5:17 PM The Sony Xperia X smartphone is available on e-commerce portal Flipkart with the discount. (Source: IE) \nSony Xperia X, a smartphone which was launched in India last year, has received a big price cut. The smartphone by Sony was earlier priced at Rs 38,990, but will now be available for as low as Rs 24,990 which is a big Rs 14,000 drop in price. The smartphone is available on e-commerce portal Flipkart with the discount. This is the second time Sony has dropped the price of the Sony Xperia X, this first time being only two months after its launch. In the mid of last year, Sony had dropped the price by Rs 10,000. \nSony Xperia X smartphone is available in four colour variants: Rose Gold, Line Gold, Graphite Black and White. The device has a 5-inch display screen with 1080p. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor and comes with 3GB RAM and 64GB storage which can be expanded by up to 200GB using a microSD card. The smartphone has a 23-megapixel camera at the back and a 13-megapixel selfie shooter. The phone is fueled by a 2,620 mAh battery, but according to Sony, it is capable of lasting 2 days on a single charge. In terms of connectivity, the phone has dual-SIM and 4G LTE support. It runs the Android Marshmallow operating system. \nEven with both the price cuts, the Sony Xperia X may not be worth the money. With that price tag, it is competing with mid-range phones and a few other flagships like the OnePlus 3T, and almost all of them offer consumers better specification and features, including camera and battery. There are smartphones from Lenovo and LeEco available in the market which is priced almost half of what Sony is asking for, and they give better specs in terms of RAM and processors. The price cut seems to be in time before Sony launches some new smartphones at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, scheduled at the end of this month. The upgraded version of the Xperia X can be expected to be unveiled at the event too.
