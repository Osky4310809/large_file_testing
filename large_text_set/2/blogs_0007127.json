But it could spell the end of the remnants of the Senate cloture rule as it applies to presidential nominees. \nPreventing a vote is the antithesis of democratic procedure. James Stewart’s popular portrayal of the filibuster in the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a romantic image, but essentially at odds with how politics is supposed to work. The American system of government is based on compromise, a value enshrined throughout the Constitution. The Senate owes its very existence to the Great Compromise of 1787 . The original Filibusters , by contrast, were uncompromising Caribbean pirates, and the verb “to filibuster” initially referred to mercenary groups in the 1850s who invaded and plundered Cuba and Central America. The expression later was applied to taking piratical control of the Senate. It was not a term of endearment. \nIt is noteworthy that this type of self-indulgent wrecking was rare in the Senate’s early history. For over a century the upper house did not need a cloture rule . Even though one Senator could in theory shut the body down, this rarely happened. When contentious issues arose, they were worked out. The Senate survived the sectional crises, Civil War and Reconstruction with no mechanism to force the end of debate. \nThis changed 100 years ago when a group of 11 Senators led by Wisconsin Republican Robert La Follette filibustered the Armed Ship Bill promoted by President Woodrow Wilson on the eve of America’s entry into the First World War. Wilson scored the \"the little group of willful men , representing no opinion but their own,\" who had reduced the U.S. to a “helpless and contemptible” position in the world. In response, the Senate adopted the cloture rule, which at the time required a two-thirds vote to end debate. But cloture was still an extraordinary measure. In the first 53 years of the rule, it was invoked only 8 times .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:59:55.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
