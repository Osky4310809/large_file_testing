Something else that’s good (in a different, more grown-up way) is Shay Mitchell’s R-Rated Beauty and the Beast parody — which we just can’t seem to stop watching .\nWritten and directed by King Bach, the parody is an updated version of the movie we all love . Pretty Little Liars star Mitchell plays Belle — a much sassier, modern-day version of the Belle played by Emma Watson. And the Beast is played by the hilarious King Bach.\nThe storyline is pretty much the same one we know, where Belle is on a journey to save her father and break the spell of the Enchanted Rose. Except she does it all with a killer sense of humor.\nOh, and some solid cuss words thrown in. The story is complete with Lumiere, the talking candlestick; Mrs. Potts, the teapot; and Chip, the adorable teapot boy. Chip attempts to show Belle one of his tricks, but he ends up accidentally farting instead. Luckily, Belle is compassionate and doesn’t make him feel bad about it, until she does, of course.\nThe classic dance with Belle and Beast turns into a raging dance party where things turn dirty pretty quickly. Mitchell posted a little behind-the-scenes video of the dance.\n“So glad I got to show off the 10+ years of dance classes I took as a child very elegant and classy – video up now! @kingbach #beautyandthebeast,” she wrote.
