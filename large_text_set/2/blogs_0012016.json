(Photo: Getty) \nOne season after Marc Jacobs caused an uproar by featuring models in faux-dreadlocks in his New York Fashion Week show, the designer isn’t shying away from interpreting different cultures on the runway. \nJacobs’ Fall collection, which he debuted Thursday, was openly hip hop-inspired, as models paraded tracksuits, puffer jackets, shearling coats and heavy gold chains. The models all wore oversized hatswhich were “inspired by the haberdashery and elegance of Andre 3000,” according to Jacobs’ press notes. \nTitled “Respect,” Jacobs’ notes made a deliberate attempt to recognize the roots of the culture he interpreted in his collection. \n“Several months ago I watched a documentary called Hip-Hop Evolution ,” he wrote, referencing the 2016 four-part series that traces the genre’s first 20 years and, according to Jacobs, “gave way to a whole new language of style.\" \nMarc Jacobs greet his models outside of his NYFW show.

However, it’s worth noting that the streetwear that Jacobs and other designers pay homage to on their runways was once maligned as “ghetto” by fashion’s mainstream. \nAlongside brands like FUBU and Rocawear, Kimora Lee Simmons created her Baby Phat line in 1999. In an interview with the Fader last year, Simmons criticized the fashion industry for its current infatuation with “urban” looks after spending the previous decade marginalizing her designs. \n“Maybe they call it American fashion but at the time it was ‘ghetto fabulous,’ it was ‘urban’, it was ‘hip-hop culture,’ it was “streetwear,’” she said. \n“Now, they’re doing the baggy silhouettes, the layering of pieces, all of the Afrocentric hairstyles like a real afro. Now you’re seeing it on the runway. You’ll see dreads, big braids, and on and on with the make-up trends. You’ll see braids on some celebrity and it’s like, ‘Oh, they started that trend.’ No, they really didn’t.” \nLil Kim and Katy Perry outside the show.

I guess, like, everybody has to stay in their lane? I don't know.\"  //usat.ly/2lnmjCv Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:34:54.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
