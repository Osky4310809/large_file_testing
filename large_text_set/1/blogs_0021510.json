His mother wanted the world to see his mutilated body, so she insisted on an open casket. \nDonham testified at her husband’s trial that Till had grabbed her and threatened her. Her spouse and a co-defendant were acquitted by an all-white jury. \nIn an interview conducted for a book due out next week, Donham is quoted as saying she exaggerated. She also reportedly says she felt sorry for Till’s mother. \nChris Benson, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says people have doubted Donham’s claims and her recent acknowledgement will be a relief to them. \nHe says this should prompt us to be more open-minded when looking at current conflicts between minorities and law enforcement. \nBenson wrote a book with Emmett Till’s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, before she died in 2003. \nNancy Harty I was a fan of WBBM Newsradio 780 long before joining the staff as a reporter in January, 2006.
