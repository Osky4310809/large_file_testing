Last night, she wore red eyeliner at the Grammys and instantly had us scrambling around to find some dupes so we can recreate her look for ourselves . As usual, Gaga looked INCREDIBLE — like, seriously woman, how do you always know how to bring us life?\nThe liner itself was out of this world, but it was only accentuated by the fact that her skin was glowing, her lips were perfect, and her brows were on POINT. She killed it! Her makeup artist, Sarah Tanno, gave us a look at the products she used to create this beautiful look , and unsurprisingly we’re seeing a lot of Marc Jacobs beauty products here!\nLove this beat #grammys #ladygaga #sarahtannomakeup #makeup #marcjacobsbeauty makeup assistant @peggywrightmua #metallica Hair by @fredericaspiras @marcbeauty @thewallgroup Eyes New @marcbeauty Matte Highliner Gel Crayon in (Fine)Wine & Blacquer Twinkle Pop in Leila Velvet Noir Mascara Skin ReMarcable Foundation Remendy Concealer Pen O!Mega Bronzer in Tantric Blush Lush &a Libido Lips Boy Gorgeous \nA photo posted by Sarah Nicole Tanno (@sarahtannomakeup) on Feb 12, 2017 at 6:05pm PST \nSarah used the Marc Jacobs Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon, and you’ll be very pleased to know that it’s currently available online for $25. !\nMatte-Not-Flat.
