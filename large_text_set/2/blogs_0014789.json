to United in summer, Wenger wants to stay February 19, 2017 1:38pm by Staff writers Source: FOX SPORTS MANCHESTER City eye a move for Lionel Messi, Victor Lindelof is set to join Manchester United, and Arsene Wenger admits he wants to stay at Arsenal. \nHere’s the latest transfer links in Rumour Mill! \nCITY LINE UP MOVE FOR MESSI \nManchester City have made Lionel Messi their number one target as they believe the £100 million-rated ($160m) Argentinian superstar is ready to leave Barcelona, according to The Mirror. \nMessi’s father and adviser, Jorge, is in Barca but reportedly not to talk to the Catalan giant about extending Messi’s current contract, which has 16 months left to run. \nAs the club has given new deals to Neymar and Luis Suarez, Barca will reportedly struggle to increase Messi’s current wages while staying within La Liga salary restrictions. \nSpanish clubs can not spend more than 70 of their income on wages, and Messi is on £20 million-a-year after tax.

Source: AP \nAfter the 4-0 drubbing by PSG in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola and City will have new optimism that Messi could seek a new club on a basic wage of £500,000-a-week. \nReports in Spain detail that Messi is keen to reunite with his old manager, but the Spaniard has ruled out returning to the Barcelona head role to potentially take over from under pressure-Enrique. \n“No, I will never go back to Barcelona to be coach there. My period there is gone,” said Guardiola, who won 14 trophies in four years. \nInstead, City are now reportedly expecting Guardiola to stay beyond 2019. \nAthletic Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde is reportedly a contender for the job if Enrique leaves, along with Eusebio Sacristan of Real Sociedad and Everton’s Ronald Koeman , who as a player scored the goal that secured them their first European Cup in 1992. \nBut according to Express, Barca still want Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino to become their new manager.

My preference is always to manage Arsenal. I think I have shown that. But I am adult enough to analyse the situation.” Arsenal's French headcoach Arsene Wenger. Source: AFP \nWenger’s latest low came last Wednesday when Arsenal were crushed 5-1 at Bayern Munich in the Champions League, leaving them on the brink of a seventh successive last-16 exit. \nThey are also 10 points below leaders Chelsea in the Premier League. But Wenger believes he still has at least four years left in his managerial career and wants to work for longer than Manchester United’s Alex Ferguson, who was 71 when he retired in 2013. \n“Ferguson has some other interests in life,” he said. \n“He was older than I am today. He was four years older and retired at 71. I’m 67. Maybe (I’ll manage for) more, or maybe less. I don’t know. Everyone is different. \n“I do not want to take anything away from Ferguson. He was an unbelievable manager, but had enough. I’m not at that stage.” Wenger hints at exit 1:10 \nLEICESTER EYE NEXT VARDY \nIn a bid to unearth the next Jamie Vardy, Leicester have given a trial to non-league striker Josh Gordon after scoring 10 goals in 16 games. \nThe 22-year-old will train with the Premier League champions next week after impressing the Foxes while playing for Stafford Ragners in the Evo-Stick Premier Division. \nDerby are also reportedly tracking Gordon, but Leicester have made the first move. \nLeicester bought Vardy, who scored 24 goals last season to take them to the title, from Fleetwood for £1m in 2012. 3rd-tier Millwall shock Foxes 1:02 \nBITES \n- Liverpool have entered talks to sign out-of-favour Borussia Dortmund midfielder Mario Gotze , according to The Mirror. \n- James Rodriguez claims his future is at Real Madrid despite a lack of playing time. \n- Former Chelsea player Michael Essien is set to sign for Croatian side HNK Rijeka, according to Radio Rijeka. \n- Additional reporting from AFP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:55:14.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
