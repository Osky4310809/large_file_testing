Bob Casey (D., Pa.) will face the public Sunday in a town hall Q-and-A in University City. \nThe event will make the senator one of the few lawmakers from the Philadelphia region to host a town hall since President Trump’s election, and it comes a year before he faces what could be a challenging re-election campaign. \nRepublicans have faced the most pressure to host such events, and those who have done them have often faced raucous throngs of constituents. Democratic events have drawn less scrutiny, though Republicans have made Casey a potential target in 2018 elections. \nCasey’s town hall is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. Sunday at the Penn Museum, 3260 South Street. The public forum is the first of what his office says will be a series of such events. \nYou can follow Tamari on Twitter or email him at .
