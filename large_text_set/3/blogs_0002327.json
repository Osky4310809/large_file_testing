The Rangers' early pressure tactics made the Battling Bees play from behind throughout, and although Medina rallied, Lakewood maintained its grip. \nThe Rangers will play in a regional game for the first time since their 1995 state runner-up season. \n\" Playing at our fast pace usually throws off teams, and that’s how we usually score. We get them out of their flow,\" Lakewood senior point guard Ryann Greenfield said. \n\"It feels great, honestly, because so many doubted us from the start. There were some papers talking about how the championship was gonna be Joes and Mags and not even mentioning either of these teams to get here.\" \nThanks to dispatching Medina for a second time this season, Lakewood books a third matchup with Berea-Midpark, which eliminated defending state champion Wadsworth on Thursday in the Medina District final. Berea-Midpark won both of the Southwestern Conference games. The SWC rivals will face off at 7 p.m., Tuesday night, in a regional semifinal at Brecksville High. \nThere will be a third clash largely due to Nagy's inside contributions. \nLakewood's 6-foot-3 junior post put together quality second and fourth quarters to finish with 23 points. Nagy scored 10 fourth-stanza points and came up big on both ends, also serving as an effective rim protector. A pivotal sequence featured three Nagy blocks on one fourth-period possession. \nNagy managed to navigate the likes of Amanda Holzman (Medina-high 12 points) and Emma Bobey (eight) enough to ensure Lakewood's press could disrupt the Battling Bees' offense, making a comeback difficult. \n\"They were definitely tough, definitely strong. It was rough down there, but you’ve got to figure out ways to get around them,\" Nagy said. \nFollowing her three blocks, Nagy sank a running layup to inflate the Rangers' lead to 37-28 inside of six minutes remaining. Lakewood guard Saher Hamdan (eight points) then drained a right-wing 3-pointer to make it 40-28, and two possessions later, Emma Ribar located Nagy on a cross-court entry lob that resulted in a layup and a 14-point lead. \nThe Battling Bees, who shifted into a trapping set to disrupt Lakewood during a closely contested second half, cut the Rangers' advantage to 42-37 more than two minutes later. But Nagy converted four foul shots in the final 1 1/2 minutes, and after Greenfield missed a free throw with less than 15 seconds left, Nagy went to the floor for the rebound. Her final two free throws increased the Rangers' lead to eight and cemented their unlikely championship. \n\" They’re so long and big. We got Olivia, but they got three 6-footers that can come at you,\" Lakewood coach Mike Harper said. \"She was huge. I couldn’t get her off the floor because they kept coming with those 6-footers. \n\"I can’t even describe it. I get a little choked up thinking about it. This is what you dream of, having a program that can contend at this level.\" \nHarper's team didn't score until more than four minutes elapsed in the opening quarter, when Trinity Nail downed a right-wing triple, but went up 8-0 and didn't allow any Bees points until 1:35 remained in the period. Medina trailed 28-16 at the half but slashed the deficit to five late in the third quarter on back-to-back baseline jumpers from Madison Luthy. The Bees held the Rangers to five third-period points. \nThis marked the eighth time the Medina girls advanced to a district final. Although the Bees finished under .500, three playoff wins -- headlined by a 42-34 triumph over St. Joseph Academy in the semis -- helped make this a memorable season. \n\"We’re part of Medina basketball history. They’ve left their legacy,\" Medina coach Karen Kase said. \"I couldn’t be prouder of them. It’s such a great group. (They won't realize it) this second, but it’s a positive ending for them because they’ve worked so hard. They’re gonna be proud of this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T15:52:05.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
