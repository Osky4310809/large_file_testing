Carson has been the Cavaliers' head coach since the school opened in 2005. \nAlong with his defensive coordinator role at Klein Collins, Madison also served as defensive backs coach and head strength and conditioning coordinator. \nMadison has more than a decade of coaching experience, including stops at Oak Ridge, Clear Brook and Magnolia. Before entering the profession, he was a defensive lineman and tight end for Texas A&M and was a member of the Aggies' Big 12 championship team in 1998. \nA graduate of The Woodlands High School , Madison is married to Leslie Madison , the head volleyball coach and women's athletic coordinator at Magnolia. The couple has three children: Mallory, Morgan and Chase. \nKlein Collins is coming off a season that saw the team advance all the way to the Class 6A Division II state semifinals. The Tigers ultimately lost to eventual state champion DeSoto at NRG Stadium after winning the first regional title in school history. \nMadison's defense was a key part of that success. Klein Collins allowed just 14.1 points per contest and held its opponents to single digits in nine games. The Tigers finished the season with a 13-2 overall record, including a 7-0 mark in District 15-6A play. \nCollege Park, meanwhile, is coming off a 1-9 season. The Cavs' lone victory came against Conroe in District 12-6A action.
