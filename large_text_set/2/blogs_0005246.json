MIchael VarcaS \nVIGAN, Ilocos Sur , Philippines – Navy-Standard Insurance drew enormous power from its youngest members as teammate and defending champion Jan Paul Morales lost steam in the intermediate sprints as it dominated with consummate ease the first stage of the LBC Ronda Pilipinas 2017 which roared off and finished in front of the provincial capitol here yesterday. \nNavy-Standard Insurance took the overall lead after the 158-km stage after Rudy Roque, Ronald Lomotos and Archie Cardana made a 1-2-3 finish with identical times of 3 hours, 51 minutes, 47 seconds. \nRoque, 25, finished second in the final sprint but sliced a 10-second bonus off his finishing time after ruling two intermediate sprints worth five seconds each and another five seconds for placing second to teammate Ronald Lomotos. He goes into today’s stage two criterium wearing the LBC red jersey, symbolic of the overall leadership, with an aggregate time of 3:51.32 \nLomotos topped the race, his first since three years back, but was second overall with only an eight-second bonus while another teammate, Cardana finished third. \nAfter the race, the 25-year-old Roque, whose best finish here was ninth overall in the very first edition of Ronda six years ago, admitted the real plan was just to help Morales, the champion of the three-leg Ronda last year. \n“Our initial plan was to make it easy for Jan Paul (Morales),” said Roque, who hails from Tibo, Bataan, in Filipino. “But he was heavily guarded so we went to plan B and joined my two teammates’ (Lomotos and Cardana) pull away in the final 30 kilometers.”   \nLomotos just took advantage of his chances and cashed in on it. \n“I’m happy to win my first stage in my third year here,” said Lomotos, a 22-year-old rider from San Felipe, Zambales. \nCardana and another Navyman Jaybop Lampawog, both 21, impressed racing team captain Lloyd Lucien Reynante. \n“I have been telling people that my young riders will make heads turn in this race and I’m glad that they are making me look like a genius,” said Reynante, a 38-year-old veteran of the Tour. and Ronda. \nMorales ended up at 23rd overall in 3:56:43, or a little less than five minutes off Roque.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T05:59:38.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
