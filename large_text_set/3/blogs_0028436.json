But as the audience started to feel for Susanna it all went very wrong. Vic and Bob were playing \"the stots\" as they cringe interviewed Susanna (Photo: BBC) We all felt for the GMB presenter (Photo: BBC) \nBob opened his legs and said: \"It’s out there. It’s quite long, have you seen it? It’s very long and heavy at the end with a twist in the middle and at the beginning there’s a couple of little clackers. \n\"It’s quite hairy at the beginning. You’ll probably miss it.\" \nRed-faced Susanna laughed off the crude joke - but many viewers didn't see the funny side. \nOne mum fumed: \"We have turned off. At 8.55pm Vic & Bob are on # disgusting sad for my children who were looking forward to this \nAnother added: \"And now it's 'we were funny once' Vic and Bob. Sorry, but this is so, so poor.\" Ed Sheeran fluffed his lines (Photo: BBC) \n\"Ed isn't allowed to mention the brutality of child rape but these two get their Kong's out,\" ranted another. \nIt comes as Comic Relief bosses raised more than £71 million after wowing film fans with a Love Actually sequel . \nLovers of the hit 2003 movie stayed at home to see the 12-minute follow-up from screenwriter Richard Curtis. \nThey also saw Ed Sheeran feel the pressure of live TV, when he forgot the lyrics to new track What Do I Know? \nBut the 26-year-old simply laughed off the blunder and carried on.

Andrew Lincoln was back with his cue cards (Photo: Comic Relief Ltd) \nThe mini-film opened with Andrew Lincoln’s character Mark knocking on Juliet’s (Keira Knightley) door as per the original, holding his infamous cards. \nAfter asking if his former crush liked his beard – she didn’t – he reminded her of his plans to marry one of four famous women, including Kate Moss. \nTo Juliet’s surprise, he held up a sign saying, “Well I did” and to everyone’s shock, the supermodel then appeared. “Meet the wife” said Mark’s sign, with an arrow, while Kate’s read, “Hi, Nice to meet you”. Mark married Kate Moss (Photo: BBC) \nThe scene then revealed Juliet was still happily married to husband Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who was inside watching the TV. \nMark suggested they find out what happened to the rest of their friends and the footage cut to Hugh Grant, resuming his role as Prime Minister David. Instead of dancing to Jump, like in the first movie, he busted some moves to Drake’s Hotline Bling in one of the funniest moments from the reunion.

Billy revealed Joe had died, after a “big heart attack, big coffin, left a big whole in my heart”.
