Given that there are two justices over the age of 80, and one who is 78, it's not infeasible that one would be looking towards retirement in the near future. (But it's certainly more fun to dig out the \"Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer\" jokes.) \nWhile his comment was awkwardly worded, he does make an excellent point that nobody is really talking about: Trump could be filling a lot of seats on the Supreme Court in the very near future. This will potentially change the makeup of the Supreme Court for a generation or more. The average life expectancy in the U.S. is just over 78. A full third of the court is older than that, and Justice Clarence Thomas will be 72 at the end of Trump's first term. The left likely will go \"full Armageddon\" if one of the justices that either passes away or retires is on the liberal wing of the court. Elections have consequences--and this is likely the biggest one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:36:06.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
