Owners are also asked to not displace tenants in those buildings if none of its code violations are life-threatening.\n“Buildings in Oakland should be safe places to live, work and play. In the wake of the Ghost Ship tragedy, unpermitted living, assembly and work spaces are under heightened scrutiny,” said Mayor Schaaf in a statement on the city’s website . “We must unite as a City to improve the safety of non-permitted spaces while also working to avoid displacing vulnerable community members.”\nOn Dec. 2, a fire inside a two-story warehouse space called the Ghost Ship killed 36 people who were attending an experimental electronic show in the upper level of the building. In the aftermath, a large community of artists living in similar spaces express concerned that property owners could use the incident to force out their tenants, leaving them homeless. In the wake of the fire, warehouse spaces (also known as “warehomes”) were evicted in Richmond, Philadelphia and other cities . \nWith this order, it appears Schaaf is trying to appease the local artist community who have been calling for action, but warehome residents like journalist Sam Lefebvre (a KQED freelancer) have already expressed concern with the strength of the order for protecting artists.\n“Seems to direct owners of unpermitted residences to enter into compliance plan w city w/o actually safeguarding against resultant evictions,” Lefebvre tweeted . \nThis story will be updated when more details as we learn them. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T07:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:54:30.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
