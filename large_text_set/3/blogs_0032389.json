In the past, CoSigns has been one of our most reliable ways of introducing fresh, vital music to our readers while giving young artists the platform they deserve. \nOne of the most exciting aspects of local music is the “local” part. Taste knows no geographical boundaries, but loyalty does, and it’s always more thrilling to get turned on to a new band in your own backyard. That’s why we recently decided to freshen up CoSigns a bit, recasting it as a monthly feature that focuses on five artists from the same city or scene. Every month, we’ll go out of our way to find a diverse cross-section of artists who represent the best of a particular place’s musical tapestry. The best part? You’ll get to hear them before they blow up nationally and become total sell-outs. \nThis month’s CoSigns are near and dear to us because they all hail from Chicago, the city that Consequence of Sound itself calls home. We’re confident that the acts we’ve chosen — Jamila Woods , Yeesh , Oshwa , Whitney , and Trevor Sensor — represent Chicago’s insane diversity and speak to its reputation as one of the world’s best cities for music. \nNow won’t you join us on a walk through the Windy City? –Collin Brennan", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T14:58:57.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
