As it turns out, we may have just found our answer. \nWith a little researching and social media hunting, it appears Bella unfollowed Selena on Instagram this afternoon. Photos \nThey Dated? Surprising Star Couples Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images \nAnd while nobody can really know the exact reasoning behind it, we do have some background about these famous faces. \nBefore the unfollow happened, a source revealed to E! News that while Selena and Bella know each other, they are not good friends. In other words, this isn't a situation where Selena stole her friend's man or The Weeknd is trying to make Bella jealous. \nAt the same time, the wise Internet uncovered a pictured from Immy Waterhouse back in September of 2015 when Bella and Selena were hanging out with a group of mutual friends. \nAccording to Cosmopolitan , Bella also liked the picture that signaled Selena's return to Instagram following her hiatus from the public eye. \nAs for the reasoning behind Selena and The Weeknd's public outing, a source believes the two didn't really care if everyone knew about them. \n\"[The Weeknd] always had a thing for Selena,\" a second source shared with E! News. \"He thinks she is extremely talented and sexy. They recently started talking before the holidays but she has been on his radar before.\" \nOur insider added, \"They are on the same level with expectations and think the other is really fun. They are taking things slow and getting to know each other.\" TAGS/ Bella Hadid , Selena Gomez , The Weeknd , Couples , Instagram , Top Stories Additional Privacy Statement Your information may be shared with other NBCUniversal businesses and used to better tailor our services and advertising to you.
