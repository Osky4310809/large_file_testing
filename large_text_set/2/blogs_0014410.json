Sharon Broaddus from St. Paul’s Baptist Church told the station. “Their bodies have been in there two days and it has to have an effect on the children.”\nCops say Walter Gaines III, 23, shot Walker and her mother, Deborah Walker, 55, before turning the gun on himself. Their bodies were found at about 8:30 a.m. Thursday, after cops received a tip.\nWalker’s two children, both under the age of 5, were also found in the apartment, police said. They were unharmed and have since been reunited with relatives.\nPolice could not immediately confirm how long the children were inside the home after the bloodshed as the medical examiner still needed to determine an estimated time of death. Autopsy results were still pending Friday morning.\nGaines was not the father of Walker’s children, but had been living with Walker and her mother for some time, police spokesman Gene Lepley told The Post.\nMayor Levar Stoney visited the crime scene Thursday, calling the incident a “senseless act” that seemed to be an isolated incident, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. \n“It’s a tough day,” Stoney said.\nRelatives of the victims told the local NBC affiliate that no one dialed 911 when they heard gunshots at the apartment complex.\n“The neighbors or somebody had to hear something and they did not report it, they didn’t cry,” Broaddus told the station.\nBroaddus, who works as a faith leader with the Richmond Police Department, said the ongoing pattern of silence following serious crimes is troubling.\n“It says that we have become cold, indifferent, and it’s like another day,” she said. “It’s like murder is the norm, when it shouldn’t be.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:22:31.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
