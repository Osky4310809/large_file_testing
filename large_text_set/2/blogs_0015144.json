Got it! \nClick the heart, it's called favoriting. Favorite the stuff you like. Got it! \nI was recently in Philadelphia and ate at one of the best restaurants on the scene in recent years—and the best dish I tasted was a humble side of basmati rice. ♥ + Green Garden Herby Basmati Rice with Basil, Mint, Chives & Rosemary by Basil and Roses \nAt Zahav , Chef Michael Solomonov beautifully highlights modern Israeli cuisine, and I was greatly inspired by his vision, the story behind his culinary venture, and the flavors of the amazing meal. As I looked around, I saw that most diners had a sense of exploration as they discovered the colorful melody of flavors and layers in each dish that payed homage to the chef’s roots, to his fallen brother, and to the pleasures we receive from earth.

The Al’Haesh dishes (grilled over coals) are served with a side of basmati rice that was not only delicious, but momentarily took me home. This humble side dish became the center around which all the other plates harmoniously danced , a little pot of rice that had the power to transport me to another place and time, to the the familiar places where I feel safe, comforted, and loved, to my grandmother’s old kitchen in Isfahan. ♥ + What to Cook from Zahav by Michael Solomonov by Emily Stephenson \nRice is the ultimate comfort food. It has been farmed by people for over 10000 years, and growing up in a Persian family, its beautifully fragrant and earthy aroma (in Hindi, “bas” means “aroma” and “mati” means “full of”) was part of the essential scents of home. Cooking traditional Persian rice (with tahdig of course) is truly an art form (to create such a saffron-scented masterpiece, check out Persian Mama’s great recipe ). \nBut for a simpler and quicker version, I use a rice cooker. Not all rice cookers can deliver the crunchy and golden bottom of the pot goodness—generally the PARS brand rice cookers do the trick.

Nine years ago, I had the opportunity to visit my grandmother in Iran shortly before she passed. It was the New Year and we made this dish together. I’ve had herbed rice many times before, but never had it tasted more wonderful. I learned the recipe from my mother, who had learned it from her mother. And here we were, together for the first time in nineteen years—three generations of women cooking a family meal together as if distance and time had not kept us apart for almost two decades. \nMaya Angelou says, “I long, as does every human being, to be at home wherever I find myself.” I found myself at home in this beautiful experience at Zahav, and I hope you do, too, by trying my basmati rice recipe.
