It goes beyond that, though. The question we should really be asking is “Is this the craziest Oscar moment of all time?” And the answer to that question is also…yes.\nThe final moments of the 89th Annual Academy Awards will forever be a footnote of gonzo trivia stored in the minds of movie fans all over the world. It was the time that the wrong movie was announced for Best Picture, only for everyone to learn the truth in the middle of an acceptance speech. It was an embarrassing and nightmarish moment, handled with surprising dignity by all involved. Even though millions of people saw it happen, it’s still hard to believe.\n\nHere’s what you need to know: it was the end of a particularly tedious Oscar ceremony and things had gone mostly as expected. While it wasn’t the juggernaut everyone was expecting, the musical romance La La Land was still cleaning up the bulk of the awards, taking home six statuettes (including Best Director and Best Actress). Moonlight , on the other hand, was more of a low-key winner, snagging Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor. Everyone knew that Best Picture was La La Land ‘s to lose, so it was not surprising at all when it was announced as the winner.\nBut things seemed…werid. Hollywood legends Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were on stage to present the award and at first, it looked like he was just hamming it up. He opened the envelope and stared at the result. At first, it looked like he was trolling the crowd, something only a seasoned pro like Beatty could get away with. Dunaway called him out for milking the moment, so he showed her the envelope. She glanced at the result and announced that the winner was La La Land .\nWATCH: 'La La Land' announced as #Oscars Best Picture winner, but only until a mistake is realized with 'Moonlight' being the real winner. pic.twitter.com/wYsUngcdwe \n— ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 \n\nCue the big applause. Cue the standing ovation. The La La Land team took the stage and the producers began to make their speeches. And they were good ones too – impassioned, full of calls for diversity and tribute to creativity. And then it happened: someone slammed the brakes and everyone quickly learned that a mistake had been made and that Moonlight was the actual Best Picture winner of the year. For everyone who made Moonlight , it was a moment of celebration. For everyone on stage for La La Land , it was a crushing, humiliating blow.\n\nNow, cue those mixed emotions. Cue the Moonlight team celebrating. Cue the La La Land team standing awkwardly on stage, waiting to hand their statuettes to the proper winners. Cue Warren Beatty explaining that the envelope he opened read “Emma Stone – La La Land” (hence his confusion), which means that someone behind-the-scenes made a mistake, not anyone on stage.\nWarren Beatty seems to be opening an envelope that says 'Actress in a Leading Role'. He must have been handed the wrong one somehow. Yikes. pic.twitter.com/Rma4wp80aX \n— Neil Patrick Harris (@ActuallyNPH) February 27, 2017 \n\nAnd here’s the most important cue of all: the producers of La La Land , Beatty, and host Jimmy Kimmel all stood their ground, handled the moment with grace, and handed the awards to the proper winners. Even Kimmel’s (let’s be honest, pretty rotten) jokes represent someone trying to absorb the crushing blow for everyone around him. It’s a difficult scene to watch, but if ever need to witness a group of people rolling with the harshest punch ever thrown at a live awards ceremony…here you go.\nGuy in headset appears to clear things up during the third speech. Wow. pic.twitter.com/7cqt470gds \n— Matt Haughey (@mathowie) February 27, 2017 \n\nSo how did this happen? Despite urban legends about the wrong people accidentally winning Academy Awards ( namely Marissa Tomei for her work in My Cousin Vinny ), the Oscar tabulation process is pretty intense and has built-in fail-safes. Tonight, we witnessed them: moments after victory, the tabulators stepped in and rectified the situation, as they have said they would do in the past.\nBut still doesn’t explain how this happened. How did Warren Beatty end up with an envelope containing Emma Stone’s victory announcement? According to this profile on Martha Ruiz and Brian Cullinan , the third-party PricewaterhouseCooper partners charged with overseeing the counting of Oscar votes, there are two sets of ballots.\nI guess Warren and Leo came from opposite sides https://t.co/wOcicSEg5C pic.twitter.com/EUEf1nO2gi \n— Ev Williams (@ev) February 27, 2017 \n\nHere’s a quote from Ruiz:\nWe also have two sets of ballots – Brian will have one complete set and I’ll have another. The envelopes are kept locked up in an undisclosed location.\nSo let’s not go blaming Emma Stone or Warren Beatty or Faye Dunaway – someone behind-the-scenes may have mixed up one of the doubles, leading to one of the most astonishing misunderstandings in pop culture history. At least, that’s the story that makes the most sense for now.\nStone seems to be taking all of this fairly well:\nEmma Stone backstage: \"I was also holding my Best Actress card at that time … I don’t know what happened.\" #Oscars pic.twitter.com/FS11XVo11y \n— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017 \n\nMeanwhile, Moonlight director Barry Jenkins just seems beside himself:\nOK and now here’s Barry Jenkins’ reaction backstage: pic.twitter.com/0hYotOVzAI \n— Marc (@MarcSnetiker) February 27, 2017 \n\nSo there you go. Moonlight was named Best Picture at the 2017 Academy Awards. Congratulations to all involved – your movie is a masterpiece. As for La La Land …better luck in the future, guys.\nThe post Is This the Craziest Oscar Moment in Our Lifetimes? appeared first on /Film .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:17:19.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
