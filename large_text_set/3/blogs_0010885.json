Ew!\nIt’s Stephen Curry’s 29th birthday and he has a cake, a typical birthday celebration. But the cake is decorated a bit strange, if you ask me.\nBlessed to see another year. So many things to be thankful for! Keep growing, keep pushing, living life....Appreciate everyone who reached out today. #29 #morelife \nA post shared by Wardell Curry (@stephencurry30) on Mar 14, 2017 at 6:04pm PDT \nIt has the pi symbol, which is fine because it’s Pi Day. (Cake is better than pie though) It has Steph Curry’s own logo, sure. IT HAS A MOUTHGUARD. WHY PUT A MOUTHGUARD ON A CAKE. WHO PUT A MOUTHGUARD ON A CAKE. NO MOUTHGUARDS ON CAKES. Besides this terrible/great cake, Steph also had some kids singing to him courtside before the game, which was pretty darn cute.\nHappy Birthday, Steph!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T04:44:27.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
