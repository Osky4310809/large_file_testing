So of course it’s easy to lose your way in life sometimes – to forget about the things that are most important. “Every day I wake up to the most beautiful thing I could dream of: A son that makes my heart melt, a son that never stops smiling, a son that can make me laugh no matter what kind of mood I’m in, a son that I’m proud of, a son I watch fall asleep because I never want to leave him, a son who reminded me what’s most important in life.” May 2009: Ashley Cole in Manchester with Cheryl Cole where she is judging on X-Factor auditions. \nAshley and Cheryl split in 2010 after just four years of marriage. \nAnd after months of pregnancy rumours, it was only last week that Cheryl finally confirmed her pregnancy in a poignant campaign and video for The Princes Trust and L'Oreal. \nStanding with a smile on her face, cradling her bump, dressed in a form-fitting knitted dress, Cheryl looked positively glowing. \nHowever, the campaign has a serious edge to it, as the message behind the campaign for The Prince’s Trust and L’Oreal Paris is to launch a three-year collaboration to help raise the confidence of 10,000 young people across the UK who are struggling with self-doubt.
