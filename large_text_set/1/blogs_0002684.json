Unveiled back in October, the Mi Mix sports a 6.4-inch Full HD display, but the lack of bezels and a 91.3% screen-to-body ratio means that the phone isn't any larger than a traditional 5.5-inch handset.\n\nThe phone is kitted out with high-end internals in the form of a Snapdragon 821, 6GB of RAM, 128GB storage, 16MP camera at the back, 5MP front shooter, and a 4400mAh battery. As is the case with the standard black variant, the white Mi Mix won't be available for sale outside of China.\nThe white Mi Mix has a \"unique\" scratch-resistant finish, and while Xiaomi didn't reveal the price, the new color option is expected to be up for grabs in China later this year.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T07:19:48.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
