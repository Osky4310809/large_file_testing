Patients left waiting for hip operations can experience extreme pain (Photo: Getty) \nSteve Cannon, Vice President of the Royal College of Surgeons, warned that people waiting for hip replacements are being left with little more than painkillers for comfort. \nHe said: “For NHS managers hip replacements and knee replacements can generally wait because they are not life threatening. They are easy targets for rationing. \n“But they are very painful, they can severely inhibit peoples lifestyles. The longer you wait the worse the hip becomes, day by day by day. The cartilage gets worn away and the bone becomes exposed. It then slowly wears away.” \nHe said that the operations could be life-changing. \nHe said: “Any doctor would like in an ideal way to do any life-improving surgery extremely quickly. When you have the skills available you want to use that to the benefit of your patients. \n“It transforms lives. It makes the immobile mobile, it can give you the ability to climb stairs. It can allow you to walk very good distances if the rest of you is OK.” \nAccording to NHS England the waiting list for non-urgent orthopaedic operations referrals- the bulk of which experts say are comprised of hip and knee operations - has risen from 376,000 in October 2008 to 505,957 this year.
