Then so be it.\nBecause when it comes to replacing the white front on a red iPhone 7 with the much-cooler black bezel from a different phone there's really not that much of a choice. That black-widow style is just too badass to pass up, and if Apple won't manufacture it for you then you'll just have to do it yourself.\nActually, never mind. This is an awful idea, and as you risk destroying your phone in the process. You definitely shouldn't do this.\nProminent DIY'er Zack Nelson, on the other hand, is not you.\nSEE ALSO: Get ready for a bunch of new Apple products, including a phone in this long-overdue color\nAs a how-to video posted March 24 demonstrates, he has both the knowledge and the tools to create a one-of-a-kind iPhone 7 that swaps out the white bezel for a black one.\nPretty awesome, right?\nNelson delicately removes the front faceplate after unscrewing it at the base. This also involves breaking the water-resistant seal with a razor blade, so, you know, if you go this route maybe don't take your phone surfing after?\nHe then unscrews two different types of screws (because: Apple), and swaps out the default white front with a different front from a matte black iPhone 7.\nAs home buttons are paired with their iPhones, Nelson has to replace the black home button with the original white one — giving the phone an explosion of white on an otherwise all-black surface.\nIt still looks pretty cool, though.\nWell.... I've got good news and bad news. pic.twitter.com/DrequSIiW0\n— JerryRigEverything (@ZacksJerryRig) March 24, 2017\nHowever, despite its coolness, you should definitely not do any of this.\nInstead, if you want a red iPhone with a black front, allow your friends at Mashable to present a simpler option: Skin a matte black iPhone 7 with a red decal . It's easy, cheap, you won't void your warranty, and you don't need three types of screwdrivers.\nFashion may trump function, but laziness trumps all.\nWATCH: This ingenious toilet paper tray will keep your iPhone safe in the bathroom", "external_links": ["https://t.co/DrequSIiW0", "https://twitter.com/ZacksJerryRig/status/845328956886700032", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/DmTbrHX3.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/DmTbrHX3.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-28T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:14:41.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
