Worried over how the pitch would look a day ahead of the third Test, Steve Smith wasted no time in going to the middle. The ground staff wasn’t ready to lift the covers, and after some gesturing, only a part was removed to allow Smith a peek. \n“This irked Australia coach Darren Lehmann even further as they were in no mood to leave without getting to see the entire pitch. When the covers were finally lifted, Lehmann and Smith started their assessment from every angle.” The pitch at Ranchi, pictured by Sydney’s Daily Telegraph. Source: News Corp Australia \nPITCH NOT ALL IT SEEMS \nNot all in the Indian media are convinced the wicket will play tricks on the tourists. \nS Dinakar, writing in the Hindu , said local weather conditions might trump any attempts by the Indian team to prepare a slow, low turner. \n“The pitch might play better than it looks — images of the track have been doing the rounds on Twitter — since it may not be very dry,” Dinakar wrote. \n“Spells of rain in the city leading up to the Test have meant the surface had to be periodically kept under covers. The curator, resultantly, hasn’t really been able to prepare a bone dry wicket. \n“Showers have been forecast on day three and four of the Test. If it rains, then this will have a direct bearing on how the surface plays. \n“Lack of adequate sunlight and the covering up of the surface will slow down the breaking up of the wicket.” Steve Smith, left, listens to Steve O'Keefe as they inspect the pitch during a training session. Source: AP \nTENSION AT KOHLI PRESS CONFERENCE \nSandip G, writing in the Indian Express , noted a tense exchange between a member of the touring Australian media and Virat Kohli at the pre-match press conference in Ranchi. \nSandiip noted the exchange “demonstrated that the underlying animosity has, by no stretch of the imagination, dissipated”. \n“Towards the end of the Kohli’s interaction, he had a verbal sparring with an Aussie journalist, when neither seemed to let go off the A-word,” Sandip wrote. \n“It began with a gentle prodding question, ‘Is it appropriate for an international captain to make serious allegations and not provide evidence to substantiate that?’ \n“’What allegations,’ retorted Kohli. \n“’The allegations that Australia weren’t using the DRS the right way, two other occasions…’ \n“Kohli combated with his tone, ‘But what were the allegations called?’ \n“The reply came, ‘Doesn’t matter what the allegation is called.’ \n“He then simply blunted it, ‘It does (matter) because it has to be called something for me to be questioning something about someone to call it an allegation. If no charges were pressed against me, how are those allegations?’” Kohli's claims are 'wrong' 0:59 \nGAVASKAR BLASTS AUSTRALIAN MEDIA \nIndian great Sunil Gavaskar is none too pleased with the tone of coverage in the Australian media since the fiery conclusion to the Bangalore Tests. \nIn an interview with NDTV, Gavaskar said , “We should not bother too much about the Australian media and what they write”. \n“They are an extension of their cricket team’s support staff,” he continued. The focus now should shift to cricket from off-the-field issues. \n“Neither India captain Virat Kohli nor his Australian counterpart Steve Smith have said anything about the issue in between the second and the third Tests. Both captains had their say on the last day of the Bengaluru Test and now they have spoken ahead of the third Test. \n“Nobody spoke anything in between about it but the media.” Clarke: It wasn't about race 1:09 \nKOHLI’S BEAUTIFUL PHILLIP HUGHES GESTURE \nSpeaking at his book launch in Kolkata, Michael Clarke paid tribute to Virat Kohli and the Indian team, who were in Australia when Phillip Hughes passed away. \nThe Indians agreed to delay the Adelaide Test and Kohli, along with several teammates, attended Hughes’ funeral service in his hometown of Macksville on the NSW north coast. \n“The way (Virat) handled that situation, he came for the funeral and had some of the Indian players too,” Clarke told the Indian media, as reported by Sports Keeda . \n“I have utmost respect for him because of that. \n“This is clearly above the game of cricket and they didn’t need to postpone the game. They could not have turned up for the funeral. They didn’t have to do anything that they did. I will always remember that.” \nHISTORY FOR RANCHI \nVishaal Loganathan, writing in the Times of India , said Ranchi was buzzing ahead of hosting its maiden Test match. \n“’Let’s make history,’ the hoardings in the city scream as Ranchi hopes to have a successful first Test,” Loganathan wrote. \n“A special postal letter to commemorate the event will be released. The series is tantalisingly poised and the locals are excited. All the boxes needed for a strong first Test have been ticked, only the cricket’s left.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T02:54:30.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
