The Redmond woman was watching TV Monday evening when the stray 9 mm slug blasted through at least one exterior wall of her neighbor’s home, passed through a fence and then entered her home.\nIt flew through a picture frame and “bounced” off her noggin about 9:45 p.m., Redmond police said.\n“She had a knot on her head. You could feel it, but it didn’t bleed or puncture anything,” police Lt. Curtis Chambers said in describing her superficial wound.\n“It was like having a small rock thrown at you,” he said.\nThe bullet was fired from her neighbor inside his home at 2486 SW Wickiup Ave., Chambers said. When cops arrived, they followed the bullet’s trajectory to an exit hole in the neighbor’s house.\nRyan Pine, 24, was charged with unlawful use of a weapon, two counts of reckless endangerment and second-degree criminal mischief. He also had an outstanding warrant.\nPine was not shooting at anyone or trying to scare anybody, Chambers said.\n“What he was doing is not exactly clear,” he said, adding that drugs and alcohol appeared to have been involved in the errant shooting.\nThe woman was fortunate that the bullet passed through several barriers, slowing its normal speed of several hundred feed a second before it struck her.\nBut in addition to a hard head, she also was aided by her fortuitous decision to rearrange her living room furniture a week earlier, when she moved the couch away from the spot where the bullet entered the apartment.\n“Had her furniture been arranged in the previous position, it’s possible it could have struck her immediately and caused more of an injury,” Chambers said.\nThe woman declined to comment to the paper – saying the incident was blown out of proportion.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:15:38.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
