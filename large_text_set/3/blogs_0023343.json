Fortunately, moving the needle in a big way doesn’t require a major or painful lifestyle change—as these seven savers prove. \nThey tell us how they dialed up their efforts with some simple yet extremely effective hacks—and ultimately saved thousands. \nCourtesy of Nick D'Urso “I stockpile my $1 bills.” \nNick D’Urso, 27, co-founder of a nutrition company  in Brooklyn, N.Y. \n“This may sound like the simplest idea ever, but I’ve been able to save a pretty good chunk of money just by stockpiling my $1 bills over the last five years. For example, if I buy something for $16 and pay with a $20, I take the four leftover singles and put it in a safe. \nIt took some getting used to, but now it’s become a habit I don’t even think about. The best part? I’ve saved over $9,000 this way! I’ve been tempted to spend it over the years, but I’m happy to say that my willpower prevailed. My big-picture goal is to put a down payment on a house , so I’m keeping my eye on the prize.” \n\n\nCourtesy of Elizabeth Jenkins “I rent out my home during peak holiday season.” \nElizabeth Jenkins, 28, communications manager in San Diego, Calif. \n“Whenever I’m planning a vacation, I always list my apartment on rental websites, like Airbnb and HomeAway, for the days I’ll be gone. It’s a quick and easy way to help cover the cost of the trip and sock away some additional funds. \nDuring peak travel season, which is May to October in San Diego, I take it a step further by renting out my couch to budget travelers via Airbnb. I love meeting new people, so it’s like free money. At the height of the season, I rent out my entire home. I’ll either stay with a friend or in a budget hotel outside the city, then pocket the profits. I’ve been doing this for a little over two years and have saved roughly $5,000 as a result.” \n\n\nCourtesy of Eliza Cross “I made my savings account super-inconvenient.” \nEliza Cross, 58, entrepreneur and blogger in Denver, Colo. \n“My tactic goes back to the old, ‘out of sight, out of mind’ way of thinking. I used to have monthly  automatic withdrawals from my checking account to my savings, but soon discovered one major flaw: It was way too easy to transfer money back into checking for small emergencies, like a broken garbage disposal. \nSo about two years ago, I decided to create an ‘inconvenient savings account.’ I deliberately chose a credit union that’s not connected to my regular bank, then declined the free debit card. If I want to take money out of this account, I have to physically drive there and arrange it with a representative. Because it’s such a pain to access, I rarely move cash back into my regular account—and have been able to save about $4,500 so far.” \n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:04:44.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
