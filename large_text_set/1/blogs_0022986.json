It's really difficult for us, but it is difficult for good reasons and the good reasons are we progress in competitions.\" poll loading Will Manchester United win the Europa League this season? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T13:22:32.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
