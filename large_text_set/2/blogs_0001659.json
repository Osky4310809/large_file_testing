(AP Photo/Ben Margot)\nIf U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?\n— Donald J.

If you believe the Obama administration should have had that power to decide what beliefs and speech the citizens are entitled to then ask yourself if the Trump administration should? For me, the answer is clear: neither.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/02/trump-threatens-no-federal-funds-for-berkeley/", "external_links": ["https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2017/02/TrumpUCBerkeleyMilo2-1024x547.jpg", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827112633224544256", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2017/02/TrumpUCBerkeleyMilo-1024x745.jpg", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2017/02/TrumpUCBerkeleyMilo.jpg", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2017/02/TrumpUCBerkeleyMilo2.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-02T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T15:11:16.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
