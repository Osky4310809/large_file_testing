Credit Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times After the Waldorf Hotel opened in March 1893, the writer Oliver Herford quipped that it “brought exclusiveness to the masses.” The same could be said for the famous Waldorf salad, a dish that was made for New York City’s elite but that became, through the 20th century, a staple of Americana. On March 1, the Waldorf Astoria will close indefinitely for renovations, amid reports that only a small portion of the hotel will remain , making way for luxury apartments. Yet the Waldorf salad, which is currently served at two of its three restaurants and on the room-service menu, lives on — in cookbooks, at diners and even at restaurants known for ambitious cooking. The salad, originally a mix of diced apples and celery tossed in a good-quality mayonnaise, was created for the hotel’s debut event, a charity ball in honor of St. Mary’s Hospital for Children on March 14, 1893. The menu was developed by the hotel’s first executive chef, Edouard Beauchamp, and its maître d’hôtel Oscar Tschirky, who became known as “ Oscar of the Waldorf .” Mr. Tschirky wasn’t a chef, but he is nevertheless credited with creating the Waldorf salad, having published the recipe in his 1896 cookbook, “The Cook Book, by ‘Oscar’ of the Waldorf.” (The updated version here was given to The New York Times in 1956, accompanying an article about Mr. Tschirky’s replacement, C. C. Philippe . “A juggler trying to keep six plates in the air has it easy compared with C. C. Philippe of the Waldorf Astoria,” it began.) Photo Oscar Tschirky is credited with creating the salad. He was the Waldorf’s maître d’hôtel and worked there 50 years. Credit The New York Times Through his 50 years at the hotel, Mr. Tschirky — a Swiss immigrant who was a busboy at the Hoffman House, then a waiter at Delmonico’s before landing the job at the Waldorf — became a celebrity, just slightly less famous than the people he waited on. He loved nothing more than coordinating the details of a lavish party. In 1899, when the mining heir Daniel Guggenheim described the dinner he wanted to throw for his 40 closest friends, Mr. Tschirky reveled in the challenge. He transformed a hotel ballroom into an enchanted forest, carpeting the floor in sod, hanging fresh grapes from a trellis and borrowing cages of nightingales from the Central Park Zoo. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But it was in an unassuming salad that he found longstanding fame. The simplicity of the original Waldorf salad has encouraged improvisation, almost since the dish was introduced. Soon after, chopped walnuts became an accepted topping. Historical recipes for home cooks play up the sweetness, suggesting ingredients like mandarin oranges and marshmallows. Today, the Waldorf Astoria serves a contemporary version, updated in 2011 by its culinary director, David Garcelon, and the executive chef, Pete Betz, made with julienned Granny Smith and Fuji apples, halved red and green grapes, and candied walnuts. The dressing has evolved from simple mayonnaise, to crème fraîche in the 1990s, to an emulsified mixture of Dijon mustard, olive oil, champagne vinegar, egg yolk and white truffle oil. Other restaurants have taken even greater liberties with the recipe. Mr. Garcelon said he had seen many different versions in his travels, and, most of the time, he thinks, “That’s not a Waldorf salad.” Follow NYT Food's board Food News on Pinterest. Butter Midtown has had a fried chicken Waldorf salad on the lunch menu since it opened in its original location in 2002, made with apples, endives, raw and roasted grapes, candied walnuts and a blue cheese dressing. The executive chef, Alex Guarnaschelli, called it the restaurant’s most popular lunch item. She attributed the dish’s success to its potent flavors: “There’s the duality of the raw and cooked grapes, and the walnuts are textured with sugar but also quite savory.” Eleven Madison Park’s twist involves grated Granny Smith apples, marinated celery root, dehydrated grapes soaked in simple syrup, candied walnuts and Middlebury Blue cheese.
