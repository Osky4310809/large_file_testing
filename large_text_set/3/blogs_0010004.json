The designation was originally meant to be used on a stillborn V12-powered M version of the 8 Series , canned after a lukewarm response to the base car. \nThose hoping for the resurrection of a BMW supercar like the M1 will likely be disappointed, however, as the new M8 will essentially be a next-generation M6. This is because the 6 Series coupé, convertible and Gran Coupé models are set to move to the 8 Series and become larger and more luxurious, so the M version will follow suit. Sources close to the publication claimed that the car will go on sale in 2019. \nPower will likely come from the same powertrain as the forthcoming F90 M5 – a 4.4 litre twin-turbo V8 producing upwards of 600 hp, sent to all four wheels via an advanced version of the company’s xDrive system. BMWBlog expects the transmission to be an eight-speed automatic rather than a typical M DCT (dual-clutch transmission), which would not be able to handle the torque and isn’t set up for all-wheel drive.
