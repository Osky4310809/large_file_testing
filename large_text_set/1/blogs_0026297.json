Everything’s just kind of this blur, you know? Until you hit rock bottom. \nThe biopic promises to cover “the tumultuous story of pop icon Britney Spears’ rise to fame, fall from grace and eventual triumphant resurrection, firmly securing her position as one of the world’s greatest entertainers.” \nYou can also expect to see this Costco Kirkland knockoff of *NSYNC . These new photos from the Lifetime Britney Spears biopic are a true hate crime. Someone please pray and keep us in your thoughts. pic.twitter.com/Saw1YtS8N1 \nIt’s not as good as the name brand, but certainly… cheaper. \nThe 23-year-old Bassett told New York Daily News what it was like trying to become Spears. \nShe was a fan of Britney, having grown up listening to her pop hits, but she had no idea what the singer went through in her personal life. \nBassett said, \nIt was traumatic having to experience through my eyes what she experienced. I mean, she’s not like anybody else. Her entire life, she’s been chased by paparazzi and she’s constantly being scrutinized and in the public eye, so it’s not normal. I really appreciated how strong she is. Emotionally, the way she got through the constant pressures that she was faced with is admirable. Hopefully, Bassett’s empathetic portrayal will do Spears’ story justice. What drove her crazy?
