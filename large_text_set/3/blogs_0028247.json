With what’s happening?” [the passenger] asked. \n“Anger? No anger. I’m zen, completely zen.” \n“You meditate it away?” Paula Vrinceanu \nAt a time when hate crimes against minorities are occurring at an alarming rate in the U.S. ― and anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies are coming from the White House ― the blog is a small effort to “humanize” immigrants, said Tan. \n“It’s not easy being an immigrant in this country,” Tan told HuffPost. “I’ve endured many acts of xenophobia. I was walking down the street one day in D.C., and someone yelled at me to ‘Go back to China.’ I’m not from China, so it doesn’t even make sense . For all they know I could have been American.” Someone yelled at me to ‘Go back to China.’ I’m not from China, so it doesn’t even make sense.\" Wei-En Tan \n“[After Trump’s travel ban], I started thinking: how can I do something to bring people together?” Tan added. “Talk to people who might not know immigrants.” \nThe website is run as a “community blog,” meaning the volunteer team at Riding Up Front ― almost all immigrants themselves ― collects submitted stories, edits them and pairs them with illustrations from artists around the world, who submit their work voluntarily but occasionally receive a nominal fee. \n“It’s a labor of love,” Tan said of the writers and artists all volunteering work. “Almost all of the founding team is made up of people with experience with immigration or as refugees: Anais is Iranian-French in the U.S. Mark is American in Australia. Martha was a refugee from Cuba, who came over on a boat.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T21:53:14.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
