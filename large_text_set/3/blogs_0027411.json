This essential oil is usually extracted from the leaves, barks, twigs and stalks of the slim, perennial cassia tree. \nProduced on a large scale in China and the United States, cassia bark oil is often adulterated, which in turn results in high levels of toxicity. \nTo ensure that you only get cassia bark oil at its highest possible quality, I highly recommend that you buy only from trusted and reputable manufacturers that only produce their oils from wholesome organic ingredients and safe practices. How Does Cassia Bark Oil Work? \nCassia bark oil is one of the many essential oils worth adding in your medicine cabinet due to its well-documented healing properties. \nIt works well as a febrifuge (reduces fever), antiemetic (helps stop vomiting), carminative (lessens instances of gas or flatulence) and anti-arthritic agent. Suggested applications for cassia bark oil include: 4 \n• Antiseptic. Dilute cassia bark oil in a mild carrier oil and apply a small amount to the reflex points of the feet. \n• Anti-diarrhea. For diarrhea and other digestive issues, dilute and massage the essential oil into the reflex points of the feet and over the abdomen. \n• Antifungal. Apply a small amount of diluted cassia bark oil to the affected area at least once or twice daily. \n• Antiviral. For colds and flu, diffuse the essential oil through the room. Is Cassia Bark Oil Safe? \nCassia bark oil can be a potential skin irritant and dermal sensitizer. Cassia bark oil is definitely not safe to be used on babies and small children, given the extremely delicate nature of their young skin. \nBecause of its 100 percent sensitization value, I strongly discourage topical applications of pure cassia bark oil. You may dilute it in a mild carrier oil in low concentrations to reduce its strength. \nNevertheless, I still say it’s best to seek the expert advice of an experienced aromatherapy practitioner before doing anything to avoid unfortunate incidents. \nIn addition, cassia bark oil also has potent emmenagogue (stimulate blood flow) and antigalactogogue (prevent or decrease the secretion of milk) properties, which is why I do not advise pregnant or lactating women to take any form of it. Side Effects of Cassia Bark Oil \nWhile there may be existing recommendations to use cassia bark oil in aromatherapy or vapor therapy, let me warn you that too much inhalation of this warm essential oil may possibly induce insomnia, debility or depression in some individuals. \nI recommend that you seek expert medical opinion practitioner first before incorporating cassia bark oil, or any herbal oil, into your health and wellness regimen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T07:38:57.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
