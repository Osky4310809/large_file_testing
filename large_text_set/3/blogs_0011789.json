This 3D printed travel dock fixes that problem. \nNintendo tried to cater for every gaming scenario with the Switch by including three play modes: docked, tabletop, and portable. For the most part, they do cover all situations, but there's one glaring omission. What if you want to take your Switch round to a friend's house and play on their big screen TV? \nThe option to have a second dock would solve that problem, but Nintendo doesn't sell them yet. You could take your existing Switch dock with you, but it's far from portable. So a Reddit user by the name of Jolimon decided to make his own Switch travel dock . \nHere's the Switch tablet sitting on top of the travel dock to give you some idea of its size: \nWhat Jolimon did was to take all the components included in the official Switch dock and squeeze them into a smaller unit which can easily be slipped into a pocket. The travel dock hooks up to a TV just like the official one, only the Switch sits on top. That may actually be preferable to Switch owners concerned about screen scratching.

The issue there is getting hold of the necessary components without dismantling official docks. The bigger issue, however, is how Nintendo will react to an unofficial accessory such as this. \nThe correct response from Nintendo would be to release an official travel dock. It may be the case that a 3rd-party manufacturer such as Hori is already working on one, though. Whatever the situation, it shouldn't be long before Nintendo reacts one way or another.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T14:31:05.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
