Dianne Feinstein spoke with protesters outside a fundraiser in LA Friday. The protesters were agitated over a number of issues but at one point a woman offers Feinstein a litany of reasons she believes President Trump should be removed from office and asks how to get him out. Feinstein replies Trump is going to “get himself out.”\n“We know that he is breaking laws every day. He’s making money at Mar-a-lago. He’s getting copyrights in China. He has obvious dealings with Russia,” the protester says. She continues, “There’s so many things he’s doing that are unconstitutional. How are we going to get him out?”\nSeveral protesters answer the question by suggesting, “Impeach!” as Feinstein is still gearing up for her answer. Feinstein replies, “We have a lot of people looking at this, technical people. And, I think, he’s going to get himself out.” She adds, “I think sending sons to another country to make a financial deal for his company and then have that covered with government expenses…I believe those government expenses should not be allowed.” Feinstein goes on to say she is working on legislation to deal with conflicts of interest but adds “it’s difficult.”\nPressed on whether or not Trump had committed “impeachable offenses,” Feinstein replied, “I can’t answer that.” So Feinstein isn’t quite on board with the impeachment talk, at least not yet, but she does seem to believe that Trump’s days in office are numbered. Does she believe he’s going to resign amid scandal? That seems to be where she is heading with the comment about the deals made by Trump’s sons.\nMaybe the “technical people” Democrats have examining this will find something, but at this point it’s hard not to see this as the most recent aspect of the never-ending effort to get rid of Trump by any means necessary. Hillary was supposed to finish him in November. Then it was recounts based on claims the election had been hacked. Then it was rallying faithless electors . Then it was preventing certification of the vote. Then it was massive street protests. Then it was Russian collusion (for which there is still no evidence ). The best you can say for this attempt to take Trump down using the emoluments clause is that it seems slightly more realistic than everything else the Democrats have tried.\nHere’s the first part of the exchange in which Feinstein says Trump with “get himself out”:\nPart 4 of Q&A.
