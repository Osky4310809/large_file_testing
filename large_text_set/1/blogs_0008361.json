If you haven’t got a card you can give out to prospective clients or collaborators, you’re missing out on a key marketing opportunity.\nNot all business cards are created equal, however. We live in a world where the average small business can design their own cards and order them from well-known online printers for under £20. These cards tend to be of an inferior weight, and typically use twee clipart to relate themselves to the business being advertised.\n55 inspiring examples of letterpress business cards What this means is that there are a lot of poorly designed business cards out there! This is both a challenge and an opportunity: to stand out you need to create a design that looks fantastic, and helps you differentiate yourself. If you can make it tactile and feel pleasant in the hand, you’ll be well on your way. Create an effective card and you can elevate your business above your competitors before the prospect has ever seen your website!\nSo, with all that in mind we’ve brought together 10 of our top tips for creating effective, innovative business cards .\n01. Use good design principles \nRemember: the basic principles of paper-based design apply to business cards It might seem obvious but it’s worth reiterating that a business card is a piece of printed material like any other. Because of this, the basic principles of paper-based design apply to business cards:\nKeep all your key copy at least 5mm from the trim edge Work at 300dpi for best image reproduction Ensure you maintain a minimum size for your typography to maintain legibility Design in CMYK unless you’re working exclusively with spot colours Many designers also find it helps to use a grid to lay out their cards, as this can help you to achieve the right hierarchy of information as well as ensure your alignment is sound.\n02. Get creative within the constraints \nA business card may be small, but you can still get creative with the space There are a couple &apos;standard&apos; sizes for business cards, depending upon where you are in the world. One typical example is 55x85mm, although you&apos;ll see many other sizes quoted on the web. Working within this tiny canvas you can still get creative with the space: start by considering the key information you want to include, which will typically be a name, phone number and email address, then work your design around presenting this information in a creative way.\n03. Avoid common pitfalls \nThe first and most obvious pitfall is to ensure you provide a bleed as specified by your printer There are some common pitfalls to designing business cards that it helps to be aware of. The first and most obvious is to ensure you provide a bleed as specified by your printer. This is commonly 3mm, but can be 5mm so check! Just as important is to avoid using a straightforward border around the entire of the card, as this will show up any misalignment in the trim if the card isn&apos;t perfectly cut.\n04. Use special finishes \nThis example features a UV spot to highlight fret positions, on the reverse of a guitar tutor’s business card An instant way to add impact to your business card, and make it stand out from the crowd, is to use a special finish. Special finishes include the likes of foil blocking, spot-UV and metallic inks, and can add significant cost to your print. What they offer, however, is the opportunity to make your card more tactile, visually impressive and memorable.\nDifferent printers offer different options for finishes, so speak to them to find out what they can do for you, and don’t be afraid to go to a specialist if your usual printer only offers straight four-colour print.\n05. Cut into your card \nThis card, designed by Phil Jones, Ryan Coleman and Jeff McCullough for Yoga One, shows how some creative thinking with die-cuts can result in a fun and memorable card A great way to make your card unique is to use a die-cut process to remove elements from the card stock, leaving a void. You can either use a die to change the shape of your card (by rounding the corners, for example), or you can cut shapes out of the centre.\nDies are expensive to create the first time, although increasingly printers are offering laser-cut options that make it economical to create a die-cut look on shorter print-runs. There are some amazingly creative examples on the web, and when combined with creasing you can use the process to create architectural features in your card design. Also, don't overlook letterpress as an option.\n06. Use unusual materials \nThis card is constructed from a printed circuit board, and works as a USB device. When plugged in, it provides additional information about the owner Most business cards are printed on card stock. This is the most cost-effective option for printing your cards.
