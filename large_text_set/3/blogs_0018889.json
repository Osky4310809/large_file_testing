In Chartiers Valley’s production of “Sweeney Todd”, the cast showed an attention to detail that helped the audience look past the façade of gore and despair to discover the humanity of Sweeney Todd. \n“Sweeney Todd” is a Stephen Sondheim classic about a vengeful barber named Sweeney Todd who sets up his deadly shop on Fleet Street to avenge his wrongful imprisonment by the dastardly Judge Turpin. He is aided by his partner in crime, Mrs. Lovett, who owns a pie shop below his shop. “Sweeney Todd” is filled with anger, sorrow, love, and death which forms a compelling storyline with several twists and turns. It is incredibly demanding to take on and it requires an attention to detail to convey the different messages packed within the narrative. Chartiers Valley rose to the challenge and delivered a superb performance. \nSweeney Todd appears to be a one-dimensional character on the surface. Yet, if you look closer, you find a complex character who is driven by sadness and despair at the loss of his wife and daughter. Devin Moore, who played Sweeney Todd, understood the grief-driven rage of Sweeney Todd and took the character to an emotional depth that was especially evident during “Epiphany.” \nThroughout the song, Moore was forced to switch between vowing vengeance on mankind and expressing sorrow over how his wife is supposedly dead and he will never see his daughter again. Moore changed his tempo and tone to convey this Jekyll and Hyde-type back and forth. He was able to tap into the emotions and humanity of Todd and use his body language and facial expressions to express an array of emotion. This attention to detail and the depth of his portrayal combined with his talent solidified Moore’s performance as a true tour de force. \nThe Bonnie and Clyde partnership between Mrs. Lovett and Sweeney Todd is only as good as the other half which means that Lovett has to be as dynamic as Todd himself. Emily Schneider’s Mrs. Lovett did not disappoint in this regard. She did an excellent job depicting her erratic yet cunning nature, especially during “A Little Priest,” where she utilized her body language, off hand glances, and other facial expressions to display to Todd her suggestion to bake people into pies as well as convey to the audience her true intention to start a twisted partnership. \nThe interactions between the two all seemed natural which only enhanced the depiction of their partnership. This relationship stole the show and it is largely due to the excellent acting ability of Emily Schneider. \n“Sweeney Todd” can be a difficult show to perform, due to the necessary set pieces and special effects. The crew constructed multilevel set for the pie shop and barber shop, which were connected by a staircase. These sets allowed the audience to step into Fleet Street with the characters in the show, yet they were not distracting and allowed the focus to be on the cast. This was exhibited during “My Friends.” One of the defining moments of the performance was when Todd stood in his shop and proclaimed, blade in hand with an arm raised, “My arm is complete again.” This represented a turning point in Sweeney’s character and it would surely have been lost had the crew constructed an overwhelming barber shop. \nThe crew also displayed their ingenuity in creating Sweeney’s chair and the murders, as seen during the “Johanna” sequence. They designed a chair with a seat that would fall out when a lever was pulled, sending the actor sliding off the set. They also utilized red lighting, sound effects, and even blood that spurted from the necks of the victims during this murders. This was a crowd favorite, drawing applause and laughter and showing how impactful the detail of the sets and special effects were on the storytelling. \n“Sweeney Todd” combines a compelling storyline, powerful music, nuance and hidden humor to create an entertaining story. While baking humans into meat pies made for an entertaining show, it was the dedication to the humanity of the characters that made this show brilliant. The characters appear basic and shallow, but when they are brought to life by an excellent cast, their emotions and experiences come to life as well. \nChartiers Valley brought the characters to life. Moore and Schneider captured the emotional and psychological depth of their characters and made this excellent, complex story that much better. Not only did the audience “attend the tale of Sweeney Todd” as the company suggests in the opening number, they experienced it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:42:03.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
