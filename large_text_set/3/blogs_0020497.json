Reid Nakamura | March 21, 2017 @ 7:06 PM \nA contestant on “Wheel of Fortune” completely blew it on Tuesday, eliciting shocked gasps from the studio audience. \nAfter confidently solving all but one letter of the puzzle, Kevin screwed up the title of the Pulitzer-winning Tennessee Williams play “A Streetcar Named Desire,” guessing the letter “K” instead of the very, very obviously correct answer, “M.” To be fair, you can see how he got there. \nEven host Pat Sajak was stunned into silence by the flub, only able to choke out a short “no” before moving on to the next player, who solved the puzzle no problem.

In the fast money round of \"Family Feud,\" two family members need to get 200 points combined by answering a series of survey questions. In this episode, the first member scored a whopping 182 points, meaning the second member only needed 18 points to win ... which she didn't get. The first question on \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\" is generally the easiest, but this sleep-deprived college student still couldn't manage to get it right. According to one contestant on \"Jeopardy!,\" the electronic music duo LMFAO introduced us to \"It's a Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem).\" Erm, nope, that was definitely Jay-Z. This contestant on “Wheel of Fortune” in May 2012 made it to the bonus round, but failed to guess the magic \"thing\" before time ran out. Clue: It rhymes with wand. \"Black\" was this \"Family Feud\" contestant's answer to \"What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of zombies?\" Host Steve Harvey looked even more astounded when she justified her answer by saying, “I don’t know if they’re white.” Former “American Idol” contestant Kellie Pickler tried to figure out where Budapest is in a November 2007 episode of “Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?” However, after she determined Europe isn’t a country, it all went downhill. According to this contestant on \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?,\" owls squirt ink. Yes, you read that correctly. \"Catch 21\" contestant Kimberly was determined not to give her competitor Beau five points because she didn't want him to be 10 points closer to 21. So she gave her fellow contestant Shawn five points, which boosted his score of 16 to a 21. Someone needs a basic math lesson. You get a car, you get a car, everybody gets a car! “Price Is Right” model Manuela Arbelaez thought she’d lost her job (she didn't) when she accidentally gave away a free car in April 2015. Luckily, the producers thought the goof was hilarious. If this woman on \"Family Feud\" could ask the Wizard of Oz one thing to give her husband it would be -- \"a really big thing.\" Could you be more specific?
