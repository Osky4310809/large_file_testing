Aregbesola, saluting Tinubu on the occasion of his 65th birthday (which comes up today Wednesday) said history has already recorded the former Governor as having found ways where there were none and created opportunities for humanity where many did not see any. The Osun Governor’s message signed by the Director, Bureau of Communication and Strategy, Office of the Governor, Mr Semiu Okanlawon, recognised Tinubu’s immense contributions to the political and economic growth of Nigeria and indeed Africa. It said that Lagos began to emerge as a truly habitable state after what he described as “Tinubu’s mega-development vision” adding that the success story of Lagos has rubbed off on South-West, Nigeria and indeed, the whole of Africa. Aregbesola said Tinubu’s capacity for talent hunt and leadership recruitment are unparalleled adding that his unique ability to spot the best hands for crucial assignments have elevated him to that pedestal of rare leader of men. “Today, we are celebrating a giant pathfinder; one whose contributions to Nigeria’s political and economic growth have provided development scholars serious models for academic studies. This is one Nigerian politician whose politics is known to have impacted heavily on humanity. From Lagos where God used him for the emergence of a new state, to Nigeria as a whole and indeed, the continent of Africa where his influence continues to be felt, Tinubu manifests in our lives in all ramifications,” the statement said The Governor prayed for a longer life for Tinubu just as he expressed the wish that his visions of a greater Nigeria and indeed, the Black race would continue to blossom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:41:56.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
