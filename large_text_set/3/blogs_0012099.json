We just kind of wanted to bring the clowns out, because it’s clownery — it’s ridiculous what’s happening. As America, it just doesn’t seem like we’re very respected right now.” \nHitting YouTube, Wellens pinned a comment on the video, which currently sits at over 3 million views. \n“Oh my god. People are so triggered. This is a short about clowns. Its a whole other universe. If you pay attention when you watch it you might understand. Here is a hint ‘Context” Tell me what you think the message is?” \nIn the same feature article from Billboard, Snoop Dogg called the video right on point. \n“The whole world is clownin’ around, and [Jesse’s] concept is so right on point with the art direction and the reality, because if you really look at some of these motherfuckers, they are clowns,” Snoop said. \n“When I be putting shit out, I don’t ever expect or look for a reaction,” he added. “I just put it out because I feel like it’s something that’s missing. Any time I drop something, I’m trying to fill in a void,” he says. “I feel like it’s a lot of people making cool records, having fun, partying, but nobody’s dealing with the real issue with this fucking clown as president, and the shit that we dealing with out here, so I wanted to take time out to push pause on a party record and make one of these records for the time being.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:44:59.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
