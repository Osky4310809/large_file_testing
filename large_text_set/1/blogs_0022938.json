Statement from the Department of Veterans Affairs on federal hiring freeze \nWASHINGTON - The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced exemptions to the federal hiring freeze in the President’s memo dated January 23 rd , 2017. The authorities outlined in the President’s memo provide VA the ability to continue filling essential positions that provide public safety services to our Veterans. We strongly believe that these exemptions are in line with the President’s intent. \n“The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to exempt anyone it deems necessary for public health and safety, including frontline caregivers,” Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Snyder said. “The President and VA remain committed to seeing that our Veterans receive the quality care and benefits they’ve earned. This is the right thing to do for our Veterans.” \nThe memorandum is available for viewing here . # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T00:59:47.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
