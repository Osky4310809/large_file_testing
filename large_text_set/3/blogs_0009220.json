By covering a radius, microbes respond to music , chaotically extending its surface to generate chaotically concrete shapes reminiscent of human bodies . \nThe video, made by using high-resolution 3D scans, blends surrealistic, colorful shapes. The work was conceived out of a desire to explore the unknown territory of new tools. Coming from a motion design background, Woll Söder wanted to express his visions through Houdini Software, a program that was new to him. \"I've always been a big fan of bright and bold colors. With this project, I wanted to make it more vibrant than what I tend to create,\" says Woll Söder. As a result, many geometric figures fill the entire body surface in a truly organic motion. \nWatch the dark scenes of myriad globs of color gloating and the full video below: \nClick here to see more work of Anton Woll Söder and here for more from CypherAudio. \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T11:54:16.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
