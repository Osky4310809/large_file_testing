The stronger the Bluetooth signal, the closer you were, which helped narrow down your search to a specific area instead of turning your place upside down. \niTunes \nWithout the app, the only option after losing AirPods – and not finding them – is to buy replacements for $69 per earphone, or to buy the entire set all over again for $159. The app was a good solution that cost only $4 from the App Store. \nWe're not sure if Apple's alleged statement posted on Reddit is legitimate, but if it is, it doesn't sound like a good reason to pull the app. Of course, Apple owns the App Store and can do whatever it wants with it, but Apple did approve this app to begin with, and the \"concept\" of finding lost AirPods seems like a quality service that Apple, or some third party, should provide, especially considering the pricey alternative of buying replacements. It would be understandable if the app posed technical issues with your iPhone or AirPods, but again, we'll wait to hear an official explanation from Apple.
