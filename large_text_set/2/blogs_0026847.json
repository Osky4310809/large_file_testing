Joss Whedon wants it. And Scarlett Johansson ? She definitely wants it. But ‘wanting’ doesn’t mean it will actually happen. \nWhile speaking on the red carpet of the Academy Awards , Johansson couldn’t offer any updates about the film’s potential future. \n“I don’t know,” the Avengers: Infinity War actor said. “I don’t know at this point.” \nJohansson has bounced from optimistic to unsure whenever she’s asked about the film, but it seems to be at the forefront of her mind whenever she’s picking new projects. The actor revealed that she’s constantly in contact with the first Avengers director about the possibilities of exploring Natasha Romanoff’s solo career.

As Vin Diesel himself has proven, just because a movie star tweets about wanting to do their own movie doesn’t mean it’s going to happen. *cough* Groot *cough* Black Bolt *cough* \nExcuse me. \nAt least Black Widow will be returning for next year's Avengers: Infinity War .
