A victory at home to Crystal Palace in their next game will move them one step closer to the title. The Italian coach has impressed many with his management style and tactical acumen that has re-invigorated a squad that was failing under Jose Mourinho. Last season Diego Costa was a shadow of the player that lit up the league in his debut season, but under Conte the 28 year old has found his form. Chelsea’s top scorer has 17 goals from 26 appearances, surpassing the 12 goals he scored in the whole of last season. \nThe Spanish International is as combative as ever, and he will relish the challenge of playing against a Crystal Palace defence that has leaked 46 goals in the league. Costa has already beaten them this season, he scored the only goal in Chelsea’s win at Selhurst Park. Costa has bagged seven goals at home this term and is converting 29% of his chances with a shooting accuracy of 59%. He is averaging a goal every 136 minutes, and after going two games without scoring so he is due a goal against Palace. \nDo you think Diego Costa will score against Crystal Palace again?
