Here are the answers we got — and didn't get: Did Trump offer a way forward on health care? He discussed five principles: 1) ensuring that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage; 2) allowing people to use tax credits to purchase their own coverage; 3) giving governors the resources they need with Medicaid; 4) wanting to bring down the high cost of drugs; and 5) allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines. But Trump didn't mention how to pay for this (especially if you repeal the current health law's funding mechanisms). He didn't promise that his plan would cover as many — or more —Americans as the current law does. And note that \"access\" to coverage for those with pre-existing conditions isn't the same as a guarantee of coverage. Did he provide clarity on tax reform? Trump gave a nod to House Speaker Paul Ryan's border-adjustment tax, but it wasn't a full-throated endorsement. \"Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing,\" Trump said. Did he explain how his budget priorities add up? No. Trump discussed tax cuts, increased military spending, more money for infrastructure, paid family leave — but nothing on how to pay for these things while ballooning the size of the deficit. Did Trump extend an olive branch to the millions of Americans who didn't vote for him? Unlike in his inaugural address, Trump made three different mentions of Democrats and Republicans working together. He also called for increased infrastructure spending — something that Democrats have wanted. But there was nothing beyond these platitudes. And when he said the \"time for trivial fights is behind us,\" he signaled to the Democrats in the audience — so hardly a real olive branch. Did he mention what happened in Kansas? Yes and no. He mentioned the violence against two Indian immigrants in Kansas at the top of his remarks. \"Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\" But unlike his description of violence committed by undocumented immigrants, the president didn't go into detail about what happened in Kansas and why. What did Trump say about Russia and North Korea? He didn't mention a single word about either country. How do Democrats treat him? They made some grumbles, withheld their applause (mostly), and headed for the exits right after the speech. But there were no \"You Lie\" outburst. Of course, that's a very low bar.
