No charges were laid. \nThe retired lieutenant-colonel claimed that the attack was racially and culturally motivated after his wife was called a white sl** and a white w***e by the men. \nHowever criticism that he has received about the incident on Facebook persuaded him to set the record straight on the incident. He confirmed that the men were Muslim and said he would ‘do it again in a heartbeat’. \nHardcore. \nLet’s wait for the MSM to condemn Tyrrell for…something. \nThey’ll find a way to manufature a crisis.
