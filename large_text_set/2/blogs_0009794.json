Twitter user Elizabeth Findell tweeted proof of the legislation with this screenshot:\nThis state pic.twitter.com/qCVjSfCgG9\nâ€” Elizabeth Findell (@efindell) February 16, 2017\nThis is real, folks. A group of legislators in Texas took the time to get together in a room to discuss the use of an emoji. You can read the details of the bill here , but here are some highlights that are oh-so-very Texas:\nMost major electronic messaging applications provide a number of flag emojis...\nAll too often, the Chilean flag emoji is used as a substitute for the Lone Star Flag in text messaging and on social media platforms; the Chilean flag proudly represents its country but, despite its similarity to the Texas flag, it does not represent the State of Texas...\n...the 85th Legislature of the State of Texas hereby reject the notion that the Chilean flag, although it is a nice flag , can in any way compare to or be substituted for the official state flag of Texas and urge all Texans not to use the Republic of Chile flag emoji in digital forums when referring to the Lone Star Flag of the great State of Texas.\nGuys, they mean business. Texas is taking this emoji confusion personally and I think we should all respect their plea.\nAfter all, if you do happen to use the wrong emoji when referring to Texas you'll be ... uh ... I don't know. Is there a fine? Do you go to jail? Does someone look through your texts to find out your emoji history? Do you have to flee Texas? Do you get banned from ever using emojis again?\nJust do Texas a favor and don't do it. Please. They're begging you.\nBONUS: Texas woman sought for stealing ring off corpse in funeral home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/efindell", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iMAZIGlQtmJqgf3srXrOuPGMk_w=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F386558%2Fe1464bfc-fc77-4f42-addb-b7f8c1ce2c35.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/roevJT_Au24TJSDqVIbfZujAc1c=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F386576%2F8de2d55a-0d88-44e9-9b69-e2ffb215b1a9.jpg", "https://t.co/qCVjSfCgG9", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/ik8ux6wm.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1DzncWCkNOoIn-mBxsYJtRCe_n8=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F386573%2Ffaac5c7c-d910-4559-ad7e-fa5f231b7a5e.jpg", "http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HC00075I.htm", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kcEUMsuqqt1IG7F3FXby1Ueu6gw=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F386560%2Fb4ac62f8-4fe9-42a0-8a9e-fe19ffb0b86e.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/ik8ux6wm.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/efindell/status/832303434443452416"], "published": "2017-02-17T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:23:36.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
