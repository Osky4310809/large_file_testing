According to local TV news reports, the audio clippings were derived from a hidden camera placed in the bathroom. Joy Matthew, an actor and political activist, slammed the media for such low level journalism which he labeled as ‘political pimping, not journalism.” \nAK Saseendran’s resignation came shortly after controversial audio clippings were released by a new Malayalam TV news channel, allegedly leaking a ”lewd” phone talk that the former Kerala Transport Minister had with a woman. \nIn the latest development, Kerala government has ordered a probe in the matter. However, many Malayalis have slammed the news channel that leaked the audio clippings on the premise that this is taking TV journalism to a low level in Kerala politics and this practice should not be allowed to continue. \nIn Joy Matthew’s Facebook post written in Malayalam, the noted film actor has raised several questions about journalism, professional ethics and why it is that a Minister cannot have a relationship with a woman as long as it is with her consent and not causing any loss to the state exchequer? \nThis is a basic translation of Joy Matthew’s Facebook post written in Malayalam: \n‘This cannot be called journalism – this can be termed as pimping! To record some one’s bathroom scenes with a hidden camera and enjoying it is fast becoming a new form of sensational journalism. For any individual to talk with someone he likes or even mate with the said person is his basic human right and need. To record it without the knowledge of the concerned person and selling the clippings to media barons and for obvious vested interests – this is political pimping of the worst kind. \nCan’t a Minister have a conversation with a woman? Can the same Minister not have sex with a woman if it is with her consent? And if the aforementioned takes place, has the Minister taken anything from the state treasury or caused a loss to the state exchequer for him to be pulled up like this? Has the Minister done anything out of the way or illegal for the said woman? Has the Minister forced the woman or threatened her in any way?’ \nAK Saseendran resigns: Why is NCP hinting at a conspiracy angle? \nHe further states in his Facebook post, “To place a hidden camera in the bathroom, record it and make news out of it is neither journalism nor news. What is tragic is that the Minister chose to resign over the leak of such news. Hope that the Chief Minister will not accept the resignation given the circumstances around it. Today we have news stories breaking from cameras hidden in bathrooms, tomorrow it will be from the toilets – will we accept it? Malayalis will soon have to witness that kind of news too.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T12:48:16.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
