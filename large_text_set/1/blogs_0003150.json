From 5 a.m. wake-ups as a baby to the accidental 2 a.m. buttdials, mothers are always on the clock. In the latest video to go viral on Reddit, it features a mom desperate for a second of alone time. The video is short, at 34 seconds long, but it perfectly captures the joys (and exhaustion) of motherhood.\nIn the video, which was shared by Reddit user Thund3rbolt, a mom seeks refuge from her kids in the family pantry to take a ~tiny~ snack break while their dad is shoveling the driveway.\nCheck out the full LOL video: The tired mom says into the camera,\n“They don’t ever go away. They want everything you have.” The mom pans the camera down the bottom crack in the door to reveal that — despite being alone in the pantry — she’s not actually alone. In the most relatable kid move ever, her kids are just outside the door. \n“See? She’s always there,” the mom says, as her daughter peeks under the door, giving an enthusiastic “hi” to the camera. If this video doesn’t prove the endless work a mother does, we don’t know what does.\nIt’s something all parents can relate to . If you’re not a parent, definitely ask your parents about their experience raising you because chances are, especially if you have siblings, your parents will share some serious exhaustion stories.\nUltimately, we love seeing videos like this circulate around the internet because there’s nothing as relatable as parenthood. Now get some rest, pantry mom!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:05:40.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
