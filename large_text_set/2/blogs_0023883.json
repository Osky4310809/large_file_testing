The title of the book comes from the Greek word for \"preacher\" or \"teacher.\" \nKing Solomon goes through a list of things he tried in seeking fulfillment: career achievements, materialism, alcohol, pleasure , even wisdom. His conclusion? All of it is \"meaningless.\" The King James Version of the Bible translates the word as \"vanity,\" but the New International Version uses \"meaningless,\" a concept most of us find easier to understand. \nSolomon began as a man poised for greatness. Both his wisdom and wealth were legendary in the ancient world. As the son of David and Israel's third king, he brought peace to the land and launched a massive building program. He began to backslide , however, when he took hundreds of foreign wives and concubines. Solomon let their idolatry influence him as he slipped farther away from the True God. \nWith its dire warnings and record of futility, Ecclesiastes could be a depressing book, except for its exhortation that true happiness can be found only in God. Written ten centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ , the book of Ecclesiastes urges today's Christians to seek God first if they want to find purpose in their life. \nSolomon is gone, and along with him his riches, palaces, gardens, and wives. His writing, in the pages of the Bible , lives on. The message for today's Christians is to build a saving relationship with Jesus Christ that guarantees eternal life . Author of the Book of Ecclesiastes \nScholars debate whether Solomon wrote this book or whether it was a compilation of texts done centuries later. Clues within the book about the author lead most Bible experts to attribute it to Solomon.
