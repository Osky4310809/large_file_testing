I can’t say it enough.”\nWhen Bayers was finally free, a friend heard his calls for help and jumped into action, too, shoveling to get the kids out. Bayers suffered a broken fibula and twisted knee in the ordeal, Global News reported, and his son, Ben, received a minor concussion, and the friend, Adam Inch, was uninjured.\nThe story said Bayers wanted to share what happened to raise awareness of this type of snow accident.\n“This isn’t our first snow fort,” he said. “We’ve built tons of snow forts in the past and the goal is to get outside and do things with your kids and have fun, and this one just went wrong.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:08:35.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
