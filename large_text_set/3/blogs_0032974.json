Photo: Getty Images \nThe FFA issued a statement on Friday afternoon confirming the March 31 deadline for reaching an agreement for a new congress would not be met and removed a strict deadline on reaching an agreement. Despite FIFA and AFC approving the previous deadline, the FFA imposed no strict deadline for expanding its new congress, suggesting it must be operational by November's annual general meeting in Sydney. \n\"We will continue to facilitate the dialogue to push for a resolution of these discussions but all stakeholders recognise that the issues require careful examination on a number of levels. Our next annual congress meeting is due in November 2017 and we have agreed with FIFA and AFC to find a resolution with our stakeholders and to ensure there is an expanded FFA Congress at our AGM in November 2017,\" FFA chairman Steven Lowy said. Related Content Football missing out on indigenous talent \nAn FFA statement suggested they have followed calls from stakeholders to delay the decision, which was supported by several state member federations. However, A-League clubs are understood to be furious with the hold-up. Speaking through their united Australian Professional Football Clubs Association, the club owners are awaiting advice from FIFA and AFC before issuing their response. Privately, many expressed their anger with the FFA's delay, labelling it \"flabbergasting\" and \"outrageous\". \nThe FFA is yet to receive 75 per cent support for any proposed new governance structure with only seven state member federations supporting their proposed model, while two others rejected it along with the one vote representing A-League clubs. Their model would see the congress expanded from 10 votes to 13, including nine state federations, three from the A-League clubs and one vote for the players union, the PFA. Advertisement \nFootball NSW and Football Victoria rejected this proposal in preference for an expanded congress of 14, while the A-League clubs and the PFA are demanding 16, that would provide them with five votes and two votes respectively. \nFairfax Media can confirm FIFA rejected the FFA's model of a 13-seat congress, suggesting it was not sufficiently democratic or inclusive to meet requirements. FIFA urged the FFA to consider talks with NPL clubs, who formed the united Association of Australian Football Clubs. \nThe FFA did not confirm whether FIFA and the AFC approve of their decision to delay the expansion of their congress but have kept the two governing bodies informed. \n\"FFA wants to see an expanded Congress for Australia that reflects the way the game is evolving in this country but also safeguards the significant progress made through the reforms of 12 years ago,\" Lowy said. \n\"We have kept FIFA and AFC briefed on progress to date and they understand that the current Congress members and other stakeholders need more time to consider these matters.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T09:35:38.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
