It was a way of expressing England’s greatness while also avoiding any familial responsibilities, and it helped promote the time-honored legacies of both imperialism and racism. Though it takes place relatively recently, director James Gray’s adaptation of David Grann’s The Lost City Of Z is about one such adventure, and it stars Charlie Hunnam as real-life explorer Colonel Percival Fawcett. In this trailer, Fawcett makes a case for why he should go hunting for a hidden civilization deep in the Amazon, and though it definitely looks like he’s going to have an adventure, it probably won’t be as fun as he might have hoped—at least going off of the multiple shots where he and Tom Holland (playing Fawcett’s son) are chased and attacked. \nThis trailer sets up more of the backstory than the last one , and it also makes a point to note that Hunnam’s character says “Zed” instead of “Zee,” just to make it clear that this is an international trailer that isn’t specifically targeted at the United States. \nThe Lost City Of Z will be in theaters on April 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T01:29:32.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
