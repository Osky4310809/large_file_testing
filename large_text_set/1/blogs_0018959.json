The fiasco is thought have cost Samsung in excess of $5.3 billion in monetary terms, and the huge blow to its reputation could yet prove to be even more disastrous.\nSamsung revealed the findings of its internal probe on Monday, saying that neither the software nor hardware were at fault. It concluded that “the batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents.” According to the report, the problems stemmed from insufficient insulation material within the batteries, as well as a design that did not allow enough room to safely accommodate the batteries’ electrodes.\nThe fault likely falls in the hands Samsung’s manufacturers, though the tech giant said it was “taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of the battery design and manufacturing process.”\nSamsung will be hoping to bounce straight back with the Galaxy Note 8, which is said to have a 4K display and a new Bixby AI assistant .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T11:36:18.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
