In the wake of the debt recovery debacle, Helen Hodgson asks if it is time for Centrelink to change tack. \n\"The recipient had made a number of claims that were unfounded and it is the opinion of officers that this was likely to concern other individuals,\" she said. \n\"That's why we felt that it was appropriate to release the information, so that people knew it was important to file their tax returns and tell us about changes in their circumstances. \n\"In this case, our data said that had not occurred and that is why we had been chasing the debt.\" \nMr Tudge and his department claimed the disclosure was legal according to section 202 of the Social Security Act 1999 and section 162 of the A New Tax System Family Administration Act 1999. Release of information may have backfired \nMs Campbell said she did not personally approve the release of the information and claimed she did not need to under these legal provisions. \n\"This allows us to correct the record when a person publicly makes claims that do not accord with our records,\" she said. \"We have had this capacity for many years. \n\"Unfounded allegations do unnecessarily undermine confidence in the department and the social welfare system.\" \nBut social security experts and lawyers believe that the release of the information further undermined public confidence. \nVictorian Legal Aid told the ABC on Wednesday it would change its legal advice to clients to protect their private details from public release by the Government. \n\"We would now have to advise any person who thinks they have an incorrect Centrelink debt that, if they speak publicly about their situation, their confidential information is no longer safe with Centrelink,\" he said. \nPeter Sutherland, a social security legal expert at the Australian National University (ANU), said the department had never made a public disclosure with this specific legal argument. \n\"This appears to be a new practice,\" he said. \nPrivacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim has made inquiries with the department to determine whether any laws were broken.
