WikiLeaks Offers $20,000 Reward For Information On Obama Officials Destroying Documents \nThe present figure represents 12 percent of the entire federal bench and means Trump will have the ability shape the third branch of government in a profound way. \n“If President-elect Trump can put a different face on the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals he could substantially change the course of federal jurisprudence,” Russell Wheeler, a judicial nominations expert with the liberal Brookings Institution, told CNN. \nThe high number of openings comes despite Obama successfully appointing more judges (329) to the bench than President George W. Bush did (326).   \nTrump offered a list of 21 conservative judges from which he would pick to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, which may offer insight into the type of judges he would be looking for to fill lower court vacancies. \n“ The freedoms we cherish and the constitutional values and principles our country was founded on are in jeopardy. The responsibility is greater than ever to protect and uphold these freedoms and I will appoint justices, who like Justice Scalia, will protect our liberty with the highest regard for the Constitution,” Trump said in September. \nThe president-elect stated at the time that the Federalist Society, the Heritage Foundation and other individuals helped him compile the list. Presumably, these conservative groups would be involved in assisting him with the lower court openings, as well.
