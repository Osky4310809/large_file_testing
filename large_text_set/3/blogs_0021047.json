So far, there is, however, no evidence that could prove the allegations. FBI representatives declined to comment to McClatchyDC on this issue.\nRussia has repeatedly denied the accusations of the US intelligence agencies over its alleged involvement in the US election campaign . Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called them absurd and did not exclude that it was another attempt to demonize Russia. \nOn Monday, FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Admiral Michael Rogers testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee on the alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election. US House Intel Committee Chiefs Agree on Scope of Russia Election Probe During the hearing, both Comey and Rogers repeated the conclusions written in the US intelligence report released in January, which was mostly based on media publications and social media. They also confirmed that Russia did not in any way affect the vote tallies in the US.\nComey also said that the FBI's investigation into the alleged Russia's interference in the US election campaign that started in July is still underway . \nThe Russophobia trend has become especially evident in the fake news campaign that is designed to counter alleged Russian propaganda. In November 2016, the European Parliament voted in favor of a resolution, which said that Sputnik and RT posed a danger to Europe's unity and called for extra European Commission funding for counter-propaganda projects. It also drew a parallel between the Russian media and the propaganda disseminated by Daesh, a jihadist group outlawed in Russia and numerous other states. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:26:37.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
