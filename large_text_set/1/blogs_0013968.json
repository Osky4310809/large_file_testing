More RAM directly translates into better multitasking and performing complex tasks more smoothly. Consequently, smartphone vendors have been packing as big as much as 8GB of RAM to make these pocket-computers snappier and quicker. Recently, Samsung announced its first 6GB RAM equipped smartphone dubbed the Galaxy C9 Pro in China, and has now brought the device to our shores. Naturally, questions arise as to how well it stacks up against the current 6GB RAM favourite, the OnePlus 3T ( review )? Well, let’s find out. Design and display \nBoth the OnePlus 3T and the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro have been crafted using unibody metal designs, which gives both the smartphones a sturdy build. However, the metallic backs of the two smartphones makes them prone to accidental slips, so we’d recommend you to slap on a case or a skin to avoid unpleasant trips to the service centres. \nThe difference between the two smartphones becomes quite apparent when we look at the displays. While the OnePlus 3T sports a moderately sized 5.5-inch full HD display, the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro is a phablet and comes with a 6-inch full HD display. Naturally, the pixel density on the OnePlus 3T will be higher than the C9 Pro, making texts and images pop out more. As for the display technologies, both smartphone vendors have backed their respective displays with AMOLED panels. Both the devices feature fingerprint sensors up front on their respective home buttons as well. Performance, storage and software \nThe OnePlus 3T seems to be better than the Galaxy C9 Pro when it comes to performance. While the former is powered by the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 821 processor, the latter is powered by a mid-tier Snapdragon 653 chip. Be it gaming or performing everyday tasks like opening and closing apps, the 3T should perform a lot better than the competition. As stated earlier, both the smartphones come with 6GB of RAM for multitasking. For storage, the OnePlus 3T comes in two different variants of 64GB and 128GB, with neither of the two models supporting a microSD card for further expansion of storage. The Galaxy C9 Pro on the other hand, comes with 64GB of internal memory with room for a microSD card slot as well. Software-wise, both the smartphones boot Android Marshmallow, but an Android Nougat update is now available for the OnePlus 3T. The software experience on the 3T will be fairly close to stock. On the other hand, users will have to deal with Samsung’s TouchWiz skin on the Galaxy C9 Pro. Camera, battery and connectivity \nFor cameras, both the 3T and the C9 Pro come furnished with a pair of 16MP cameras on the back as well as the front, making either of the two smartphones a great buy for photography and selfie-enthusiasts alike. \nOn the battery front, the C9 Pro is fuelled by a 4,000mAh battery where as the 3T sources power from a 3,400mAh cell. Seeing as both the batteries power identical resolution displays and taking into account the power-efficient processing cores of the Snapdragon 653 chip, the C9 Pro should give its users a much better battery life than the 3T. Both the smartphones come with standard connectivity options along with support for 4G VoLTE. \nThe C9 Pro has been priced at Rs 36,900, which is similar to the OnePlus 3T. So which smartphone should you opt for? If your interests lie in gaming or other intensive tasks, we’d recommend you to go with the OnePlus 3T. However, if you consume a lot of media or watch a lot of movies on your smartphone, the C9 Pro with its bigger display and battery will not let you down.
