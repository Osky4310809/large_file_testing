After giving the remaining six women enoughÂ time to descend into a panic about whether they were next, Nick stopped by their hotel room to apologize for his very dramatic behavior the night before and informed them thatÂ he wasnâ€™t going anywhere. Everyone breathed a big sigh of relief as if it was actually ever remotely a possibility that ABC would let the Bachelor peace out mid-season, and they went on their merry to way to Bimini.\nONE-ON-ONE WITH VANESSA The first one-on-one in Bimini was with Vanessa. Corinne â€” the only one who hasnâ€™t gotten an official one-on-one date with Nick yet â€” didnâ€™t take this news well at all.\nCorinne: â€œNow Iâ€™m getting frustrated. And Iâ€™m really bloated.â€\nBachelorÂ villains, theyâ€™re just like us!\nNick and Vanessa spent the day lounging on a yacht, and Vanessa revealed that she had never been on a boat before. TBH the fact that she chose to wear giant gold hoops was already a dead giveaway. They also went snorkeling and didÂ a lot of underwater making out, whichÂ definitely doesnâ€™t look worth all the effort it requires.\nDuring the evening portion of their date, Vanessa decided she was going to tell Nick she was falling in love with him. Nick gave her what can only be described as the most long-winded â€œUm, thanks, I like you tooâ€ responseÂ ever, and Vanessa was less than pleased.\nRELATED:Â We Stalked the Bachelor Contestants on Instagram So You Donâ€™t Have To â€”Â Hereâ€™s What We Learned \nGROUP DATE WITH KRISTINA, CORINNE AND RAVEN The group date this week was extremely important because it was the only date where a rose was up for grabs â€” meaning whoever received it wasÂ guaranteedÂ a hometown date next week. Kristina, Corinne and Raven were chosen for the group date, which once againÂ consisted of spending the day on a yacht. Clearly not a whole lot else to do in Bimini.\nThe tension sparked betweenÂ Kristina and Corinne â€” who, by the way, has been on, like, way bigger boats beforeÂ â€” the second Nick started to rub sunscreen on Kristinaâ€™s inner thigh. Then things got even more dramaticÂ when they jumped off the boat to swim with sharks and Kristina totally chickened out, prompting Nick to rush to her sideÂ and comfort her, abandoning the two other women in the water.\nCorinne was entirelyÂ too focused on the attention Nick was giving Kristina, which Raven used to her advantage in order to slip completely under the radar for almost the entire date â€” until she won the rose.Â This girl knows how to play the game.\nRELATED:Â The Bachelorâ€™ s Nick Viall Says He Fell for More Than One Woman This Season: â€˜Itâ€™s Truly Amazingâ€™ \nONE-ON-ONE WITH DANIELLE M. Danielle M. was the veryÂ first girl to score a one-on-one date this season. If you thought that meantÂ she and Nick would have tons to catch up on since it had been a while, you are sadly mistaken.\nThis date got awkward when Nick and Danielle ran out of things to talk about within five minutes. Then it got even more uncomfortable when Danielle started to talk about her dead fiancĂŠ right around the same time Nick realizedÂ he was going to be sending her home.\nDanielle: â€œItâ€™s scary because the last time I was in love with someone they died.â€\nAnd there went Nick,Â doingÂ that thingÂ again. You know, that thing where he looks incredibly pained and refuses to make eye contact. He did it with Danielle L. after she told him she was falling for him right before he eliminated her, and he did it with Danielle M. this week.Â The Danielles are cursed! \nNick: Â â€œIâ€™m sorry. Youâ€™re just so great.â€\nDanielle: Â â€œNot great enough.â€\nThis embed is invalid\nThat was almost too painful to watch.\nCORINNE IT TO WIN IT After Danielle was sent home, Corinne decided it was time to take matters into her own hands to secure her spot this week. Remember, her heart is gold, but her vagine is platinum , people.\nCorinne got all dressed up in skintight black pants, a plunging shirt and heels she couldnâ€™t walk in and snuck off to surprise Nick in his room. They shared a bottle of champagne and started making outÂ and Corinne promptly suggested they move the partyÂ from theÂ living room into the bedroom.\nThere were no cameras in the bedroom, but both of them were still micâ€™ed so we got to hear lots of tongue action followed by Nick asking Corinne to â€œslow downâ€ becauseÂ as â€œtemptingâ€ as she was, heâ€™s learned that itâ€™s â€œalways best to wait in these instances.â€\nWow, Nick actually kept it in the pants. Who knew he had that kind of self-control?\nRELATED:Â Corinne Olympiosâ€™ Most Outrageous Moments (So Far) \nONE-ON-ONE WITH RACHEL The next morning, Nick and Rachel spent the day enjoyingÂ Bimini at a â€œlocals-onlyâ€ bar. It only took one beer for Nick to oh-so-subtly ask Rachel ifÂ he was the first white guy she would beÂ bringing home.\nNick: Â â€œUm, will I be similar to guys youâ€™ve dated before? Will I be different? Be more specific!â€\nTurns out Rachel has dated white guys butÂ never brought one home. Also her federal judge fatherÂ likes to go by â€œSir.â€ Godspeed, Nick.\nRELATED VIDEO:Â Nick Viall Teases How His â€˜Bachelorâ€™ Run Ends: â€˜It Ended the Way It Should Haveâ€™ \nÂ \nA SURPRISEÂ ELIMINATION After RachelÂ and Nickâ€™s date, Nick met up with Chris Harrison to let him know that he had made up his mind about which lady he would be sending home butÂ that he didnâ€™t want to do it atÂ a traditional rose ceremony because he wanted their goodbyeÂ to be as â€œpersonalâ€ and as â€œprivateâ€ as possible. Not likeÂ it was going to be televised four months later or anything.\nSo Nick showed up at the girlsâ€™ villa and took Kristina outside for the dreaded breakup. Nick was crying, Kristina was crying â€” it was all very unpleasant. How many more of these do we have to get through?! Hang in there, Bachelor Â Nation.Â Weâ€™re almost at the finish line.\nThe Bachelor airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:48:45.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
