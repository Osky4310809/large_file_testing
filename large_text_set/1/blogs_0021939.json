Esta mañana hemos informado a la Casa Blanca que no asistiré a la reunión de trabajo programada para el próximo martes con el @POTUS . \n— Enrique Peña Nieto (@EPN) January 26, 2017 \nIt says, roughly, that this morning, he let the White House know that the meeting planned for next Tuesday is canceled. \nWe already knew how the former president felt about the wall and whether or not Mexico will be paying for it, but this is definitely a step above that. For a current president to cancel a meeting when tensions regarding the wall are so high sends a pretty strong message about the severity of the issue. \n[image: screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
