CREDIT: AP Photo/Chris O’Meara Nearly a dozen Jewish community centers reported phoned-in bomb threats on Monday, following a disturbing uptick in anti-Semitic scares and harassment in recent months. Yet President Trump — known for immediately tweeting his outrage over international Islamic attacks and threats on U.S. soil before all the facts are known— stayed silent until Tuesday morning.\nThe bomb threats over the past few weeks turned out to be hoaxes, but they were likely motivated by anti-Semitism, according to a press release by the JCC Association of North America . In a separate incident on Monday, almost 200 tombstones were desecrated in St. Louis, including sites holding the remains of Holocaust survivors.\n“Hatred and hate-motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in response to a request by NBC News reporter Peter Alexander on Monday. “The President has made it abundantly clear that these actions are unacceptable.”\nBut the president had not said such actions “are unacceptable” as of Monday night. In fact, it took until Tuesday morning for the president to respond to the wave of anti-Semitic threats at all. During remarks from the National Museum of African American History, Trump said, “Anti-Semitism is horrible, and it’s going to stop.” Trump also said he would never pass up an opportunity to denounce anti-Semitism.\n“Wherever I get a chance, I do it,” Trump said.\nTrump: anti-Semitic threats targeting Jews are \"a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate &amp; prejudice &amp; evil\" https://t.co/amGUFjnxw3 \n —  @BraddJaffy \n“This tour was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms,” the president continued. “The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.”\nTrump later told reporters that he would visit the Holocaust Museum because it was “very important to me,” according to a White House pool report from the National Museum of African American History.\nBut the president has largely failed to condemn the recent surge of anti-Semitic threats in the United States, a point that prominent Jews have noticed.\nyou cant shout down the truth. there is a simple Q all Americans want answered: what will @POTUS do to halt the surge of #antisemitism?\n —  @JGreenblattADL \nIn a memorable exchange with Jewish reporter Jake Turx during a press conference last week, Trump interrupted Turx’s question about the wave of anti-Semitic threats, saying it was “not a fair question” and demanding that the reporter “sit down.” Trump went on to defend himself as “the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.”\nThere have been a record number of hate incidents since Trump was elected president, including 70 instances of anti-Semitic hatred according to our post-election tracking of hate incidents.\nAll three times Trump declined to denounce anti-Semitism this week \nThe administration has been largely silent when it comes to attacks on Jews (and Muslims) thus far. On International Holocaust Remembrance Day , the White House released a presidential proclamation that omitted the words “Jewish” and “Jews.” Prominent anti-Semites like Richard Spencer and former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke endorsed Trump’s candidacy and presidency, as ThinkProgress previously reported . And his supporters have long harassed and sent death threats to Jewish reporters.\nThe president and other administration officials have been quick to condemn horrific incidents that do not exist, however. Trump recently suggested that something horrific had taken place in Sweden , allowing him to justify plans to restrict travel to the United States.\nTrump claims he denounces anti-Semitism ‘wherever I get a chance.’ Actually, he doesn’t. was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:49:27.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
