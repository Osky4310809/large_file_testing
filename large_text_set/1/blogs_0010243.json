We need an Atom and Humber banner at the Emirates. Alexis will stay for life. His dogs are his life. Respect them and he will respect you. \nLiverpool stink up St. Mary's \nTwitter user @aliladiere explained to Goal how the idea came about after seeing a photo of the dogs on Sanchez’s Instagram account. \n\"It was just a tweet I thought of as I was looking at Alexis' Instagram. It's just a bit of fun - then I get people agreeing with me and sending in photos!\" \n\"The real credit goes to the Arsenal fans for sharing it and to the RedAaction fan group. They're making it a reality, so let's hope he likes it” \n\"I hope Alexis sees what he means to the club and our fans. We can have different opinions on many things but every Arsenal fan wants Alexis to stay” \nSanchez has previously starred alongside his dogs for a Chilean dog food advert and Gunners fan group REDAction have revealed that plans are in place for two banners to makes their debut when Arsenal play Burnley on January 22.
