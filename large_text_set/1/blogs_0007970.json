The company is now selling its two current and unlocked Android smartphones, the Le S3 and Le Pro3 , on Target’s website.\nSee also: Going into 2017, these are the Chinese smartphone makers to look out for November 29, 2016 When it first began selling those smartphones in the US, LeEco went down the “flash sale” route , giving consumers a short window of just a few hours at a time to purchase its products. After a few weeks, it began a more conventional sales strategy, offering the phones on its own site, as well as Amazon and Best Buy .\nNow it has expanded that reach to Target, selling the Le S3 phone for $249.99 in Gray and Gold colors and the higher-end Gold colored Le Pro3 for $399.99 on its site. There’s no word on if LeEco’s phones will be sold at Target’s brick-and-mortar stores as well.\nThis new outlet for the company’s phones comes even as LeEco is still dealing with some lingering financial issues. The most recent reports on that front claim that the company is trying to get as much as $1.4 billion in new funding from some mysterious investors. Hopefully it will be able to keep its operations going as it tries to compete with all the other China-based smartphone companies that are trying to gain a foothold in the US.\nGet it at Target ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:12:07.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
