I’ve watched Dream Girls a couple of hundred times. \n“It was amazing to sing for her, but for her to acknowledge me as a singer has given me a whole new lease of life and confidence.” Goodbye: Kit Rice with Jennifer Hudson on The Voice \nHe continued: “I was completely star struck – and I don’t get star struck that often. I think I was stumbling over my words. She was lovely to me – it was a dream come true.” \nRice – who toured with Ed Sheeran and Sir Tom Jones on graduating from the BRIT School – said he has received a number of “knockbacks” in the industry but has never considered turning hbis back on music.
