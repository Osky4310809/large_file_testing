If it comes, I will be more than happy to give it a thought…,” he said. He was responding to a poser on his future plans after the Samajwadi Party expelled him. The Rajya Sabha secretariat has since declared him as a member without any party affiliation. Asked to elaborate what he meant by “graceful opportunity”, Singh said it would not be a “hurried decision” and he would take a call keeping in mind his past experiences. He told PTI in an interview that since he has been expelled twice by the Samajwadi Party, he would not return to it in future. \nWatch this video I don’t allow my kids to watch Amar Singh on TV, says Dimple Yadav to @saahilmenghani \nFull interview: http://t.co/c5nKpasTeu pic.twitter.com/18uffhLmEU \n— News18 (@CNNnews18) March 3, 2017 \nSingh, who had defied the Samajwadi Party by defending demonetisation, said he has not talked to anyone in the BJP on the issue of joining that party. To a question on whether he could be heading the Congress way, Singh was critical of the role the party played during the cash-for-vote scam case in which he had spent time in Tihar jail. \nThe one-time close confidante of Mulayam, Singh has of late been critical of the role the SP patron played during the family feud of the Yadavs. \n“It was a programmed drama in which all of us were given a role. I subsequently realised that we are being used… I came to realise it was a ploy to distract from the anti-incumbency, law and order situation,” he had said. “Mulayam loves being defeated at the hands of his son. Cycle (SP’s election symbol), son, and SP are his weaknesses. Even at polling day, the entire family went (to vote) together. So why all the drama?” Amar asked. \nThe Samajwadi Party went through a bitter power struggle between Mulayam and Akhilesh, with the latter taking the fight to the Election Commission and, ultimately, winning the battle and the party symbol. Amar has been blamed by a section of the party leadership for creating fissures between Mulayam and Akhilesh. \n(With agency inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:09:10.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
