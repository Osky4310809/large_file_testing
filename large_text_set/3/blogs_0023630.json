The new Ninja Inferno is a Shogun Inferno-Lite looking to take advantage of the Apple Pro-Res 10-bit 4:2:2 4K 60p the Panasonic G H5 spits out over its HDMI 2.0 connection. \nIf you happened to pre-order the G H5 , you may already know the shipping firmware can internally record 4K UHD 60pâ€”but only in 4:2:0 8-bit, and tops off its 4K UHD 10-bit 4:2:2 at 30p limited to 150Mbps . The Ninja Inferno will give you the added bump with a slew of features priced at $1,000 less than its big brother (at $995). \nWith the Ninja Inferno, you're getting the same ABS polycarbonate 7.1\" touchscreen with 1920 x 1200 resolution and 10-bit processing; the same AtomHDR support providing 1500nit brightness for Rec. 709 or HDR PG/HLG monitoring and log formats for Sony, ARRI, Panasonic, JVC and RED; the same hot swappable dual battery system for continuous power; the same HDMI start/stop recording triggers, as well as conversions for interlace video to progressive with 3:2 and 2:2 pulldown. \nThe specs of Ninja Inferno are nearly identical to Shogun Inferno. So, what's missing? SDI and RAW recording support. \nThe monitor-recorder can only provide a uncompressed true 10-bit or 8-bit 4:2:2 over HDMI 2.0 up to 4K 60p to Apple Pro-Res (HQ, 422, LT) or Avid DNxHR (HQX,HQ,SQ,LB) codecs. It's also capable of accepting a 4K DCI signal from cameras like the Panasonic GH4 / DVX200 / HCX1000 / UX180 / HCX1, Sony FS7 / Z100 and the JVC LS300. \nAs a monitor, you can use X -Rite's i1DisplayPro to calibrate the screen or pull up playback controls and familiar features like focus peaking, zebra lines, false color, frame guides, waveform, and more. You can generate playlists and XML tagging as well. Ninja Inferno Credit: Atomos \nFor the audio-conscious, two channels of balanced XLR analog audio can provide 48V phantom power; or, you can tap into two or eight channels of 24-bit audio over HDMI. There's also an option 48V stereo XLR breakout cable to connect and power external microphones. Included in the box is a Master Caddy, 12V-3A AC adapter, and travel case. \nAtomos dropped the price of Shogun Flame from $1,695 to $995 and Ninja Flame to $795 from $1,295. Both models ship with a power supply, recording caddy, and travel case, with the Shogun Flame getting the added bonus of an XLR breakout cable. Lastly, Atomos developed an Accessory Kit ($295) and a Power Kit ($149) for users to power, control, dock, and charge the units.
