Here are the highlights: \n• Trump began the event by criticizing BuzzFeed and CNN for reporting Tuesday that U.S. intelligence officials briefed him on allegations that Russia could have compromising information about him. It “would be a tremendous blot on their record\" if intelligence agencies leaked the documents that CNN and BuzzFeed reported, Trump said. Story Continued Below \n“I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies — who knows? — but maybe the intelligence agencies, which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that — a tremendous blot — because a thing like that should havenever been written, it should never have been had and it should certainly never have been released,” he said. \n• Trump admitted: “As far as hacking, I think it was Russia.” After months of rejecting the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia meddled in the U.S. presidential election, he conceded Wednesday that he believes Russia conducted cyberattacks . “But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people,” he continued. \n• Trump said in his opening statement that he will nominate David Shulkin for secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Trump said he interviewed more than 100 people — “some good, some not so good” — but that his selection of Shulkin will straighten out the VA. “Speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin,” Trump said. “And we'll do a news release in a little while.” He added that Shulkin is “fantastic” and “will do a truly great job.” \n• Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer opened the news conference slamming BuzzFeed news. “It's frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elect's campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office,” Spicer told a room of at least 250 reporters. “According to BuzzFeed’s own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report.”• BuzzFeed and CNN ran with an “unsubstantiated claim,” Spicer said, calling it “a sad and pathetic effort to get clicks.” “For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful,” he added, before introducing Vice President-elect Mike Pence. “With that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T19:02:45.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
