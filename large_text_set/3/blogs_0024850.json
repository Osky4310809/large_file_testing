PPD | AP, file \nMANILA, Philippines - The word war between President Duterte and detained Sen. Leila de Lima raged on yesterday, with De Lima praying that “Satan may be saved from his potty mouth.” \nIn a handwritten statement she issued from her detention cell at the Philippine National Police Custodial Center in Camp Crame, De Lima lamented that Duterte continues to attack her with “libelous statements” despite already having jailed her on what she said were trumped up drug charges. \n“Unsatisfied with the fact that he was already able to imprison me, he continues to destroy me before various audiences like a market fishwife and leaves no dignity whatsoever to the office he holds,” the senator said. \nIn his speech before the Filipino community in Bangkok, Thailand on Thursday, Duterte called De Lima the “queen of Satan” whom he will meet in hell. \nDe Lima shot back, saying, “Miracles do happen. This is my fervent prayer so that he may be saved from hell and so that Satan may be saved from his potty mouth.” \nShe said she prayed for a miracle that Duterte would have a “lucid, Fentanyl-free interval and be enlightened in Thailand, like the way Gautama Buddha achieved enlightenment.”   \nDe Lima said that whatever attacks made against her by the President, these would not come close to how Duterte has betrayed the Philippines by selling it to China. \n“Our territories, which our ancestors fought for and were recognized by the arbitral tribunal at The Hague, are being sold by our current leader,” De Lima said. \nDe Lima also called Duterte a “madman” responsible for the extrajudicial killings of thousands of Filipinos since his days as mayor of Davao City until now as President. \n“Sooner or later, the long arm of the law, domestic or international, will catch up with the chief architect of the mass murders and his enforcers and cheerers,” she added. \nDe Lima also warned that Duterte’s liability for atrocities under international human rights law, including the Rome Statute, extends not only to him as “actual perpetrators or direct participants” but also to those who tolerate and condone them. – With Marvin Sy  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:11:32.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
