The Freebandz leader stood on the sidelines as his hometown Atlanta Falcons beat Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Divisional Playoffs 36-20 yesterday (January 14). Wilson, who is married to Future‚Äôs ex-fianc√©e Ciara and is expecting a child with her, went 17-of-30 for two touchdowns and two interceptions in the loss, which ended the Seahawks‚Äô season. Future is here, Falcons fans https://t.co/IxT7Wwrnrz pic.twitter.com/xIrqSO24wU \nThe Falcons refrained from playing any of Future‚Äôs music during the game, with head coach Dan Quinn saying days before the matchup that ‚Äú We will absolutely not go down that road .‚Äù \nBut the internet wasn‚Äôt letting Wilson off so easily. Especially with another of Ciara‚Äôs exes, Bow Wow , at the game. There was plenty of pettiness from the streets of Twitter whether the Falcons wanted it or not.
