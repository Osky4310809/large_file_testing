I feel so blessed and super humbled to be a part of such an empowering brand. Thank you @cosmopolitansa and @johnsiavis for taking such good care of me. Click the link in my bio to check out the interview. A post shared by Blac Chyna (@blacchyna) on Mar 17, 2017 at 5:05pm PDT \nIn the spread, the former stripper says she's \"in it for the long haul\" with the KUWTK star even though they constantly fight and bicker.\n\"I feel like every person who's in a long-term relationship, or who is committed to their person, goes through ups and downs... Everything isn't always going to be peaches and cream. If it is, then it's fake. I'm in it for the long haul, so I feel like my advice [for anyone in a similar situation] is therapy, know each other's family, calling each other's moms.\" \nAlthough the 28-year-old acknowledges their relationship isn't \"perfect,\" they are doing everything they can to stay a couple. \n\"I feel like everything isn't going to be perfect, but I know we love each other and we're fighting for each other, and the people we surround ourselves with are rooting for us. It makes everything much easier.\" \nNot surprisingly, the glue that keeps them together is their daughter Dream.\n\"And we also have Dream. So we're looking at the bigger picture. We have a whole other human being that looks up to us, so we have to makes sure she's taken care of.\" \nDespite their differences, Chyna will always admire Rob for his parenting skills. \n\"He's a wonderful dad. I think it's because he had such a great father.\" \nThe same goes for ex Tyga . Although the two have had drama -- considering he later went on to date Rob's sister Kylie Jenner -- they keep things positive for their son King.\n\"It's important to me and Tyga no to have negative energy... Kids breathe energy... You have to learn to forgive and forget. Many people don't like to forgive others. Even if someone does something awful to you, you need to forgive them to be able to move on with your life. You can't hold on to that stuff because it'll make you a bitter person and it'll block your blessings. You need to let it go and be free.\" \nAs we reported , Rob and Chyna broke up in February with a source citing his \"insecurities,\" and her turbulent relationship with the Kardashian family. It is unclear whether this interview happened before (or after) the split, and whether Chyna feels the same way today.\nNever a dull moment with these two! \n[ Image via WENN . ] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T04:07:08.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
