Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA couple of childhood sweethearts are fighting to get a few more years together after one was diagnosed with a shock brain tumour shortly after they were reunited. \nChris McGregor, 33, has been struggling to recover since he received the devastating news in 2013. \nPartner Lauren Rigby said the diagnosis came less than a year after the pair began dating, having been reunited for the first time since their early teens. \nHeartbreaking photos show Chris, a forklift driver and doorman from Speke, as a young boy with his arm around baby Lauren, now 28, as their mums were close friends.

About nine months into our relationship he was diagnosed.

But it would give him the opportunity to see his son finish school, give his son memories, and I can’t imagine life without him.” \nShe wrote on the gofundme.com page: “He spent two weeks looking like Mr Bump. He got words muddled and even made up some new ones. Chris McGregor with his son (Photo: Lauren Rigby) \n“He would forget he had put the bath on or even if he had taken his medication. I heartbreakingly watched the soft, gentle giant, kind man I love become an anxious, shy loner.” \nBut she added: “There has been such generosity from family and from people we have never met. He’s finding chemo really difficult, but the sense people want to help him has really picked him up.” \nVisit the fundraising page here and get more information on brain tumours here .
