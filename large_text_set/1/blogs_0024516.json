The 28-year-old UFC champion discussed a variety of topics Saturday, but perhaps the most intriguing were his thoughts on a potential bout against boxing champion Floyd Mayweather. \"I have my eyes on one thing right now, and that's Floyd Mayweather,\" McGregor said . \"That fight is more than just being explored. There's a lot of steps, but it's the fight to make. It's the fight I want. I believe this is the first billion fight, so people have to pay for a billion dollar fight. I believe it will happen at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year.\" Not only did he say his next fight will be in a boxing ring, McGregor went on to explain that a bout against Mayweather \"would be the easiest fight ever.\" Although the Irish star is a great striker, he is planning to face a boxer who was 49-0 in his career before retiring. Beyond the potential struggles that could come from transitioning between sports, getting Mayweather to agree to a fight of this nature likely won't be too easy. Meanwhile, the 39-year-old boxer isn't the only enemy McGregor has discussed as of late. He also questioned the lack of popularity of his own league. \"There's more people here than currently at the UFC event right now,\" he said . \"That should tell you everything you need to know. Right now there’s something humongous that needs to be done, and it doesn ’t really involve them, even though they think it does.\" With one star in Ronda Rousey fading and another one considering a move to boxing, it doesn 't bode well for the fast-growing league. What we do know is he has left the door open for a possible move to WWE , notably saying \"never say never.\" At the very least, fans should follow McGregor news in 2017 because there are a lot of possibilities for the young fighter.
