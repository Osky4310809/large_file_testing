The charges were later changed to “voluntary violence,” sparking controversy. \nThe man alleges that the police officers used force during an ID check on Thursday, with one of them thrusting his baton into his anus. The alleged assault took place not in a vehicle or at the police station, but on the street, he said, as cited by AFP. \nThe man suffered severe wounds, underwent emergency surgery, and was advised by doctors to stay away from work for 60 days, sources close to the investigation told French media. \nThe local public prosecutor’s office has launched an investigation into the incident, to be carried out by the General Inspector of the National Police (IGPN). \nThe alleged assault took place in the commune of Aulnay-Sous-Bois and was captured on film by surveillance cameras belonging to local police, which shows a police officer delivering a horizontal blow with his baton to the buttocks of the young man after his pants “dropped by themselves,” AFP reported , citing a source close to the investigation. \nParts of the video from a surveillance camera, showing a dark-skinned man subdued by police at a distance, have been released by Le Parisien TV. A witness in the video report shows blood at the alleged site of the man’s interaction with police. \nThe young man was taken to the hospital. The doctor who examined him said he had suffered “a longitudinal wound in the anal canal” and “a section of the sphincter muscle.” \nArriving at the police station, the young man complained “of bleeding in the mouth and anus,” a source close to the investigation told Le Parisien.

We, the Aulnaysians [those living in Aulnay-Sous-Bois], can not understand this requalification. It is perceived as a misrepresentation of the truth.” \nThe post has collected dozens of comments with many praising the mayor for his stance, while others urging to wait and see for the results of the investigation. Some have been doubting the mayors sincerity, accusing him of making the statement only for the sake of appeasing “the young people who would be ready for a new ‘uprising’ in the suburbs.” \nThere have already been reports of tensions in the commune with a population of 3,000 people, with a car being burnt and an attempt to set a bus on fire Saturday night, according to a police source cited by Le Figaro.
