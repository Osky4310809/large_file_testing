Obama really poisoned the well of freedom. Share on Facebook Share Tweet Email Email Print Advertisement - story continues below \nEven though we now have, in my opinion, a very capable and honorable U.S. president in Donald J. Trump, a man committed to reversing all of the damage inflicted upon our great nation by President Barack Obama, that chore is monumental in scope. Obama and his team of Marxist-socialist-Islamist activists had a free hand for the past eight years, plotting and embedding counterproductive leftist operatives throughout our government during his time in office. \nIn June 2016, Daniel Horowitz of Conservative Review said : \nThere’s something called CVE, countering violent extremism. It’s not just an Orwellian term to expunge any mention of Islamic terror and make it about a kind of generic extremism, including so-called right-wing extremism; it’s a term of art. It is a very specific term concocted by the Muslim Brotherhood front groups like CAIR . They have successfully introduced this lexicon in our [Department of Homeland Security]. These people are most commonly found in the Homeland Security Advisory Council, as well as the civil rights and civil liberties division of DHS. \nObama’s appointments throughout the government and its many agencies have been cited as establishing a shadow government , or what has been called a “ deep state. ” Even though Obama is no longer in office, it seems that he continues to command an army of activists that is largely made up of an alliance of left-wing Marxist-socialists and Islamists , an army that numbers 30,000. \nAs a further part of an apparent Saul Alinsky strategy where disasters are created and utilized to destabilize opposing political parties, Obama also pardoned and released many proven enemies of the nation, including Islamic terrorists whose recidivism rate was known to be high, thereby placing Americans back into their sights during the term of a newly elected president.
