Why? She believes he is seeking more executive power. He's making this up out of thin air, she mused, because it's something he wishes he could do. \n\"Maybe he's projecting that's something he'd like to do,\" she told the anchors on \"CBS This Morning\" on Tuesday. Do you think Trump is just making this up? Pelosi: Yes. pic.twitter.com/HTUABtFRJf — Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) March 7, 2017 \n“Once again, the president doesn’t know what he’s talking about because first of all, the president cannot do that,” she said. “That isn’t what President Obama did or could do.” \nThe Democrats are not the only ones doubting Trump's wiretap assertion. To the White House's frustration, FBI Director James Comey reportedly told his agency to refute the president's claim. \nThe good news is Congress intends to get to the bottom of it. After all, there is a paper trail they can follow, according to Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC). \nPelosi also appeared on CBS to rant against the GOP's new draft to repeal and replace Obamacare, calling it an \"extreme\" plan that only benefits the wealthy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:51:55.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
