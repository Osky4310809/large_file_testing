Then, when Ken finds Chloe alone, she lies that she and Peter are having an affair and he’s back on the booze. Horrified, Ken seeks out Toyah – who is starting her IVF – to warn her. \nWe catch up with Jo-Anne as she gets her teeth into the role – and the reformed Barlow bad boy... \nYou first appeared on Corrie in 1995, as a nurse. Do you still feel like the new girl? \nIt always feels that way. I still remember my first appearance standing on the street outside the factory, and I feel the same now. Jo-Anne has acted in all the soaps (Photo: ITV) Read More Coronation Street grooming storyline made me share the horror of being sexually abused by my stepdad \nWho do you share a dressing room with? \nI’m on my own! But one of my closest friends is Sally Ann Matthews, who plays Jenny. We’ve known each other since we were nine. I’ve also known Bev Callard (Liz McDonald) for 20 years. \nYou’ve been in all the soaps, so which is the best? \nI think you probably know the answer to that!

He gets quite aggressive, warning her off, and it frightens and upsets her. She decides to fight fire with fire. \nWhere will this storyline go? \nShe uses everything he’s told her in confidence and sews it into a blatant lie that his family believe. She’s very clever. \nDoes Peter deserve what’s coming? \nI think he’s led her on, but I’m not sure if Peter warrants the lengths Chloe goes to to mess up his life. \nDo you prepare for intimate scenes? \nWe all have toothbrushes in our bags and pop to the toilet to brush our teeth! \nIs there any femme fatale in you? \nOh gosh, no. I’m not like Chloe at all! I just go on walks with my Cockapoo, Mabel.
