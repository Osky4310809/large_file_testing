And the benefit grows the older you get. For instance, by the time a man is 80, his chance of dying within the year is 7.4 percent if he has a kid, but 8.3 percent if he’s childless. \nProtect Against Pollution Exposure to fine particles in air pollution can cause a host of health problems, including sparking inflammation throughout your body. But taking your vitamins can help: Folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 may protect against the harmful effects of air pollution , researchers from Columbia University discovered. Still, since it was a very small pilot study—with only 10 participants—more research on a larger is needed to develop clinical implications, the BBC says . \nCheck Your Blood Pressure \nIf your blood pressure spikes when you enter your doctor’s office, you might have white-coat hypertension—but your doc may treat you for high blood pressure anyway, leading to overtreatment. Now, researchers from the Netherlands discovered that in-office, automated BP monitoring over 30 minutes could cut down on that overtreatment . The BP readings taken this way were significantly lower, leading doctors to recommend treatment in 25 percent of the cases, compared to 79 percent when the docs only looked at traditional readings. \nBeat Depression Can the key to treating depression really be as simple as changing the way you think? According to a new study out of Norway, learning how to reduce persistent ruminations may help relieve symptoms of depression . It’s called metacognitive therapy, and it’s focused on helping adjust your thinking process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T20:25:43.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
