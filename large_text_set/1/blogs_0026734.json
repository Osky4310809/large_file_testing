Liverpool miss out on Inter wonderkid Liverpool have missed out on Pinamonti's signature (Photo: Getty) \nLiverpool have missed out on Inter Milan wonderkid Andrea Pinamonti, writes Mirror Football's John Cross. \nThe 17-year-old was a target for Liverpool and Juventus amid a contract stand off but he is now expected to stay at Inter. \nHis prolific form for the primavera side, scoring 16 goals in 18 games, earned him a first team debut in the Europa League this season. \nAble to link with the midfield and work the channels, Pinamonti moves similarly to Fernando Torres during his time at Anfield. Mane ready to return for Chelsea clash Mane is set to be utilised by Liverpool once again (Photo: Liverpool FC/Getty Images) \nJurgen Klopp will decide on Sadio Mane's participation against Chelsea only after he “looks into his eyes”, writes Mirror Football's David Maddock. \nLiverpool put on a private jet to fly the Senegal international back from the Africa Cup of Nations, following his nation's exit from the tournament on penalties at the quarter final stage. \nBut Reds boss Klopp revealed there was a problem with the winger being allowed on the plane in Gabon, which means he will arrive back in England tonight, before training tomorrow morning. \nThat means he is a doubt for the showdown that could decide Liverpool's season, and the manager revealed that he will wait to see exactly what state Mane is in after his epic journey.
