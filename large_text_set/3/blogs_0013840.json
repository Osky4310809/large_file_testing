Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool have reportedly offered a 17-year-old Honduran wonderkid a one-week trial after he impressed their scouts during a recent Under-20s tournament. \nLeft-back Wesley Decas was one of the stars at the recent U20 CONCACAF Championship, as he helped his country reach the final of the competition, which they lost to USA on penalties. \nCurrently he is on the books at Honduran side Club Independiente, but that could soon change, according to the Sun , with Liverpool inviting the youngster to undertake a trial at Kirkby. \nIf they do decide to make a permanent move for Decas, the report suggests they will need to reach an agreeable compensation settlement with his current club. \nWhile left full-back has been a problem position for Liverpool's senior side, they already have promising youngster Juanma Garcia on their books. Woodburn earns Wales call-up (Photo: Getty Images) \nLiverpool's Ben Woodburn, 17, has been included in Chris Coleman's Wales squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifer against the Republic of Ireland, writes Liam Corless . \nThe teenager became the Reds' youngest ever goalscorer in November's EFL Cup win over Leeds. \nWales manager Coleman has been impressed by Woodburn this season and his call-up is on merit rather than to stop England from snaring him. \nWoodburn was born in Chester but is eligible to play for Wales through his maternal grandfather and has already represented the Dragons at Under-15, U16, U17 and U19 levels. \nAsked if he included Woodburn to keep England away from him, Coleman said: \"No, if I feel the need to make a change and him to come on it will be for tactical reasons nothing else. \n\"He’s been a Wales international from a young boy and we expected him going forward. There will be no knee jerk reaction to cap him.\" Mane makes shocking admission (Photo: PA) \nSadio Mane made a shocking admission about the start of his career, writes Mark Jones . \nThe Senegalese forward - who has shone at Anfield this season following his switch from Southampton last summer - has often shown that he is never afraid to go it alone on the pitch, but that seems to extend to his life off it as well, at least according to a new interview he's given to Liverpool's official website. \nBecause there he's confirmed that he didn't even tell his MUM that he'd left Senegal for Europe to try and start a football career at the age of 19. \nAfter coming through the Senegalese academy Generation Foot, Mane set off to Europe to try and make his way with French club Metz - and he only told one person he was going. \n“I only told my uncle'\" he told the Reds' website. \"Even my mum, she didn’t know.\" Divock Origi shows off his shooting skills Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T07:50:21.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
