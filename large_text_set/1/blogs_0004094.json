As a tennis prodigy hailing from Compton, California, she burst onto the scene with her sister Venus in the 1990s, to take the world by storm with her record-breaking serve and headline-making on-court style (knee-high tennis boots, anyone?). So it is somewhat of a surprise to find that the one thing about Williams that has remained out of the public eye is her personal life. \nOh, sure, we knew about the alleged hush-hush tryst with Drake; the on-again, off-again romance with Common; and even the power coupling with her and director Brett Ratner. But when Williams recently announced at the end of last year that she was engaged to Reddit mogul Alexis Ohanian, it all came as a shock. The tennis pro had been decidedly mum about this great romance—in fact, all but a few fuzzy paparazzi pictures over the course of their more-than-a-year-old courtship had surfaced of the happy couple. Even their wedding announcement was a bit of a cipher, Williams writing a love poem to announce their imminent union. Of course, it didn’t stop there. She went on to play cat and mouse with the revealing of her engagement ring this month, keeping us all on our toes. Certainly her ring would be a dazzler, something that would fit the extravagant tastes of the glamorous champ and clothing designer. She instead initially debuted a novelty ring brandishing, well, a taco, writing, “Sneak peek. It was a corn tortilla, of course, in case you were wondering.” \nSarcasm withstanding, in a world of over-sharing—where couples often Snapchat date night dinners and breakups are headline news—the stealth approach to romance was not only surprising, but damn refreshing, too. The over-the-top production of weddings can often overshadow the actual love between two people. It soon becomes about the trappings and optics of said romance, with a couple’s compatibility being judged upon a ring’s carat size or the size of the bride and groom’s guest list. Opening up one’s union to the world is always exciting, of course, but as Vogue.com’s Market Editor, Chelsea Zalopany, muses, there is something to cherishing the moment just as a couple. “Everyone makes the whole business of a wedding such a serious one! I love that they can have fun with a taco ring and simultaneously are keeping the ring, and the excitement of their engagement, something just for them,” she said earlier this week. “Only they know, for a bit longer, at least.” \nZalopany’s right: Williams posted another picture of her ring to her millions of Instagram followers this morning, much to our surprise, with a rare picture of her hugging her soon-to-be husband. The moment didn’t last so long, though. With a signature wink, Williams quickly Photoshopped that aforementioned taco over the glittery stone and left us all swooning—a winning wedding approach the anti-Bridezillas among us could adopt. It certainly makes the idea of taking the money you would spend on a pricey engagement ring and investing in, say, a Brooklyn brownstone, all the more appealing. After all, a GucciGhost ring would be the perfect substitute. And you could keep your family guessing with Saint Laurent’s moth ring and debut the sparkler on the big day. Heck, why not buy each other matching Kate Spade whimsical triceratops rings instead? While it may make others scratch their heads, it’s an inside joke you both can enjoy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T04:06:35.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
