Traders in the market expressed concern about the depreciation of the Naira in spite the gains earlier recorded. \nAlhaji Aminu Gwadabe, President, Association of Bureau De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), said there was need for a review of the distribution mechanism. \n“Many banks are selling to only clients with current accounts and not to savings account holders and there is also increasing demand for forex from our neighbouring countries. \n“The different applicable exchange rates and volumes with Travelex and banks need to be harmonised and with that of BDCs to reduce friction,” Gwadabe said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:17:51.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
