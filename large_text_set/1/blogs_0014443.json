The news arrived via a customer care agent in the Nvidia Forums, while the Nvidia Shield hub Google+ account suggests that Nougat will roll out to the Shield Tablet K1 “in a few weeks.”\nAndroid 7.0 Nougat recently rolled out to the Nvidia Shield TV and introduced a wealth of new features to the platform, raising questions about when Nvidia’s other hardware would be upgraded to the new Android platform.\nSee also: Hands-on with the new Nvidia Shield TV 2 days ago The original Nvidia Shield was released in July 2014 with Android 4.4.2 KitKat.
