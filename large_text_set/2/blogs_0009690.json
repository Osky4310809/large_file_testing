Couple Announces Their Pregnancy with Hilarious Movie Poster Kaitlin Stanford \nWhen Brittney Dufrene and her boyfriend Ryan Cannon learned they were having a baby, there was one thing they knew for sure: They wanted to spill the news in a unique — and hilarious — way. “I always see the same ‘ole baby announcements,” Brittney tells Babble, “and that isn’t really my style.” \nSo the mom-to-be did what most of us do when we’re in desperate need of a little inspiration: She scoured Pinterest, looking for ideas. Brittney says she knew she wanted “something cute, yet funny” to capture not just her personality, but also Ryan’s — she just wasn’t sure what that was. \nLuckily, it didn’t take long before she struck gold: Brittney spotted a baby announcement done in the style of a movie poster, and instantly decided that she and Ryan would do the same, with a few fun and original twists. \nThe resulting announcement wasn’t just hilarious — it’s also gone viral. Image Source: Brittney Dufrene \nAchieving the perfect photo turned out to be easy enough: Brittney says she’s taken digital media courses in the past and has always been active in creative hobbies like photography — so this project was right up her alley. Once the couple nailed down the concept they wanted, they loaded their bed up with plenty of humorous pregnancy “must-haves” — from jars of pickles to a couple What to Expect books. They also added in a few fun references their friends and family would enjoy. \n“We are from Louisiana and Mardi Gras season is in full effect,” explains Brittney, “so having King Cake this time of year is a must!” Related Post The Force Is Strong with This Epic 'Star Wars' Pregnancy Announcement \nOnce the scene was set, Brittney says she put her camera on a self-timer and the two began posing. And after a little trusty Photoshop work, it was clear their efforts paid off — the announcement was a hit. \n“Everyone was surprised and excited at the same time!” says Brittney, of the moment the couple shared it with family. “The look on everyone’s faces were priceless and very memorable.” \nThe announcement probably would have just remained within the family had Brittney not shared it on the Facebook page Love What Matters , where it’s been steading going viral since being shared on February 4. To date, the post has over 11K likes and 480 shares. \nAs for their sudden viral fame, Brittney says it’s been a total shock — in the best way. \n“I did not think THIS many people would see our announcement,” says Brittney. “But, it is exciting to see how far it has gotten. It is also very heartwarming to see all the positive responses and smiles it has brought to many. I am just happy to see some positive news spread across the media.” \nUs too.
