The children were found just a short time later. \nPolice say 37-year-old repeat offender John Bowling was taken into custody by Southeast District patrol officers in the Unit block of North Montford Avenue just before Friday night. \nRick Ritter spoke exclusively with the father of the children and has more on the suspect who’s been identified. \nRELATED: City Police Search for Man Involved in Carjacking of 2 Young Children \nThe man they say was behind the carjacking that triggered an Amber Alert. \nIt’s an opportunity Eric O’Neill thought might never come again. A chance to hold his kids after they were kidnapped Thursday night. \n“It was real heartbreaking, when they say men don’t cry, I cried my heart out,” said O’Neill. \nThe heart-pounding moments unfolded along North Port Street near Patterson Park. A mother unloading her car and leaves it running with her 4-year-old and 19-month old boys still inside. \nVideo obtained by WJZ showed the suspect casually enter the vehicle and then took off. \n“I got a phone call by my wife, the kids were gone and I just sped home,” said O’Neill. \nPolice quickly issue an Amber Alert and the two children were safely found a few blocks away. \n“That’s a relief, not to find them dead in the car, or find them anywhere else,” said O’Neill. \nVideo shows that the mother’s car was parked right here and police say if it wasn’t for a neighbor’s surveillance camera, this story could have had a much different ending. \n“Huge role, once we get that photograph, it gives us an idea of who we’re looking for, more importantly it gives community an idea,” said Baltimore Police Spokesman Jeremy Silbert. \nThe suspect, Bowling, of Dundalk, has a lengthy criminal history. \nWhile both he and the family’s 2007 Saturn are still nowhere to be found, O’ Neill is thankful to police and the community for getting his kids back home. \n“Baltimore has a lot of love, people just come in and mess it up,” he said. \nBowling is being charged with kidnapping, reckless endangerment and auto theft. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook Rick Ritter Rick Ritter joined WJZ Eyewitness News in May 2014 as a reporter.
