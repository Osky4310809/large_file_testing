Check out the clip above! No, it’s not main characters, but there are several same-sex couples at the boy band concert Star and Marco (and his girlfriend) are attending kissing in the crowd. Wow. It’s almost as if it’s no big deal. Thanks, Disney. Feel free to take that spirit to the rest of your projects.
