In order to fulfill her \"insatiable desire to explore and document the beauty all around us through photography\", Lea packed up her photo gear and hit the road eight months ago in her tiny teardrop trailer - and she hasn't looked back since.\n\n\nLike many intrepid travelers, Lea decided to change her lifestyle after getting burned out at her job. Deciding to live life on her terms and pursue her passion for photography, she purchased a tiny teal T@G teardrop camper to use as her home on wheels . \"It simply called to me,\" Lea says. \"I couldn't explain the reasoning; I just knew I had to have it. That. Exact. One.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/NUjWSHzpg6k\nUnfortunately, that trailer was stolen shortly after buying it. It was found later thanks to an online plea by Lea that went viral, but, to her dismay, the trailer had been completely trashed. Although heartbroken at the loss, Lea was encouraged by the overwhelming support of total strangers during the ordeal, and decided to follow through on her dreams to travel, this time in her newly-bought, orange-swirled camper she named \"The Phoenix\".\n\nRelated: Italian woman restores old van to travel the world with her rescue dog \nThe camper has all the comforts of a tiny home : indoor shelving, custom-made cabinets and an open kitchen space at the rear of the compact camper . For personal touches to make her feel at home, Lea added a comfy bed, curtains, custom wooden knobs, and a tv.\n\nLea has been on the road for 8 months and has explored 28 states and three countries. In that time, she has photographed some amazing landscapes and come in contact with bears, eagles, coyotes, elk, and even scorpions!\nYou can keep up with Mandy's travels on her website as well as Facebook , Instagram and YouTube .\n+ Mandy Lea Photo \nVia Treehugger \nImages via Mandy Lea \n\n\n\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:17:50.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
