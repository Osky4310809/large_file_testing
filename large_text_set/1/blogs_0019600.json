This has been a very interesting live stream. #HeWillNotDivideUs pic.twitter.com/CqY9pLobWi \n— #HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDUS) January 23, 2017 \nShia LaBeouf is known for his off-the-wall performance art , but his latest piece might be his most interesting yet. During his new, four-year live stream at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US — a response to Donald Trump's presidency — the actor got heated when an alleged white supremacist decided to contribute his own opinions to the camera on Sunday. While it is unclear what exactly the man was saying, Shia obviously wasn't having any of it as he yelled \"He will not divide us!\" into the man's face until he walked away. Honestly, it's enough to make your whole body tense as the two egg each other on.
