The club said it will reserve jersey numbers for two members who survived the crash, in the hope that they can rejoin the squad to play at some point.\nThe team, hailing from the southern Brazilian city of Chapecó, was heading to Colombia for what would have been the first leg of the the Copa Sudamericana tournament’s finals on the evening of Nov. 28, when the chartered plane it flew on crashed near the city of Medellin. Of those on board, 71 people died and six survived. Prior to that point, the team’s meteoric rise through the ranks of Brazilian and South American professional soccer circles had been hailed as a “Cinderella story.”\nAmong the Chapecoense players on the ill-fated flight, only three survived — with one of them having to undergo partial leg amputation. The club’s director of football told Reuters that the reservation of the survivors’ jersey numbers is “more than a tribute,” as he expects the two players still capable of playing to return to the pitch. The club also recruited a new coach for the season, reports the Associated Press, as its entire coaching staff also died in the crash.\nAfter the tragedy, Chapecoense was awarded the Copa Sudamericana, and will have a place in the upcoming Copa Libertadores tournament, Reuters reports. But the team has rejected a proposed 3-year immunity deal that would’ve allowed it to stay in the country’s top soccer league regardless of its actual performance.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T06:24:59.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
