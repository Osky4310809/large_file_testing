Abiola \nare you mad? is it your state? you most be crazy! Igbo fool!!!! kenny \nAre all the people of the state in support of his action. I am from Osun state, I don’t belong to any party and I don’t agree with some of his actions. jman \nThat ur problem d policy is there to stand and nothing will change it.. kenny \nWe will know soon whose problem it is. Let him continue to waste his energy on unnecessary policy. mathew \nThat is what we are saying, What the man said that warrant you to call him mad. A responsible man is speaking with respective manner and you call him mad. I think this man deserve your apology. Otherwise I will assume you bring out your violent character from your religion to display. I pray God will set you free in Jesus Mighty name amen. jman \nAre u free? mumu like una wey una pastor dey drive private jet whereas una followers no get money to eat 3 times daily so tell us if GOD don set u free.. MUGUN mathew \nThat it what we are saying, instead of you to caution your fellow Muslim guy you jump to another topic. For your information set free is not abusing language am just wishing him well. If you think am not free I pray for myself that God should set me and my family free if we are in wrong path. In Christianity, if somebody does abnormal thing we have to pray that God should set that person free but reverse is the case in yours. Yoruba we say “e nfi ete sile e npa lapalapa”. As per the Pastor using jet that it is what will call Glory of God shine in their life. Do you know how many destiny God has use most of them to change. I want to assure you that you are not exception to use jet if you believe what they believed. I want to ask you how many of their member you are feeding and how many of them come to you to complained. In your mosque or in Muslim religion there is no poor people there. Choice is yours. Jesus is the way the truth and the life. Babakeu \nYou shall come to realise that Jesus was never the way, the truth and the light for you but ONLY for the lost sheep of the house of Isreal (Mattew 15:24 and Q3:49-51). But Prophet Muhammad was only sent to you and me after the ascent of Jesus Christ (Q34:28 and John 16:7; 14:16; 15:26). I want you also to know that this world is a paradise for the unbelieving jet-flying persons while it is prison for the bicycle-riding believing persons. Then reverse will be the case for these two group of persons on judgement day. You have been told now so that you will not have any justification against us in the judgement day. Peace be unto you. SPIRIT LED \nDear Brother,i must be sincere with you,writing without any convincing truth with balanced facts from two religious books(The Bible and Quran)is a write up based on prejudice,bias or hatred.But the one that is supported by verified truths is empowered to enlighten so many people and help them overcome their ignorance.. I was in it,Islam, before and i can recollect several meaningless pamphlets i had written before i knew the truth,the whole truth and nothing but the truth.JOHN 8:32. Among all the rubbish i used to claim and write about were also your points mention above and DEUT 18:18.JESUS never made any statement concerning muhamad,let alone mention his name in the Bible.its not possible for anyone to force cunningly what is not into IT.Its not easy.!!!All said and done everything in the Bible ,including references to people,things and places were made clear,either by those apostles who wrote the Bible,THEY were given through the inspiration of the HOLY SPIRIT, which you and all Muslims always blaspheme against.Most of the writers of the Bible did not know themselves over the centuries,yet their messages were similar,consistent and complimentary.why?because they never wrote the Bible from their own head or at their own instructions as carnal men but at Gods instance,instruction and inspiration.The question you should ask yourself is ,does muhamad lives or abides forever?OR now GOD? \nThere are several areas in the Bible from the old to the new testament that established the truth about the deity(divinity)of JESUS and the HOLY SPIRIT.The letter of john talks more about the being -HOLY SPIRIT and HIS works..PEOPLE who walk by sight cannot understand anything about the Spirit.THE Favour and Holyspirit in the quranic text of Sura 5:110 used for JESUS,appeared so strong and important to be ignored?Do you know GOD used HOLY SPIRIT and favor to connect to JESUS in several chapters of the quran?Let the truth be told ,negative mindset is the bane of the world in the new milleninium.Men,women,young or old who accepts Christ as their lord and saviour receives power effectively through the HOLY SPIRIT.-Who brings men into fellowship with God. Quran refers to JESUS as spirit,truth,word OF God,Sura 2:253,5:110,4:171etc HOLY SPIRIT in the book of John is the Spirit of GOD and inheritance of all followers of JESUS CHRIST.HE is the father of all knowledge and key to all wisdom ,without Him, man is nothing.Please seek Him in truth and you shall surely find HIM.Bless you. Military rule returns \nhave you ever seen a Christian carrying plate about begging? NONE. but that is the hallmark of muslims from North to West Edumomoh \nMy brother; that is Mulsims for you, nothing good will ever come out from Islam? Check the history of mohamed, he’s a blood sucker! Military rule returns \nnot just that, a rapist, paedophile and womaniser who doesn’t even care if the lady just started menstruating or if she is the wife of his son Babakeu \nMany of you blasphemers will see the horror which your tongues will lead you to face in this life, inside your graves and in the judgement day. No one will come to your rescue when you are mercilessly ceased by the Angel of death and those Angels in charge of carrying out severe punishment for the unbelieving blasphemers. The day is fast approaching. Better repent now for your salvation. But if you remain unrepentantly arrogant, then wait and we shall also wait! GEE \nhow can i attain or qualify for salvation in islam?Please i needed to know. Concerned Citizen \nHaba! Abiola, let not use abusive words on each other please. Let’s learn to respect other people’s opinion even if we don’t agree with them. otitoju olu \nabiola,if you are a true son of yoruba please stop being abusive on this forum. just artuclate your own postion. it is not in our culture to abuse people unecessarily. senatorojd \nIt’s obvious who is mad actually. Cos I’m wondering what wrong Okayoh made in his post. Segun Abayomi \nThis policy needs to reverse. This policy is denying christians their rights. We will try to make this policy un-implementable and we will try to support as many court actions as possible against aregbesola. Lastly we will ask osun CAN to raise 5billion to build a new private school in line with secular doctrin. Okayoh \nNo I am not mad,yes this is my state.Sorry I am not crazy neither am I Igbo (not as if it matters if I am Igbo).May I ask you a question ?Do people from normal homes write such that you wrote ? Sunday Olawale \nOgbeni Gvernor, your educational policy is anarchical. You should reverse it if there is no ulterior motive. Period. Jungle Justice \nMallam remember na u cuase dt problm banji apata \nTalk is cheap, Alhaji, the author of confusion. I wonder why would someone create problem and waste the state resources to solve it. Anyway, deal with them the boko haram way. Its in you. Yemiking \nReversing unpopular policy is not weakness, Aregbesola you have been a proactive guvnor but that doesn’t mean you are always right. I am looking for a day when there will be clear separation between state and religion. Babakeu \nIt is not possible in Nigeria to completely separate the state from the religion. Both are mutually exclusive in the way Nigeria is shaped. Nigeria is one of the most religious country in the world. Nigeria heterogeneity in terms of two close major religion, christianity and islam, will always make it impossible to have clear separation between the state and religion. That is why you see sharia, as an Islamic law, enshrined in the constitution. Such also as English common law enshrined in the same constitution. So that if any state government wants to practise either solely sharia or common law, the space is there in the constitution. It will only amount to injustice and insincerity if all sections of the Nigeria federation are only subjected to christian-introduced common English law when the rights of the muslims to their own islamic law are being denied in the unreasonable name of secularism. The term ‘secularism’ was only designed to protect the interests of the christians by not considering the interests of the muslims in some major areas. Then islamic law should also be allowed to protect the interests of the Muslims, if any state so desires, in accordance with the islamic law position in the constitution. But all other religious faiths may either be protected by common or islamic law, since they have no specific law guiding their religions affairs. Any other minority interests must also be protected under any law. elochris \nWho can bring clean things out of unclean things,can demon cast out demon,can terrorist fight terrorists,can boko haram fight boko haram?u can fool people everytime but u cant fool everybody at the sametime,continue to brainwashed ur fellow yorubas and not everybody,u have not finished to emerges ur evil religion have starts their violent,well they deserved it make u unite them with baptism of islam Babakeu \nJust listen to yourself. I don’t think I have seen any Muslim tagging christianity ‘evil religion’ on this forum. Though they may have queried the reality and authenticity of christianity as truly a religion approved either by God or Jesus Christ himself. They may also have queried the sincerity and reality about those pastors arrogating the highest position of divine prophethood to themselves, which no imam has ever arrogated such prophethood position to himself in islam. But all of these queries can be refuted by merely bringing facts to proof any muslim wrong or right. But not by coming on a public forum and declare a religion of over a billion people on earth surface entirely ‘evil religion’. This is a sign of lack of mutual respect to other faith or lack of decorum, wisdom and sense of indiscipline. It is also a sign of spiritual misguidance and loss of righteousness. It is a highest sense of rascality and indecency to tag islam as evil on a public forum. It shows lack of proper home and religious training. Please, change your mindset! Edumomoh \nIslam is evil! elochris \nI never means to insult islam,i think islam means peace but y pakistan,somalia,afghan,iran,iraq ,nigeria,mali,uk,us,france,yemen,egypt,and others happened to muslims are terrorising everywhere,and u tell islam means peace,look at kano,there xstian and muslim y sharia,and y not go after boko haram,and y did muslim like and what is their happiness in marrying to 8 or ten years old,like 8years old died of internal bleeding after making with his 42 year old husband on the same day they married? Babakeu \nIt is surely ‘Death’ that will silence you forever for making derogatory and blasphemous remark about the prophet of God. No muslim will ever kill or hurt you. But the inevitable death shall surely come to you and me suddenly. Then your eyes will open to the reality of which you are denying presently. elochris \nBut y do u refuse to answer my questions and u are twisting it elochris \nPls how old was prophet muhammed when he married,and how old was his wife and how many wife did he married pls Babakeu \nWhat do you want to do with his age or that of his wife? Better go to any reliable islamic site and find out more about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), who was the seal of the prophets (Q33:40); sent as Mercy for the believers and all creatures (Q9:61 and 21:107); gentle in nature (Q3:159); most exemplary and beautiful pattern of conduct (Q33:21) and, above all, foretold by Jesus Christ (pbuh) (Q61:6; John 14:16; 15:26 and 16:7). These are just brief information about whom you are asking. Learn more about him. Babakeu \nMr Governor, we Osun people are really in support of your determination to punish those attackers who took laws into their hands by beating up the principal of Baptist High School on 25th November, 2013. But please Mr Governor, I will also advise you to still go deeper into the investigation on who really those attackers were. Were they truly muslims altogether? Were they truly up to 250 as the principal claimed? Please, find out when you get them arrested. Also Mr Governor, I will not want you to hurriedly believe in everything the principal said in denial of the allegation that he neither asked the get to remove her hijab nor sent her away from the school. If you take a deeper look at the confession of the principal yesterday, you will bring out from his defence statement some unbelievable facts. Let us break his statement down into three parts. One, “the girl did not wear her hijab nor put any hijab in her bag”. Two, “what is in her bag is not my concern except the content is harmful”. Three, “I did not search her bag”. Mr Governor, please querry the principal ‘ only’ over his first and last statement. If truly he said he didn’t search her bag, how then did he know that the girl did not have her hijab in her bag, according to what he said in his first statement that “….nor put any hijab in her bag”. This sounded contradictory to me. Let him explain further. I lastly tender apology for ‘unintentionally’ misinterpreting the second part of the principal’s statement yesterday. Thank you sir. Stephen \nThe evil perpetrators are those to be punished, also the number doesn’t concern you, why are you twisting this issue again Babakewu ? Babakeu \nI am not twisting any issue here. The fact is that it is morally wrong to lie to the public. If two persons attack you, never say ten persons attacked me. If you are not sure of the exact numbers of the attackers, then rather not state imaginary lower or higher specific numbers to deceive the public or security operatives. And never say all my attackers were muslims when you are not really sure who they really were, even if some showed some signs of being muslims in their approach. Not until when some of them are arrested and questioned, then we cannot confidently come into undeniable conclusion that they were all muslims. Is it impossible that some christians who support the policy of the government and never being biased and sentimental in their position towards what Aregbesola is doing can also rally with some muslims to attack anyone suspected to be going against the government policy? So, let us wait till they are arrested. Edumomoh \nTheir even more than 250; O-Yes terror members. I pity Islamic State of Osun, the Taliban Aregbe has open the can of worms, just wait and see. Babakeu \nWe shall all see! lovelove \nBabakeu you again,still talking instead of burying your head in shame.You claimed far away from Ijebu to know more than the executive gov. of the state who is the chief security officer of his state,and who agreed that the attackers are muslim youths. Babakeu \nWhy should I bury my head in shame? What shameful act have I committed here? Mind yourself! Nonsense! gee \nHow come you are now from osun.When has osun state turn to IJEBU IGBO,where Yu from? Babakeu \nI am an indigene of every state of the federation in as much as I am a Nigerian. All are my brothers and sisters. Thank you. jay \n@Babakeu, I appreciate your thorough knowledge on issues. I am a neutral observer and tend not to talk against any religion as only God knows the true way of light. having said that, i think pple wont just wake up one day and speak ill of any religion without clear evidence of violence at every word mentioned against it. Violence wont solve every issue. Some religions need to be open to criticism and let God be the judge not man. Lastly i think we all need to do more in regards to tolerance and caution with words used on social media. AWORLD \nHi Babakeu, i have been following you for a while and have come to conclusion that you are a person with great mind. I appreciate you always and really like us to be friends if you dont mind. May God be with u always. Alabi wasiu [email protected] thanks \nYou are also welcome to [email protected] Thanks. \nAregbe we want to see the action not only bragging, we are watching. michael alade \nAlh Aregbesola, please this is 2013, do not vow to deal with anyone, that is not what you were elected to do, let the Police arrest offenders and take them before the Court of law, Okay! speaktruth \nmedicine after death. kkk \nWhy is the government just talking now as if he is not in the know of what is happening. He brought Islamic fundamentalism to Osun state and we are beginning to see the effect. Edumomoh \nNew group of terrorists are just graduated in the O-Yes cadet; State of Osun is really in trouble, is time he Ogbeni change the state name again to Islamic state of Osun! Susan \nAregbe should never have dabbled into religious matters the way he did, especially at a time when BH were on a killing spree in the North. It was very bad timing indeed. Why on earth he demanded Muslim girls should be allowed to ware the Hijab in Christian schools beats me. He should have also demanded that Christians do the same in Muslim schools as well, now look at what is unfolding in Osun state. It’s very unfortunate . elochris \nThe hausa fulani have mislead the yorubas finally brought catastrophe to them the next is change the baptist school into an islamic name Edumomoh \nThey’re now Islamic state of Osun! Ebny Cuk \nAregbesola is not a Nigerian but was born to a Somali father and a Yemeni [email protected] John Omoniyi \nAregbesola’s policy on education may be very very detrimental if Christians in Osun State fail to pray. A thief only comes to steal, kill and destroy. He has been pretending all day long. He claims to be of Ijesha origin, but I doubt it. I’m afraid we may count a lot of losses when he leaves. raymond \nabiola are you paid agent of this people why the abusive word please try to be refine and not to be childish.please contribute positively for effective change please God bless us all. raymond \nconcern citizen may your days be long and may you live in good health God us all,nice word for the wise.
