When they arrived, they found an 11-year-old boy had been outside in 20 degree weather for about 20 minutes. \nThe child told police he attempted to get the attention of his mother’s boyfriend by banging on the door with a shovel. However, his attempts failed. \n“They found an 11-year-old child locked out of the residence, it was about 19 or 20 degrees outside, he had been outside for about 20 minutes.” said Bridgeville Police Chief Chad King. “He had tried banging on the door with a shovel to get the attention of his mother’s boyfriend who was inside.” (Source: Allegheny County Jail) \nOfficers say they were familiar with the adults of the home as being known drug users. \nA neighbor says he took the boy inside his home until police arrived. \n“The little boy is the one who knocked on my door. I took him into my house and made calls I needed to make, and I kept him shielded from all the activity,” neighbor Kevin Sperring said. \nFearing an overdose, police made a forced entry into the home. Once inside, they found Marcus Stancik, 30, who said he had just used heroin within the past hour. \n“He had heroin needles in his pocket and admitted to shooting up one hour prior to police arriving,” said Chief King.

The child’s 16-year-old sister was also taken into protective custody later. \nWhile inside, officers found two emaciated pit bulls and four cats. One of the dogs was so weak that he could not walk and had to be carried . \nThe dog, Cory, is now being cared for by Animal Friends. \nOfficers also found animal feces throughout the home. There did not appear to be running water, the toilet didn’t work and the only food item in the house was a spoiled package of chicken in the refrigerator. The home has since been condemned and is now boarded up. \n“The house was deplorable,” said Chief King. “Human feces and animal feces throughout the house, the toilets were not working, and it didn’t appear that there was even running water in the house.” (Photo Credit: Bridgeville Police Department/Facebook) \nMeanwhile, officers returned to the home that evening and found Stancik in possession of crack cocaine paraphernalia. \nHe has since been charged with aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of a child, cruelty to animals and possession of drug paraphernalia. \nMeanwhile, Reitmeyer is facing charges of endangering the welfare of a child and cruelty to animals. \nBoth are being held in the Allegheny County Jail after turning themselves into police on March 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:49:35.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
