This week the Atlanta rapper has made unprecedented chart history after landing two consecutive chart-topping albums on the Billboard 200 in a row. Just last week, his self-titled album FUTURE scored the number one. Now, HNDRXX has knocked FUTURE off the top spot into the second place – also making Future the first artist in a year to have the number one and number two slots at the same time since Prince last year.\nHNDRXX sold 121,000 equivalent units total, with 48,000 of those in traditional sales and 63,000 in streaming equivalents. This came after FUTURE moved a total of 140,000 equivalent album units, more than half of which was made up by streaming numbers. Overall, those are some out-of-this world numbers from the Astronaut.\nWatch him perform HNDRXX track “Incredible” on Ellen below.\n\nRevisit our feature on Future’s 14 most emotional tracks right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T11:47:13.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
