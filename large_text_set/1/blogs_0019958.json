Your make-up look can no longer be complete till your brows are on point. Thick and bold brows are being appreciated, and thin brows are being dissed at, and if you don't groom your brows at all then you are definitely living under a rock. But, you don't need to worry; with brows it's never one size fits all. So, here are our favourite Bollywood celebrities who continue to give us #Browspitation. Alia Bhatt \nTalk about going natural. Even though she doesn't have full brows, she doesn't over-pluck them. Instead the un-groomed brows add to her natural look. A photo posted by Alia ✨⭐️ (@aliaabhatt) on Jan 10, 2017 at 1:25am PST Anushka Sharma \nIt's not necessary to be blessed with Cara Delevigne brows to make heads turn. All brow shapes don't suit everyone. Anushka's brows are not thick, but are sharp and groomed, and that is enough to slay. A photo posted by Makeup Artist Puneet B Saini (@puneetbsaini) on Dec 6, 2016 at 10:45am PST Deepika Padukone \nNow, Deepika is one actress who takes eyebrow business very seriously. No matter what, her brows are always in place and with not one stray hair. She is giving some serious #BrowGoals. A photo posted by Hung Vanngo (@hungvanngo) on Jan 19, 2017 at 8:03pm PST Aditi Rao Hydari \nShe is literally blessed with boxy brows, and needs to make bare minimum effort to keep her brow game strong. She has thick brows and a sharp arch, which makes her look all kinds of awesome. A photo posted by Aditi Rao Hydari (@aditiraohydari) on Jan 9, 2017 at 5:07am PST Sonam Kapoor \nIf you have bold and thick brows, then please don't over-pluck them. Just thread few strays, but that's it. Take a look at Sonam Kapoor, that's how you roll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T12:31:45.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
