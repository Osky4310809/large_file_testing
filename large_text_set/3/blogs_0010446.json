He begins: \n\"God knows there's enough hate in the world and I don't want to add to the sum total, but forgive me, I have got to get this off my chest: I fucking hate Melania Trump.\"\nWe told you. This is good stuff! He continues:\n\"I'm not alone in loathing Donald Trump 's third wife — she's married to a misogynist after all. Odds are good her husband hates her too. But there are some folks on the left who not only don't hate her, they view her as some sort of sympathetic figure. The pretty princess in the tower locked up by the orange ogre with the bad combover, a princess desperately blinking out distress signals during swearing-in ceremonies and inaugural balls.\"\nWe've definitely seen and even been guilty of this. Hmm.\nVideo: Samantha Bee Calls Out 'Bridezilla' Donald Trump! \nBut why are we wrong? Dan theorizes:\n\"I think we can credit that undeservedly charitable view of our new First Lady to our propensity as humans, as a species, to think that the insides of pretty people match the outsides of pretty people.\"\nThat's an interesting theory. We think it's more likely our innate desire to try to protect people from predators — we never heard any sympathy for Melania before the whole \"pussy-grabbing\" scandal . But now it's hard not to want to protect women from The Donald's tiny grasp.\nBut back to why Dan is NOT on the Melania train:\n\"Mrs. Trump, Melania Trump, is as ugly on the inside as she is pretty on the outside. She is a birther. Pretty Melania went on TV to push the same racist conspiracy theories about Barack Obama that her husband did. She's an immigrant who doesn't give a shit about the plight of other immigrants. She's famously a plagiarist. And she's brought ruinous lawsuits against journalists and bloggers accusing them, amongst other things, of potentially interfering with her ability to profit off her role as first lady.\"\nYeah, that is pretty gross. He then compared her treatment by the left to the disgusting way the right attacked Michelle Obama at every turn:\n\"I don't know if you can impeach a first lady or how that would work, but I do know that we would have found out pretty fucking fast if Michelle Obama had said the same during her husband's presidency.\"\nVery true.\nDan goes on to trash the way Melania told sick children during a Washington, D.C. hospital visit that they should focus on \"the power of nature\" to heal them.\nYou know, because they likely aren't getting access to as much healthcare under her husband.\nRelated: Barack Obama Literally 'Rolled His Eyes' At Trump's Baseless Wiretapping Claims \nSavage makes a darn good case for remembering that Melania isn't so much the \"better half\" of Donald but just another one of his cronies — that his choice of First Lady was just as bad as his choice of every other administration position.\nYou can listen to the full episode HERE !\nThen tell us, Perezcious Readers…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:25:52.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
