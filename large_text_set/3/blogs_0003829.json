The e-commerce giant is offering a discount of up to Rs 10,001 on almost all models of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. \nThanks to the hefty discount, you can get the iPhone 7 32GB in India for only Rs 49,999, while the 128GB variant can be had for Rs 59,999. The iPhone 7 Plus is also available at a similar discount, with the cheapest 32GB variant now coming in at Rs 61,999. The 128GB iPhone 7 Plus can be had for Rs 71,999 — down from its original price of Rs 82,000. The discounts are available on all colors and storage variants of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, including Jet Black. \nWith the iPhone 8 still almost six months away from its official unveiling, buying an iPhone 7 at such a discounted price is not a bad deal at all. It is unclear if the discount comes directly from Apple or is being given by sellers on Amazon, but whatever the case might be, this is a deal that you cannot miss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:58:46.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
