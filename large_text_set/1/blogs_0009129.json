(Jerry Lai/USA Today Sports) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   6:34 PM \nThe Giants unequivocally denied a Monday report that their players had trashed a United plane on the flight home from Sunday's season-ending 38-13 loss in Green Bay. \n\"That is false,\" a team spokesman said. \nNow, Odell Beckham Jr. certainly has a reputation for destroying property after reportedly punching that hole in the wall at Lambeau Field Sunday night. But on Monday, several Giants players didn't even understand the question when asked about the rumored plane incident, first reported by United passengers on Twitter. \n\"Listen to this,\" one Giants player said to a teammate when approached, as if to say 'Get a load of this guy.' \nThere was reportedly a mechanical issue, in fact, that delayed the plane scheduled to operate United Flight 934 from Newark to London's Heathrow Airport at 8:30 a.m. Monday. So there was an aircraft swap, creating a delay. \nThe flight didn't take off until 11:47 a.m. FLOWERS WILTS IN WINTER \nThe Giants used the No. 9 overall pick on Ereck Flowers in 2015, and the offensive lineman has failed to live up to expectations in his first two NFL seasons. \nJerry Reese provided a blunt assessment of Flowers’ development Monday, insinuating the Miami product could lose his job as the Giants’ starting left tackle. \n“He’s still a young player. But it’s time for him to show us the fruits of being a first-round draft pick,” the Giants GM said. “I still think he has a chance to do that. We’ll evaluate that. Is he the left tackle? Should he be in a different position? We’ll evaluate all that. But I do think he’s a big, strong kid that has a chance to be a really good player.” \nFlowers’ struggles this year came primarily in pass protection, where he appeared overmatched against edge rushers. He was called for a league-leading nine offensive holding penalties in the regular season. And the Packers’ Clay Matthews burned Flowers for a strip sack and fumble recovery in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s loss. \n“He’s learning to trust his technique,” Ben McAdoo said. “With young players, the way they come into the league now, they have to take a leap of faith with their technique as far as the bending, keeping your elbows tight and striking with your hands in pass protection, finishing the way you’re capable of finishing. Those are things that need to improve.” \nMcAdoo was then asked if he's content with Flowers’ progress this season. \n“I’m not content with the way we played offensive football,” he said.
