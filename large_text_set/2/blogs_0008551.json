Even bigger than anything Kim Kardashian and Taylor Swift fight about is the bitterness between Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel . Sure, Damon and Kimmel’s hatred is fictional, but it’s hilariously convincing. In a new clip where Kimmel takes his pregnant wife to the doctor , a brand new twist occurred that shows their feud isn’t going to improve anytime soon.\nKimmel and his wife Molly McNearney are keeping the sex of the baby a surprise, which can be extremely difficult to do. But this footage proves that Molly might have yet another secret for her husband.\nAll we’ll say is, Matt Damon has four girls already, and is likely a stellar father. So, that’s good news for Molly. Molly is currently 28 weeks, and things are looking good. “Nothing could ruin this moment,” Kimmel says lovingly.\nAnd then, Matt Damon shows up .\n“Um. I’m the father,” Damon says. Damon had agreed to stop sleeping with Kimmel’s girlfriends (after all, this all started with Kimmel bumping Damon from his show, and then Matt Damon retaliating by sleeping with Kimmel’s ex-girlfriend Sarah Silverman back in the day) but in his eyes, his wife is a brand new category.\nNever forget the impact this incredible moment had on the show, and Kimmel’s life: In Kimmel’s mind, this is actually way worse. And, we definitely agree. But hey, Damon found a loophole.\nWe seriously can’t stop cracking up over the Maury footage, as well. Martin Short was the perfect man to play the role.\nABC The ending has quite the surprise that we never saw coming. But we’re so happy it ended the way it did.\nWe know one day in the future, the yet-to-be-born baby Kimmel will watch this and appreciate his or her very first moment in the spotlight.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:16:02.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
