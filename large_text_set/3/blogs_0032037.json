Facebook screengrab/Presidential Communications \nMANILA, Philippines - Solicitor General Jose Calida asked the Supreme Court (SC) yesterday to dismiss the petition of embattled Sen. Leila de Lima against her indictment and detention on drug trafficking cases. \nIn oral arguments, the top government lawyer argued that the detained senator’s move to bring the case immediately to the high court was clearly forum shopping and a violation of the hierarchy of courts. \nCalida cited De Lima’s pending motion to quash before the Muntinlupa City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 204, which practically seeks the same reliefs and raised the same legal issues as her petition in the SC. \n“De Lima, no matter her stature, is not exempt from the principle of hierarchy of courts,” he told the justices during the third hearing on the case, citing the failure of petitioner to prove exceptional and compelling circumstances that would warrant her case’s exemption to the rule. \n“What is so special about this senator that her lawyers are practically asking this Court to waive its rules so that the court can rule on an incident still pending before respondent Judge Juanita Guerrero? None,” Calida stressed. \nUpon interpellation by Associate Justice Presbitero Velasco Jr., the solicitor general also pointed out that De Lima failed to raise a valid constitutional issue or any issue of transcendental importance to justify relief from the high court.   \nCalida likewise cited as another procedural ground for dismissal of the petition the supposed violation of court rules in the notarization of the verification and certification in De Lima’s petition. \nHe explained that since the verification and certification against forum shopping were fabricated or not signed in the presence of the notary public as required by law, the petition should be considered unsigned pursuant to Section 4, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court and therefore has no legal effect. \nVelasco pointed out during questioning that lawyer Maria Cecille Tresvelles-Cabalo, who supposedly administered De Lima’s signing of the petition last Feb. 24 inside Camp Crime in Quezon City, admitted in her affidavit submitted to the SC that De Lima did not personally subscribe to the petition before her. \nThe magistrate hinted that this could be a violation of the 2004 Rules on Notary Public, which requires the signing and subscription of affidavits personally before a notary public. \nCalida added that De Lima and Cabalo could actually both be held liable for falsification and contempt of court. \nOn the issue of jurisdiction on the drug cases against De Lima, Calida insisted that it should fall before the RTC and not the Sandiganbayan as being pushed by petitioner. \nHe cited Section 90 of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act), which provides that only RTCs designated by the SC can handle drug cases. \nCalida further pointed out that the Sandiganbayan has never tried any drug case. \n“There is no irreconcilable conflict between RA 9165 and the Sandiganbayan charter, as amended by RA 10660. RA 9165 confers on the RTCs exclusive jurisdiction over drug offenses. On the other hand, the Sandiganbayan charter confers on the graft court jurisdiction over offenses committed in relation to public office, to the exclusion of drug cases,” he argued. \nUpon interpellation by Associate Justice Mariano del Castillo, Calida differentiated the act of “taking advantage of public office” as alleged against De Lima and crimes committed “in relation to public office,” which fall under jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. \nHe argued that the position of De Lima as secretary of justice was “just an aggravating circumstance” and that her purpose really was to raise money for her senatorial bid last year. \nChief Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno and Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, for their part, grilled Calida on the jurisdiction issue. \nBoth magistrates pointed out that De Lima’s case requires the SC to settle if the drug case falls within the jurisdiction of the RTC or Sandiganbayan to set the standard for similar drug cases expected to be filed against public officials. \nSereno tackled the issue of violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution in De Lima’s case, citing the gray area on which criminal cases against public officials should be filed before the RTC or the Sandiganbayan. \nShe stressed it would be necessary for the SC to clarify the issue to serve as guide for the Department of Justice on when to pursue cases in RTC and when to refer the cases to the ombudsman, which is tasked to prosecute cases in the anti-graft court. \nCalida, in response, suggested that drug cases should be left to the jurisdiction of RTCs and graft cases to the Sandiganbayan. \nLeonen, on the other hand, quizzed the solicitor general on De Lima’s allegation that she is being persecuted by the Duterte administration for her persistent criticisms on the war on drugs. \nThe justice cited exemptions to the general rule on hierarchy of courts in criminal cases as set by the SC in previous cases. \nBut Calida pointed out that the cases where exemptions were made involved political crimes – not common crimes like drug trafficking – and use of strong arm of the law during martial law.
