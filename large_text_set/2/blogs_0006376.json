According to Bloomberg , the company is looking to hire a manager in charge of licensing, who will form partnerships with retailers and help with the creation of related books, comics, and toys.\n“We are pursuing consumer products and associated promotion because we believe it will drive meaningful show awareness/buzz with more tangible, curated ways to interact with our most popular content,” Netflix said in the job posting . “We want licensed merchandise to help promote our titles, so they become part of the zeitgeist for longer periods of time.”\nIf you think about it, Netflix itself doesn’t have original merchandise, as most toys you may see in the wild are through partnerships with other companies, such as with Marvel. But for original series like Stranger Things , the amount is lacking. Recently, Netflix tested its merchandising potential with a line of Stranger Things products at Hot Topic , which includes T-shirts, mugs, patches, and clothing lifted from characters like Eleven.\nOf course, you can buy fan-made merch on Etsy and unlicensed goodies on places like Amazon (who wants a House of Cards T-shirt ?). However, with this new position, which unlocks a new strategy, consumers can be seeing a whole swath of things to buy.\nFor example, the job posting (it’s still open if you want to apply), mentions books and comics as areas for opportunity, so it’s possible we could see tie-in graphic novels for some Netflix originals.
