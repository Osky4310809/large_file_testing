File photo \nZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines – Four suspected Abu Sayyaf bandits were killed in an encounter with government forces in Basilan on Wednesday. \nSenior Superintendent Nixon Muksan, Basilan police director, identified two of the fatalities as Mobin Kulin, alias Mulawin, and Hadji Villamin Hassan. \nPolice and military operatives were serving a warrant to arrest Hassan when they chanced on Kulin and two other suspects in Barangay Tong-Umus on the island of Tapiantana. \nMuksan said the suspects drew their guns, triggering a firefight. \nHe said Kulin, who has a P600,000 bounty on his head, was charged in connection with the Sipadan kidnapping in 2000. \nKulin was also tagged in the siege at the Dr. Torres Hospital and St. Peter Church in Lamitan City in 2001.   \nAuthorities said Kulin was also behind the kidnapping of plantation workers in Barangay Tairan in Basilan in 2001. Sleepless over kidnaps \nDefense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana admitted that kidnappings and piracy by Abu Sayyaf bandits are giving him sleepless nights. \n“They are actually giving me…a headache,” Lorenzana told a forum at Camp Aguinaldo yesterday. “Sometimes I couldn’t sleep at night thinking about how to solve them.” \nHe said the number of kidnap victims increased from only 18 when President Duterte took office to 31 now, excluding 70-year-old German Jurgen Kantner, who was beheaded last month. \n“It’s very embarrassing to the whole world that the bandits are doing this. But we are doing a lot of things that are within our power,” Lorenzana said. \nHe said joint patrols with Malaysia and Indonesia would be conducted to prevent cross-border kidnappings. \nLorenzana said the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) would also put up a task force based in Bongao town and possibly a permanent division in Jolo. \nDuring his visit to Sulu on Tuesday, the defense chief said the AFP would dispatch additional military equipment and assets. He said more Marine troops would also be deployed if necessary. \nLorenzana said Navy boats had been deployed to the area, even as he admitted that they have no fast seacraft that could run after pirates and bandits. \nHe said the government is also considering the holding of next year’s Balikatan exercises in Mindanao. \n“Maybe we can swing these exercises toward the south to coincide with our fight against piracy and kidnapping,” Lorenzana said. \nNational Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon said the military is applying its full force against the bandits to meet its self-imposed deadline to crush the group in six months. \nMeanwhile, in Basilan, a bomb exploded in front of the Jose Elementary School in Barangay Matatag in Lamitan City yesterday. Another bomb was recovered in front of a church in Barangay Malinis shortly after the blast. \nThe military said the incidents could be a diversionary tactic amid relentless military operations against Abu Sayyaf bandits. – With Michael Punongbayan  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:12:18.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
