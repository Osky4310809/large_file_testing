(Though they did not identify said lyrics.) \nHowever, Ribfest said that decisions were made months in advance and are not based on politics. \nThey refused to drop him, despite the pressure. \nGood, this is starting to get a little ridiculous. \nHe didn’t even express any support for President Donald Trump. \nJust performing in and of itself is now “too political” to be heard? \nAre the lyrics too American for the critics? \nAre “red, white and blue” lyrics now too much?
