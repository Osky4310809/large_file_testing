Kerr said that he’s open to a reduction of the current 82-game schedule and would even be willing to take a pay cut to make it happen. \n“I wouldn’t be opposed to it, even at the expense to my own salary, but it’s something that everyone would have to agree to,” Kerr said before Tuesday game against the Mavericks. “I think even just going down to 75 games, I think that would make a dramatic difference in schedule. Now I don’t see that happening because there is money at stake for everybody. \n“I do think this can be remedied though — maybe not remedied — but I think it can be dramatically helped with what the league is already working on for next year and the consideration of geographics when it comes to the schedule.” Steve Kerr said he \"wouldn't be opposed\" to NBA reducing schedule from 82 games \"even at the expense of my own salary\" pic.twitter.com/YBS5N7EG0P \n— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) March 21, 2017 \nKerr’s comments come a day after commissioner Adam Silver sent a memo to NBA owners, telling them that the issue of healthy players resting will be addressed at the board of governors meeting April 6 in New York. The matter took center stage this month when Kerr rested Steph Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson for the Warriors’ nationally televised game against the Spurs. It was further compounded a week later, when the Cavs rested LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving for the Cavs’ nationally televised game against the Clippers last Saturday. \nKerr pointed to the Warriors’ recent schedule, playing a home game against Boston then travelling to Minnesota and San Antonio in a span of three days, as a reason the league might want to adjust the number of games. \n“Our schedule two weeks ago, I talked about it quite a bit, the way we bounced around from city to city didn’t make any geographical sense,” Kerr said. “Obviously it was done for nationally TV purposes. I think we can work on that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:12:35.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
