The beef between the rapper and C-Breezy all started with a feud over Brown's ex Karrueche Tran. Since then, it has become a trending topic and it looks like everyone is trying to get involved.\nMayweather also divulged on Instagram that not only is he training Soulja Boy, but he and his company Mayweather Promotions will be promoting the matchup. He did this by revealing a poster showing that the bout would be a Pay-Per-View event scheduled for 3 rounds. No official date has been set yet, so we'll all just have to wait and see if this showdown will actually happen. The fight is said to be a charity match.\nA photo posted by Floyd Mayweather (@floydmayweather) on Jan 4, 2017 at 7:52pm PST \n\n???? \nA photo posted by Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) on Jan 5, 2017 at 4:22am PST \n\nMe and my trainer/big brother @floydmayweather #TMT it's official!! \nA video posted by Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) on Jan 5, 2017 at 5:52am PST \n\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:34:52.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
