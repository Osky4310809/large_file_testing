Naturally we expect nothing less from James Corden, who is hosting the Grammys this year . The Late Late Show host is making his Grammys hosting debut, but knowing how amazing he is singing Carpool Karaoke and other musical numbers, we knew he would kill it.\nAnd he did, starting with a hilarious opening number . While Corden set up a dramatic musical number, he promptly flipped that on his head when he fell down some well-lit stairs. At first we thought the fall was accidental, but then we were relieved to realize his genius physical comedy bit was all part of the plan.\nJames Corden made us totally LOL with this fabulous opening fall. . @JKCorden opens the #GRAMMYs with a stumble pic.twitter.com/pQSxpE3oc2 \n— Variety (@Variety) February 13, 2017 Host James Corden makes a #GRAMMYs entrance to remember. pic.twitter.com/oPD2utiar5 \n— CBS Television (@CBS) February 13, 2017 LOL, so adorably hilarious. We love this opening to the show, because we know that James will have a sense of humor throughout, which we ALL need right now.\nAfter his hilarious fall, James launched into a VERY impressive rap. WOW, now those were some really awesome rhymes. We could never speak that fast, and we need to watch it at least five more times to hear all of the genius lyrics.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:41:22.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
