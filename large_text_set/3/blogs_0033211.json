Being dedicated to a core group of friends isn’t just about partying and posing on the ‘gram — it’s about lifting one another up in life, like this bird riding on a cat’s back .\nFine, so we meant that in the figurative sense, but it clearly applies in a literal way as well. We’ve seen cats in weirder positions than this, but given the generally contentious relationship between cats and birds , this particular feline’s show of kindness and extreme nonchalance towards its adorable blue, beaked companion deserves a round of applause.\nIn case you didn’t know it, this is what #squadgoals really looks like:\n& \nPosted by หัวหน้า & เดอะแก๊ง Big Boss & The Gang on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 Yes, being a successful squad member sometimes means supporting a friend who needs help getting around (or one who really just doesn’t feel like using their own limbs/appendages/muscle groups to produce motion).\nAs Mashable points out, this bird-cat interaction is also kind of a big deal because birds have wings, and it would seem like using those built-in, feathered modes of transportation would make for a more convenient and quicker trip. But again, THEY’RE CLEARLY FRIENDS IRL, Y’ALL, which would also explain why the bird-carrying cat appears to be so unmoved by the presence of its tiny passenger.\n& Posted by หัวหน้า & เดอะแก๊ง Big Boss & The Gang on  Wednesday, March 29, 2017 We honestly can’t be sure if this laid-back feline was always super bird-friendly, or if it’s one of those cats that routinely re-evalutes its life and only recently arrived at this place of all animal-inclusive serenity.\nEither way, we can all take a lesson from this cat and bird duo about what it really means to lend a helping hand (or back) to a friend.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:27:32.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
