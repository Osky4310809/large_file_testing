Not even Karan Johar and Kajol ! In real life, things function a little differently. Like, when a sibling or BFF breaks up with a partner, than that means your friendship is over with them too. We're not saying that's the right way to go, but that's mostly how things happen. But in B-town celebrity-land, it's seems okay for someone to hang out with a friend or sibling's ex, without making it look awkward. \nAmrita Arora and Arbaaz Khan: Now that Amrita's sister Malaika has separated from husband Arbaaz Khan, we didn't expected the two to mingle, but guess we were wrong. Arbaaz and Amrita both celebrated Christmas together. Amrita's Instagram post says that! X'mas vibes at the moms! #joycesbash #familyfirst @arbaazkhanofficial @joycearora A photo posted by Amrita Arora (@amuaroraofficial) on Dec 25, 2016 at 2:03am PST \nArpita Khan and Katrina Kaif: We all know what equation Salman Khan (Arpita's brother) and Katrina shared. Post the Salman-Kat break up it was obvious that the â€˜Khandaan' would not have anything to do with Katrina. But that's not how it went down! Katrina was very much part of Arpita's wedding ceremonies. In fact, six weeks ago the two were seen partying hard together at a private bash. Love you gorgeous ðŸ˜˜!

The two are very much in touch and recently Zayed was also seen attending Hrithik's birthday party. #HrithikRoshan in #Bandra with sons, #Hrehaan and #Hridhaan followed by #ZayedKhan with his sons, #Zidaan and #Aariz.

Well, this didn't make things sour between Deepika and Ayan. The two are very much friends and also worked together on the film Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.
