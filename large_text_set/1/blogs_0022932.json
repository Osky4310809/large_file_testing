In 1993 a Stratus server was booted up by an IT application architect -- and it's still running. An anonymous reader writes: \"It never shut down on its own because of a fault it couldn't handle,\" says Phil Hogan, who's maintained the server for 24 years . That's what happens when you include redundant components. \"Over the years, disk drives, power supplies and some other components have been replaced but Hogan estimates that close to 80% of the system is original,\" according to Computerworld. There's no service contract -- he maintains the server with third-party vendors rather than going back to the manufacturer, who says they \"probably\" still have the parts in stock. And while he believes the server's proprietary operating system hasn't been updated in 15 years, Hogan says \"It's been extremely stable.\" The server will finally be retired in April, and while the manufacturer says there's some more Stratus servers that have been running for at least 20 years -- this one seems to be the oldest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T03:07:41.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
