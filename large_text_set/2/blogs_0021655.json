Does he or she make you feel happy, and loved? Unfortunately, while that sure is a valid question, our definition of romance is not the most accurate. We tend to subconsciously associate romance with big gestures of love, which means that a guy who maybe books a yacht for a girl and takes her out on Valentine's day is much more romantic than, say, a guy who cooks up his girl's favourite meal. The bigger the better... needless to say, this is the worst association of romance. \nWhen I got married, seven years ago, romance for me was in the bigger things. However, the problem with that was the more I expected, the more disappointed I got. This is not to say that things were not romantic. They sure were. However because my expectation were a date on the yacht, I couldn't look at the smaller things. \nIt's okay to expect grand, public declarations of love. But, sometimes, you also need to open your eyes to the smaller things. Someone who always wants you to call once you reach, someone who is super concerned about whether you have eaten or not... that's romantic right there. It's probably not something that you can show to others, or maybe click a picture of and hashtag it, but do you really need that? As long as it works for you, it's great. \nFor me, my relationship saw a huge change when I stopped expecting big gestures and focused more on the little, everyday things. Because once the grand expectations stopped, I realised that the little things were as romantic and fun as the bigger things. \nIf you feel that romance is dwindling from your relationship, trust me, just re-evaluate your expectations. Big things are great, but the smaller, regular gestures are amazing too.
