Björn Höcke (centre) marches with AfD members in Raguhn ( Getty ) \nThe comment was understood to refer to Berlin’s Holocaust memorial, which pays tribute to the Jewish victims of the Nazi regime using five acres covered with almost 3,000 commemorative blocks. \nHundreds of gathered supporters applauded as Mr Höcke’s described Germans as a “brutally defeated people” and called on the country to stop atoning for Nazi crimes.

Germany's AfD says Islam is not welcome \nGermany's Vice Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, said it had sent shivers down his spine. \n“Never, never must we allow ourselves to let the demagogy of a Björn Höcke go unchallenged,” he added. Syrian refugee suing Facebook over 'fake news' posts \nJosef Schuster, chairman of the Central Council of Jews, said that the AfD had “shown its true face with these anti-Semitic and utterly inhuman words.” \nDiether Dehmn, of the Left party, said he was reporting Mr Höcke and believed he had been emboldened by the federal constitutional court’s decision not to ban the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD), despite finding it had an “affinity” with Nazism and used anti-Semitic language. \nThomas Oppermann, parliamentary leader of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung Mr Höcke had been unmasked as a “right-wing extremist”. \n“Höcke is a Nazi, I’m glad that most of the population is reacting to his statement with disgust and horror,” he added. \nAs the furore continued, Mr Höcke released a statement saying any suggestion he had criticised the Holocaust memorial was “a malicious and deliberately denigratory interpretation of what I actually said”.

The German political party delighting in breaking Nazi taboos \nThe AfD politician has previously been compared to Goebbels for remarks including claims Africans are \"fundamentally different\" to Europeans and that the \"German Volk\" are being threatened by migrants. \nHis party has long been accused of racial discrimination and hate speech, but its members include more moderate conservatives and Eurosceptics seeking an alternative to Ms Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). \nIts rhetoric has won support amid concern over the refugee crisis, terror attacks in Germany and mass sex assaults in Cologne. \nWith polls putting it on 12-15 per cent of national support, the AfD is tipped to win seats in the Bundestag for the first time in September's national election. \nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T15:08:18.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
