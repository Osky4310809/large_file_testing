If there‚Äôs one thing that we‚Äôve learned from watching Selena Gomez‚Äôs latest Insta story it‚Äôs that the only thing better than going to the Grammys is hanging out with your friends and doing Destiny‚Äôs Child karaoke.\nWhile rumors about Selena Gomez‚Äôs supposed romance with The Weeknd have been flying, (people have even suggested that the couple look like Gomez‚Äôs parents ) it seems that Sel is readying for her return to the music scene with a brand new single featuring Kygo, which is set for release this Friday (February 17th). The star announced last year that she was taking a break from the spotlight following some personal and health problems, and this new music is the first taste of what she‚Äôs been cooking up recently.\nA post shared by Kygo (@kygomusic) on Feb 9, 2017 at 9:27am PST \nWell, in preparation for new music, and to let her hair down, Selena skipped the Grammys, instead opting to have a night out with her BFFs. While the awards show was going on, Selena was sharing videos where her and her friends seemed like they were having the greatest time.\nFebruary 12: Selena with friends (via @caro_franklin Instagram Story) \nA post shared by Selena Gomez News Source (@dailyselenagomez_) on Feb 12, 2017 at 11:36pm PST \nSelena was even partying with Kygo, whom she‚Äôs been working with in the studio.\nShe's so happy ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è (via @kygomusic) ‚Äî @SelenaRusso \nA post shared by Selena Gomez Updates ‚≠êÔ∏è (@selenamgomezfanss) on Feb 13, 2017 at 4:02am PST \nHowever, our favorite video sees Sel and her friends doing Destiny‚Äôs Child karaoke. They just look like they‚Äôre having so much fun!\nFebruary 12: Selena with friends at 1 OAK nightclub (via @lauratoggs Instagram Story) \nA post shared by Selena Gomez News Source (@dailyselenagomez_) on Feb 13, 2017 at 3:10am PST \nMeanwhile, Teen Vogue are reporting that Selena Gomez also cropped up on Katy Perry‚Äôs Instagram live video, too, with some speculating whether the pair have worked on new music together.\nRegardless, it‚Äôs so great to see Selena out and having fun. We were heartbroken to hear that she had been going through a difficult patch last year, and we‚Äôre glad to see that she‚Äôs out again and living her best life.\nAlso, we‚Äôre SUPER excited to hear her collaboration with Kygo when that drops on Friday!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:14:21.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
