Playtonic told GamesIndustry.biz on Thursday that it had removed Jafari from the game “in light of his recent personal viewpoints.”\n“Playtonic is a studio that celebrates diversity in all forms and strives to make games that everyone can enjoy,” the developer said . “As such, we deeply regret any implied association that could make players feel anything but 100% comfortable in our game worlds, or distract from the incredible goodwill and love shown by our fans and Kickstarter backers.\nYooka-Laylee, which will be available for most gaming platforms including Playstation 4, XboxOne and the Nintendo Switch, will be released next month.\nJafari did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:12:39.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
