Fans of BlackBerry and of a full keyboard, were immediately intrigued. Presented as part of World Mobile Congress last night in Barcelona, it looks like BlackBerry and its new device partner TCL, did not disappoint the crowd.\nThe new BlackBerry KeyOne looks like a solid device, featuring an aluminium body and Gorilla Glass 4 front. The smartphone comes with a 4.5-inch LCD, with a 3:2 aspect ratio and resolution of 1620 x 1080. Most importantly, it comes with a full physical QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard is touch sensitive and you can use it to scroll, without ever touch the screen. Furthermore you can assign each key to a shortcut. The device is quite narrow, meaning that it can actually be used one-handed. So far, the reviews of the keyboard are great and it seems to feel much better than a touchscreen keyboard.\nThe new BlackBerry KeyOne will release in April, priced at $549. Will you be picking one up?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:50:03.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
