As he concluded his set, Kimmel told the applauding audience to remember that if they take a shot at Trump on stage tonight, they Commander in Chief will more than likely tweet about it first thing in the morning. \n“We’re at the Oscars. The Academy Awards. You’re nominated. You got to come. Your families are nominated.some of you will get to come up here on this stage tonight and give a speech that the President of the United States will tweet about in all caps during his 5:00 A.M. bowel movement tomorrow, and I think that’s pretty darn excellent if you ask me.” \nWatch above, via ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:05:52.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
