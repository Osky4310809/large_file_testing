It is time to stop viewing education spending as a cost and to start seeing it as an investment in England's future, and in our children's.\" Image copyright NAHT Image caption Urgent government action is needed to boost school budgets, says NAHT leader Russell Hobby 'Staff cuts' \nLiam Collins head of Uplands Community College in Wadhurst, East Sussex, said budget pressures amounted to \"a cut of 10 teachers, fewer clubs, no pastoral support, a narrowed curriculum, no counselling for students struggling with mental health issues, crumbling buildings, no IT upgrades, no new textbooks and no school planners. \n\"Eventually this will impact on student outcomes.\" \nLabour said the NAHT's survey showed ministers \"continue to hide their heads in the sand\" on school funding. \nShadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \"Headteachers should not be faced with a decision of whether to cut school staff or invest in new equipment. \n\"The Tories have no plan to deal with falling budgets, chronic teacher shortages and not enough good school places - this is no way to run a schools system.\" \nA Department for Education spokesman said that school funding \"will be over Â£40bn in 2016-17 - its highest level on record\". \nThe spokesman said the government's fairer funding proposals to end what ministers have termed \"a postcode lottery\" in school budgets would help. \n\"These proposals will not only see more than half of England's schools receive a cash boost in 2018-19 but will also give head teachers certainty over their future budgets, helping them make long-term plans and secure further efficiencies,\" said the spokesman. \n\"We recognise that schools are facing cost pressures, which is why we will continue to provide advice and support to help them use their funding in cost-effective ways, including improving the way they buy goods and services, so they get the best possible value for their pupils.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T02:58:18.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
