He did, however, add that presidents get better at the job the longer they are in office. \n“I believe in term limits for president,” Obama said. “Because I think that there’s no doubt I’m a better president now than when I started.” \n“The bubble is the bubble. And, I think we’ve done a pretty good job staying in touch with the American people,” the President said, “but at a certain point you can’t help but lose some feel for what’s on the ground because you’re not on the ground.” \nHost George Stephanopoulos interrupted, “You didn’t think Donald Trump could win” as an example of the president not having a “feel” for what was happening with the American people. \n“Case in point,” Obama replied. “So that tells me there’s a utility in the democracy refreshing itself on an ongoing basis.” \nWATCH: . @POTUS says there’s a “bubble” effect to the presidency—not thinking Trump could win was “case in point.” https://t.co/hgpxF3XTdn #thisweek pic.twitter.com/COzs8Rth7Y", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T20:08:09.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
