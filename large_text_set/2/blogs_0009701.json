Nokia 6 available on eBay India, but you probably shouldn’t buy it yet   6 is a mid-rung offering with an all-metal body, a 5.5-inch full HD display and Android Nougat” \nHMD Global, the new home of Nokia devices, recently launched its first Nokia-branded Android smartphone dubbed the Nokia 6 . So far, the company has only made the phone available in China. The device is expected to be available in global   after an international launch at MWC later this month. However, ahead of the official unveiling, the phone is already available in India, but there’s a catch involved. \nThe Nokia 6 is up for grabs unofficially on eBay India for a hefty price of Rs 32,440, which is almost double the price in China. The listing on the e-tailer clearly says that the phone is imported, and buyers will have to wait for as long as 20 – 25 days to get the device in their hands. The device is being offered with a one-year seller warranty. If you’re keen on picking up the phone, you’d be better off waiting a couple of weeks. Nokia is expected to introduce a couple more Android smartphones and a revamped 3310 at its MWC event this month, and we expect some announcements on India price and availability as well. Plus, it’s worth mentioning that imported Nokia 6 units will come with the Chinese ROM installed. \nFor the uninitiated, the Nokia 6 features an all-metal design, a 5.5-inch 1080p display with a layer of 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3, a Snapdragon 430 octa-core SoC, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It offers a 16MP rear camera, an 8MP front shooter, a 3,000mAh battery, 4G LTE, USB Type-C, Dolby ATMOS sound and Android Nougat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:25:30.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
