This morning, the news broke that Jay Z will be officially inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\nJay Z was the first rapper to ever even be nominated for the prestigious recognition. The Songwriters Hall of Fame celebrates the people behind popular music. Many artists, like Jay Z, write their own music. But others often collaborate with these talented songwriters to create their hits.\nAnd, until this nomination, no rapper had ever been recognized for their songwriting. The announcement came from fellow producer and musician Nile Rodgers. And Rodgers excitedly praised Jay Z’s induction, calling him a “revolutionary.” Because of the incredible number of awards and nominations he’s received throughout his illustrious career, it’s hard to disagree.\n“He has changed the way we listen to music.” -- @NileRodgers on Jay Z becoming first rapper inducted into 2017 Songwriters Hall of Fame #SHOF pic.twitter.com/rHISmBLRcp \n— CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) February 22, 2017 Rodgers recognized Jay Z’s massive impact on the music industry. He made the point that the multiple award-winner basically turned rap music into mainstream pop. Since Reasonable Doubt came out in 1996, he’s completely changed the music industry. Plus, with all the behind-the-scenes work he still does with his label, Roc Nation, he continues to create a lasting musical legacy.\n\nAlong with being an excellent songwriter, the talented Jay Z wears many hats. He’s a businessman, a producer, and – of course – husband to the one and only Queen Bey. So it only seems appropriate that a man with such a record-shattering spouse continues to shatter records of his own.\nThe Awards Ceremony will take place June 5 in (Jay Z’s hometown) New York City. \nWe are so happy for the groundbreaking entertainer. He definitely deserves this honor. And we hope that many more incredible artists like him are recognized like this in the future.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:34:14.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
