It's part of the game, he's been in football for a lifetime and knows what it involves when you are coach of an important club like Inter. \n\"It's all perfectly normal. Just look at Juventus; they are winning and dominating in Italy for years, yet they talk about the coach leaving at the end of the season. \n\"I repeat, Stefano is not worried about next year.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:04:13.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
