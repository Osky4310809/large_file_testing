It took them 122 points and five minutes of overtime to do so, but for the first time in 12 matchups, the Raptors won. Advertisement \nMost one-sided streaks like this in the NBA are the product of a good team beating up on a bad team. As you’d expect, the Spurs have put together several long winning streaks and the Sixers have lost a ton of games in a row to good teams . However, the Raptors and Bulls have both been good over the past four seasons, and if anything, the Raptors have been better. Losing 11 straight games to a slightly worse opponent is strange, and it got to the point that Bulls and Raptors players have recognized that it had become a Thing. \nAs Jimmy Butler said before the game , “I think we just catch them on off nights.” Tonight was an off night for the Raptors, right up until Serge Ibaka and Robin Lopez started throwing punches at each other . At that point, they were down by 16 points and Ibaka had been a more valuable player than Lopez.

Newly acquired wing defender P.J. Tucker was tremendous, and DeMar DeRozan came alive. DeRozan ended with 42 points, and he also came up with a huge block down the stretch \nThe Raptors ended the game on a 50-32 run after the ejections, but they almost gave it away in regulation. Jimmy Butler was tremendous in the fourth quarter tonight, and he clawed back a four-point lead for the Bulls with a minute left with a big layup. \nThe two star shooting guards swapped missed shots at the buzzer to send the game to overtime, where the Raptors finally ended things despite not having a lead in the game until the final 90 seconds. The win was not as buck wild as their victory over the 1996 Jordan Bulls , but finally beating the dysfunctional Bulls right before the playoffs has to feel good.
