Not to be confused for the Oscar Wilde play of the same title, this is author Sonia Purnell’s upcoming biography of American heiress/super-spy Virginia Hall. \nIn the years before World War II, Hall tried to break into the American Foreign Service but was denied due to her gender as well as a leg injury. She eventually worked for British intelligence during the war and eventually was allowed to join the OSS, the forerunner of the CIA. \nRidley will next reprise her role as enigmatic Force-sensitive Rey in Rian Johnson’s sequel Star Wars: The Last Jedi , and is currently filming Kenneth Branagh’s star-studded remake of Murder on the Orient Express . She is also attached to star in Lionsgate’s YA franchise hopeful Chaos Walking . \n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:03:55.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
