Alan Peter Cayetano will head the Department of Foreign Affairs after Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. steps down. The STAR/Bernardo Betuigas, file \nMANILA, Philippines — Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano said that he is \"preparing for different jobs\" as he has yet to receive a formal offer to join President Rodrigo Duterte's Cabinet. \nThe president earlier said that Cayetano will head the Department of Foreign Affairs by mid-2017 after Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. steps down to return to the United States. \nYasay was a visiting law professor at the Richardson School of Law in the University of Hawaii before returning to the Philippines to head the DFA. \nREAD: Alan Peter to replace Yasay in DFA \nCayetano said that he will meet with the president in April or May to discuss the matter. \n\"Tingnan natin kung pagdating ng May o June, 'yun pa rin ang... pinakamabuti o makakatulong ako doon. Kasi kumukuha ka ng posisyon para makadagdag ka, hindi para makabawas... Kung sa tingin ng Pangulo, meron akong maidadagdag sa departamento, malugod kong tatanggapin,\" Cayetano said.   \nDuterte's former running mate said that he is willing to help the administration in any capacity that the president deems fit to achieve the goal of instituting genuine reforms for the country. \n\"Ayokong pangunahan ang pangulo o sinumang secretary... I think they're all performing well... Pero kung anong sabihin ng pangulo sa mga susunod na buwan, I'd be happy to help,\" the senator said. \nCayetano has been joining presidential visits and meetings abroad as well as international conferences on the South China Sea in preparation to assume the top DFA post. \nThe law prohibits losing candidates from taking appointive positions for a year after the elections. His term in the Senate ends in 2019. — Patricia Lourdes Viray  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T11:04:29.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
