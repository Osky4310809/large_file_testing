MUST READ   \nThe BJP stole a march on the Congress which failed to muster the numbers despite emerging as the single-largest party with 17 seats. \nThe Congress was hoping to get the support of the GFP which has bagged three seats in its maiden bid at the hustings. \nBut by deft moves, coordinated by party veteran and Union minister Nitin Gadkari, the BJP succeeded in keeping the Congress at bay, winning over smaller parties and Independents, who were keen that Parrikar should lead the ministry. \nParrikar, 61, an engineer from IIT-Bombay, led the BJP in 2012 to victory and became the CM. He, however, was made the Defence Minister at the Centre in 2014 and was succeeded by Laxmikant Parsekar as the CM. \nParsekar was defeated in Mandrem constituency this time and also most of the ministers in his cabinet failed to win. \nParrikar, who graduated to the BJP from the RSS ranks, had also served as CM of the state from 2000 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2005. \nRight from the start of the campaign this time, Parrikar was widely seen as the chief minister probable. He also extensively campaigned for the party in his home state. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, during the campaign and before, lavished praises on Parrikar over his competence and decision-making capacity as the Defence Minister, especially in the context of the surgical strike on terror launch pads across the border in Jammu and Kashmir. \n(With PTI inputs)   15:24 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T12:30:10.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
