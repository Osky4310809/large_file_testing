I did not know it was meant to kill him,‚Äù Oriental Daily reported the suspect as saying. \nThe second woman covered Jong-nam's mouth with a handkerchief as she sprayed him. \nReports in Chinese media say that following the incident, the two women jumped into a taxi and left the airport. \nThe four men made their way to a hotel. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (Photo: AFP) \nThe suspect claimed that when she could not find her companion and the four men, she headed back to the airport the very next day, where she was arrested by police who identified her from the CCTV. \nPolice confirmed they are still on the look out for more suspects in the case. \nJong-nam is believed to have been assassinated on the orders of his despot half-brother Kim Jong-un.
