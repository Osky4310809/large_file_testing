He thought McCarthy’s combative and aggressive impersonation was a little exaggerated. \nMcCarthy \"needs to slow down on the gum-chewing — way too many pieces in there,” Spicer reportedly said, adding she should “dial back a bit.” \nSpicer reportedly has a major addiction to gum, revealing to the Washington Post he chews and swallows two-and-a-half packs by noon. “I talked to my doctor about it,\" Spicer told the newspaper. \"He said it’s no problem.” \nSpicer had harsher words about Alec Baldwin’s portrayal of his boss earlier in the show. \"Alec has gone from funny to mean, and that's unfortunate,” Spicer said. “ SNL used to be really funny. There's a streak of meanness now that they've crossed over to mean.\" \nSpicer also appeared on FOX News' FOX & Friends Monday morning, where the subject of the widely shared skit came up. \n\"It was cute, it was funny, [but] I'd rather talk about the issues the president is so committed to helping Americans on,\" Spicer said. \"But it's part of American culture.\" \nPresident Trump has yet to weigh in on the episode. In the past, Trump has blasted the show as “unwatchable” and “totally biased” and has said Baldwin's impersonation of him “just can’t get any worse.” \nMcCarthy surprised everyone when she dropped into the episode — it was being hosted by Kristen Stewart — in an ill-fitting suit to mock Spicer and his aggressive press briefings, which have been marked by their combative tone with reporters. \n\"Before we begin, I know that myself and the press have gotten off to a rocky start,\" McCarthy's Spicer said to open the skit. \"When I say ‘rocky start’, I mean it in the sense of Rocky the movie because I came out here to punch you.\" \nGhostbusters and Bridesmaids star mocked the press secretary’s recent problems with the truth , saying that when the news was announced that Trump would nominate Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, “The crowd greeted him with a standing ovation, which lasted a full 15 minutes. And you can check the tape on that. Everyone was smiling. Everyone was happy.” \nThose are the facts forever,” McCarthy’s Spicer continued. \nSpicer appeared to tweet out a password last week ), McCarthy’s Spicer fought with a New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush (played by cast member Bobby Moynihan) over the use of the term “ban” to describe Trump’s controversial immigration order that prohibited travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. \nYou just said that,” McCarthy’s Spicer told the reporter after booing him from the podium. “He’s quoting you. It’s your words. He’s using your words, when you use the words and he uses them back, it’s circular using of the word and that’s from you.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:46:29.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
