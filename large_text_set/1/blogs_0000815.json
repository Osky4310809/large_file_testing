Akhilesh supporters had, earlier today, removed Shivpal Yadav from the post during the party convention. \nSources close to Akhilesh Yadav claimed Shivpal Yadav manipulated a letter issued by Mulayam Singh Yadav after party’s Parliamentary Board meeting. \nMulayam, meanwhile, has retaliated by expelling SP national vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda for attending “unconstitutional” national convention and accused him of idulging in anti-party activities. \nMulayam also expelled senior leader and Rajya Sabha member Naresh Agrawal from the party. \nEarlier today, Akhilesh Yadav was anointed the SP president in place of his father Mulayam Singh Yadav at a party national convention here which also proposed the expulsion of “outsider” Amar Singh. \nMulayam termed “illegal” all decisions taken at the convention called by the Akhilesh camp. He again expelled Ram Gopal Yadav for six years from the party. \nAfter a brief truce in the ruling Samajwadi Party on Saturday, the open war in the party was all out in the open with the national convention declaring Akhilesh Yadav as party president. \nThe proposal was met with a huge applause by party cadres gathered at the sprawling Janeshwar Misra Park amid chilly conditions. \nRam Gopal also moved a proposal to make Mulayam Singh, the founder president of the party, as party patron and removing Shivpal Singh Yadav from the state unit post. \nHowever, as soon as the national convention got underway at the Janeshwar Misra park, Mulayam Singh issued a letter declaring the convention as unconstitutional. \n“Today a so-called convention has been convened by Ram Gopal. This is against party constitution and discipline. This has been convened to damage the party,” Yadav said in the letter. \nMulayam Singh also announced a convention of his own on January 5. \n(TNN & agencies) DISCLAIMER : Views expressed above are the author's own.
