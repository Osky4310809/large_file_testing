Scientists with Japan’s National Institute of Informatics (NII) say that potential identity thieves can actually read your fingerprints from up to nine feet away.\nThat means if your pointer and middle fingers are exposed to the camera (and in focus) it’s not that hard for someone to steal your identity. \n“Just by casually making a peace sign in front of a camera, fingerprints can become widely available,” researcher Isao Echizen said. Fingerprints are used more and more frequently as security measures in tech, including to get into smartphones and bank account apps, so Echizen says keeping your prints off the internet should be a priority.\nMaybe it’s time to take down a photo or two off of social media. You can never be too careful.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T07:04:59.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
