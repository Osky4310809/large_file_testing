He then walked towards non-striker Peter Handscomb to seek his views about reviewing the decision. After a brief discussion, both batsmen turned towards the dressing room with Smith making a hand gesture so as to indicate what they should do. Nigel Llong, the umpire, was quick to spot the intention and gave Smith the marching orders. Smith's move left Virat Kohli and Co. furious. \nAccording to the law, a batsman can only consult his partner before taking the DRS and, at no time, can seek help from the umpires or the team to make a decision. Clarke felt if Australia have been seeking help from the dressing room, then that's unacceptable. \n\"I want to find out from the Australian team if they're using the DRS in that way, if they are then that is unacceptable,\" he told India Today . \"My concern and my worry is that when you look at the footage of what happened with Steve Smith, Peter Handscomb ... actually suggests to Steve Smith to turn around and have a look at the support staff. \n\"If it is only a one-off, I don't think that would have happened. The fact that Peter Handscomb is even thinking about telling the Australian captain to turn around and look to the support staff, I've got my concerns.\" \nKohli, while fronting the media after the game , said they had noticed this in the first two days of the Test and had informed the umpires and the match referee. \"I saw that two times happening when I was batting out there. I pointed it out to the umpire as well, that it has happened twice, that I've seen their players looking upstairs for confirmation, and that's why the umpire was at him,\" he revealed. \n\"When he turned back, the umpire knew exactly what was going on, because we observed that, we told match referee also, and the umpires, that they've been doing that for the last three days and this has to stop.\" \nAfter the high octane drama, that saw India clinch the game by 75 runs to level the series 1-1, the two teams now have a nine-day break ahead of the third Test in Ranchi. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:48:19.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
