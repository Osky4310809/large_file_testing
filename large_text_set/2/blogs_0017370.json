He reminded us that he was one of the first to pioneer the use of eco/electric technology using one of the first cars. \nHe knew all about the different types of batteries and how it all worked.” London in line for technology trial to cut car emissions \nMayor Sadiq Khan is exploring ways to reduce toxic air in London. \nOlder, more polluting cars will have to pay a £10 toxicity charge, or T-charge, to drive in central London from October 23. \nTfL currently has 9,000 buses in operation, with 4,000 approaching the need for refurbishment.
