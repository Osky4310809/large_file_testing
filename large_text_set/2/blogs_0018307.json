We know that the result in Paris hurt, but if there is any team that can turn something like this around, then that team is Barca. \n\"It is a difficult result, but not impossible. This team has done a lot in recent years and they deserve every confidence in the world. \n\"I am with them to the death, not just because they are friends of mine but because at Barca we are all in the same boat. \n\"We cannot afford to have doubts. We have to fight to the end.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:44:07.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
