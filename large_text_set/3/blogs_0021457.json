The prolonged leaks led to serious impacts on residents, farmers and wildlife, killing birds and fish. \nThe fine imposed on Wednesday was for numerous offences in 2013 and 2014 at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore. \nThe Environment Agency , which brought the prosecution, said the enormous volume of untreated sewage discharged was unprecedented – 1.4bn litres – as was the length of time over which the discharges occurred. \nThe sewage caused long-term pollution in the Thames and some tributaries, revolting riverside users and wiping out the season for a commercial cray fisherman. The Environment Agency said it was the biggest freshwater pollution case it had ever undertaken. \n“I have to make the fine sufficiently large that [Thames Water] get the message,” said Judge Francis Sheridan, who delivered the sentence at Aylesbury crown court. Describing the breaches as “wicked”, he said: “One has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned.” UK water companies receive record sewage leak fines Read more \nWater companies have been the most frequent polluters of beaches and rivers in England and past fines were criticised as too low to deter these highly profitable companies, which often offended repeatedly. But a change in sentencing guidelines in 2014 is now leading to far heavier penalties. \nThames Water, which is the UK’s biggest water company and serves about a quarter of the population, was fined £1m in 2016 for repeated discharges of sewage into the Grand Union canal in Hertfordshire and £380,000 later the same year, after a sewage leak in an area of outstanding natural beauty in the Chilterns. \nThames Water made an operating profit of £742m in 2015-16 and paid out £82m in dividends. It is owned by a consortium of institutional investors, including funds from China and Abu Dhabi, and was managed by Macquarie Capital Funds, which sold its final stake earlier in March to Kuwaiti and Canadian investors. \nIn 2013, the Observer revealed that the nation’s 10 biggest water companies were the most persistent polluters of England’s rivers and beaches. They committed more than 1,000 incidents between 2005-2013 but were fined a total of just £3.5m, a sum described at the time as “pitiful” by a senior MP. \nThames Water was the most heavily fined company in that period, paying £842,500 for 87 incidents. Fines have soared since the change in sentencing guidelines but it remains too early to determine if pollution incidents are falling, due to the time it takes prosecutions to come to court. Southern Water fined record £2m for sewage leak on Kent beaches Read more \nHowever, one source close to the issue told the Guardian recently: “The courts have basically added a nought. Once it gets to that level, the boards and shareholders of water companies start to take notice.” \nThe previous record fine was the £2m penalty imposed on Southern Water in December for flooding beaches in Kent with raw sewage, which left them closed to the public for nine days. \nThe Environment Agency called that event “catastrophic” and the judge in the case said the company’s repeat offending was “wholly unacceptable”. The company apologised unreservedly, as it had when fined £200,000 in 2013 for similar offences. \nWater companies have been frequently criticised for making huge profits and awarding large shareholder dividends while paying little or no corporation tax. In October 2015, the National Audit Office found that an £800m windfall for water companies had not been passed on to consumers.
