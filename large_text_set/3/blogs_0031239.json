When Graham exited the shop with friends, investigators reported over their radios that they thought they saw a gun in the waistband of his pants.\nOn the stand, Haste recounted how he got out of his police van during a drug probe in Graham’s neighborhood and followed the teenager into his apartment. He went around and got in through a neighbor’s home, then unlocked the front door for other members of his team. They walked up the stairs tensely, watching for suspects and looking for cover. He said he saw Graham sidestep into a bathroom, and he leaned inside to face him.\n“He’s in front of me,” he said. “And I want to take him into custody. I want to put an end to this,” he said. Haste yelled, “Show me your hands!” but Graham instead reached deeper into his pants and yelled obscenities, Haste testified.\nAfter he pulled the trigger, he saw Graham’s grandmother and little brother screaming in the hallway, and a tan boot pointed up out of the bathroom door. He was ordered outside by other officers.\nNo gun was found, but a bag of marijuana was floating in the toilet.\nHaste said he had been in similar situations more than 10 times before but had never pulled the trigger.\nHaste said he reacted using the best of his training experience from the department.\n“I don’t think there is a perfect world,” he said.\nHaste’s attorney argued earlier that there are no specific guidelines to follow in these situations.\n“What’s important to remember is that these decisions were made in milliseconds,” London said.\nLondon called Haste a “hero officer who was attempting to take a weapon off the street.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:35:48.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
