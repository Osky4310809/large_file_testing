Union Square Donuts has been working towards this Brookline expansion for some time. In addition to its original storefront in Somerville, it operates a stall at Boston Public Market and has popped up in a few spaces and farmers markets around the metro area; its doughies (doughnut hole-like treats) can also be found at Longfellows Coffee in Cambridge, among other locations. The new Brookline store is located at 409 Harvard St., the former Wulf's Fish Market space, as previously reported . As of January 12, it was awaiting final inspections and likely to open this week, according to Wicked Local . But yeasted doughnuts are reportedly already in production , so if you stop by, you might be lucky enough to snag one, as Boston Restaurant Talk noted , indicating a soft opening. An employee reached today at the main Union Square Donuts office couldn’t confirm that the new location has already softly opened but said it would open soon. Co-owner Heather Schmidt shared a post on Instagram today indicating that the crew was in the kitchen for a dry-run ahead of an official opening this week.
