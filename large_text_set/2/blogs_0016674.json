(Source: Twitter) \nWith allegations of promoting anti-Muslim sentiments in his show, a Bareilly-based religious organisation All India Faizan-e-Madina Council has announced a bounty of Rs 10,786 for beheading Islamic scholar and journalist Tarek Fatah. The organization has also announced a bounty of Rs 5 lack on the head of the private channel, Zee News’ owner, Subhash Chandra, for telecasting the program called ‘Fatah ka Fatwa’. \nOver post in Twitter, the 67-year old journalist stated that he is not scared by the death threats against him. “A bounty on my head,” Indian Mullahs on my tail, Jihadis lusting my blood, but they don’t scare me,” he tweeted. \nAll India Faizan-e-Madina Council head Moeen Siddiqui Noori had many previous instances of announcing bounty on people hurting Muslim sentiments. \nAlso Watch: \nPakistan born Canadian writer Tarek Fatah, had often been targeted in the past for being a controversial right-wing figure and for his views against Islamism and radicalism. In past instances Fatah had repeatedly expressed his views supporting Balochistan and deferring Pakistan’s claim for Kashmir. In one such recent incident, Fatah was manhandled by Islamic extremists at an Urdu poetry and cultural festival ‘Rekhta’. \nHowever in a humorous reply to the attack, Fatah tweeted, “I am happy as a 67-year-old I was able to confront 20-year-old Urdu jihadists. Hundred howling hyenas let loose on me.” \nTarek Fatah’s show in Zee News called ‘Fatah ka Fatwa’ is a platform where he conducts debates and panel discussions on issues related to Islam. The journalist, who had often been bashed verbally because of his controversial views, is also active on Twitter, where he keeps sharing his views on Islam. In a recent tweet, Fatah said, “Islamize yr soul Muslim, not your country; Put a Hijab over yr ego, not your head; Cover yr good deeds in a Burqa, not your faces.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:59:53.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
