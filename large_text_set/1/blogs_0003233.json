Last month, animated band member Murdoc released a Christmas playlist. Today, Gorillaz bassist Noodle posted a new mix on Soundcloud honoring female artists past and present. \"In search of new sounds and new inspiration, I found these kick-ass women who in their own individual ways are true pioneers in the writing, production and creation of MUSIC. They have inspired me and I hope they inspire you too.\" The mix features music from Grimes, Empress Of, Kali Uchis , Anna Meredith, Abra, Mica Levi & Oliver Coates, Fatima Al Qadiri and more. The songs are intersected by clips of interviews with the late electronic music composer Delia Derbyshire, who is the mastermind behind the Doctor Who opening theme (the finale of the mix), as well as with deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie. Take a listen to the mix and share your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nIn search of new sounds and new inspiration, I found these kick-ass women who in their own individual ways are true pioneers in the writing, production and creation of MUSIC.
