By: FE Online | Updated: March 3, 2017 11:53 AM \nTalha Saeed used Jawahar Lal Nehru University (JNU), Ramjas-style ‘azaadi chants’ to incite crowd at a rally in Pakistan. (Youtube) \nMastermind of the Mumbai terror attack, Lashkar-e-Taiba Chief Hafiz Saeed’s son Talha Saeed was seen abusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi . According to a report by India Today TV, Talha Saeed used Jawahar Lal Nehru University (JNU), Ramjas-style ‘azaadi chants’ to incite crowd at a rally in Pakistan. Hafiz Saeed’ son further looks to take advantage of the situation in the national capital and the conflict in Kashmir by using slain militant, Burhan Wani’s name to incite the crowd. It must be noted that Pakistan has been violating the ceasefire across the border, as armed militants keep crossing into the Indian territory, which has resulted in the death of civilians and Indian jawans alike. \nIn a video footage, Talha is also seen using the name of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim to wage a war. Dawood Ibrahim was responsible for the 1993 serial bomb blasts in Mumbai. Saeed’s son, Talha was also reported to be openly abusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the video. Hafiz Saeed is currently placed under house arrest in Pakistan. In a video message released after the arrest, Saeed was seen blaming the friendship between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the action. \nAlso watch: \nMeanwhile, campus politics in India has taken an ugly turn after chants of ‘Azaadi’ for Kashmir were raised in the Delhi University campus. A series of protests and counter-protests have taken place in the university after ABVP members had stopped JNU’s Umar Khalid from entering the Ramjas college premises to attend a conference on “Culture of Protests”. Things had taken an uglier turn when both the sides were seen engaged in violent altercations, even in the presence of the police force. Earlier yesterday, ABVP had organised a “Save Delhi University” march, shouting slogans of nationalism and demanded the exile of leftist forces from the university.
