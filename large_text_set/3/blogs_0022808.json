Best friends Ava Vistocci, 35 (at left), and Melissa Rotundo, 37, recalled the years of terror Rotundo suffered at the hands of Gene Barrett. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Gwynne Hogan \n\"How many times did we call the police? I don't know how many times,\" said Stepinski's girlfriend, Melissa Rotundo, 37. \"This man terrorized us. Nobody helped us.\" \nNot only did Barrett harass Rotundo, who lived downstairs from him at 185 Greenpoint Ave., but he threatened her ex-husband with a hammer and cursed at her nearly every day, she said. \nOthers on the block knew him as a \"neighborhood terror,\" who made sure everyone understood he carried a gun. \nIt all started 14 years ago when Rotundo moved into an apartment at 185 Greenpoint Ave. with her ex-husband and started having issues with Barrett soon after, she recalled. \nHe would blast music at 2 or 3 a.m., and when her ex-husband would go upstairs and knock on the door to ask him to turn it down, Barrett would emerge wielding a hammer, she said. \nIn other incidents, Barrett would film her two young children playing in the backyard or bang on their pipes at night, Rotundo said. \nHe would often scream curses at her, calling her a \"f---ing s--t,\" a \"c--t\" and a \"f---ing pig,\" she added. \nEventually, Rotundo got tired of reporting the abuse when nothing came of it. \n\"The police didn't help. I stopped [calling] a long time ago,\" she said. \nPolice didn't not respond to requests for comment on claims they failed to act on complaints about Barrett. \nThe Brooklyn District Attorney's office said they had no prior cases on Barrett. \nBut Rotundo was still fearful something would happen to her and her children. \nHer landlord, Eugene Torhan, 64, who bought the building in 1992, installed cameras in the lobby and at the front of the building at her behest, he said. \nTorhan and Rotundo consulted a housing lawyer and tried to evict Barrett, who is a rent-stabilized tenant, for being a nuisance. In 2011, Torhan sued Barrett in a holdover proceeding, housing court records show. \n\"He's screaming at people. He's screaming all the time,\" the landlord said. \"He sometimes screams at me, too.\" \nThe eviction case hit a brick wall when Torhan's attorney told him more than one tenant would have to testify against Barrett in order to make a case. Rotundo was the only one willing to do so, the two said. \nTorhan suspected that his other tenants were afraid of speaking out against Barrett because he was onece a police officer. \n\"He's a cop,\" Torhan said. \"People are scared.\" A 'Neighborhood Terror' on a Medical Pension \nBarrett started working for the NYPD in 1993, according to court records. \nWhile on duty in 1998, he was hit in the head with a bottle during a violent union protest and left work for four months with a mild traumatic brain injury, a wound to his head, some hearing loss and insomnia, his lawyers argued in a lawsuit against the city. \nWhen he returned to work and in 2001, he slipped, fell and hurt himself inside the 18th Precinct stationhouse, suing the city again for disability and a medical pension that he continued to collect until his arrest on March 6, according to police and court records. \nWhile took disability payments from the city for more than a decade, Barrett kept other neighbors on edge, including Chul Kim, the owner of Kimchee Market down the block from his home. \n“He was a neighborhood terror,” said Kim, who said Barrett wasn't shy about the fact that he carried a gun. “I did see his gun multiple times. I think he made a point of letting everybody know he was carrying.” \nRetired police officers are allowed to carry their service weapons after leaving the force, and authorities said Barrett had two guns on him at the time of his arrest. \nKim said he got into a physical fight with Barrett in 2014 but declined to comment on the specifics of the scuffle. Barrett had been the aggressor, but when police showed up, Kim was the one arrested, he noted. His arrest is now sealed. \n“I’m not a violent person,” he said. “I basically defended myself.” \nBarrett had also called the police on Kim one evening when the store owner was having a barbeque in his backyard, he said. \n“[He was] sticking his head out the rear window of his apartment screaming at us to shut up and calling the fire department on us. The fire department practically broke our doors down to get into our backyard,\" he recalled. \nThe responders saw they were having a low-key barbeque and soon left, Kim added. \nWhile Barrett quarreled with other neighbors, Rotundo seemed to have suffered the brunt of his rage. The harassment appeared to subside when Rotundo's ex-husband moved out, but it mounted again when she got together with Stepinski, who moved into their building about two years ago, she said. \n\"He would call me a f---ing pig, he would stand by his window and scream,\" she said. \"The last time I was next to him, he said 'You f---ing pig.' He said it to me [so close to my head], that my hair moved.\" \nWith the abuse escalating after 14 years, Rotundo started recording him on her phone to document their run-ins. \n\"I'm videotaping every f---ing time I step out of my apartment. That's the terror we had with this man,\" she said. \"Every time we walked out the door we put video on cause we were scared of him. Every time I vacuumed, every time [I took out] the garbage. \n\"And I didn't realize how horrible [it was] until Joe's gone.\" 'I'd Rather be a Coward Than a Hero' \nStepinski tried to be friendly with Barrett and always remained cordial, even when he wanted to retaliate, so as not to set Barrett off, Rotundo said. \n\"I'd rather be a coward than a hero in this situation,\" she remembered him saying. \nThe situation was so tense that the couple had been planning to move upstate to Newburgh. \nDespite Stepinski​'s nonconfrontational attitude, the campaign of abuse came to a deadly conclusion on March 6 when, according to prosecutors, Barrett shot Stepinski in the head outside their home. \nBarrett then had a two-hour standoff with police from inside Rotundo's apartment and trained his gun at an responding officer, officials said. \nRotundo said Barrett called her from Stepinski's phone from their apartment after he'd killed him. \nShe picked up and the caller said, \"'Come home right now,' three times.\" \n\"I was confused. I thought, 'Oh Joe,' but he didn't say, 'babe,'\" Rotundo said, noting that Stepinski always called her \"babe.\" \nRotundo believes Barrett wanted to kill her, too. \n\"He would have killed the kids,\" said Rotundo of her 10- and 6-year-old. \"It would have been us.\" \nRotundo, choking back tears, recalled what a loving partner Stepinski was and denied what police called a longstanding feud between her, Stepinski and Barrett . \n\"He did everything for me and the children, 24 hours a day — anything, he was there,\" she said. \"He picked the kids up from school, picked them up from judo. He went shopping. He did laundry. \n\"Everything but the dishes, literally,\" she added with a smile. \"He loved us so much and all he wanted to do was make us happy. He was only good. That's all he was.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:29:04.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
