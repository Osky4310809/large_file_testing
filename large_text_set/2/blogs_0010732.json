Hoots , which offers counter service and a full bar, is now open in Cicero. The spin-off serves fewer items than the original Hooters, but the menu still centers on the chain’s familiar breaded chicken wings. Posted by Hoots on Monday, February 13, 2017 The food comes in containers that fast-food aficionados would be familiar with, as Hoots is positioning itself to handle massive to-go orders to fill man caves and basements with Buffalo shrimp and buckets of wings for sports-watching and other domestic activities. Domestic draft beer, as well as sangria and margaritas, are also available. Does Hoots represent progress or fast-casual corporate expansion? Find out today in Cicero. Check out the menu below.
