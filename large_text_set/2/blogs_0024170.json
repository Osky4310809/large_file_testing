During Hollywood's most prestigious and glamorous night , Jimmy decided to bring in a tour bus full of people into the Dolby Theatre. After asking producers to turn off the lights, the group of unknowing (and extremely lucky) people walked into the theater thinking they were going to see an exhibit of famous Oscars dresses. After the lights came back on, their faces fell as they realized they were surrounded by the world's biggest celebrities. One man, Gary from Chicago, couldn't stop taking pictures on his iPhone, and Denzel Washington even performed an impromptu wedding ceremony for him and his fiancée. Gary also kissed Nicole Kidman's hand and shared a sweet moment with Ryan Gosling. We'll say it again . . . luckiest people ever. Denzel Washington just \"officiated\" a wedding at the #Oscars : \"He's Denzel, so it's legal.\" https://t.co/FDxhW5NYXD pic.twitter.com/pdTeot9Eth", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:54:27.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
