The first one came courtesy of the most direct diss heard on “No Frauds.” \n— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) March 10, 2017 \nThe lyric clip above takes aim at an array of topics but the most sensational bar came courtesy of the line where Nicki targeted Remy’s actions that caused her to do six years in prison, when she spit, “What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?/ What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?” \nRemy Ma also didn’t pull any punches when she dropped “SHETHER,” which was fueled by incendiary lines like, “And I saw Meek [Mill] at All-Star; he told me your ass dropped/He couldn’t fuck you for three months, because your ass dropped… The implants that she had put in her ass popped!” and a shot toward her brother’s child rape case , “Guess who supports a child molester? Nicki Minaj/You paid for your brother’s wedding? That’s hella foul/How you spend money to support a pedophile?” \nThen there was the Lil Wayne-featured “Changed It,” which may not have appeared to be a diss to the naked ear but Nicki captioned the lyric tweet, #ChangedIt – too many double meanings for me to let u guys decipher on your own. Lol ♥️ You” #ChangedIt – too many double meanings for me to let u guys decipher on your own. Lol ♥️ You pic.twitter.com/1fsmUiuU3d \n— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) March 10, 2017 \nThe record appeared to a promise on Nicki’s end to keep the beef going as she rapped, “I buy, lil nigga ain’t no leaser here/ The bitch gambled her career, now it’s gonna be severe.” \nIn an interview that ran earlier this week , Remy Ma announced that she had concluded the beef and spoke on how she wasn’t proud of “SHETHER,” which is having a hard time staying actively linked across the internet thanks to its use of a copywritten instrumental . \n“I do not condone or recommend the tearing down of another female,” Remy Ma admitted. “That’s not what I do. Anybody that knows me knows that I embrace females. I always want to do some girl-oriented thing. I think we work so much better when we work together and when we help each other.” \nBy now, it seems like a resolution for this beef isn’t likely in the near future. \nWant more?
