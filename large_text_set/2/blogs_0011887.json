Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nKate and Gerry McCann have lodged a formal complaint against a Portuguese court which ruled they were \"not formally in the clear\" over their daughter's disappearance. \nThe couple were ruled out as formal suspects, or “arguidos”, back in 2008 – but in court papers released earlier this month, judges in Portugal said that this does not equate to a ruling of innocence. \nThe same judges also ruled against the couple in a legal battle with the police officer who led the hunt for their daughter. \nThe couple sued ex-police chief Goncalo Amaral after he wrote a book claiming they were responsible for Madeleine’s “death” in May 2007. \nBut he fought the case and Portugal’s Supreme Court sided with him. \nHowever, it has emerged today that the couple have lodged a complaint with the Supreme Court. \nWhen asked if she had lodged a formal complaint against the Supreme Court ruling, the The McCann's Portuguese lawyer Isabel Duarte confirmed today: “We delivered it.” Madeleine McCann has been missing since 2008 (Photo: PA) \nIn the 76-page ruling on the case – made public – the judges said the archiving in 2008 of the criminal case into Madeline’s disappearance does not prove the McCanns are innocent. \nThey wrote: “It should not be said that the appellants were cleared via the ruling announcing the archiving of the criminal case.” \nWhile the judges said it would be wrong to draw any inferences about the couple’s guilt or innocence from the decision, they noted that the case was not shelved because prosecutors believed that Kate and Gerry, from Rothley, Leics, were innocent – but due to a lack of evidence. The court sided with Goncalo Amaral (Photo: Mirrorpix) \nThey wrote: “That ruling was not made in virtue of Portugal’s Public Prosecution Service having acquired the conviction that the appellants hadn’t committed a crime. \n\"The archiving of the case was determined by the fact that public prosecutors hadn’t managed to obtain sufficient evidence of the practice of crimes by the appellants. \nThe court concluded that the archiving of the case should not be seen as proof the McCanns are not guilty, stating: “It doesn’t therefore seem acceptable that the ruling, based on the insufficiency of evidence, should be equated to proof of innocence.” How the Daily Mirror reported the court case \nThe damming document means suspicion still hangs over the heads of the McCanns, who have always claimed their innocence. \nIt was released after the court decided Amaral’s “right to freedom of expression” was worthy of greater protection than the couple’s “right to honour”. \nAmaral, 57, was ordered to pay the couple £360,000 in damages in 2015 for claims he made in The Truth Of The Lie.
