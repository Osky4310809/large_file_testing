It’s 100% racial because the initial thought in people’s minds is, ‘These hoodlums are causing problems.’” Jason Derulo (Photo: FameFlynet.uk.com) \nHe also posted a picture of an American Airlines staff member on Instagram, and wrote: \"I spent millions on your airline throughout the past ten years between myself and my entire staff but have still experienced racial discrimination today at miami airport!!! \n\"Called 15 police officers on me as if I'm a criminal! It's not ok that when you find out who I am the gears change!\" \nAn American Airlines source told TMZ that elite customers are allowed to check three bags, but Jason's friend tried to check 19 bags. \nMirror Celebs has contacted a spokesperson for Jason for comment.
