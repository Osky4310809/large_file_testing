The latter series (which imagines what the world would be if the Axis Powers had won WWII) has picked up enough momentum and acclaim that Amazon has now ordered it for season 3 renewal - with new creative vision. \nDeadline reports that Man in the High Castle will get a new showrunner for season 3: Eric Overmyer, who is the executive producer and developer of Amazon's Bosch . Overymyer replaces former showrunner Frank Spotnitz, whose clashes with Amazon caused him to drop out of the show in the middle of season 2. \nMan in the High Castle (based on the Philip K. Dick novel) has been a consistent high performer for Amazon in its first two seasons. Season 1 set new streaming records for the service; season 2 premiered with more viewers than any Amazon Original Series. \n\"The Man in the High Castle stars Alexa Davalos, Rupert Evans, Luke Kleintank, DJ Qualls, Joel De La Fuente, Brennan Brown, Bella Heathcote, and Callum Keith Rennie, with Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Rufus Sewell. Ridley Scott, David W. Zucker, Richard Heus, Isa Dick Hackett and Daniel Percival serve as executive producers for Season 3 alongside Overmyer. \" \nNo word yet on a premiere date for The Man in the High Castle season 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T16:48:01.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
