That statement has elicited a response from many of Under Armour’s athletes. NBA star Steph Curry made his disagreement with Plank’s support of Trump clear with his response, while Kent Bazemore was more supportive of Plank’s sentiment about Trump. Johnson, who endorses Under Armour as well, joined Curry on Thursday afternoon in offering a dissenting opinion to Plank’s statement.
