First, an Arctic high pressure system is moving into position across southeastern Canada and northern New England, so the cold air will be in place for snow.\nSecond, two atmospheric disturbances, one riding the northern jet stream out of Canada, and the other surfing the southern jet from the Gulf of Mexico, appear destined to meet up and combine forces to form a single, strong storm.\nProbability of greater than 12 inches of snowfall through Wednesday, from 51 different runs of the European model.\nImage: weatherbell analytics\nHowever, computer models have not yet locked onto the exact details of this atmospheric mating ritual, known to meteorologists as \"phasing.\" Subtle shifts in timing and the location of one of these systems can make a big difference in where the surface low pressure area forms and where it moves.\nFor example, a more offshore track, as hinted by computer models on Saturday afternoon, could spare areas northwest of New York City and Boston from the heaviest snow.\nBlizzard watch for NYC With the potential for a crippling snowstorm in the nation's biggest cities, the National Weather Service is not taking any chances. Winter storm watches have been issued for Monday night through Tuesday night from New Jersey north into New England, and a blizzard watch is in effect for New York City, Long Island and coastal Connecticut. However, snowfall may continue into Wednesday in many areas.\nModel projection showing a deep trough associated with a storm across the northeast on March 15, 2017.\nImage: weatherbell analytics\nBlizzard conditions have a specific meteorological definition, requiring three straight hours or more with snowfall that reduces visibility to one-quarter mile or less, along with sustained winds of at least 35 miles per hour.\nThe blizzard watch indicates that forecasters believe these conditions may be met in coastal areas of southeastern New York and Connecticut as the storm strengthens and passes nearby on Tuesday in particular.\nIf the center of the storm hugs the coast, then a mix with or change to rain could occur along the coast, lowering snowfall amounts and making blizzard conditions less likely. This scenario is looking less likely, though, compared to a more offshore track that would keep most coastal areas all snow.\nThe period of greatest concern is from Monday evening through Tuesday evening in New York, though the storm could last straight through Wednesday in New England.\nSlight eastward shift w/ECMWF 12z ensembles w/Nor'easter 10-14\" average.

In fact, 2 feet of snow is not out of the question in some few spots, particularly across Long Island, parts of New Jersey, and in Massachusetts, depending on the exact storm track.\nThe National Weather Service is forecasting snowfall totals of a foot to a foot and a half in New York, though the forecast totals are likely to shift somewhat before the storm begins.\nEditor's note: This post will be updated as new data comes in.", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DNyKsuAQrBP5gh89ldOBL-EiOTY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F411180%2F2843dd94-a3d5-40fe-96c9-081ea8650f29.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ROU7ooC2gbIolv1E1tYsLfe4djE=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F411167%2Faedda3d3-3f5a-481f-994c-e208e2893da2.png", "https://t.co/pntZsOlbZQ", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7QZCmJL4sYmfxlvJ2vmJ5v-w6yg=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F411169%2F98b2e243-fb87-43a7-b8a1-da0a6d421c3a.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HQo1nsoiiWZ3qNpSDBWU7eLccQI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F411169%2F98b2e243-fb87-43a7-b8a1-da0a6d421c3a.png", "https://twitter.com/RyanMaue/status/840648800003903489", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/G94_l5S0I5Bnt6F1kkN33Kbd86M=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F411167%2Faedda3d3-3f5a-481f-994c-e208e2893da2.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gptr511hRQZkVOzIFs_jqEn3iW8=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F411180%2F2843dd94-a3d5-40fe-96c9-081ea8650f29.png"], "published": "2017-03-12T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:54:29.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
