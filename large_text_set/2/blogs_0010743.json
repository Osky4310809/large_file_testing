Lang from Packers Rams should target free agent offensive lineman T.J. Lang from Packers By Bryan Kalbrosky 4 hours ago 58 shares By: Bryan Kalbrosky | 4 hours ago \nExpect the Los Angeles Rams to make a move on top offensive linemen available to protect Todd Gurley and Jared Goff when free agency begins. \nLast season, free agent offensive lineman T.J. Lang did not allow a sack or a quarterback hit. According to Pro Football Focus, Lang was the No. 2 overall offensive guard in pass protection. FA Guard @TJLang70 : Mixed emotions about reaching Free Agency. Excited to see what other teams think of me. #Packers \n— SiriusXM NFL Radio (@SiriusXMNFL) February 13, 2017 FA Guard @TJLang70 : I've really enjoyed my time in GB & I've played my whole career there. I haven't heard a word from them yet. #Packers \n— SiriusXM NFL Radio (@SiriusXMNFL) February 13, 2017 \nHis grade was 92.9 on passing plays last season. Compare that with the top Rams pass protection: Rodger Saffold (80.7) and Rob Havenstein (78.1) in 2016. \nFormer NFL quarterback Chris Simms predicted that Lang will re-sign with Green Bay ( via Bleacher Report ): \nLang is 29 years old, so this could be his last chance to cash in. Expect him to receive a deal that looks more like that of Jets guard Brian Winters ($29 million, $15 million guaranteed) than Eagles guard Brandon Brooks ($40 million, $17 million initially guaranteed). Call it a Lambeau discount.” \nSimms projected a 4-year, $32 million deal with the Packers. On a similar note, Spotrac reports that the eight-year veteran has a market value of $8.4 million per season. \nThe Rams have less than $40 million in cap space for next season, but if they don’t sign Kenny Britt and Trumaine Johnson, they will have money to spend in free agency.
