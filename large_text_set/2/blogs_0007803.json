JOHN UNSON, file COTABATO CITY, Philippines — Government agencies this week agreed to work together to clear rivers crisscrossing Maguindanao province of water hyacinths that threaten to cause flooding. The Army’s 6th Infantry Division, the police and the office of the district engineers in Maguindanao’s two congressional districts also promised to provide manpower and equipment to address the problem during a meeting in Cotabato City last week. The meeting was presided over by lawyer Laisa Masuhud-Alamia, who is regional executive secretary of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. It was prompted by apprehensions on possible flooding in riverside farming enclaves during rainy days now that the flow of rivers has been constricted by the aquatic plants. Hundreds of riverside villages in Maguindanao and in North Cotabato were inundated twice in the past eight years when the Rio Grande de Mindanao and tributaries of large rivers that spring from the 220,000-hectare Liguasan Delta overflowed due to same problem. Maguindanao Gov. Esmael Mangudadatu announced last week his office has a plan to procure machinery that can grind water hyacinths for composting into organic fertilizers. He said the measure could be a sustainable and effective solution to the nagging problem. “It is sustainable because it can provide employment to residents in riverside villages who can collect water hyacinths for a fee,” Mangudadatu said. ARMM’s Humanitarian Emergency Assistance and Response Team has been monitoring closely since last month the water level in rivers now virtually carpeted with tightly-knit water hyacinths. Brig. Gen. Arnel Dela Vega, commander of 6th ID, said personnel of different units under his tactical control are ready to help the ARMM government clear the rivers of water hyacinths to prevent flooding. The Department of Public Works and Highways-ARMM, also committed to help remove the water hyacinths now obstructing the downstream flow of rivers in Maguindanao to the western coast of the province.
