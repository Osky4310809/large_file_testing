How many of us assumed that he used a hand double to film those incredible piano-playing scenes in La La Land ? (We did.) Or maybe we thought he was playing some easier version of the film’s songs, that they then masked in editing. Turns out that the charming, Oscar-nominated actor is even MORE talented than we thought because apparently, Ryan Gosling can also play the piano like a god . The man performed all of those intoxicatingly beautiful piano parts himself! Amazing.\nEven better? We have a video to prove it. From Variety :\n\nCan you believe that?\nThis is unedited on-set footage without any sound dubbing.\nIn an interview with Variety , La La Land director Damien Chazelle said that Ryan spent three months learning to play the piano before filming. Impressive. Ryan told GQ that the opportunity to work with incredible jazz pianists and hone his skills was one of the most enticing parts about the film!\nAnd, also, lest we forget, Ryan can sing, too. He sung vocals on the film’s popular song “City of Stars,” which the Hollywood Reporter predicts will win the 2017 Academy Award for Best Original Song. Ryan recently won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and is also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor .\nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling are a match made in #LALALAND. See their Academy Award-nominated performances in theaters now. \nA post shared by La La Land (@lalaland) on Feb 17, 2017 at 2:02pm PST \nLa La Land has been a hit from the start , but Ryan revealed in a recent interview that he was a bit nervous that the film could have been a disaster and that audiences wouldn’t get it.\n“You know, people are breaking into song and dancing and flying in the stars,” Ryan tells GQ , “and [the audience is] also having to accept them as real people in the world. That was the challenge…There’s nothing cynical about this movie, and there’s no out for us to say, ‘Just kidding!’ We can’t be ironic about it. There’s no avenue for that in this. It wears its heart on its sleeve, this film.”\nWe love your passion, Ryan! We can’t wait to see what you do next!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:43:49.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
