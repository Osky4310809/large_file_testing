Jones dedicated herself to studying Trump’s speeches and mannerisms, even as co-stars Vanessa Bayer and Sasheer Zamata tried to warn her that her audition for the part of Trump would not end well. \nThe moment Jones walked in to audition, SNL Executive Producer Lorne Michaels straight up told her “It’s not gonna happen, Leslie.” Jones proceeds to demolish his office while yelling about how she “got range,” and security escorts her out quickly enough for Jones to see Bayer walk in for her own Trump audition. \nJones’ impression seems to be good enough for “ Melania Trump ” however, seeing as the First Lady invited Jones inside her limo as she just so happened to be passing by 30 Rock. \nWatch above, via NBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:38:44.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
