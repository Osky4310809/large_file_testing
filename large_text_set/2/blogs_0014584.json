Samsung’s upcoming device has been rumored for some time now to include support for Samsung’s S Pen and, by the looks of the manual, it appears these rumors are, in fact, true, with the device appearing to be bundled with the stylus. Interestingly, though, the manual doesn’t show any slots for the S Pen, so it appears the accessory will be an external accessory only without a dedicated slot like on Samsung’s Galaxy Note line. Not all revolves around the S Pen, though, with the tablet including a number of hardware and software features. \nLooking at the hardware side of things, the device looks to include four speakers – two top and two bottom ones – along with a Fingerprint scanner integrated into the home button, a USB Type-C port and a keyboard dock connector on the side of the device. Regarding the camera department, the manual simply shows that the tablet will feature both a front and rear-facing camera, with the latter being coupled with a single LED flash. Moving on to the device’s software, the tablet is said to come running Android 7.0 Nougat straight out of the box and, as the manual shows, it is expected to support both multi-window and pop-up view, which allows more than two apps to be running simultaneously. As an added bonus, the manual also states that Samsung has equipped the device with support for Qualcomm’s Fast Charge 2.0. \nSamsung’s upcoming Galaxy Tab S3 has been rumored for some time now to include a large 9.7-inch AMOLED display along with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage on the inside. These specifications, along with features such as a keyboard dock connector, the S Pen, and even the latest software appear to indicate that Samsung is preparing to market this device as a direct competitor to both Apple’s smaller iPad Pro and even Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4. With Samsung’s MWC press conference just over a week away, it shouldn’t be too long before the South Korean company officially unveils the tablet. If the rumored spec sheet is anything to go by, though, it appears Samsung is certainly going to be giving its rivals a run for their money.
