But 53-year-old George was never pictured outside the house.

A woman was also seen turning up with a delivery of flowers. \nA postman delivered gift bags and the Ocado food shop suggested George was preparing for a festive feast. \nHis godson Roman Kemp – son of Spandau Ballet star Martin and his wife Shirlie, who was George’s backing vocalist in Wham! – told how the singer planned a Boxing Day meal before his death. \nSpeaking before the tragedy, Roman said: “We’re going to George’s house on Boxing Day. To me, you do the Christmas rounds and you see all those people who are big influences on my life.” \nFadi was spotted at George’s house on Christmas Eve. He was seen taking a trip to the local cafe and grabbing a coffee and some food before going back into the house. A source said: “It was very busy at the house in the days before George died. \n“A number of people were coming and going, delivering various items. \n“It looked like they were preparing for a gathering – which makes George’s death even more tragic. He definitely wasn’t alone. He looked to be surrounded by many people who cared about him.” \nGeorge had a London home but loved spending time at the Goring retreat, which he had renovated from top to bottom. He redecorated the 16th century house, complete with low wooden beams, and bought scores of antique books for its library.

Police know ­everything. That’s the most important thing. The police have been amazing. They have been supportive. They have done what normally happens when someone dies. \n“They have not been accusing me, never. They have been very supportive.” \nAnd the celebrity hairdresser – said to be angered by claims he split with George 18 months ago – has maintained they were “very much in love”.
