Yes To Carrots Super Rich Body Butter, $10, Walmart\nWalgreens \"I use a lot of different body lotions and butters, but this body butter is ideal for those moments when you really need to be cocooned in moisture. Once you put it on, your skin is plump, dewy and feels pampered ‚Äî and if you're going to take the time out of your day to apply body butter, isn't that how you want to feel? I would be remiss if I didn't discuss the scent: Pay no mind to the name; you won't smell like carrots. This leaves your skin with a light, clean-yet-sweet scent. Like all Yes To products, this is approved by Leaping Bunny, which is fast becoming the leading authority on cruelty-free products. I love progressive body butter!\" said Jessica Matlin, beauty and health director of Teen Vogue.\nMy definition of luxury: loads of bedding; elastic-waist pants; Janetta, my Siberian Forest Cat by my side; and triple-thick moisturizers!

Dove Dry Oil Moisture Body Wash, $7, Target\nTarget ‚ÄúFor those times when I don‚Äôt have a spare minute to slather on body cream and wait for it to dry ‚Äî or the desire to shiver sans clothes! ‚Äî I turn to this body wash. Yes, body wash. The insanely rich, pudding-esque formula contains a trio of natural oils (argan, soybean, and sunflower) that actually leave skin noticeably softer after you rinse and dry off. And it‚Äôs not just my imagination: the Good Housekeeping Beauty Lab‚Äôs moisturization test found that this body wash alone hydrated skin for four hours, no lotion needed. Oh, and it smells like it should cost five times as much ‚Äî musky and warm, like a fancy perfume ‚Äî but the bottle is so huge I can slather it on without guilt,‚Äù said April Franzino, beauty director of Good Housekeeping.\nHere is a photo of me awkwardly posing with @dove body wash üòú Why, coming soon! üíã#ghbeauty\nA photo posted by April Franzino (@aprilfranzino) on Jan 5, 2017 at 11:01am PST\n3.

It goes on lightly, dries pretty quickly and doesn‚Äôt get all over the floor (like some other sprays do). No mess, no stress. Bonus: The subtle scent doesn‚Äôt compete with my fragrance,\" said Dori Katz, beauty and fashion director of Family Circle.\nMy first ever #wcw goes to: @christiebrinkley.

Burt's Bees Nourishing Baby Oil, $9, Walmart\nWalmart \"I find body oils to be much easier to apply than lotions or creams. They dry just as quickly ‚Äî if not quicker ‚Äî and instantly warm in your hands. This body oil has a lush apricot scent and a rich texture. And it happens to be for ... babies. I discovered it when I had my first child, when I was looking for something without phthalates or SLS. Of course, you can use it on anyone (most of all yourself), and you can pour it in the bath or put it directly on the body. There is a version for adults, but I prefer the scent of this one. I always keep it in the shower so I never forget to apply,\" said Jamie Rosen, beauty director of Town & Country.\nRELATED: 17 drugstore face masks celebrity experts love\n5. DJ Khaled x Palmer's ‚ÄúWE THE BEST GLOW‚Äù Cocoa Butter Formula, $6.50, Palmers.com\nPalmers.com \"Full disclosure: I'm not a body lotion fan. The formulas I tried left my skin feeling sticky. Then, I stumbled upon this moisturizer. First, I fell in love with the cocoa butter scent (think chocolate chip cookies but not too sweet), then I fell in love with the results. The vitamin E goodness sinks in fast, transforms my scales into silky, almost model-worthy skin and takes away that tight, itchy feeling I get on my lower back come wintertime. This limited-edition bottle is a collab with hip-hop mogul DJ Kaled who claims, \"it's a major key\" to soft skin,\" said Heather Muir, beauty director of Real Simple and Health.\n6. Jergens Oil-Infused Moisturizer with Nourishing Monoi Oil, $5, Target\nTarget \"Like magic, this luxe (without the bucks) body moisturizer turns my scaly winter skin into soft, smooth and sleek (read: slimmer and firmer-looking!). I slather it on my legs, arms and d√©collet√© before a big night out. The formula packs the power of classic Jergens lotion, but with the added addition of monoi oil, a scent that transports me back to a holiday on the island of Oahu ‚Äî sans the business class plane ticket price!\" said Gwen Flamberg, beauty director of US Magazine.\nJust a couple of outer borough girls sharing beauty secrets and a smile! #nofilter (really!) #wcw #jlovegas #jlustbyjlo üíú\nA photo posted by Gwen Flamberg (@gwen_beauty) on Jun 15, 2016 at 9:51am PDT\n7.

For this reason, I only use body hydrators that make a noticeable and speedy difference. And this one truly does just that. It‚Äôs infused with alpha hydroxy acids and softening glycerin, which together slough away the flaky, dead cells and quench the fresh ones underneath with moisture. I slather it on at night and wake up with skin that‚Äôs almost unrecognizable‚Äîit‚Äôs that soft, and that devoid of rough patches and bumps. ‚ÄîMaura Lynch, Beauty & Lifestyle Director at Women‚Äôs Health\n8.

Jergens Original Scent Dry Skin Moisturizer, $4, Target\nTarget \"This moisturizer is my ride-or-die. I have a jumbo size (plus a backup!) in my bathroom, and am never without my purse-size mini. It hydrates like crazy, but there‚Äôs an emotional tie, too. My grandmother ‚Äî whom I‚Äôd never met ‚Äî wore it non-stop and passed it to my mother, who then passed it to me; a beauty heirloom, if you will. Now when I smell that soft, comforting scent, I‚Äôm reminded of memories from my own life: getting ready for my first high-school formal with my friend Anne, sharing it with my sorority sisters jam-packed in a tiny bathroom, moisturizing my hands on my first date with my husband, applying it in the hospital before holding my son for the first time. Budget-friendly as it may be, its scent memories are priceless,\" said Leah Wyar, executive beauty director of Cosmopolitan and Seventeen.\nCelebrating @seventeen's first-ever Body Confidence Day with a pic that shows me carefree and loving life (in my home state of PA!).

Palmer‚Äôs Cocoa Butter Formula Original Solid, $3.50, Walmart\nWalmart \"I‚Äôm completely obsessed with this body butter, specifically the one that comes in the jar. I grew up on this glorious stuff and I can‚Äôt remember not having it in my home. Ashy, dry skin is no match for the thick and creamy formula. It‚Äôs 100 percent amazing!\" said Julee Wilson, fashion and beauty director of Essence.\n11. Curel Hydra Therapy Wet Skin Moisturizer, $11, Walmart\nWalmart \"My skin is extremely needy this time of year. If I skip lotion for more than a day or two, there‚Äôs suddenly a rough, dry, bumpy revolt happening south of my neck. The trouble is that once I‚Äôm out of the shower, mom duty calls and it‚Äôs a mad dash to get dressed and deal with the kids. Too late to moisturize!\n\"Now I slather on this in-shower formula as soon as I turn off the water ‚Äî it takes 30 seconds tops ‚Äî and then wrap myself in a towel. The formula defies logic: it's deceptively lightweight, doesn‚Äôt have a cloying scent and hydrates over the course of the day just as well as the thick creams I‚Äôve used in the past (i.e. before kids). It‚Äôs a low-maintenance solution to my high-maintenance skin and life,\" said Erica Metzger, beauty and fashion director of Better Homes and Gardens.\nAll the cliches are true.

The three minutes it takes to absorb feels like an eternity, especially on a rushed weekday morning when I need that time to curl my hair (priorities!). But a big bottle of this moisturizing lotion is always on our bathroom counter. Why? Because my boyfriend has been using it for years (Sidebar: men are crazy loyal to products). I recently applied a few pumps to my legs out of curiosity and didn‚Äôt even have to wait a minute for it to sink in.

St. Ives Skin Renewing Collagen Elastin Body Lotion, $5, Jet.com\nCVS \"I‚Äôm very picky when it comes to body lotion.

I love this lightweight formula because 1) it isn‚Äôt sticky, 2) it contains both collagen and elastin, ingredients known to give skin a youthful glow, and 3) it has a fresh but totally non-cloying scent.

Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer, $7, Walmart\nWalgreens \"I'll often layer four or five serums and lotions on my face ‚Äî sometimes more than once a day. But I'm really really lazy about moisturizing my body. In the winter (when I need the hydration most), I just want to wrap myself in a fluffy robe as soon as I step out of the shower. I love this magic formula because I can apply it, in about 30 seconds, to my damp skin right after I turn off the water. It contains emulsifiers that let its hydrating oils combine with the water on your body and absorb quickly. So I can immediately snuggle up in that robe and still have silky limbs all winter,\" said Jenny Bailly, beauty director of Allure.\nit's the most wonderful time of the year: getting a sneak peek at next year's @flowerbeauty goodies and my annual #drewfie @drewbarrymore is one of the most passionate beauty moguls out there (and her mascara is putting mine to shame here) #yesterdaygram\nA photo posted by Jenny Bailly (@jbailly) on Dec 8, 2016 at 10:51am PST\nRELATED: Allure magazine spills the hottest hair and makeup trends of 2017\n16.
