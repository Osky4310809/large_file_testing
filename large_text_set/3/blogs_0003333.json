(AP) By Glenn Sattell / Special to MLB.com | + 0 COMMENTS \nJUPITER, Fla. -- Carlos Martinez faced the minimum in three innings of work as the Cardinals starter in their 6-1 win over the Mets on Wednesday at Roger Dean Stadium. \n\"I feel good,\" he said of his only appearance before leaving Sunday for the World Baseball Classic . \"I'm really working on my breaking ball. That's going to make the innings go faster and that's what I'm working on right now; staying ahead on the count, that's what's helping the innings go faster.\" Full Game Coverage \nAfter a 1-2-3 first inning, Martinez struggled a bit with his control in the second inning. He walked Wilmer Flores to start the frame, but worked out of trouble with a strike-'em-out-throw-'em-out double play. Mets' left fielder Brandon Nimmo struck out on a 3-2 pitch and Cards catcher Yadier Molina threw out Flores attempting to steal second base. \nâ€¢ Spring Training : Info | Tickets | Schedule | Gear \nMartinez said he gambled on the pitch and it paid dividends. \n\"I tried to keep it on the outside corner,\" he said. \"I knew that he was going to swing. I took a chance [on the 3-2 pitch] and it ended up being positive.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:07:36.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
