It's one more win for a global movement—disparate but growing—of anti-immigrant populist politicians who've strong-armed their way to power. Author By Michael Idov & Adam Weinstein Jan 26, 2017 One small consolation of last year's space-slug attack of a presidential election was the debate sketches aired by Saturday Night Live. Alec Baldwin's impression of Donald Trump often sounded more like a transcript from the campaign trail than a joke. \"All of the blacks live on one street in Chicago,\" fake Trump says in one episode. \"It's called Hell Street. And they're on Hell Street and they're all just killing each other.\" Hillary, played by Kate McKinnon, responds, \"Can America vote right now?\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below How easily parody slides into reality: As U.S. voters proved in November, fearmongering works—and not just for Donald Trump. Across the globe, autocrats are on the rise. Strongman populism, usually served with a steaming pile of xenophobia, has claimed Greece and Hungary; it's also mangled Turkey. Italy, too, is at risk: The resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi in December gave new hope to the immigrant- and central-government-hating Lega Nord. Right-wing populism is even lapping at the steps of the European Parliament: In 2014, the institution welcomed its first neo- Nazi, courtesy of Germany's NPD. And then, of course, there was Brexit, which looks to be a superlative case study of what happens when gravelly rabble-rousers actually get hold of the steering wheel. These regressions have followed a remarkably similar path from country to country. It begins with widespread fear of the future. Globalization gave rise to an international class of wealthy urban technocrats who look utterly out of touch with the rest of their respective populations. (Before November's election, America's brightest minds seemed to be more concerned with robots gaining consciousness than with income inequality, which has grown for thirty consecutive years.) The populist pushback takes aim at anything that feels elite. Institutional experience becomes a liability. Qualifications take a backseat to passion. Skill itself becomes suspect. \nGlobalization gave rise to an international class of wealthy urban technocrats Next, bad information floods the void. Social media has laid waste to the informational monopoly that, even in the most democratic societies, had always—for better or worse—been held by the ruling classes. Hundred-year-old news orgs and anonymous Twitter eggs are now locked in a codependent death embrace. The patronizing drone of the professional media drives people to the fringe, at which point the mainstream co-opts the fringe in order to get the eyeballs back. Facts are replaced by an irrational but basic fear of the Other—be it gays or immigrants or a global Jewish conspiracy. They thrill to the baroque dangers of swarthy job-stealers and banker cabals.

He tells it like it is—which is to say, how you suspect \"it\" to be. He says the unsayable—calls Mexicans \"rapists,\" for instance—and you feel a surge of gratitude for finally having your most embarrassing fears acknowledged out loud. You don't have to be embarrassed anymore! And then he promises to smash this corrupt system, to make it work for you. And you go along. This time, you will not be ignored. You will get your cozy Anglosphere, your Great Russia, your Beautiful Wall. And by the time you realize what it has cost you, it is too late. —Michael Idov \nNigel Farage Leader of the UK Independence Party, Great Britain Understatement of the year: \"I think that politics needs a bit of spicing up.\" British conservatives had long mused about yanking their country out of the European Union, but only Farage, leader of the once-fringe UK Independence Party, was crazy enough to become the poster boy for Brexit. The effete pol helped \"Leave\" squeeze out a surprise national victory last June by lying and blaming foreigners. Farage's bitches' brew of economic populism and race-baiting worked. He's a celebrity on RT, Putin's TV station, and was a popular act at Trump campaign stops. Brexit has turned staid British politics into a dystopian YA-novel plot. \"When I came here seventeen years ago and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me,\" he gloated last year after the vote. \"Well, I have to say, you're not laughing now, are you?\" —Adam Weinstein Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Leader of the National Front, France Considers Trump's victory part of: \"A great movement across the world.\" Few people expected a future for France's right-wing National Front after its first leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, lost the 2002 presidential race by a historic 64 percent margin. But the elder Le Pen—who infamously shrugged off Nazi gas chambers as a mere \"detail\" of history—passed control of the party to his media-savvy daughter, Marine, and it's experienced a rebirth as a mainstream political force. On her watch, the authoritarian nationalist party has played down its racially checkered past, trading overt anti-Semitism for big-government welfare—as long as its recipients aren't immigrants, dual citizens, or practicing Muslims. And the party weathered bad news last April, when the Panama Papers exposed a \"sophisticated offshore system\" by Le Pen's aides to hide hundreds of thousands of dollars. Le Pen has refocused on local races, a bet that's showing signs of paying off in populist cred. But France's staggering unemployment, terrorist attacks, and endless problems integrating immigrants have given Le Pen major mojo as a grande dame of the anti-Islamic right—and made her a serious contender in May's presidential contest. She makes her hard-right opponent, François Fillon, look like a Bernie Bro. \"With the designation of Trump in the U.S.,\" Le Pen brags, \"there's a global awakening.\" —A.W . \nNarendra Modi Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Prime Minister, India When asked if he regretted a massacre of thousands of Muslims that happened on his watch: \"If a puppy comes under the wheel of your car, will it be painful? Of course it is.\" Talk about an image makeover: Ten years ago, the tunic-bedecked showman was barred from traveling to the U.S. and EU for his suspected role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, in which Hindu vigilantes murdered 1,169 people—mostly Muslims, many women and children. Today, he's the vegetarian prime minister of nuclear-armed India, a CEO type hyping manufacturing jobs who now enjoys an approval rating in the low 80s. But he's never abandoned his roots, trolling his \"weak\" opponents; denouncing camps for displaced Muslims as a \"breeding ground to produce children\"; and calling for Muslim-targeting powers to combat terrorism. An opposition leader called Modi a merchant \"of religion and death.\" Maybe so, but he has the most Twitter followers of any world leader. On the campaign trail, he regularly used a 3-D hologram of himself to simultaneously speechify at hundreds of political rallies across India. Modi's flickering likeness mystified many of his rally attendees, a spokeswoman acknowledged at the time, but that just added to his futuristic cachet: \"The Gandhis are decades behind.\" —A.W . \nVladimir Putin President, Russia Could guest on Westworld : \"I am the wealthiest man not just in Europe but in the whole world. I collect emotions.\" Putin is seventeen years and counting into an unchallenged rule that could stretch all the way to 2024—and, if he pulls off one more Medvedev Maneuver (i.e., gaming the constitution by temporarily replacing himself with a pliable yes-man), way beyond. Putin came into power, as strongmen often do, on the wave of disaster—Chechen separatist attacks on Moscow housing blocks—and a tough-guy vow to punish the guilty. \"We'll find them and we'll waste them,\" he said. Instead, he proceeded to take out his destructive energies on most of Russia's civil liberties. He bought off the actual Chechen separatists, just as he did most of the opposition. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Putin's big secret is that he's not a strategist. He's a brilliant tactician who gets lucky. His idea of \"restoring Russia to greatness\" is to act as a global spoiler as soon as anything important happens anywhere; his ever- toughening domestic policy is designed to paper over a weak economy. Now that Trump is in the White House—in no small part because of Russian hackers' attacks on Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party—Putin is expected to ease off the anti- American rhetoric. Then again, it's possible these two unchecked demagogues will find out the world's not big enough for both of their yuuuuge egos. —M.I . \nNorbert Hofer Member, Freedom Party, Austria Sticking it to the establishment: \"The more they fight me, the stronger I become.\" Hofer—who served as a copresident of Austria for six months after crashing last May's runoff election—has used his youthful polish to bring respectability to the arch-right Freedom Party of Austria, which was founded by an ex-SS officer in the '50s. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Hofer proudly carried a Glock on the campaign trail, a \"natural consequence\" of his country's immigration influx. He's said that \"Islam has no place in Austria\" and vowed that as president, he'd dissolve the government if it didn't take a tougher stance on Austria's nearly hundred thousand refugees. Though he lost December's final presidential election, he received 43 percent of the vote and remains a figurehead of his far-right party, which is leading the polls for the next parliamentary election. The burka-banning Hofer, it seems, is the canary in Europe's extremist coal mine. —A.W . \nRodrigo Duterte President, Philippines Possesses airtight logic: \"My god, I hate drugs. And I have to kill people because I hate drugs.\" The potty-mouthedprovincial mayor won the Philippines' presidency last May after encouraging vigilante death squads to execute as many as a thousand suspected petty criminals and vowing to kill a hundred thousand more in his first six months in office. (He reportedly managed only seventeen hundred.) His declarations are piped up directly from his id. When the UN criticized his regime, he told reporters, \"I don't give a shit to them.\" When told Barack Obama would press him on human rights in an upcoming summit, Duterte called the U.S. president a \"son of a whore.\" Late last year, Duterte promised to curtail his cussing, saying the voice of God had commanded him to quit using swear words. The extrajudicial killings, however, continue apace. —A.W .
