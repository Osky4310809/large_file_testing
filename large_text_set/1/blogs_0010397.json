She was a known associate of Jango Fett and was at one point involved in a relationship with Hondo Ohnaka . Ten years before the start of the Clone Wars , Sing was on the outer rim world of Tatooine during the time of the Boonta Eve Classic Podrace. Sing watched the pod race from a balcony on Beggar's Canyon . [4] The Clone Wars Joining Boba Fett Aurra on board the Slave I with Bossk. \nDuring the Clone Wars , she joined up with Boba Fett to kill Mace Windu for revenge for Boba's father. Boba, under the name of \"Lucky\", boarded the Endurance as a clone cadet . After his first attempt on Windu's life failed, he contacted Sing to ask for advice. Sing told him to blow up the reactors, much to Boba's surprise. After Boba successfully destroyed the Endurance's reactors, sending it crashing towards Vanqor , he got into one of the escape pods along with several of the other cadets. Once they were away from the plummeting vessel, the pod was docked by Slave I . Bossk and Sing entered the pod to confront Boba. After telling him that the other cadets must be launched into space, due to the fact that they are \"living witnesses\", Boba reluctantly came aboard Slave I and jettisoned the pod from Slave I's docking area. Although the group of bounty hunters escaped, the cadets were saved by Anakin Skywalker and Windu, who had escaped the Endurance in their Jedi Starfighters. [6] \nTRAINS \nShe later abducted Admiral Kilian, Commander Ponds, and a naval officer from the crash site of the Endurance on Vanqor. After Skywalker and Windu triggered their bomb in the crash site, Boba convinced Sing to go back there and get the two Jedis' heads to bring to Count Dooku , who might pay them for their trouble. Sing, along with Boba and Castas , went to the crash site. Due to the ship falling apart, and R2-D2 's interference, Sing decided to blow up the crash site. As they left, Bossk contacted Sing, telling that a explosion happened near where the Jedi landed. Sing then ordered Bossk to jam all transmissions from the planet. When Sing and her team returned to Slave I , they saw Windu's Jedi starfighter taking off. Unbeknownst to Sing, only R2-D2 was aboard. Though Slave I took out the Jedi fighter's communications, Artoo reached the hyperspace rings and escaped. Knowing that Windu would not hold a grudge against them, she decided to motivate Windu by using the hostages. [7] Aurra Sing caught by Ahsoka Tano. \nWhen contacting Mace Windu to come and find her, Sing shot Ponds, whom she had abducted, after Boba wouldn't do it. The group of bounty hunters then docked on Florrum for a visit with Sing's old flame Hondo Ohnaka to see if he would give them any advice. During a visit in the bar with Hondo, Sing overheard Castas communicating via hologram to a friend on Coruscant. After hearing him calling her an old hag, she shot him. Plo Koon and Ahsoka Tano later caught up with her. After having a quarrel in a room, Sing fled away, leaving a discouraged Boba behind. Tano chased her, but after getting an order from Plo Koon, she went to free the hostages. Sing got suspicious, so she went to go and stop the Padawan. After Tano pursued her, she fled on Slave I , but because of a wing failure caused by Tano, the ship crashed. [8] Sing was presumed dead by the Jedi. [8] Unknown to them, Hondo salvaged her out of Slave I ' s wreckage. [5] Working for Ziro \nSing was later hired by Ziro the Hutt to assassinate Senator Padmé Amidala in retaliation for imprisoning him. She tracked the Senator to Alderaan , where Amidala was due for a conference on refugee concerns. Infiltrating the conference through the vents and snapping the neck of several Senate Commandos, Sing set up a sniper position. Only the timely intervention of Tano gave Amidala a flesh wound, forcing Sing to flee. [5] \nSing later made a second attempt on Amidala's life when she tracked down the Senator, not being fooled by the BD-3000 luxury droid acting in her place. But once again, Tano interfered. Sing outdrew Tano as she grazed the Padawan, but Amidala used a stun blaster on her. Sing was then arrested and brought to Coruscant . [5] Senate hostages \nLater in the Clone Wars, Sing escaped Republic captivity and teamed up with Cad Bane 's bounty hunter team for the raid on the Republic Senate Building . During the hostage siege Aurra covered Bane's entrance to the building by taking out the Senate Commandos who attempted to stop him with a sniper rifle. After Bane eliminated the remaining Senate Commandos, Aurra shot a dying one. Later she aided Shahan Alama in searching for the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, whose presence in the Senate Building threatened to thwart Bane's plan. Eventually, with the help of Robonino they managed to render Skywalker unconscious. When the Hutt crime lord was freed, Aurra Sing successfully left the crime scene along with the rest of the group. [9] Personality and traits Aurra takes aim. \nAurra Sing was one of the most powerful and ruthless bounty hunters in the galaxy. She had no qualms about committing murder, whether it be wounded clone troopers or former partners such as Castas. Despite her ruthlessness, Sing was also somewhat of a mother to Boba Fett during his teenage years, sometimes addressing him as \"honey\" and stopping him from drinking alcohol in Hondo Ohnaka's bar. She was also very selfish and abandoned Fett to save herself after the boy was captured by Plo Koon. She also tried to get the boy to murder the helpless Commander Ponds and, when he hesitated, she simply shoved him aside and killed Ponds herself. Aurra Sing also had a romantic relationship with Hondo Ohnaka, and though they were no longer lovers, Ohnaka still referred to her as \"my dear.\" Consequently, after Sing and Boba arrived at Ohnaka's base, he asked if Boba was his son. Even with their past, Ohnaka refused to help Sing when she tried to lure Ahsoka Tano and Plo Koon into a trap. Behind the scenes \nThe character of Aurra Sing was first conceived in a sketch labeled \"Babe Fett\" by Lucasfilm's Doug Chiang . Chiang had made the sketch as a result of George Lucas ' request to have more characters fill out the podracing sequence in Star Wars : Episode I The Phantom Menace . In the final film, the character was played by model Michonne Bourriague . Aurra Sing became so popular with fans that she was explored in other media, including comics and video games. She was voiced by Jaime King in the television animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars .
