Former coach Mike McCoy was done in by an incredible string of injuries, aberrant bad luck in close games and a stacked AFC West. \nThe Bolts have gone just 7-18 in games decided by eight or fewer points since the start of the 2015 season. Their 11 games lost with a fourth-quarter lead are more than any other team during that span. \nThere's a fine line between success and failure in the NFL. San Diego may not have been a good team under McCoy, but the team was competitive even against the league's superpowers. After drafting a franchise-altering talent in Joey Bosa , general manager Tom Telesco is now sitting on a roster strong enough to contend for the playoffs as soon as 2017. \nLet's examine that roster, poised to make a new home in the 30,000-seat StubHub Center on the Carson-area campus of Cal State Dominguez Hills: Offense \nPhilip Rivers stumbled down the stretch without No. 1 receiver Keenan Allen , receiving back Danny Woodhead and breakout runner Melvin Gordon . At age 35, though, he remains a legitimate franchise quarterback, directing a top-10 offense in spite of the injuries and Antonio Gates ' steady decline. \nBouncing back from a disappointing rookie campaign, Gordon proved to be a Pro Bowl-caliber tailback with power, breakaway speed and underrated receiving ability. \nGordon will be joined by a healthy Allen, who was dismantling the Chiefs secondary for three quarters of the season opener before going down with an ACL injury. In Allen's absence, Tyrell Williams developed into a playmaking wideout with the speed to win deep and the possession skills to move the chains. Beyond Allen and Williams, the Chargers have quality depth in run-after-catch threats Travis Benjamin and Dontrelle Inman . \nTo offset Gates' twilight phase, Telesco drafted the promising Hunter Henry to excel as Rivers' new red-zone weapon at tight end. \nThe offensive line returns intact, which should allow that bevy of skill-position talent to shine in the cozy confines of the StubHub Center. Defense \nPass rusher Melvin Ingram ranks No. 7 on Gregg Rosenthal's list of the top-25 impending free agents . If necessary, the Chargers can apply the franchise tag to keep Ingram in Los Angeles now that he's developed into one of the league's best all-around outside linebackers. \nAs well as Ingram played in 2016, though, Bosa is the headliner on defense. The draft's No. 3 overall pick is already the dominant force on the field in many games, pulling off a convincing J.J. Watt impression. The most impressive rookie pass rusher of the past decade, finishing second only to the Rams ' Aaron Donald in QB hits per game . \nBosa and Ingram shouldn't overshadow a well-rounded linebacker corps featuring the hard-hitting Denzel Perryman , fifth-round steal Jatavis Brown , tackling machine Korey Toomer and jack-of-all-trades Kyle Emanuel . \nOnce nose tackle Brandon Mebane returns from torn biceps, this defense should be stout against the run. \nThe ingredients are already in place for a strong pass defense. Casey Hayward might have been the premier signing of last offseason , emerging as a shutdown corner once Jason Verrett suffered an early-season ACL injury. Once Verrett returns to join Hayward and veteran Brandon Flowers , this secondary is loaded with potential. 2017 prospects \nAwaiting a competent offense for the past decade, Rams fans are desperately clinging to hope that the next coaching staff can salvage Jared Goff , turn Todd Gurley loose and build a capable front line. \nThe Chargers , in contrast, have constructed a team ready-made to surpass expectations under a new head coach. The offense is loaded with skill-position talent. The defense has the potential to graduate from frisky to fearsome. Provided the injured players return healthy in 2017, there's no obvious weakness on the roster. That's a claim several 2016 contenders won't match when training camp opens next season. \nGet your shots in now . Los Angeles' newest team won't be a laughingstock by the time the 2017 season rolls around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T01:01:40.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
