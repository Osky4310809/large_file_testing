It was important to show character and personality. To show all of our character at 2-0 down against City is difficult but we believe and it is a massive point for us. \n\"At the start it was difficult for us to play in the way we normally play, to be honest it was not a good first half performance, we were not comfortable with or without ball and they were better. \n\"Sometimes in football this happens and it is important to react. We tried to change in the second half and conceded two quick goals but you need to believe and show character to get a result when you don't play well.\" \nGuardiola blasts missed chances \n  rejected two strong penalty appeals by Sterling, but Pochettino felt that Sane controlled the ball with his arm for City's opening goal and refused to criticise the referee's performance. \n\"I think the first goal we conceded was handball by Sane, but it's difficult for the referee,\" Pochettino said. \"We can't see every small detail in football. \n\"England is another world. This is England and it is different. From my side, I'm not going to complain about the referee. It is more important to talk about the football.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:21:24.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
