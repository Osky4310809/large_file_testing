On What She Can't Live Without © Courtesy of Charlotte Rutherford G.E.M. On What She Can't Live Without China's Taylor Swift, G.E.M., On What She Absolutely Can't Live Without 0 Shares \nEvery week we profile a different woman who’s been crushing it , whether on social media, on TV, or on the runway. Our Crush of the Week has a lot going for her: She's successful, accomplished, hugely influential and she's a total babe. Want to nominate someone for Crush of the Week? Write to . \nEverybody knows her as G.E.M. (Get Everybody Moving). She’s Asia’s best-selling female artist (she’s been dubbed the Taylor Swift of China) and has toppled the charts both in her homestead Hong Kong and abroad. \nShe made it onto Forbes' 30 Under 30: Music shortlist last year after touring for two whole years. She made many appearances on Chinese TV, toured all over the world and all of this before her 26th birthday. \nLet's get to know her a little better! \nWhere can our readers find/follow you? \nDid you have a childhood nickname? What was it? Yup, Lulu. My grandma gave me this nickname. \nWho was your biggest childhood crush? Harry Potter. I’ve always imagined myself to be Hermione Granger. \nWhat's the one product you couldn't live without? A bed. I can’t liv , if living is without sl p. Sing it with me. \nWhat qualities would make you swipe right immediately? I don't use Tinder, because the qualities that would make me swipe right can’t be seen on a photo. I’m attracted to people who are passionate, considerate and kind. \nWhat's the best gift you've ever received from a significant other? A surprise of his presence. Having to travel so much on tour, I didn’t [and still don't] have as much time to be with my friends and family. When I surprisingly see him standing in front of me, my heart just melts. Generally, I appreciate the thoughts put into presenting the gift than the gift itself. I like surprises! \nWhat's the worst thing a guy could do on a date? Constantly checking on his cellphone. I need quality time. \nWhat is your dream date? Being comfortable just to be with each other without an urge to figure out what to do next. Well, there are actually two other significant elements: a beautiful rose, and a beautiful view. \nWhat's the one product you couldn't live without? A bed. I cant liv , if living is without sl p. [Sing it with me.] I’m known for being very creative and being able to turn virtually anything into a bed when on the road like on a plane, back of a car, tour bus and my neck pillow comes in handy. \nWhat's your biggest guilty pleasure? Nuts or peanut butter. Cashew and peanuts are my king and queen. \nThree girl crushes you wanna shout out and why? Beyonce, Rihanna, Emma Watson. They are all beautiful and inspiring and passionate about what they do. \nAnything else you would like to plug? My upcoming world tour - Queen of Hearts . The tour will be starting in April but I’m already so excited about it! From the concept to the music to the visuals of the tour, etc. I think my team and I have come up with a great show. Can’t wait to flip over the Queen of Hearts to all of you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:40:01.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
