Chris Collins: GOP silent on Michael Flynn's resignation because 'It's Valentine's Day' When CNN's Chris Cuomo questioned why Republican lawmakers have fallen silent in the aftermath of retired General Michael Flynn's resignation as national security adviser on Monday night, Rep. Chris Collins of New York offered a Hallmark-themed response.\n\"No word from Ryan, no word from McConnell,\" Cuomo said. \"When you have a man of Flynn's stature resign -- and in his own letter said he misled, maybe even lied to other members of the White House, why is everyone so quiet?\"\n\"Well, it's Valentine's Day,\" Collins said, \"and I guess they're having breakfast with their wives.\"\n\nWhile neither Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell nor House Speaker Paul Ryan have shared any Valentine's Day-themed posts on social media, it is possible Feb. 14 celebratory happenings are keeping the ranking GOP officials from speaking out on the Trump administration shakeup.\nCollins, who served on the Trump transition team executive committee, continued in saying he's sorry to see General Flynn go, but that it's time to move on.\n\"I do know [Flynn's] very loyal to President Trump. I do know he's a great American,\" said Collins.\n\"General Flynn did what he thought was in the best interest of the country. I certainly respect that and I think it's just time to move on.\"\nRELATED: Reaction to Michael Flynn's resignation ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:28:01.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
