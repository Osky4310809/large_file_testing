Perfect. So have I (27 times) Let’s discuss… because I have a lot of questions. \nFirst of all, what’s going on with this grill? Giphy \nI haven’t seen a grill moment this awkward since Michael Scott burned his foot on a George Forman grill. \nAlso, Danielle is looking at the camera the same way we all look at our crushes when they walk in the room. \nIt’s that face when you want to flirt, but your facial muscles decide to be cringeworthy instead. \nNext, let’s discuss this “make it rain” moment. Giphy \nWho makes it rain by flicking their money as if it were a bug? \nHer face looks so scared, too. It’s basically how I look when I get my paycheck and blow half of it at the racetrack (come on, Stinky Pete! You’ve gotta win sometime!). \nAlthough, I’ve got to hand it to this music video. Allow me to explain with a short checklist. \nCash? Check. \nOutside? Check. \nHow bow dah? \nThat’s three for three… exactly the same as the judges who ruled in favor of not reinstating Trump’s travel ban. \nCoincidence? There are no coincidences. \nHonestly, I wish Danielle all the best. Perhaps, she can learn from her fame and maybe (just maybe) get some anger management. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
