That’s cute. But if your doggie doesn’t want to put on a Christmas sweater, you probably shouldn’t force the issue. \nOn Friday, a pit bull mix named “Scarface” turned on a family. The dog mauled 52-year-old Brenda Guerrero in the backyard of her Tampa, Florida home when she tried to put a Christmas sweater on it. Guerrero’s husband, Ismael, and their 22-year-old son tried to stop the dog from biting Brenda’s arm, but the dog then attacked the two men. \nThe son then stabbed the dog in the neck in an effort to thwart the attack. \nPolice arrived at the bloody scene and tried to suppress the dog by tasering the dog. But the pit bull continued to chomp on the woman. Police then used a bean bag gun, but the dog continued to gnaw the woman. \n“Officers responding said the dog was pretty aggressive,” Eddy Durkin, from Tampa Police, said. “When they tasered the dog the dog was still pulling away and was able to release the prongs from the taser.”\nFinally, animal control officials stopped the attack by shooting the dog with a tranquilizer gun.\nBrenda and Ismael Guerrero were both taken to a hospital. Brenda’s injuries are believed to be serious, but not life-threatening.\nTo be fair to the pooch, I’d probably attack anyone who tried to put a Christmas sweater on me. Especially if I lived in humid Florida. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T03:54:32.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
