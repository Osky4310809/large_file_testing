His grandmother died Feb. 6, according to an obituary in the Loveland (Colo.) Reporter-Herald newspaper. The paper reported that the funeral was scheduled for Feb. 13. \nWashington-area sports talk station 106.7 The Fan reported , citing team sources, that McCloughan was sent home from Redskins Park on Feb. 20.
