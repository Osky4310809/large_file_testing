(ANI) \nRamjas Row: Indian National Congress party leader Randeep Singh Surjewala has joined in the Gurmehar Kaur row blaming Narendra Modi -led government of putting a ‘zubaanbandi’ after notebandi. In an interview with ANI, R Surjewala said, “After notebandi, Modi government now putting ‘zubaanbandi’; Would you be raped for saying ABVP gundas should stop hooliganism?” This comment from Congress comes after LSR student Gurmehar Kaur was trolled and attacked at by many people including celebrities for her facebook post. Her facebook post read- “I am a student from Delhi University. I am not afraid of ABVP. I am not alone, every student of India is with me. #StudentsAgainstABVP” \nEver since the post went viral, the 20 year old youth received rape and death threats to which she replied in an interview, “I am 20. What political affiliations will I have. Rape threats are not OK. Death threats are not OK”. Gurmehar Kaur’s post has exploded a fiery debate of nationalism and freedom of speech among the masses. \nFurther details awaited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:40:33.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
