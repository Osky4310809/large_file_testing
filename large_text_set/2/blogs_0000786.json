Many online commentators and journalists believe repeated discussion of and links to this particular attempt at doxxing is the main catalyst for the ban. I think we need an #AltRightBan . Temporary, of course. Just until we tighten up the extreme vetting process. https://t.co/x8sx48uc5E — Steve Horton📎 (@tropicalsteve) January 30, 2017 \n“Reddit is the proud home to some of the most authentic conversations online. We strive to be a welcoming, open platform for all by trusting our users to maintain an environment that cultivates genuine conversation and adheres to our content policy,” the company said in a statement. After the events in #quebec we need to ban right wing white men until we can figure out what is going on. #extremevetting #altrightban — Peter Whinn (@petergene) January 30, 2017 \n“We knew this day was coming, so it comes as no surprise... But the admins are playing a losing game of whack-a-mole here,” user /u/MortalSisyphus, a former /r/altright moderator of the subreddit, said in a statement . “The more the established political institutions try to maintain the status quo and marginalize us, the more they will drive free-thinking, independent lovers of truth to our side.” \nREAD MORE: Twitter suspends ‘alt-right’ WeSearchr on back of dubious bounty offer \nA former senior moderator of the altright subreddit, who identified himself as Bill Simpson, told The Daily Beast , however, that he believed moderators on the site had been overly strict. \n“So much for leftist tolerance,” Simpson said. “Our moderator team enforced stricter standards of behavior than reddit requires, and our users were very prompt at reporting violations so we could ban violators and delete posts and comments that broke the rules.” \nWhile Reddit has long been known as a champion of freedom of speech, there has seemingly been a recent dramatic shift in policy. During the US presidential campaign, Reddit’s CEO Steve Huffman even admitted to directly editing posts directly attacking or referencing him in the dedicated Donald Trump subreddit, /r/The_Donald.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:04:36.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
