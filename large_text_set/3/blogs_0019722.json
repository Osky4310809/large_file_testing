By: Rajeev Kumar | New Delhi | Updated: March 17, 2017 11:57 AM Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley with Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and MoS for Railways Manoj Sinha at Parliament House in New Delhi on Thursday during the budget session. (PTI Photo) \nNo doubt, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh is one of the tallest leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the country and tallest in Uttar Pradesh. His work as the Home Minister has been fair and bold since May 2014. But when it comes to running the state, Singh’s tenure as CM couldn’t last long. He also missed an opportunity to rationalize reservation structure of government jobs. Singh wanted to make reservation available for the most backward classes among the SCs and OBCs. \nHowever, in various political and administrative roles since 1975, Singh has shown he can always think out of the box and introduce what is the best for the country and the BJP . It is his this ability that makes him more suitable BJP leader for running the country’s Home Ministry that covers the entire country, not a single state. It is for this reason, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would like to have Singh in the Cabinet: Remember Kashmir turmoil hasn’t yet died down completely, nor the Maoist threat. \nAs a Home Minister, Singh gives the same confidence to people as was done once by top BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. Despite these, Singh’s name has been doing the rounds as the UP CM. But I strongly believe that PM Modi would not send Singh to UP and instead send another contender, Manoj Sinha, for the job. Here are at least five reasons for this: UP needs a leader who can be seen as a guarantor of development \nRajnath Singh’s image is still of an astute politician. After 2004 debacle, Singh had started focussing on the most basic Hindutva tents to rebuild the party. His efforts led to the rise of BJP as well as Modi in around 10 years. UP now needs a leader who is not talked more about for his politics but his works. Someone who can guarantee development. An engineer by training, Manoj Sinha is the only name among all frontrunners who can do so. His work in the Railway Ministry has been commendable. Moreover, Sinha’s appointment would mark a continuity in CM office as the previous CM, Akhilesh Yadav was also an engineer. After historic UP win, caste calculation for CM post is a matter of past. Now, it is only about development and who can do that \nSeveral experts are claiming that BJP CM in the state would be the one who can fit into the complex caste arithmetic of Uttar Pradesh. I do not agree with such experts. BJP win in UP has busted the myth that people would always vote according to their caste and religious loyalties. \nBJP has made tall promises in the election campaign and now it needs a man who can get them done. Secret is, PM Modi is raising a new breed of low-profile workaholic BJP leaders and Sinha fits the bill \nIf you look at the kind of leaders PM Modi and Amit Shah have picked for Maharashtra, Haryana and Assam in the last 2-3 years, you would notice that PM Modi is raising a new breed of BJP leaders who can remain low-profile, much-like Raman Singh of Chattisgarh, and work hard, just like Modi. Sinha is the only such leader among the top contenders at present. Modi prefers CEOs-type leaders who can complete targets within a fixed time period \nPM Modi’s ambitions are so high that he needs more and more leaders who can work like CEOs and complete works in a time-bound fashion. Only a few of his ministers have been successful in this regard, other are trying to catch up. For UP, Modi needs a “CEO-politician” the most as only he can help him retain the prize state in 2019 and beyond. With his engineering background, especially in civil engineering, Sinha is the ideal man who can start a new era of infrastructure development that the state needs to become prosperous. Modi needs Rajnath by his side in the Cabinet after Manohar Parrikar left for Goa \nA PM cannot always run the country all by himself. He does need a few honest and trustworthy confidantes who can give genuine suggestions. After Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar moved to Goa, Modi won’t like to lose Singh also from the Cabinet. One should remember that Singh has unapologetically supported Modi at all times, even when an atmosphere of dissent was prevailing against the Gujarat leader in the saffron camp.
