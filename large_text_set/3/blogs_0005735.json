Under the management of Terry Venables the club went to the FA Cup final in 1982, won Division Two in 1983 and secured a fifth-place finish in the top flight in 1984, earning them a place in the Uefa Cup for the 1984-85 season. But there was trouble ahead. \nVenables departed for Barcelona, with Alan Mullery arriving from Crystal Palace for an ill-fated spell at Selhurst Park. Lasting only six months, Mullery was frank in blaming the “moaning, groaning bunch of players who treated me, themselves and their profession with contempt”. Mullery crammed a lot into his time in West London – including a 5-5 draw with Newcastle and away thrashings at Tottenham, Sunderland and Leicester – but QPR’s adventures in Europe grabbed most of the headlines in the early part of the season, but not for the right reasons. How Arsenal won the Centenary Trophy, the least celebrated title in their history Read more \nOne of QPR’s undoubted strengths was their familiarity with their plastic pitch but the artificial carpet was pulled from under their feet before the Uefa Cup commenced. Ordered to play their home matches away from Loftus Road due to the surface, QPR chose Highbury as their alternative home. The change of venue didn’t seem to cause them any issues in the first two rounds. \nA comfortable 3-0 win away against KR Reykjavik was followed up by a 4-0 romp at Highbury in front of just 6,196 fans – summer signing Gary Bannister bagging a hat-trick – as QPR progressed to the second round easily. There would be a much sterner test awaiting Mullery’s men in the next round, however. \nPartizan Belgrade , who had won the league in Yugoslavia in the 1982-83 season and finished as runners-up in 1983-84, had the attacking talent of Zvonko Zivkovic and Dragan Mance, but Mullery was confident. Before the first leg at Highbury, he said he wanted to take a two-goal lead to Belgrade “to take the sting out of the tie”. He was granted his wish, and more, but even a four-goal lead wasn’t enough to put the tie to bed. \nMullery’s plan was to attack Partizan down the flanks, using wingers Wayne Fereday and Ian Stewart. Stewart was forced off at half time but the approach worked well. John Gregory swept in the opening goal in the 12th minute in front of a crowd of 7,836 fans, before Partizan skipper Klincarski equalised within a minute . Mance gave the visitors a 2-1 lead 10 minutes later with a thunderous 30-yard strike but QPR responded quickly, with Fereday levelling the match within two minutes before Simon Stainrod headed home to give QPR a 3-2 lead at half-time.

Conceding two away goals was not ideal but Mullery could feel very happy with his team’s performance at Highbury. \nThere had been one tiny blemish, though. Neill had intervened in an altercation between Stainrod and Admir Smajic, pushing Smajic, who fell to the ground. “He just collapsed in a heap,” said Mullery. “The Yugoslav is a good actor.” Neill was sent off and would miss the second leg. \nThe match had been a very open affair, but it had also been niggly and physical throughout. Partizan manager Nenad Bjekovic was furious over a Fenwick tackle on Ljubomir Radanovic. “It was disgraceful and he should have been sent off,” said Bjekovic. Fenwick was wary that Partizan would be up for the fight in the second leg, saying: “We’ll all have to take a slap in the face and just grin and bear it. We just can’t afford to get involved, although they will be out to intimidate us.” \nThe atmosphere in Belgrade was always going to be a factor, but the welcome the QPR players received on inspecting the pitch an hour before kick-off was a real eye-opener. Bombarded with coins and ball bearings in the stadium – which was only half full at the time – the noise generated by the 45,000 present shocked even Mullery. “I have never seen a crowd who could generate so much electricity,” he said. “It became too much for our youngsters to cope with.” \nA solid start was crucial to silence the partisan Partizan fans, but Mance headed in the opening goal after just five minutes . Rangers held out until the 40th minute, but the deficit was halved when centre-back Steve Wicks fouled Zivkovic in the box and Dragan Kalicanin scored the resulting penalty. Zivkovic was terrorising the QPR defence just five days after finishing a year of national service. Wicks must have wished the army had extended his stay. \nThe night went from bad to worse for QPR when Hucker let a speculative long-range effort from Miodrag Jesic bounce past him for Partizan’s third. The impossible was now looking probable and, when Zivkovic headed home a free-kick , the comeback was complete. It had taken just 64 minutes for QPR to be pegged back, which gave them plenty of time to find an away goal of their own, but they were shellshocked and defeated. The 6-6 aggregate scoreline took Partizan through on away goals. \nMullery locked the players in the dressing room for 40 minutes after the match before appearing in front of the press to tell them about the “worst result of my footballing life”. “I don’t blame any individual,” he said. “We conceded four goals and Partizan were brilliant. They never let us settle or play the ball forward.” Blackburn v Manchester United: the Cup tie that made Mick Rathbone famous Read more \n“We were beaten in Belgrade more than an hour before the match had even started,” he said. “I saw the players’ faces change when we walked out to sample the atmosphere. It was incredible. It frightened the life out of me and I have been around a long time.” It has since been rumoured that the players drank too much alcohol on the trip – before and after the match – but, whatever the truth in those stories, the whole experience was a nightmare for QPR. \n“It doesn’t put me under any more pressure,” said Mullery on his return to England, but he was fighting a losing battle. Less than a month after the Partizan debacle, Mullery was sacked with QPR in 16th place. Under caretaker manager Frank Sibley, they eventually finished the season one place above the relegation zone. \nPartizan were knocked out in the next round to Videoton. Losing the first leg 5-0 in Hungary didn’t help their cause. Sadly for Partizan, they discovered that not every team was as charitable as QPR.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:08:45.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
