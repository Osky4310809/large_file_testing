He will leave a big gap.” \nWhen news of his death emerged on January 2, the lido was closed and flowers and cards were laid at its gates, while the pool has now opened a book of condolences. \nMr Roberts was also chairman of his local tenants and residents association and his local voluntary work included campaigning to protect green spaces and building a games area for children. \nHe completed 15 marathons, raising thousands of pounds for charities. \nFriends said, despite his busy life – which included a number of other interests such as history and photography – he was always keen to help. \n'Wonderful man': Glyn Roberts, who completed the three peaks challenge, climbing Mount Snowdon \nPaul Nichols, 47, who knew Mr Roberts since they were children, said: “My father was hit by a lorry back in 2007. \n“I went straight to the place where he had been hit and the first person I saw was Glyn, who was part of the ambulance crew that day. \n“It was calming to see Glyn there who had been with my dad assuring him he would be alright. I owe him a lot.\" \nTributes have also poured out for Mr Roberts on social media. \nSusanne Lamido wrote on Facebook: “Why do the good die young? Can't help crying, my special community buddy Glyn Roberts died this morning. \n“The local community loved him. He helped everybody and continually raised money for charity. RIP my friend.” \nMr Roberts leaves his partner Victoria, son Edward and daughters Holly and Jessica.
