It started with you and your policies. Now, we have the 77th consecutive month of job growth. Mr Trump, don't blow it.\n— Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) March 10, 2017 \n\nFormer aide to President Bill Clinton and CNN political commentator Keith Boykin added similar sentiments on Twitter, writing that Obama inherited an economy of declining jobs, and gave Trump an economy that is gaining jobs.\nPresident Obama inherited an economy losing 748,000 jobs/month in 2009. Trump inherited an economy gaining 237,000 jobs/month. #JobsReport pic.twitter.com/D84hANJiyZ \n— Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) March 10, 2017 \n\nBut CNN Political Director David Chalian said on Friday that the business community had very positive views of Trump, and gave him credit for the upward thrust of the job market.\n\"The business community could not be more enthusiastic right now about Donald Trump. That is great for him out of the gate,\" Chalian said, adding that jobs and the economy have been the high points of Trump's presidency so far.\nThe post Pelosi Praises Obama, Criticizes Trump for Positive Jobs Report appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T01:31:41.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
