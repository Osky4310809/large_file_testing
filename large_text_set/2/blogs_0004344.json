As soon as we started watching Stranger Things , we couldn't take our eyes off the little lady who plays Nancy. At first it was just her screen presence that captured us, but when she made an appearance at the SAG Awards in a custom Miu Miu gown (that was quite honestly one of our favorite looks of the night), we thought way beyond Netflix . \nRest assured, campaigns and magazine covers are in the 21-year-old's near future. One scroll through her Instagram , and you'll note Natalia's ability to create a stylish mood board. Mix that with her red carpet choices so far, and you'll find yourself looking at fashion's next It girl. Read on to brush up on the facts and keep your eyes peeled for Natalia's next move. Whatever it is, she'll no doubt pull it off in a really great outfit.
