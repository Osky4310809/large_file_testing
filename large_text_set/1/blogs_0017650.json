Witchblade , created by Brian Haberlin, Marc Silvestri, David Wohl, and the late Michael Turner, debuted as the star of her own series in 1995, published through the Top Cow imprint of Image Comics . CSI ‘s Carol Mendelsohn and The Vampire Diaries ‘ Caroline Dries are working together on a script. \nRELATED: Rob Liefeld’s Extreme Universe Heads to the Big Screen \nWitchblade tells the story of NYPD detective Sarah Pezzini who, while on the hunt for a serial killer, finds herself imbued with superhuman powers via an ancient artifact. The artifact, the sentient Witchblade, has existed for ages and has come into the possession of women throughout history. As such, it remains to be seen whether or not the new series will follow Pezzini or if it might begin with an all new character. \nThe Witchblade comic ran for two decades, ending an 185-issue run in 2015. The character has had a substantial number of crossovers through the years. She has met both DC and Marvel Comics heroes as well as Lara Croft, Vampirella, Red Sonja and even creatures from Alien , Predator and Mars Attacks! \nAdaptations of Witchblade in the past include a two-season series on TNT that stars Yancy Butler and a 24-episode anime version. \nWitchblade is just one of several properties based on Image Comics publications. The Walking Dead is famously based on Robert Kirkman’s long-running horror series and word recently broke that a cinematic universe is being planned based on Rob Liefeld ‘s Extreme Universe (originally Image’s Awesome Comics imprint). \nWhat do you think of bringing Witchblade back to the small screen? Is there anyone you’d like to see star as Sarah Pezzini or would you rather the show follow a different Witchblade?
