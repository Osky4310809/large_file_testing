If you’re throwing an alley-oop, it’s a good idea to have Giannis Antetokounmpo on the receiving end of your pass.\nThe Greek Freak made Jason Terry look good Monday against Houston, soaring above the hoop to retrieve a high pass and slam it home for a massive alley-oop. \nTerry found a streaking Antetokounmpo and lofted a pass to the far side of the rim, but slightly off the mark. Thankfully, Antetokounmpo and his sky-scraping wingspan went up with his right hand and got it like it was nothing, catching the pass one-handed and slamming it home in one fluid motion that got the Milwaukee crowd going. \nGiannis routinely makes dazzling plays with his size and athleticism , but this is a good example of how impressive athletic ability can erase the mistakes of others on the court. Giannis can make up for it when a teammate’s pass sails a bit because the 24-year-old point guard can fly . If that pass is intended for anyone else on the court, you’re looking at a close miss and a slightly higher number on the turnover section of the box score.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:01:27.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
