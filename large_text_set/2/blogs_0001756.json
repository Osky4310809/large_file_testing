Instagram @maria.elena.adarna \n  “It must have been love, but it’s over now.” One could almost hear the lyrics of Roxette’s hit song as Ellen Adarna revealed to Philstar.com that the relationship she had with presidential son Sebastian “Baste” Duterte was “a bit” serious and not just for fun. \nThe relationship, she said, lasted for roughly six to seven months, but it just did not work out. \nThe 28-year-old sexy star was rumored to be dating the 29-year-old youngest son of President Rodrigo Duterte last year after the actress posted a photo on social media showing her and Baste kissing. She then posted couple photos while they were in Siargao. \nJan 24, 2017 at 4:38am PST \n  \nThe actress just confirmed the hearsay this month, when they already broke up via text. Baste was seen alone   after-party in Okada Hotel last January 30. \n“I have work on Valentine’s Day,” said Ellen, who is in ABS-CBN TV shows “Langit Lupa” and “Home Sweetie Home”. Her new movie, “Moonlight over Baler”, will be showing this February 8 with Gil Portes as director. \n“Everything’s going to be okay. If it’s not okay, it’s not the end, so be strong!” she urged those who are also nursing a broken heart.
