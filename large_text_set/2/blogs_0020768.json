ESPN College Basketball captured the deciding basket: ESPN College BBall @ESPNCBB 2/23/2017, 2:07:08 AM The final 13 minutes of the game featured back-and-forth play with neither team earning more than a three-point advantage. The Orange forced a missed shot by Luke Kennard with 11 seconds remaining, and Gillon did the rest to give Syracuse its biggest win of the year. Gillon has been hot-and-cold this year but was at his best Wednesday, finishing with a game-high 26 points on 9-of-14 shooting, plus six assists and zero turnovers. This came after shooting just 2-of-10 in a loss to Georgia Tech last time out, which Brent Axe of Syracuse.com joked about: Brent Axe @BrentAxeMedia It's quite a thing how John Gillon can look like dogmeat one game and steak the next 2/23/2017, 1:30:38 AM The Orange moved to 17-12 and 9-7 in the ACC, which has arguably been the toughest conference in the country. Duke fell to 22-6 and 10-5 in conference, losing for the first time in eight games. Jayson Tatum was dominant early in the game for the Blue Devils, tallying 14 points, 10 rebounds and three assists in the first half alone, while helping the visitors take a 33-25 halftime lead. The freshman finished with 19 points and 13 rebounds Although Duke maintained control for most of the first half, neither team was especially impressive offensively, as ESPN Stats and Info noted: ESPN Stats & Info @ESPNStatsInfo Duke and Syracuse have struggled to get it going offensively in the 1st half. They've combined to shoot just 42% (10-24) in the paint. https://t.co/UHc4prXrIZ 2/23/2017, 12:55:34 AM Syracuse looked much better in the second half, storming back with some quality shooting before eventually tying the game at 47-47 with 13 minutes left. The Blue Devils ended up in trouble when both Kennard and Grayson Allen picked up their fourth fouls, hurting their ability to defend. Allen also struggled on the offensive end while finishing with eight points on 2-of-11 shooting. Kennard did his job with 23 points, but couldn't make his final attempt, giving Gillon the chance at the game-winner. Plenty of those watching along were surprised at the outcome: Bleacher Report @BleacherReport", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:45:11.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
