Valencia and Celta Vigo will have the chance to rise back above Real Betis and Las Palmas, who have at least temporarily overtaken them. RONALDO TURNS PROVIDER \nIt has been two years and four months since Cristiano Ronaldo last provided two assists in an away game in La Liga, which he did here to help Real Madrid to a vital win over Athletic Club. \nThe Portuguese has remained prolific this season, scoring 19 goals in 22 league games, but the way in which Zidane has brought youth into his first-team squad to create more depth and decrease the emphasis on his stars has undoubtedly been to Madrid's benefit. If anything, it is now Barcelona - famed for their academy and playing philosophy under Pep Guardiola - who now seem to be more reliant on the individual talent of their 'MSN' forward trio for success. \nBarca have scored more goals than Madrid but they have also had more off-days. Their potentially costly defeat to Deportivo La Coruna last weekend, probably a result of the euphoria of their incredible victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, was yet more evidence of how they are being bettered for consistency by their biggest rivals. ALSO OF NOTE... \nIt was a good Saturday for Atletico Madrid, who go into Sunday's match against Sevilla with less pressure on their shoulders due to the inability of Athletic, Villarreal and Real Sociedad to win. A win for Diego Simeone's men at the Vicente Calderon and the Champions League spots could be all but decided. \nWhen is the Champions League draw? \nAt the other end of the table, there is plenty to play for on what promises to be a significant close to the weekend. Sporting Gijon's meeting with Granada and Leganes' clash with Malaga are both huge games in the relegation fight and, after Simeone vs Sampoli, Barca aim to keep their title hopes alive against Valencia.
