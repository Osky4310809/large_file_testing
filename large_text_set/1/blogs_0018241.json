Mischa the Murray-slayer is 29, has never won an ATP title, has a career singles record of 82-125 and until this moment had never been ranked higher than 45. \nA contemporary of Murray and talented junior who had seen his share of injuries, this is his sixth Australian Open and hitherto he had never been past the second round. \nMurray’s exit marked the first time that the top two seeds had been eliminated prior to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park since 2002, when Lleyton Hewitt and Gustavo Kuerten fell. \nBut Hewitt and Kuerten were not Murray and Djokovic and the seemingly innocuous players who took them out were not viewed as clear and present dangers. \n“I don’t feel this is any more of an opportunity (lost) than the other years,” said Murray, who has been beaten in the final here four times. \nWhen Djoker was put out, there was much talk about his issues — personal problems and a strange diet. Tempting as it is to look for excuses for Sir Andy — injuries, heat or whatever — Zverev, a left hander, played as if he was channelling John McEnroe. He served and volleyed an extraordinary 119 times. \nHe made preposterous shots — lunging volleys at his feet that Murray couldn’t touch, serves, returns and passing shots that belied his ranking and history. Mischa Zverev served and volleyed 199 times.
