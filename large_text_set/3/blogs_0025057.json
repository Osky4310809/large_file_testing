As speaker, the current House minority leader worked long and hard to pass Obamacare, so she knows just what’s at stake for all those people who could end up without coverage—and what’s politically at stake for members of Congress. \n“What is happening today is a lose-lose situation for the Republicans,” Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said of the legislation during a press conference with party leadership. \n“It’s a lose for the American people, that’s for sure,\" she continued. \"But the people who vote for this will have this vote tattooed to their foreheads as they go forward.” \nRepublicans have voted and voted and voted and voted and voted to repeal Obamacare, but now that they could actually do it, they’re finding out it’s not so easy. And, yes, this will be a vote that will come back to haunt the bill’s supporters in 2018—and beyond, if necessary. \nIt’s our job to make this a vote that makes Republicans lose in 2018, but first it’s our job to make this a vote that fails here and now. \n  TODAY and it’s not too late to stop it . Even if you have   call   again at (202) 224-3121. Keep calling and urge your member of Congress to vote NO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:25:27.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
