Kevin Hill had just reported for duty when he got the phone call he doubted would ever come. \nA kidney was available, and he needed to head to St. Louis University Hospital for a transplant. It was about 10 a.m. on Feb. 8. \nHe rushed to his sergeant and could only say, “I got the call, Sarge! I got the call!” Hill’s voice cracked as he recalled the moment in an interview Thursday from his home in Florissant. \nHill, 47 and a father of six, had been waiting for a kidney for about five years — a span that included a divorce and a stretch of homelessness. \nThe surgery was a success, but Hill learned the recovery would be complicated. His immune system had been suppressed by drugs to reduce the chance of rejection. Doctors ordered him to limit visitors and stay home for the first 30 days. He would have to take three medications for the rest of his life, two of which will never be fully covered by insurance. \nAnd no work for three to six months. Hill had been with the Ferguson department only since January 2016 and had three weeks of paid time off. \nSo his fellow officers and the community have rallied around their rookie cop. \nCity officials are working out a way to let other officers donate their sick time and comp time to Hill. Police spouses and area residents helped organize a Dine Out event at a dozen Ferguson restaurants for March 1. An online donation page has netted about $725. \nTo Hill, the support shows there’s more to the Ferguson police than the national reputation the department got in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting in 2014. \n“The community reaching out and helping me just bears out what I’ve been saying — Ferguson supports its police,” he said. \nChief Delrish Moss said that the first time he talked with Hill after his surgery, Hill said he was eager to return to the short-staffed department. \n“I told him, ‘You’re more worried about being there to help your fellow officers and the community than you are about your own health. You just get yourself better and come back to us,’” Moss said. \nGetting back to work matters to Hill because his health has caused him troubles for decades. The native of Joliet, Ill., first learned he had high blood pressure during a physical for a college basketball scholarship. He started medication and played for the University of Missouri-St. Louis. He graduated with a degree in criminology in 1998, he said. \nHe graduated from the St. Louis police academy in 2001 and joined the force. But his health continued to decline. A doctor sent him to a nephrologist immediately after a urine test in 2009 and Hill learned his kidneys were functioning below 10 percent. He needed dialysis, and he needed a kidney. \n“With high [blood] pressure over the years, it eroded my kidney function and size to the point where one was the size of an 8-year-old’s,” he said. “Even with medication, my blood pressure would spike and I wouldn’t know.” \nThe dialysis and fatigue made policing too difficult, Hill said, so he retired in 2009. \nHe tried driving a cab and doing security work but working around his dialysis schedule proved difficult. He also went through a divorce, and costly legal battles over child support mounted. He wound up living out of his van. After about 1½ years of having no home, his nephrologist told him a clinic would work his dialysis around police shifts if he could get back into the profession. \nWhile living at a shelter, he said, he was hired by the Breckenridge Hills police. That job lasted about six months. Hill believes they let him go because of his unpredictable health. He said he understood. \nLate in 2015, Hill applied with Ferguson. Assistant Chief Al Eickhoff recommended the department hire him. \n“He still loved the job, but due to things that were not in his control, he was down on his luck and just needed someone to give him a break,” Eickhoff said. \nDialysis continued. So did 12-hour patrol shifts. Doctors told him he could not have continued that pace without developing heart problems. \n“It was just too much to keep going back from that without 24 hours of rest to handling calls and the mental aspect of being vigilant as a cop,” Hill said. \nHill, who has remarried, has a blended family that includes six children ages 8 to 27. \nHaving a home got Hill back on the transplant list earlier this year; he had lost that spot during his bout of joblessness. \nWeeks later, he got the call. \n“It’s just a blessing,” he said.
