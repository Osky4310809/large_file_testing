The actor, musician, model, and clicktavist is an advocate for equality amongst race, class, and gender. With the latter being the bastion of his agency as a famous teen. “I feel like people are kind of confused about gender norms. I feel like people don’t really get it,” Jaden said in his August 2016 interview with Nylon —as the magazine’s first-ever, solo male cover star, no less.\n“I’m not saying that I get it, I’m just saying that I’ve never seen any distinction.” It’s no wonder, then, that while intently walking us through his latest MSFTSRep pop-up shop at V-Files SoHo, Jaden pauses to mention, “we don’t have the skirts in this collection, but they’re coming soon.”\nAt just 18-years-old Jaden is the uncanny leader of web-driven youths, tweeting in 140-character revelations as his followers hinge on every word like Power Rangers taking commandments from Zordon. Riddles like, “If a cup cake falls from a tree how far away will it be from down. #jupiter,” just add to the allure of Jaden’s oracle-ish mystique… Or make him look like a manipulative Twitter troll… Or both.\nWhatever your stance on Jaden’s celeb, he’s undoubtedly different. His light shining just a little brighter than everyone else’s in the room. And his infectious energy beaming through every endeavor from protesting alongside Shia Labeouf for the “He Will Not Divide Us” participatory performance , to eagerly embracing a mob of anticipating young fans outside of his MSFTSRep pop-up shop.\nCheck the above video as we go 1-on-1 with Jaden Smith for a guided tour of his MSFTSRep pop-up shop at V-Files and talk skate fashion, gender fluidity, and more.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T19:01:19.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
