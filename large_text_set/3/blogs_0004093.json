City of London calls on Chancellor to deliver stable Brexit \n“Or pretend the public finances are doing better than expected, yet he has to cut payments to the disabled, while continuing with tax giveaways to a wealthy few.” \nOn the NHS and social care – subjects that were not mentioned at the Chancellor’s autumn budget – Mr McDonnell will add: “It is essential that the Government use this Budget to give the NHS and social care the funding they urgently need. \n“The present Conservative Government has been condemned for its fast-and-loose approach to NHS spending.” \nWith the fiscal statement falling on International Women’s Day, Mr McDonnell will also cite independent estimates suggesting that 86 per cent of public spending cuts since the start of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010 have fallen on women. The numbers behind the NHS crisis \n“Our public services, from education to local government to prison services, are in a deepening crisis and the burden is falling disproportionately on women,” he will add. “It is women who are bearing the brunt of low pay, cuts to in-work benefits, and the public sector pay cap. \n“Put together, this Government has created a toxic mix for women.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:06:37.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
