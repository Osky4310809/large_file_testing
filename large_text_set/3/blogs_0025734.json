All are super splashy, featuring chefs with impressive star power (two involve chefs who have earned five-star reviews). All are downtown or downtownish. If these dining rooms even begin to fulfill their potential, they could turn our city center into a glamorous gastronomic power zone. Mirador, the penthouse restaurant atop Forty Five Ten, features the cooking of executive chefs Josh Sutcliff (left) and Junior Borges. Rose Baca/Staff Photographer Mirador \nWith a wraparound terrace that overlooks the giant eyeball, the penthouse restaurant atop Forty Five Ten on Main features the ambitious, gorgeously presented modern American cooking of executive chef Josh Sutcliff in collaboration with Junior Borges, executive chef of the Joule Hotel. (Forty Five Ten and the Joule are both owned by Headington Companies). \nMirador , Forty Five Ten on Main, penthouse level, 1608 Elm St., Dallas; 214-945-8200. Lunch Monday-Saturday; dinner Thursday-Saturday. Town Hearth A 1961 MG showpiece on display between Town Hearth's open kitchen and its dining room Tom Fox/Staff Photographer \nMassive, fabulous wood-grilled steaks, lobsters roasted in butter and other over-the-top indulgences are the order of the day at Town Hearth , Nick Badovinus' glammy new Design District restaurant. \nTown Hearth, 1617 Market Center Blvd., Dallas. 214-761-1617. Dinner Monday-Saturday. The French Room \nExecutive chef Michael Ehlert plans a modern take on French classics when the Adolphus Hotel's historic dining room, closed for a remake since last summer, reopens in late May or perhaps June. Until then, we'll be hungrily anticipating its return. \nAdolphus Hotel , 1321 Commerce St., Dallas; 214-742-8200. Bullion \nLongtime Mansion chef Bruno Davaillon is one of the city's most inspired, so his extended absence from an anemic scene (he left the Mansion in 2015) has been keenly felt. A year and a half in the making, the modern French brasserie he plans to open in early June promises to feature whole roasted birds, escargot beignets, braised rabbit torte, a gold leitmotif, a dramatic staircase. Glorious-sounding indeed. \n400 S. Record St., Dallas.
