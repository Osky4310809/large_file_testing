If you pay $100 in fees, they point out, that's $100 that won't be compounding toward your long-term financial goals.\nYou can take a look at this Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) graph to see this argument laid out very clearly.\nAs the SEC's graph illustrates, over 20 years a $100,000 portfolio could lose out on $30,000 of gains if the annual fee is 1% instead of 0.25%.\nhttps://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/ib_fees_expenses.pdf \nLet's get it out of the way upfront: I am a fee-based financial adviser — I have been for two decades. One would correctly assume that this makes me biased toward folks having an adviser, so you should probably take that into account. That being said, being an adviser for two decades also makes me uniquely positioned to understand the personal finance needs that real people have in real life — needs that are completely discounted by the increasingly popular anti-fee rhetoric of many robo-advisers and personal finance bloggers.\nWhat that SEC fee impact graph above offers is a highly focused example of opportunity cost. But the truth is, if you pay $100 for anything — investment advice, coffee, or childcare — that's $100 you will no longer have to invest for retirement. In other words, buy any item and that amount of money, plus years of compounding, will be removed from your potential retirement assets and future income.\nChoosing not to pay $100 a month for coffee, or $155 for my cell plan with unlimited texting, or $189 for cable, or $250 for my kid's after-school program, or $750 for my monthly BMW lease would free up a pile of money that could go into my portfolio and improve my current retirement savings and my ultimate income in retirement.\nOf course none of these items — the coffee, the cable, the cellphone plan or the car — will help me manage my financial affairs any better. So why isn't the low-fee crowd calling me a chump for spending money on coffee and childcare and all the other extraneous expenses? Because they aren't selling cheaper coffee. Most are selling cheaper — and nothing is free — investment \"advice .\"\nBy focusing solely on how expenses and fees can impact a portfolio, they are ignoring whether you are receiving any value for the dollars you spend on financial advice. Although there is certainly plenty of worthless advice to be had at a premium, before you dump every ounce down the drain like yesterday's cold coffee, let's take a minute to look deeper and cut through the hype.\nA recently updated Vanguard study attributed very little investment performance benefit to working with an adviser. This is not a surprise. But even Vanguard, outspoken proponent of low fees, found that investors did obtain broad benefits from the planning, portfolio construction, and wealth management process, and especially from behavioral coaching offered by a skillful adviser.\nVanguard's study indicated that an adviser who helps a client find and use lower cost investments tools can add nearly 0.5% to long-term performance, managing asset allocations between taxable and non-taxable accounts can add up to 0.75%, intelligent rebalancing can add 0.35%, and thoughtful withdrawal strategies can add another 0.7%. \nThomson Reuters By far the biggest value was realized from an adviser helping clients write, understand, and stick to their financial plan. Behavioral advice alone can add 1.5% to a client's long-term performance, according to Vanguard's study. \nAre you really a chump to pay 1% for advice that may improve your long-term outcomes by as much as 3%?\nWhen you're trying to figure out if you can swing that expensive vacation to Machu Picchu without having to work another year before retiring, who will run the lifetime cash-flow numbers? Which account should you draw on first in retirement? When should you take Social Security? How will you factor in all the different variables? When you have a question — any question — who will you trust? And who will ask you the hard questions when your investment behavior threatens to derail your long-term financial plans? Most of us routinely pay for the professional services of an accountant, mechanic, or plumber to help us manage stuff we can't or don't want to figure out ourselves.\nMeanwhile, the Vanguard study found that a \"suitable asset allocation\" adds only minimal value. Asset allocation is often the only thing you'll get from robo-advisers. They will ask you eight to 10 \"risk-tolerance\" questions and POOF – \"suitable asset allocation.\" In other words, you will pay next to nothing for something that, according the Vanguard, has little demonstrated value and none of the benefits a good adviser can provide.\nCheaper investment advice isn't better. It is just cheaper. \nWanting practical guidance and reassurance does not make you a chump — especially when you consider the long-term financial gains Vanguard's study shows a good adviser will provide.\nJonathan K.
