Here's the exchange where CNN's Jim @Acosta tries to ask Trump a question and the President-elect refuses pic.twitter.com/LlwmhPj5w3 — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) January 11, 2017 \nAccording to Mashable , Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Jacobs noted an altercation between Acosta and Trump spokesman Sean Spicer after the event. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer after news conference confronted @Acosta , angrily pointing finger as he spoke. https://t.co/lNttm82MIy — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) January 11, 2017 \n“Acosta then appeared on CNN and said Spicer threatened to remove him from future press conferences if a similar episode happened,” Mashable reported. Fortunately ABC's Cecilia Vega asked my question about whether any Trump associates contacted Russians. Trump said no. — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) January 11, 2017 \nAcosta has been involved in White House reporting since 2013. He previously worked as a journalist at CBS and a national political reporter at CNN, according to Mashable. \nThe back-and-forth between Trump and the national news website comes a day after CNN reported that intelligence leaders shared information with Trump that linked the president-elect to Russia. In fact, the intelligence report said Russia has information on Trump that they are holding against him. \nDespite Trump's harsh comments, CNN stands by its reporting. The news organization said that it remains \"fully confident in our reporting\" and that the report informs people of the inner workings of government. \n\"We made it clear that we were not publishing any of the details of the 35-page document because we have not corroborated the report's allegations,\" CNN said in a statement. \"Given that members of the Trump transition team have so vocally criticized our reporting, we encourage them to identify, specifically, what they believe to be inaccurate.\" \nCNN also said its decision is different from that of BuzzFeed News, which published the full actual account of information (it contains some graphic information, which is why we haven't linked to it). \nBuzzFeed said in its report that the files were unverified, but decided to publish them \"so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the U.S. government.\" \nMedia critics spoke out against the news organization Monday and Tuesday for releasing documents that may not be accurate at all. publishing unverified claims after a months long narrative of combatting \"fake news\" is certainly a bold move", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T09:39:26.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
