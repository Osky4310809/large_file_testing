The SpaceX CEO’s recently-revealed plan to dig a tunnel under Los Angeles to ease traffic congestion has apparently been given the go ahead, according to Musk himself, who tweeted this morning , “Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.” \nThe announcement comes two days after Musk, along with several other business leaders including Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson, met with President Trump at the White House to discuss manufacturing issues. \nExciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so. \nNot one to hang around, it seems. We only learned of Musk’s tunnelling ambitions last December when the mogul mused about LA’s traffic problems on Twitter. \n“It shall be called 'The Boring Company',” he wrote. “Borings, it’s what we do.” \nBut just over a month later, following the high profile meeting with Trump, Musk has confirmed work on a tunnel, which will be carved out by Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs), presumably beginning next month across the road from SpaceX’s LA office in Crenshaw, near the 105 Freeway, “5 mins from LAX”. \nMotherboard has contacted SpaceX and Tesla by email to get more information about the project, but has yet to receive a response. \nDonald Trump is serious about infrastructure, and even specifically mentioned tunnels in his inauguration speech. \"We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation,” he declared last Friday. \nIt’s entirely plausible that Trump gave Musk the go-ahead to pull the trigger on The Boring Company this week, with Musk’s surprise announcement of an LA tunnel fitting the profile of Trump’s erratic, off-the-cuff, business-minded attitude. And with Trump’s $1 trillion infrastructure plan that looks to rely heavily on private investment , it would seem Musk is the perfect guy for the job to shake up America’s roads with tunnels.
