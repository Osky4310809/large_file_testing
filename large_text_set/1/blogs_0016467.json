Iheanacho celebrating his goal against Southampton \n“When Kelechi turned 19, Nike were in the United Kingdom to negotiate a fresh contract with him that would have paid him over 100,000 pounds and another 100,000 pounds in kits and products, “ a Nigeria Football Federation insider said. “Nike set up a meeting but he didn’t attend, so they had to pull out of the deal when they discovered that he breached the contract with his American agent. “ \nWhile Iheanacho has claimed that he was introduced to Stellar Group by City teammate Patrick Roberts, who is on loan at Celtic, it is known that some English-based Nigerian agents were the ones that convinced him to tear up his contract with First Eleven Management.
