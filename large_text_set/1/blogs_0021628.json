The raunchy, gag-filled animated series quickly became a favorite show after it debut under Darn Harmon and Justin Roiland. However, there’s been little word on when the show’s next season will make its debut. Earlier this week, fans were sent into a tizzy when Harmon nodded to the season three delay, but it seems like some of his comments were left unsettled. UP NEXT: Dan Harmon Explains Rick and Morty Season 3 Delay \nAnd, now, the creator is taking a moment to clarify his comments about Rick and Morty’s third season. \nTaking to Twitter, Harmon addressed previous statements he made during an interview with Indiewire. Speaking to the site as Sundance, Harmon took blame for the delay and said the ordeal came down to creative differences. \n“If Justin [Roiland, Rick and Morty co-creator] were here he’d agree,” Harmon elaborated. “He and I would go, ‘Yeah, we fucked up,’ and it’s hard to put your finger on how we f**ked up. Rick and Morty keeps taking longer and longer to write, and I don’t know why.” \n“We have fights all the time and then we have fights about why we’re having fights,” Harmon said. “Well, we didn’t fight during Season 2, that’s why it’s taking longer! All this fighting! So OK, let’s stop fighting!” \nHowever, it looks like Harmon is backpedaling on some of his harsher language. Taking to Twitter, the creator shared a slew of tweets about Rick and Morty and chalked up the delay to nothing more than slow writing. And, no, there’s no drama going on behind-the-scenes with Harmon an and Roiland. You can read the transcript of the tweets below: \nRe: confusion/concern about my comments in Indiewire interview re: Rick and Morty. The “fights” I refer to aren’t “the reason 4 delay.” The “fights” also aren’t what you call a fight when you have one in your home or street. I’m talking about fights like “what joke to do.” It’s the statements back to back that’s confusing: I was saying “the buck stops with me and justin.” It was our usual perfectionism, etc. Then, I was moving on, in trademark rambling, to try to express how hard and confusing it can be in a RAM writers room. Chasing tails. \nI understand and we are flattered that in an information vacuum, with the show so late, any morsel of info is going to have huge weight. But the truth is not dramatic. It’s quite boring. We love our show. It’s a weird show that we struggle to not overthink OR underthink. As for now, they’re drawing it. We don’t update on exactly where every episode is in pipeline for two reasons (uh oh sub enumeration): One is that we want you harassing the bosses as opposed to hard-at-work artists and editors, or writers that finished months ago. The other is that it is out of our jurisdiction to discuss schedule. That’s Adult Swim’s biz. Totally unrelated. Hence the info shortage. \nSo, I’m sorry I can’t say “we fractured a creative valve in sector 3\" or “it’s Paul’s fault. GET HIM!” No hidden truth. We slow. Sorry. Part of what I was trying to express is that WE would sit and ponder, what’s the problem here, how can we write faster, why we so slow? And then we’d go “what made us faster in season 1\" and then we’d go “we didn’t sit here talking about this, let’s just do this,” etc. \nI tell you, as a self destructively honest guy, Justin and I have literally never fought. Season 3 isn’t late because of “fighting.” In fact, ironically, maybe THAT’s the delay-cause. We respect and terrify each other and always want the other to be happy. MORE: Rick And Morty Season 3 Sneak-Peek Released \nRick and Morty is Adult Swim's most scientifically accurate animated comedy. Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, it catalogues the bizarre misadventures of a bored scientific genius/drunkard and his socially awkward grandson, Morty. Their exploits tend to have unintended consequences for Morty's dysfunctional family, especially his unfailingly mediocre father, Jerry.
