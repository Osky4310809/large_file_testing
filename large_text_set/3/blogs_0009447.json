The Knights Templar were an important Catholic order who featured prominently during the Crusades and their name comes from Temple Mount in Jerusalem. This is where the Knights Templar are said to have first been created in 1129 under the Pope’s order, and their original duty was to help spiritual pilgrims who were visiting Jerusalem and the Holy Land. \nThe photographer Michael Scott, from Birmingham, saw a video of the 700-year-old Knights Templar cave in Shropshire and decided to visit the Caynton Caves network to witness them for himself. Some of Scott’s photographs of the cave have been published, including those in The Mirror , and these show an exotic candlelit labyrinth which Fox News note looks extremely similar to scenes straight out of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade .

I had to crouch down and once I was in it was completely silent.” \nThe Knights Templar cave was carved out of sandstone and the Caynton Caves network is found in woodland by Shifnal and the entrances to the caves are so small they could almost be mistaken for rabbit holes. Some of the chambers of the caves are also so narrow that visitors have to get on their hands and knees to move around inside of them. \nStunning 700 year old giant cave used by Knights Templar found behind a rabbit hole in British countryside https://t.co/YVtxiyfXba \n— TrutherbotUFO (@TrutherbotUFO) March 7, 2017 \nThe history of the Knights Templar is such that once the Holy Land was lost, the influence that the Knights Templar once held waned, although they still remained extremely wealthy. In 1307, King Philip IV of France decided that he wanted to expunge the debts that he owed to the order and plotted to bring about the end of the Knights Templar. He did this by accusing members of many false things like heresy and had them locked up or burned at the stake. In 1312, Pope Clement V made the decision to permanently disband the Knights Templar. \nThe Caynton Caves network in Shropshire where the Knights Templar cave is also has a darker history, and it is alleged that there were once ceremonies involving Black Magic here, the Birmingham Mail reported. The Shropshire Star note that at one point the caves were filled with graffiti, rubbish and other debris and because of this the owners of the caves sealed off the entrance in 2012. \nThe Knights Templar cave, along with the entire Caynton Caves network, is said to be extremely popular with Pagans and Druids and is also frequently visited during times like Halloween and the Winter and Summer Solstices.

For instance, the Norman temple inside Ludlow Castle may have also been used by the Knights Templar. There is also Penkridge Hall in Leebotwood, where Lydley Preceptory once stood. This was used by the Templars in 1158 and shut down in 1308 at the end of their order. \nHave you visited the 700-year-old Knights Templar cave or the Caynton Caves in Shropshire and what did you think of them if you did? \n[Featured Image by David Silverman/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:11:05.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
