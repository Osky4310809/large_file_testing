I legit go on the Master Cleanse once a year because I remember only how much I like those maple lemonades and never remember that I hate being hungry and going to Whole Foods 16 times a week and literally everything about cleanses. But I still do it. GIF Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Why? Maybe I'm trying to diet back down to my birth weight. Maybe I derive some sadistic pleasure out of depriving myself. Nah, it's just those maple lemonades. It's like drinking brunch! Jeopardy! Did the Most With Meme-Themed Categories Last week, however, I went on a cleanse of a different sort. It let me eat whatever I wanted and didn't produce any noticeable weight loss, but it made me feel better than any cleanse I've ever tried (and failed at). Last Wednesday I started a Trump Cleanse. This isn't some scam I found on Ivanka's Insta. This is a media elimination diet and what I eliminated was the president-elect. At some point last week, I tweeted about how I wanted to label future history book chapters about the Trump administration as fake news. #ForTheKids. I do most of my presidential shading on Twitter. It's a release valve. But this felt different. I looked at my timeline and I realized that every single tweet from every single person I followed was about him. It was like a scene out of a body snatchers movie. Except I was sitting in bed looking at my phone instead of interacting with the harvested husks of former humans. Same diff. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below I and everyone I know have been fixated on, infuriated by, triggered by, and otherwise distracted by one man for months. How did this happen? I have spent my entire life 100 percent obsessed with myself. I have written and performed three solo shows; I've turned navel-gazing into a brand. I'll be damned if I was going to let this dude steal my spotlight, especially inside my own head. GIF I had to give myself a break from his exposure, and I had to start with my own \"content.\" I deleted the history books tweet and futzed around with the idea. I realized that the fake news premise summoned his energy even if I didn't mention him. He Who Must Not Be Named shows up even when you don't say his name. It was like staring into a mirror and thinking ,\"I'd like a Bloody Mary\" and having a messy ghost lady show up, dripping on your floor. So rude. I had to start further back. I changed the premise and tweeted this.

Eric Thomas (@oureric) January 12, 2017 Most Popular It's my version of Repeal and Replace. I decided to try it out on all my \"platforms.\" Meaning in \"reality.\" Here's how the cleanse worked: I didn't read about him. I was nervous about missing some big news but I found that I heard about all the things that were worthwhile. And that most things weren't worthwhile. I didn't look at him. This seems petty (proud of it!) but it's important. I trained myself to keep scrolling when I saw a picture of him. This was harder than I thought but showed me that, more often than not, if I was seeing a photo I was also pausing to read a headline. Very tricky. I didn't write about him. For, like, a day. I couldn't pass up a chance to shade the press conference . But I tried, okay. I didn't rant about him. I'd found myself getting worked up in conversation with my husband and, almost without thinking about it, would slip into a screed that would begin, \"What's incomprehensible to me...\" or \"How does he think he's going to...\" or \"AAAGH!\" I would immediately stop myself, yell out \"Trump Cleanse!\" and move on to another topic. Usually whatever Viola Davis was doing. As with any cleanse, I had my slips. Like when I was on the Master Cleanse before my wedding and then went to a cake tasting. What was I supposed to do, not eat the cake? GIF I'm always going to eat the cake. But I found that this elimination diet helped calm me down a little. Not everything seemed an emergency. I felt, for the first time since November, slightly less on edge. Edge adjacent. I found myself thinking about myself, which is my favorite activity. Or about other people. Or about books I can't wait to read. I began to notice the people walking down the street, laughing, talking on their phones, holding hands with kids. \"All these people can't be preoccupied with him,\" I'd marvel to myself. \"They're just...living.\" GIF I don't think one can or should plan to ignore the president forever. Pretending isn't going to change the facts (however fungible facts may be these days), but I choose to acknowledge reality. And reality is more than just him. I love President Obama and I ask myself, How often did I think about what he was doing? In a random January, maybe once a week. There's a balance that can be struck. Even more importantly, I think acknowledging reality has a way of empowering us. When my husband and I are faced with something that we don't have the energy or emotional strength or will to do, we try to acknowledge reality with each other. \"I'm going to acknowledge reality by saying I know the dishes are in the sink and I don't have the energy to do them.\" \"I'm going to acknowledge the reality that I'm having a rough day and I don't know that I can be present for this event.\" \"Acknowledging reality? I'm scared about our future and I applied to be an Uber driver. In Paris. We should talk.\" Acknowledging reality defangs the fear and doubt without ignoring the need for action. It allows us to stand more comfortably in the present. And then it allows us move forward. Follow R. Eric Thomas on Twitter .
