(Molly Hennessy-Fiske / Los Angeles Times) Molly Hennessy-Fiske came to power in 2012. Sisi, a military leader, became president after Morsi was ousted, and he has reached out to the Coptic community, in part by attending Christmas services at St. Mark’s, but sectarian attacks have persisted.\nAfter the funeral Thursday, the Tawils made their way across the chapel courtyard to a small apartment, home to the widow of a church guard killed in the attack, Nabil Habib, 48. \nNadia Salah, 33, was caring for the youngest of her three children, 18-month-old Fadi, who still calls for his father. All she can do is point to Habib’s portrait, set up in the corner of the room they shared for 15 years. \nSalah’s 15-year-old daughter was with her father the day he died. He had sent her to fetch tea before the explosion, and she returned to find his body. \nSalah’s brother-in-law Zarif Habib, 42, was in the kitchen making lunch, having come to help from the city of Minya, where about 40% of the population is Christian and officials reported more than three dozen attacks on Copts in the last three years, including houses set afire and street assaults. \n“It’s normal for the Coptic people,” said Emad Tawil, who runs a plastic factory.

(Molly Hennessy-Fiske / Los Angeles Times) \nHe and his son have struggled, thinking of his wife and daughter every time they eat or do the dishes or laundry alone. They play back a voice message his daughter left a month before the attack in which she described a dream, a premonition in which she boarded a “train of death.” \nHis son fears the dark, where his thoughts return to that bloody day in the chapel, to the body of a girl he saw dismembered. \nBut they have also received support from the Coptic community and Muslim neighbors, who visited and made them food. Tawil smiled, insisting the family would enjoy Christmas just as their loved ones would in heaven. \nSalah started to cry. She doesn’t have much faith these days, she said. Sometimes she blames God for taking her husband and leaving her to care for their children. \n“I have weak faith. He was everything to me,” she said of her husband, before gesturing to the men and adding, “I see strong faith in their eyes.” \nEmad Tawil told her to cheer up. He would return Sunday so she could cook him a holiday meal, he suggested, and she grinned. \nAs he rose to leave, Tawil grimaced and placed a hand over his heart. He had been having pains since the attack, but did not want to see a doctor. He did not want to cry, either, but his eyes were brimming with tears. Suddenly, he did not feel strong at all. He missed his wife and daughter. \n“I want to go,” he said, and pointed skyward.
