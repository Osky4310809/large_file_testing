Michael Miszczak was jailed for 25 years (Photo: Handout) \nThe vile pair savagely beat and degraded their young victims from before the age of eight, Liverpool Crown Court was previously told. \nMiszczak was sentenced to 25 years behind bars, with an extended three years on licence. \nJones was jailed for 14 years, with a further year on licence, reports the Liverpool Echo. \nMiszczak, who showed no emotion as he was sentenced, was found guilty of 10 charges, including child rape, indecent assault and child cruelty, after a trial. \nJones, who shook her head in the dock, was convicted of four charges including aiding and abetting rape, assault causing actual bodily harm and child cruelty. \nDescribing how she helped her then husband rape the girl, Judge Watson said: “It was wickedly cruel, chillingly heartless and utterly inhuman.” \nMichael Scholes, prosecuting, had earlier told the court: “It’s difficult to imagine a worse example of the rape of a child.” Judge Denis Watson QC (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \nHe said the now adult women “suffered significant psychological trauma as a result of their ordeal at the hands of these defendants”. \nMiszczak and Jones were convicted of child cruelty on February 1 after they were found guilty. \nLiverpool Crown Court heard that on one occasion Jones punched one of the victims, as Jones brutally raped the girl. \nOn another occasion one of the girls wet herself and Jones rubbed her face in her own urine, the court was told.
