Four minutes later the Chile superstar hit the byline and pulled the ball back for Walcott to sidefoot his second. \nThere was more sublime hold-up play from Sanchez to tee up the England winger for his third and a fine stop from Lewis denied Lucas the goal his endeavours deserved. \nIt all meant there was no need for the late drama Arsenal provided in recent encounters against West Brom, Bournemouth, Preston North End and Burnley, with assistant manager Steve Bould able to enjoy a relaxed conclusion from the bench. \nHow Wenger must have envied him.
