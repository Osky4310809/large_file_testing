Mike Goren/ Flickr Stay on target American Gods adds new cast members as filming starts Joseph Gordon-Levitt quits Sandman movie Many of us may be thinking about the apocalypse in the year 2017, but if we can wait one more year, we’ll be getting a much funnier version of it on our screens.\nGood Omens , the biblical, apocalypse novel by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, is set to be adapted into a miniseries for the BBC and Amazon Prime, according to an announcement released on Thursday .\nThe six-part series, adapted entirely by Gaiman, will be released sometime in 2018 on the streaming service, and then broadcast on BBC in the UK.\nThe book documents the final days before the apocalypse, with a demon and an angel attempting to find the Antichrist, who was misplaced. The story features some fantastical figures, including witches, the horsemen of the apocalypse, and prophecies. It’s a wonderful, bonkers novel.\n“Spanning not only the universe but also the entirety of time, Neil Gaiman has created a story that may be the largest ever told on television,” said Joe Lewis, Head of Comedy and Drama at Amazon Studios.\nThe book was published in 1990, but the quest to bring it to the big or small screen has been long. With Pratchett’s death in March 2015 following a years-long battle with Alzheimer’s Disease, it seemed like it was never going to be.\nThis isn’t the first time Good Omens has been adapted. BBC Radio produced a radio series in 2014 which starred Peter Serafinowicz and Mark Heap.\nA visual adaptation has been in the works for almost two decades, with Terry Gilliam originally attached to direct a film . A TV series has been planned since 2011. In 2012, Pratchett’s daughter Rhianna Pratchett announced Narrativia, a production company run by the family in the hopes of adapting his works. Back then, Good Omens was going to be a TV movie.\nHowever, the project took on new momentum when Gaiman announced he’ll be writing the adaptation after he was presented with a letter Pratchett wrote before his death. He had previously mentioned he wouldn’t be working on anything based on the book without Pratchett, but the letter gave him the blessing to continue.\n“Almost thirty years ago, Terry Pratchett and I wrote the funniest novel we could about the end of the world, populated with angels and demons, not to mention an eleven-year-old Antichrist, witchfinders and the four Horsepeople of the Apocalypse. It became many people’s favorite book. Three decades later, it’s going to make it to the screen. I can’t think of anyone we’d rather make it with than BBC Studios, and I just wish Sir Terry were alive to see it.”\nFew other details are available. We know it’ll be produced by Gaiman, Caroline Skinner of Doctor Who , Chris Sussman, Rob Wilkins, and Rod Brown, who’s from Narrativia.\n“ Good Omens has always been one of my favorite books, and it’s hugely exciting not just to be able to bring it to life, but to do so with scripts from Neil Gaiman himself. It feels like a good time to be making a comedy about an impending global apocalypse,” Sussman said.", "external_links": ["https://flic.kr/p/6PWzC", "https://www.theguardian.com/books/tvandradioblog/2016/apr/15/good-omens-neil-gaiman-to-adapt-terry-pratchett-collaboration-for-tv", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170119005671/en/", "http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/gofact.htm"], "published": "2017-01-19T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:59:18.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
