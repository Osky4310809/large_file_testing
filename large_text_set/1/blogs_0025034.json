This space should be re-appropriated and put back into use. \n\"I think a lot of people will sympathise with what we are doing. Quite a lot of working class people are only one or two paycheques away from being homeless themselves.\" \nPolice were called to the property, which Anal said had been lying empty, after the squatters moved in, but the occupiers said officers had not been back since.
