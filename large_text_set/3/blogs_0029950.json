Beauty products are expensive! Plus, there's skin-care , and hair products and the list goes on and on. Well, now you can take solace in knowing that you're not alone. A recent survey done by beauty e-tailer SkinStore , showed that women in the United States spend about $300,000 just on their face during their lifetime. $300,000 . Let that sink in. Buzzfeed reports that SkinStore surveyed 3,000 women to find out their beauty habits. In addition to the crazy-sounding lifetime cost, the survey says women are walking around with about $8 worth of products on their face per day. That's just an average though. It really depends on where you live. Women who live on the East Coast have what the survey calls \"expensive faces,\" clocking in at $11. That differs from women on the West Coast, who are walking around with $5 of products on their face. New York, Connecticut, and West Virginia spend the most, and Montana spends the least. \nSkinStore One of the most surprising things we learned is that women use 16 products before they leave the house. There's serum and toner and face wash, plus foundation and concealer and bronzer. And that's not even half of it. It's also interesting to note that the study found the average woman spends 10 minutes applying all 16 of these steps, and seven minutes on skin-care at night. I must be doing something wrong because I use way less than 16 products and it takes me much longer than 10 minutes. To be fair, we don't know exactly how SkinStore came up with these exact numbers, and $3,000 women is not a very large sample. We've reached out to the company for more information and will update this post when we hear back. In the meantime, I'm going to go work on speeding up my morning routine.
