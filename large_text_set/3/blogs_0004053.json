View this image › \nRichard Wainwright / AAPIMAGE \nID: 10643439 Hanson also said the government’s “no jab, no pay” program, which required parents to have their children vaccinated in order to receive welfare payments, was “blackmailing” people.\n\n“I think people have a right to investigate themselves,” Hanson said.\n“If having vaccinations and measles vaccinations is actually going to stop these diseases, fine, no problems.”\n\nThe medical community described Hanson’s comments, which were made on the ABC, as dangerous and ignorant. Vaccination the most effective public health measure ever. @PaulineHansonOz dangerous and ignorant #insiders\n— Brian Owler (@BrianOwler) ID: 10643479 Labor’s health spokesperson called on the government to condemn her stance, particularly in light of the WA Liberal Party preferencing Hanson at this week’s state election. Appalled to hear Pauline Hanson's comments re vaccination on #insiders. They aren't just wrong - they are dangerous. Gvt needs to condemn\n— Catherine King MP (@CatherineKingMP) ID: 10643482 Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and health minister Greg Hunt joined the chorus of people calling out the anti-vaxx comments. The clear & categorical advice from medical experts including the CMO, based on decades of research & evidence, is vaccinations save lives.\n— Greg Hunt (@GregHuntMP) ID: 10643478 As did Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young. Pauline Hanson's view on vaccinations is dangerous and puts all of our children at risk. As a mother I am appalled she could be so reckless.\n— Sarah Hanson-Young (@sarahinthesen8) ID: 10643648 Hughes said the danger in giving Hanson’s views a platform is that they are often “regurgitated” online by parents opposed to vaccination.

I just wish she had less influence over vulnerable parents who may believe her misinformation.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T04:13:48.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
