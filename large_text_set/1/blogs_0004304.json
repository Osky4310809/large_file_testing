The messages popped up on his girlfriend's daughter's iPad (Photo: PA) \nAnd the knowledge is eating away at him. \n36 year-old Katash took to Reddit to explain his situation, admitting, \"I've been reluctant on bringing it up until the holidays were over and the time has come to spill the beans but I just can't bring myself to it.\" \nThe timing is especially harsh, as their one year anniversary falls in February. \n\"I wasn't snooping when I found the messages,\" he adds. \n\"Her Apple devices throughout the house are all linked to her iPhone.

Both parties had worked closely together (Photo: Getty) \n\"I opened the message and BEHOLD! It's d*** and t**** pictures! \n\"There were a few things that she said that were coming from her emotionally, like 'I miss you', 'you give me butterflies when we pass each other', 'I regret dumping you'. Stuff like that. \n\"She's a nurse and he's an engaged surgeon. I'm not sure how long they were dating for but I do know it's been a couple years that they've been apart. Not sure if they've gotten physical since then.\" \nSupport for Katash was unanimous.
