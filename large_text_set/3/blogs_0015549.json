On Friday, Reuters reported, immigration judges were reassigned to 12 U.S. cities to speed up deportation.\nThe Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) said it detained 444 Mexican nationals between Jan. 1 and March 8, compared with 410 for all of 2016, 351 for 2015, and 399 for 2014.\nThe CBSA can detain foreign nationals if it is believed they pose a danger to the public, if their identity is unclear or if they are deemed unlikely to appear for removal or for a proceeding.\nThe number of Mexicans turned back at the airport has risen, too – to 313 in January, more than any January since 2012 and more than the annual totals for 2012, 2013 and 2014.\nWith the visa requirement lifted, all that Mexicans need to come to Canada is an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), obtainable online in a matter of minutes. But they cannot work without a work permit, and the eTA does not guarantee entry.\nCanada issued 72,450 travel authorizations to Mexican citizens between Dec. 1, 2016, and March 10, 2017 – a significant increase compared with a similar period when visas were required.\nCanada’s Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen has said his department is monitoring the situation. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday afternoon.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:36:03.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
