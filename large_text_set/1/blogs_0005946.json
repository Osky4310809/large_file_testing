They switched the symbols for male and female, seeming to suggest that the largest protest of women on Capitol Hill would actually just be a gathering of men.\nSEE ALSO: New browser plug-in fact checks Trump's tweets for you\nOf course, there is a large mass of men coming to the White House, just not on the picket lines.\nThe Post quickly deleted the tweet, but not before social media outrage set in. Critics lambasted the publication for making the error, saying it emblematized the gender makeup of the paper's staff.\nI have no fucking words.\nYOU HAD ONE JOB, FRONT PAGE DESIGNER. ONE.

How would that work. h/t @annaisaacs pic.twitter.com/LqZSyyMSl5\n— Steven Rich (@dataeditor) January 5, 2017\nThat WaPo Express cover is so perfectly terribly wrong, and also an excellent metaphor.\n— Meghan Florian (@MeghanFlorian) January 5, 2017\nThe Post apologized and even offered a make-up tweet.\nThis is how the cover should have looked. We apologize for the mistake. pic.twitter.com/MKKOkHPV8T\n— Express (@WaPoExpress) January 5, 2017\nThe Women's March on Washington will be held on Jan. 21. For more details (and correct symbols), check out their site here .\nWe made a mistake on our cover this morning and we’re very embarrassed. We erroneously used a male symbol instead of a female symbol.\n— Express (@WaPoExpress) January 5, 2017\nBONUS: Ridiculous Fox anchor to Teen Vogue writer: 'stick to the thigh-high boots'", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/dataeditor/status/817032142857338880", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/6BKrXKB4.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/16iprrf7YzFdmjopbPx8EMM9Yf0=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F337603%2Fe59d6180-3fc1-44cb-a87d-0e5cbf7a3cda.jpg", "https://twitter.com/WaPoExpress/status/817033542446252033", "https://twitter.com/annaisaacs", "https://twitter.com/WaPoExpress/status/817033716593790976", "https://t.co/LqZSyyMSl5", "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/13/politics/donald-trump-cabinet-diversity/", "http://theslot.jezebel.com/womens-march-on-washington-set-to-be-the-biggest-inaugu-1790757798", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/6BKrXKB4.jpg", "https://twitter.com/kcunning/status/817013489436860416", "https://twitter.com/MeghanFlorian/status/817028025833418753", "https://t.co/wWM1CBFNeo", "https://t.co/MKKOkHPV8T", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vtlXaXBiIamnDELkC-r6EP7KPhk=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F337603%2Fe59d6180-3fc1-44cb-a87d-0e5cbf7a3cda.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-06T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T18:27:52.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
