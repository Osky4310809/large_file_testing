Capitalism is the disease. Socialism is the cure.” \nBut the edited image only shows the first part criticizing President Donald Trump. The GOP pulled their disastrous health care bill — this is a victory for the American people. Continue to speak up. It’s working. pic.twitter.com/DtUuUIJeyW \n— The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) March 24, 2017 \nThe administrators of the social media profile likely either edited the photo themselves, or chose an already-doctored image of the scene. \nThe decision to airbrush the more extreme statements from the newspaper, at least to some degree, embodies a divergence the Democratic Party has with a large portion of its electorate. \n“The base of the Democrats are pushing forward and exploring new options,” Rachel Silang, the national social media coordinator for the Party for Socialism and Liberation, the organization listed under the message, told Mic. “For them to edit out the words ‘capitalism’ and ‘socialism’ is just so telling about how disconnected they are from young voters, and even older voters.” \nSilang reportedly said that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, is the most popular politician in the U.S., likely referencing a recent poll from Fox News. \n“It’s incredible to see that our energy we have is taken and repurposed, without wanting to engage in our politics,” Silang said, according to Mic. \nThe Democratic Party’s Twitter account wasn’t able to cleanse all of the socialist content from the photo. Featured in the deep center of the image is a hammer and sickle (a Communist symbol). \nSend tips to [email protected] .
