Now I am waiting for M'Baye Niang to get a goal because he is improving mentally. \n\"We started the game well but in the second half we lost some intensity and ran a few risks at the end when we moved to 4-2-4. \n\"But I am satisfied with this win and how we achieved it. The foundations are there, we just need to get more shots on target and attack the opposition defence a bit more in future.\" \nMidfielder Suso was relieved to see fifth-placed Milan keep pace with the teams closest to them in Serie A after Roma, Napoli, Lazio, Atalanta and Inter all won. \n\"We knew that all the other teams had won this weekend, so it was a very, very important result for us,\" he said. \n\"It is early to talk about the Champions League, we have to keep focusing on one game at a time and reaching Europe. \n\"It was difficult. Cagliari fought hard and defended very well, but we managed to break them down in the end.\" \nThe competition for European spots is fierce in Serie A. Milan, who have a game in hand, are only two points adrift of Napoli in third but just three ahead of Inter in seventh.
