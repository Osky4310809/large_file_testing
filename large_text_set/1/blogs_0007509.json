He’s a guy wooed by John McCain to work on staff, and who has incessantly pushed Democrats to cut Social Security and Medicare. Fournier thinks Obama’s problem is that he didn’t “lead” (by which he means “engage with Republicans” enough), and once wrote that Supreme Court Justice Sonya Sotomayor had to explain , during her confirmation hearings, why she “[ looked] different than every other family-loving American\". \nHow about his love for Third Way , or his outright inability to grasp simple concepts like “ filibuster reform ,” betraying his utter shallowness and stupidity. Oh, and if that wasn’t making the case enough, how about this? x — Ron Fournier (@ron_fournier) November 30, 2015 \nThere is no reason Fournier should be anywhere near any DNC chair debate. He must be replaced immediately. \nAnd if existing candidates want an easy excuse to stand out from the crowd, here it is. Call for a moderator change or threaten to sit this one out.
