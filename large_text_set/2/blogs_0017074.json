He also called upon Afghanistan to eliminate terrorist safe havens on its soil to root out extremism. \nExpanding on the observation that civil-military leadership are on the same page on the issue, Masood that unity among institutions is important and termed it a welcoming step. \nLieutenant General (Retd) Naeem Lodhi said that it is a good decision by the military to start this operation. The operation would be successful in containing threats arriving from internal factors. \nHe added that there are certain external elements too which need to be dealt with. Lodhi said there is a need to stop their infiltration. \nPakistan Army today launched a nationwide military operation 'Radd-ul-Fasaad', which would include broad-spectrum security and counter-terrorism operations in Punjab, and continuation of ongoing operations across the country. \nAccording to the Director-General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) wing of the Pakistan Army, the operation aims include the elimination of the residual and latent threat of terrorism, consolidating gains of operations made so far and ensuring the security of Pakistan’s borders. 0 0 Countrywide operation need of the hour: analysts on 'Radd-ul-Fasaad' was posted in pakistan of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on February 22, 2017 and was last updated on February 22, 2017.
