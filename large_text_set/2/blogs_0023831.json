Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \n\nInterestingly, the survey found that college-educated white voters and non-college educated white voters are divided down the middle on the issue of trust. According to the poll, 55% of college-educated whites trust the media, compared to 55% of their non-college educated counterparts who trust Trump more. Nonwhite voters, on the other hand, were more likely to trust the media: A whopping 68% said they trusted the media more than Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:17:49.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
