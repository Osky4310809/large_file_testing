Point guard Rajon Rondo then called out both superstars on social media , blasting their lack of leadership and defending the younger players. \nThe developing feud forced Chicago to take action, reprimanding all three players, fining them and benching both Wade and Butler for the start of Friday’s home loss to the Heat, which coach Fred Hoiberg called the worst of the season. On Saturday, Wade practiced in response to his teammates’ request. \n“That’s one of the things in the meeting: Young guys just want a little bit more from him,” Gibson told ESPN’s Nick Friedell. “And he brung it today. He pushed the young guys. And that’s a sign that that meeting did a little something.” \nWhether it’s enough to fix a fractured Bulls team that’s 23-25 and not clearly behind Hoiberg is another question. FOX Sports’ Andrew Lynch thinks the first step is clear: Rondo’s gotta go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T04:12:40.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
