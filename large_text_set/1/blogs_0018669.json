Even so, Trump did talk at length about the nation’s problems, and Maddow reacted by noting the contrast between Trump and the more optimistic, hopeful speeches of former president Barack Obama . \n“It was militant and it was dark,” Maddow said. “The crime, the gangs, the drugs, this ‘American carnage,’ disrepair, decay. You can’t imagine the outgoing president giving a speech like that.” \nMaddow went on to say that Trump’s speech was reminiscent of nationalistic trends in America around WWII, and she used the isolationist America First Committee as her prime example. \n“The America First Committee is something that means a specific thing in this country. To repurpose it now, not that far down the historical path, it’s hard. It’s hard to hear.” \nAfter Maddow’s commentary, Chris Matthews praised the imagery Trump used about rejuvenating America, though Nicolle Wallace said the inaugural address was “unnecessarily dark” for the occasion. \nWatch above, via MSNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T20:18:15.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
