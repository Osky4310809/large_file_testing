More description and commentary below.\n\nWe see the off-duty officer reportedly with the Los Angeles police department, unnamed in any news account I've seen, assaulting and beginning to drag around 13-year-old Christian Dorscht. From their dialogue, what seems to have led up to this scene is the officer insisting that Dorscht threatened to shoot him. (Exactly what defensive end-game the officer saw in grabbing hold of and refusing to let go the kid is unclear.) Dorscht insists he merely threatened to \"sue\" the off-duty cop, and was verbally engaging him to begin with because he alleges the off-duty officer had yelled at a young girl on his lawn, calling her a \"cunt.\"\nStarting at around 2:05 in this version of the video, after minutes of the off-duty officer grappling with and dragging Dorscht around, one of the other kids watching the scene tries to tackle the off-duty officer. A few seconds after that the officer pulls out his gun and fires it. Amazingly, no one is hurt. There are a lot of kids milling about the whole situation.\nEven after firing his gun, the officer continues to physically detain Dorscht, though the video is now understandably being shot from farther away, what with the gun being fired by the maniac.\nAround five minutes in to the video more police arrive, and all the kids in the area are forced to sit down, see around 5:45 in the video.\nWhen the police begin interacting with Dorscht, it is the 13-year-old who appears to be forced to the ground by police, see starting around 7:45 in the video.\nThe man doing the assaulting, kidnapping, and firing of a gun is never seen to be manhandled or detained at all, merely carrying on a conversation with a uniformed officer after a very perfunctory pat around 6:45 in the video.\nAs OC Weekly reports :\nAnaheim police finally arrived to detain Christian and his friends. He was booked at Orange County Juvenile Hall for criminal threats and battery. Police arrested a 15-year-old for assault and battery before releasing him to his parents....\nAs for the off-duty cop? Anaheim's finest declined to arrest him. The LAPD is conducting an internal affairs investigation into his conduct. APD's Homicide Unit is looking into the circumstances surrounding the single gunshot.\nAccording to later reporting from local CBS-TV 8 , the unnamed LAPD officer is on administrative leave now.\nThat report also says that Anaheim cops found no evidence that the guy who had assaulted and kidnapped a 13-year-old and shot a gun near a crowd of kids had done anything worth an arrest, although the kidnapped and assaulted kid who they were told by the assaulting kidnapper who fired a gun had threatened him verbally was arrested. (The Anaheim cops had not seen the video yet, they claim. Nor have they arrested the shooter since, as of this posting.)\nDorscht has since been released from custody.\nThe unnamed shooter's union, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, CBS-TV 8 reports:\ndefended the off-duty officer, saying he acted in self-defense.\n\"The publicly available cell phone video shows that our officer was physically assaulted by multiple individuals and the officer sustained injuries,'' according to the union.\n\"There is no question, however, that when a police officer is attacked, they have a right and a duty to protect themselves, no matter the age of the offender,'' according to the LAPPL.\nSince the release of the video of yesterday's incident, protests have occurred in Anaheim . More on the protests and Anaheim city government reaction. Dorscht's family is already threatening to sue .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:49:42.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
