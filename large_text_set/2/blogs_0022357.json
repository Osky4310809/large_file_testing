(AP Photo/Petr David Josek) \nPLZEN â€” A zoo in the Czech Republic has welcomed a new baby rhinoceros. \nThe Indian rhino was born Feb. 5 at Zoo Plzen, 95 kilometers (60 miles) west of Prague. She weighed around 47 kilograms (104 pounds) at birth and is now up to 70 kilograms (154 pounds.) The zoo hasn't decided what to name her. \nHer mother, Manjula, was pregnant for 485 days, but zoo officials said the birth itself was quick and uneventful. She's now one of 74 Indian rhinos in zoos across Europe. \nYou can watch the new arrival (and her parents) on the zoo's webcam.
