Which will mean he wants a transfer out of Everton this coming summer, and the bidding war will likely commence forthwith. His refusal to sign a new contract at this stage likely only hurts him as he is still on a reported £90,000-a-week contract until the end of the season, with two years still left on it. Everton have always been reconciled to losing the striker, and will have lost leverage with his open announcement to leave, but also have the luxury of selling to the highest bidder there is since Lukaku is still an Everton player on paper.
