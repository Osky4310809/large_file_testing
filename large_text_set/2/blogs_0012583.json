The culmination of of a decade and around twenty movies worth of story, the third full Avengers film (and its still-untitled sequel, which is being shot back-to-back with the movie) will include the vast majority of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, bringing together the disparate worlds of science, cosmic, magic, and every other corner of that world. \n\"It's a very human story, even with this spectacle, even with all the players involved,\" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige assured fans in a special feature about Marvel Phase 3 on the Doctor Strange home release. \nFeige has been in a unique position, taking a very active role as studio president and guiding along the MCU as a whole for the last decade. Marvel Studios, while owned by Disney, has maintained its autonomy (much like Lucasfilm, purchased a few years later, has as well), and Feige has been at the head of the proverbial table for its entire existence as the current entity. When he knew it was all coming to a head, he was glad he already had the right team in place, and knew what the story elements needed to be. \n“There’s a simplicity of story that we’re leaning into,\" Feige said. \"Our writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who have done incredible work for us in the past. Joe and Anthony Russo, who are taking everything they learned from Winter Soldier and everything they learned from Civil War , this is the team equipped to handle this many characters, and still making it feel like what it is: a great, three-act piece of storytelling.” \nThe Russo brothers and their writing team got to cut their teeth on Captain America: The Winter Soldier and fill out the universe in Captain America: Civil War , and now they get to tear it all down in Infinity War . And fans get to reap the benefits. \nDoctor Strange is available now on Digital HD, and hits DVD and Blu -ray February 28, 2017.
