The dynamic wideout, getting extra attention with WR1 Jordy Nelson out for the game , responded by torching the New York secondary and giving his team a 31-13 lead in the fourth quarter.\nCobb split the defense with a post route before making a leaping grab of an Aaron Rodgers bullet in the back of the end zone. The 16-yard strike turned what had been a close game into a three-possession lead for the home team. The grab was enough to get the attention of the newly-retired Steve Smith, who lauded Cobb’s hands on Twitter.\nMan that undertow is strong out there !!! \nGreat catch by @rcobb18 \n— Steve Smith Sr (@89SteveSmith) January 9, 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:39:58.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
