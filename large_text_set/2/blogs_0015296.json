To be clear, these rankings are solely based on how well the players did in the All-Star Game itself. \nPlease try to keep that in mind when you see where Michael Jordan is ranked. NBAE/Getty Images Andrew D. Bernstein 25 Tim Duncan (15 appearances, 12 starts) \n9.3 points, 9.1 rebounds, 2.1 assists per game; 1 MVP award \nThere's just something ... off about the Big Fundamental winning an All-Star MVP during his career. Are we sure Duncan sharing the award with Shaq in 2000 wasn't a mass hallucination? Getty Images Stephen Dunn Ray Allen (10 appearances, 0 starts) \n14.5 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.2 assists per game \nAllen's numbers aren't all that great, but we wanted to celebrate the fact he's one of only two players with double-digit All-Star appearances and zero starts. \nThe other is Paul Pierce, in a nice bit of serendipidity. Allen gets the nod over Pierce here because he scored more career points in the All-Star Game — and the weekend is all about buckets. Joe Murphy/NBAE/Getty Images Jerry West (12 appearances, 11 starts) \n13.3 points, 3.9 rebounds, 4.6 assists per game; 1 MVP award \nWest is one of 13 players to win the MVP award while playing for the team that hosted that year's All-Star Game, and that's way more than we expected. Maybe the voters are influenced by the home crowd just like officials — or maybe the hometown player is usually the one who cares about putting his best foot forward. NBAE/Getty Images NBA Photo Library 22 Larry Bird (10 appearances, 9 starts) \n13.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.1 assists per game; 1 MVP award \nBird wasn't all that great in All-Star Games, which makes a lot of sense. How do you expect Larry Legend to get up when you tell him the game doesn't matter? Self-motivation only goes so far. NBAE/Getty Images Andrew D. Bernstein 21 Bob Cousy (13 appearances, 12 starts) \n11.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, 6.6 assists per game; 2 MVP awards \nWe're generally skeptical of \"All-Stars\" from the NBA's early years, but it's hard to argue with Cousy's success. When in doubt, pick the guys who were picked to be the best back in the day. NBAE/Getty Images NBA Photo Library 20 Kevin Garnett (14 appearances, 11 starts) \n11.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 2.9 assists per game; 1 MVP award \nLeave it to KG to ruin a storybook ending. Michael Jordan played out of his mind in his final All-Star appearance in 2003, yet Garnett came away with the MVP award that night thanks to a 37-point performance. 19 Karl Malone (12 appearances, 8 starts) \n12.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists per game; 2 MVP awards \nAlthough Malone had a far better All-Star career than John Stockton (10 appearances, four starts), the two shared the 1993 MVP award — one of four times there were co-winners. \nWe wouldn't mind KD and Russell Westbrook pulling off that feat this weekend. Derick Hingle-USA TODAY Sports Derick Hingle 18 Chris Paul (8 appearances, 4 starts) \n13.1 points, 4.1 rebounds, 13.3 assists per game \nCP3 doesn't have the lengthy resume of the others on this list. Instead, he's the All-Star Game all-time leader in assists per game — and that's pretty neat. 17 Carmelo Anthony (9 appearances, 8 starts) \n19.4 points, 8.0 rebounds, 1.2 assists per game \nFun fact: 'Melo averages the fewest assists per game for an elite All-Star in NBA history. He gets what the All-Star Game is really about — taking as many shots as possible. 16 Dwyane Wade (11 appearances, 10 starts) \n16.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists per game; 1 MVP award \nAs great as Wade's 2010 MVP performance was, we prefer his triple-double game in 2012. \nIt's hard to go wrong either way, really. Getty Images Andy Lyons Allen Iverson (9 appearances, 9 starts) \n14.4 points, 2.6 rebounds, 6.2 assists per game; 2 MVP awards \nIverson wasn't always great in the All-Star Game, but when he was, it was spectacular. \nBesides, anyone who tries to use Shaq's shoe as a phone gets on this list. WP Elgin Baylor (11 appearances, 11 starts) \n19.8 points, 9.0 rebounds, 3.5 assists per game; 1 MVP award \nBaylor holds the record for career free-throw attempts in All-Star Game history, because the only way for his contemporaries to slow the Lakers forward was to tackle him on his way to the basket. NBAE/Getty Images NBA Photos Kevin Durant (7 appearances, 5 starts) \n25.6 points per game, 5.6 rebounds per game, 2.9 assists per game; 1 MVP award \nDurant also boasts the highest scoring average in NBA All-Star Game history, with Paul George coming in second at 25.3 points per game. 12 Isiah Thomas (11 appearances, 10 starts) \n16.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, 8.8 assists per game; 2 MVP awards \nAnd, of course, one instance of freezing out Michael Jordan in the All-Star Game to add to the list. NBAE/Getty Images Dick Raphael Shaquille O'Neal (12 appearances, 9 starts) \n16.8 points, 8.1 rebounds, 1.4 assists per game; 3 MVP awards \nNo bonus points for dancing with the Jabbawockeez before the show. Sorry, Shaq. NBAE NBAE/Getty Images Bob Pettit (11 appearances, 9 starts) \n20.4 points, 16.2 points, 2.1 assists per game; 4 MVP awards \nIn a game where everyone's taking their worst possible shots, someone has to scoop up the rebounds. Pettit averaged the most rebounds per game in All-Star history and grabbed a record 27 rebounds in the 1962 contest. 9 Julius Erving (11 appearances, 11 starts) \n20.1 points, 6.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists per game; 2 MVP awards \nDr. J also averaged 20.0 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.8 assists in five ABA All-Star Games. NBAE NBAE/Getty Images Wilt Chamberlain (13 appearances, 9 starts) \n14.7 points, 15.2 rebounds, 2.8 assists per game; 1 MVP award \nChamberlain holds the record for most total rebounds in All-Star history (197) as well as the single-game mark for free-throw attempts (16). NBAE/Getty Images Ken Regan Magic Johnson (11 appearances, 10 starts) \n16.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 11.5 assists per game; 2 MVP awards \nMagic has three of the top-five single-game All-Star performances in assists, setting the record in 1984 with 22 dimes. He had 19 in 1988 and 16 in 1983 as well. \nHe also produced the greatest moment in All-Star Game history when he won the MVP in 1992 three months after announcing he had been diagnosed with HIV. Al Behrman/Associated Press Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (18 appearances, 13 starts) \n13.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.8 assists per game \nAbdul-Jabbar holds All-Star records for most games played, most blocks (31), most fouls committed (57), and blocks per game (2.1, as the statistic wasn't counted in all of his appearances). \nHe also holds the mark for most All-Star Games without an MVP award, unfortunately. 5 Russell Westbrook (5 appearances, 1 start) \n23.8 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.6 assists per game; 2 MVP awards \nWestbrook doesn't have the track record of the other All-Star greats, but the game was made for the OKC point guard. Here's hoping he picks up a third MVP award in six tries on Sunday. 4 Oscar Robertson (12 appearances, 10 starts) \n20.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 6.8 assists per game; 3 MVP awards \nSomewhat surprisingly, the Big O never tallied a triple-double in the All-Star Game. No matter. Taking part in the near-boycott of the 1964 game was far more important than anything Robertson could have done on the court during the exhibition. 3 Michael Jordan (13 appearances, 13 starts) \n20.2 points, 4.7 rebounds, 4.2 assists per game; 3 MVP awards \nThat's right, basketball fans — there's one place where Michael Jordan isn't even in the discussion for the top spot in NBA history. \nMJ was always spectacular during All-Star weekend, but Kobe and LeBron were even better on Sunday. NBAE NBAE/Getty Images Kobe Bryant (15 appearances, 15 starts) \n19.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, 4.7 assists per game; 4 MVP awards \nKobe's the all-time All-Star steals leader (38, one more than Jordan) and holds the record for most shot attempts (238) — for now. No. 1 on this list will surpass Kobe in the latter category on Sunday night. 1 LeBron James (12 appearances, 12 starts) \n24.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists per game; 2 MVP awards \nHe's already the leading scorer in All-Star Game history, with the most field goals and most 3-pointers ever. He's one of only three players to record a triple-double in the game. He's started every year except his rookie season. He could very well match Kareem's record for most All-Star appearances. He's on pace to finish in the top three in All-Star Game assists and top ten in rebounds. \nOther than that one time he decided to pass and his absence in the Dunk Contest, it's good to be the King on All-Star weekend.
