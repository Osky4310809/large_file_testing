Featuring perhaps the most subtle formation of images in a teaser poster this year, you can check it out in the gallery below. \nBaywatch reteams Dwayne Johnson with his San Andreas co-star Alexandra Daddario alongside Zac Efron ( Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates ), Kelly Rohrbach ( Broad City ), Jon Bass ( Loving ), Ilfenesh Hadera ( Oldboy ), Priyanka Chopra ( Quantico ) and Hannibal Buress ( Broad City ). Baywatch hits theaters on May 26, 2017. \nBaywatch follows devoted lifeguard Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) as he butts heads with a brash new recruit (Efron). Together, they uncover a local criminal plot that threatens the future of the Bay. \nBaywatch offers a big-screen take on the television series that originally premiered on NBC in 1989. The original Baywatch cast included David Hasselhoff, Parker Stevenson, Shawn Weatherly, Billy Warlock, Erika Eleniak, Peter Phelps, Brandon Call and Holly Gagnier. The series was initially not a success and was cancelled after a single season. Plans were made, however, to move Baywatch into first-run syndication and, in 1991, Baywatch returned to the airwaves where it continued for a full decade, bringing in new cast members like Yasmine Bleeth and Pamela Anderson . The show also received a short-lived spinoff, Baywatch Hawaii . \nHorrible Bosses and Identity Thief director Seth Gordon directed Baywatch , which is produced by Dwayne Johnson alongside Michael Berk, Greg Bonann, Beau Flynn, Dany Garcia, Ivan Reitman and Douglas Schwartz.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:01:53.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
