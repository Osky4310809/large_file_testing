Running Changed That She joined the rowing team in college, looking for a sport she loved. And she found it—while cross-training. By Pia Peterson Tuesday, January 10, 2017, 11:03 am Pia Peterson \nGrowing up, I was not athletic. I had, for instance, a love/hate relationship with playground kickball games. I wanted to be celebrated like the sporty kids who sent balls soaring with ease. Unfortunately, I usually left the field cringing over too many missed kicks and foul balls. \nMy parents realized, as I sat in the goal one day and picked flowers at a PAL league soccer game, that I would probably never be MVP. They accepted this. In their eyes, sports were more my sister’s thing, and they were ok with that. I was encouraged to just forget it and stick to art and books.

Not only had I tried out (and eaten it hard while participating in) soccer, but also ice skating, softball, swimming, and tennis. If it required sweatbands or sneakers that didn’t light up, then in my opinion, what was the point? \nAll through high school, I was the book-loving, library-inhabiting, kid. My younger sister was great at anything that required balance, coordination, or keeping an eye on the ball. \nI wasn’t a shut-in. I loved to build bridges across the brook behind our house, catch frogs with the neighborhood boys, or go swimming in the coves around Narragansett Bay. But I felt too ashamed to try out for the sports teams that my friends played on. Those small athletic failures when I was a kid added up to a seemingly insurmountable awkwardness that haunted me. I felt like sports existed in a different world, one where I didn’t belong, where everyone was cool, cocksure, and always made the winning kick. \nIt wasn’t until I was in college that I broke out of my self-conscious bubble. I was at a Thanksgiving dinner during one of my most awkward teenage phases, and a friend of my mom’s supportively pointed out that I had long legs for my lanky frame. “You should row!” she said. \nIt felt a small glimmer of possibility for building a new, more athletic me after high school. Tryouts for rowing didn’t seem as scary since they were on the water, which I loved. And when I showed up, I noticed that most of the other girls were tall and gangly as well. What was better: most of them had never rowed a boat before. I made the team. Pia Peterson holding a boat, on her rowing team. Eric Senior, courtesy Pia Peterson \nFunny thing, though, about rowing in New England: it gets cold. Really cold. So cold that rivers freeze over and there’s too much snow to make it down the gravelly dirt road to the boathouse. So the season is short and you end up having to say goodbye to the water for a while. \nThis is where running came in. A good rower is often tall, which helps her to have the longest possible stroke, but she also needs to be strong as heck to add some power to that pull. To build strength, our coach had us cross-training , which often meant running. It was tough, and it made me tough, a feeling which I’d never felt before. \nI walked most of my first run, but as my muscles adjusted to the change, I began to love it. Up hills , on roads, on fields, up stadium bleachers, in gyms and even once in the school pool for an aqua-jogging session. \nI went from not being able to run a mile, ashamed to take my workout pants off even in the hottest exercise room for fear that someone would see my thighs jiggling, to kicking ass on foot. I remember shaving my legs one day, and feeling the calf muscles bulging out under my skin and realizing that those muscles were happy, and had been waiting inside me all these years just to be used like this and show what they could do. \nIt didn’t matter if my sneakers didn’t light up anymore. One day I started talking to one of the better athletes in the group, and after we chatted a bit I mindlessly followed her for six miles up our coach’s challenging route. It seemed to be over in minutes (and it was, but there were forty-five of them). I felt light and energized beyond belief at the end of it. I wanted more and more of that kick-my-heels-up feeling, and that hard, deep breathing. \nIt was great to get back on the water in the spring, but I soon discovered that rowing and team competition didn’t hold much interest for me. I left the team after that first year. Running, however, had me hooked. \nSince college I have lived (and run) in the back woods of Mississippi, the mountains of Arizona, the neighborhoods of Yamagata, Japan, and finally in New York City, just north of Central Park. Every time I go outside for a run, I see something, feel something, or think something that I’m convinced I never would have experienced if I had stayed on my couch trying to find worthwhile documentaries on Netflix. I don’t feel guilty when I run slowly, or if I have bad form. And I’ve found a new, loosely organized “team” of runners in Central Park, the ones who run the loop with me or pass me by like clockwork at 7:30 am on weekday mornings. There’s no pressure to win or even to wave, but I like seeing them out there nevertheless. \nRunning is a part of my identity now. When I talk to my sister and my mom, they ask me how many miles I’m doing or what my next goal is, and I let them know when my birthday or Christmas comes around that a new pair of sneakers would be much appreciated. They’re so used to me motoring around these days that I’ll bet they can hardly remember the pains I would have taken ten years ago to avoid any kind of exercise, even running a block. But I remember, and I’m glad that I have that knowledge with me. \nIt makes me feel victorious and free, even when I’m stumbling and falling and making a fool of myself. I pushed myself, and something inside me that I didn’t know was there pushed back. \nI will lace up my sneakers tomorrow morning with more conviction than I will probably have in anything else I do for the rest of the day. I’ll go for my run knowing that I may be surprised by something new. That’s what gets me out the door, continuing to do things I never thought I could—to surprise myself. \n* * * \nPia Peterson is a writer, illustrator, and current graduate student at the Columbia School of Journalism.
