Liberal MP Rob Oliphant has been shepherding the proposed Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, also known as Bill S-201, through the House of Commons, where it is back up for debate and could come to a final vote Wednesday. “Either way, we already knew with statements having been made by the insurance industry that somebody was going to challenge the constitutionality of the law,” said Anthony Housefather, Liberal chair of the justice committee that refused to amend the bill to suit the government after hearing expert testimony that it was constitutional.\nHaving the federal government refer the matter directly to the top court “means that we will have an answer from the Supreme Court far faster than if a challenge is started in a lower court by industry or by someone,” he said in an interview, echoing the view of other Liberal backbenchers.\nThe last reference, on Senate reform, took just over a year for the Supreme Court to render an opinion. A previous reference on Quebec secession took two years.\n#S201 pals @SenCowan and @Rob_Oliphant in #HoC foyer after their triumph tonight. pic.twitter.com/G0AyQ8KYRy \n— David Akin (@davidakin) March 9, 2017 \n\nWilson-Raybould has said she’ll wait until the “parliamentary process” is concluded before referring the bill to the court. Housefather and other Liberal MPs assume that means the bill will be enacted after it clears one remaining hurdle in the Senate, which has already unanimously approved the bill but must agree to one minor amendment made by the House of Commons.\nHowever, that is not entirely certain.\nParliamentary procedure expert Ned Franks said it would be possible for the government to let the bill languish, without requesting that it receive royal assent from the governor general, while the top court is mulling over its constitutionality.\nAnd in that circumstance, should the court fail to render an opinion before the next election in the fall of 2019, the bill would die.\n“There are records of bills getting right through (Parliament) and never getting royal assent, sitting around for years,” Franks said in an interview.\nRelated Liberal backbenchers vote against Trudeau, pass law banning genetic discrimination Bill to outlaw discrimination over genetic makeup hits constitutional snag Bill that would ensure privacy for genetic information may fail over lack of Liberal support In Housefather’s opinion, the court reference shouldn’t be used to delay royal assent.\nWhile he’s unperturbed at the idea of referring the constitutionality of the bill to the top court, Housefather does have one proviso: someone must make a “clear and convincing case” that the legislation is constitutional.\nOrdinarily, the federal government would be expected to make that case about a federal law. But how could it do so in this instance?\n“Clearly, somebody has to make that argument (that it is constitutional)… I guess I have difficulty seeing how the federal government would go to court arguing a law that was adopted by the federal Parliament is not constitutional,” said Housefather.\n“I can see them referring the question but would they then take the position before the court that it’s not? It’s interesting. We’re all in unknown waters.”\nMacFarlane said the case for the bill will likely have to come from interveners or, barring that, the court will have to appoint an amicus curiae, a friend of the court, to ensure both sides get a fair hearing.\n“I’m not sure how anything other than an amicus curiae or some third-party intervener is an option for presenting arguments that the bill is constitutional,” he said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T16:55:18.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
