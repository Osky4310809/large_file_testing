(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Trump's 2005 tax return leaked \nPresident Donald Trump paid a 25% tax rate in 2005, according to pages of a leaked tax return reported on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show on Tuesday evening . The return showed Trump earned more than $150 million in 2005 and paid $36.5 million in taxes after writing off $103 million in losses. \nPulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston appeared on the show and said that someone had mailed him the pages of Trump's tax return. A statement from the White House before Maddow's show appeared to validate the authenticity of the documents. \nThe White House also said that publishing Trump's return would be illegal -- a charge Maddow said was not true.
