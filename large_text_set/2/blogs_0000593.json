In fact, full credit should be given to Govinda to not only pull off the dance steps that he does but even have legends, songs etc written about it. He’s back with his latest film Aa Gaya Hero , and while the trailer of the film is a different story altogether and let’s not go there, it’s the dance steps that stands out in the trailer as well as dance promos. You know your dance moves are special when they are named after your name. You know they are special when your name is used as reference in various songs be it Sharabi from Shah Rukh Khan ‘s Happy New Year , which has the line, ‘one drink down main Govinda, Tang Utha Ke from Akshay Kumar ‘s Housefull 3 , which has the line, ‘karenge Govinda ka dance, tang utha ke’. While Govinda is known as dancing legend by many, there are several dance goof ups even he has commited that made us go WTF! Also read: Aa Gaya Hero trailer: Salman Khan is loving Govinda’s comeback movie but we don’t quite agree to his sentiment \nHere are few WTF dance steps performed by Govinda that he got away with coz he is Govinda. \n\nUmmm…OKAY! \nAnd the most WTF dance moves performed by Govinda. The song had created a lot of hue and cry when released in 1994 and I wonder why! \n\nThe dance moves in sarkai lo khatiya from Raja Babu are trippy AF. I’d like to believe that it was because of this song that someone had the idea of creating Bhojpuri cinema to deliver gems like this. \nYes, yes, I know Bhojpuri cinema goes back to 1962 but as I said, ‘I’d like to believe’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:03:12.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
