Here are the pictures: \nThanks to its tiny bezels, the S8 still appears to be the more compact device when compared to the S7 – even though the latter packs a similarly sized 5.5-inch display. For more context, the panel for Samsung’s new flagship measures 5.54 inches and boasts an impressive 85 percent screen-to-body ratio. \nIn addition to its awesome bezels, the flagship will likely come in three different colors and support for wireless charging . \nSamsung is slated to reveal the new S8 next week on March 29. The handset is expected to hit the shelves later in April at the price of €799 for the standard version and €899 for the bigger S8 Plus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:33:06.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
