Subsequently, Mitchell was traded to West Coast and Lewis linked up with Melbourne. \nTo fill their midfield chasm, the Hawks then traded in emerging on-ball duo Jaeger O’Meara (Gold Coast) and Tom Mitchell (Sydney). \nLyon said the Hawks were still a genuine contender in 2017 — by virtue that they are “likely to finish in the top six — but added that Clarkson’s call on Mitchell and Lewis was as brilliant as it was brutal. \n“When I heard that Mitchell was potentially going and then Lewis, I thought to myself: ‘That is classic Alastair Clarkson’ and I thought it was a genius move. I really did,” Lyon told SEN . \n“It said to me there’s a fellow who has a really great understanding of his list and group. media_camera Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson made hard, tough calls on Jordan Lewis and Sam Mitchell. \n“The minute they didn’t contend — and I think in mind he realised they were some way off — he just said: ‘I’ve got to make hard calls. I’m not going to wait for another year because of who it is or the personnel … which means out goes Mitchell and out goes Lewis. But in my own mind, I’ve got O’Meara for 10 (years), I’ve got Tom Mitchell for 10, therefore I’ll make the call and live with the consequences.’” \nLyon then compared Hawthorn and Clarkson’s list management approach to Richmond, which opted not to trade out any of its top-end talent out following three unsuccessful finals campaigns (2013-2015). \nIt was only until Geelong and GWS approached Brett Deledio late last year — he would eventually land at the Giants — that the Tigers entertained trading out an A-grade player. \n“I compare (Hawthorn’s attitude) to some other clubs — and I want to mention Richmond here. This is a footy club who were making finals, losing but thinking they were close enough. So they go again, made finals and lost, made finals and lost and then it was Deledio out,” Lyon said. \nGet a FREE 2-week Foxtel Play trial and stream every 2017 JLT Community Series game LIVE on your mobile or tablet device.
