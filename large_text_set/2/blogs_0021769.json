(PTI) \nAs the BMC polls, 2017 results are coming to an end, a picture of who is getting control of the city is becoming very clear. The Shiv Sena has maintained a lead with 91 seats followed by BJP with 55 seats, while the Congress its third with 22 seats. The NCP meanwhile has garnered only 6 seats. The Uddhav Thackeray led-Shiv Sena’s only competition in the 227 members Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation seems to be its own saffron allies, the Bhartiya Janata Party. As per the trends in other major Municipal corporations and Zilla Parishad’s and panchayat samitis, the BJP remains in the lead with 23 seats and 10 ahead of Shiv Sena, who have 13 seats. According to last reports, the ruling MNS in Nashik, the Congress and the NCP had 2 seats each. \nThe civic bodies’ polls have been put right on the national map with an ugly tussle between the BJP and the Shiv Sena, despite both the saffron party being allies in the state and central government. The war between Shiv Sena and the BJP has put doubts over the stability of the BJP government in Maharashtra as the former has been quite vocal against the Devendra Fadnavis led BJP government and the demonetisation drive by Prime Minister Narendra Modi . \nAlso watch: \nThese results will decide the fate of 20 candidates for 5,777 seats up for grabs in the 10 municipal corporations, 25 Zilla parishads and 283 panchayat samiti for which the elections were held in two phases. The major focus of the polls has been Shiv Sena, for whom Mumbai has been a major political fort since its inception in 1966. Shiv Sena has been in power in the BMC for over 2 decades. In municipal corporations excluding Mumbai, there are multi–member wards where the electorate cast their votes for each of the categories in the panel. Each panel has more than two wards. The districts where elections to 283 panchayat samitis were held are – Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Beed, Buldhana, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Hingoli, Jalgaon, Jalna, Latur, Nanded, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Wardha, Yavatmal, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Pune, Solapur, Nashik,Amravati and Gadchiroli.
