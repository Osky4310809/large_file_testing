With the help of her siblings, the G.KERO brand was established in 2011. From there, the bohemian Bartherotte has carved a niche as one of the most idiosyncratic designers to have emerged out of France in recent years.\nThese days, G.KERO can be found on the racks of famous stores the world over. Superstars such as Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Elle Fanning, and Marion Cotillard have all been pictured in the get-up, while Daft Punk, David Bowie, The Beatles, and Karl Lagerfeld are just a few of the famous references featured on G.KERO apparel.\nSound that Cara never leave our supersexbombs printed shirt #caradelevingne #gkero #supersexbombshirt #beautiful #maldivesbeachparty \nA photo posted by G.KERO (@gkeroparis) on Dec 5, 2016 at 1:02pm PST \n\n\"Wear something that make thou beautiful and special\" is not on The Book but should be. #kendalljenner #gkero #birdsshirt \nA photo posted by G.KERO (@gkeroparis) on Oct 12, 2016 at 4:38am PDT \n\nMother to son #gkero #cute #marioncotillard #kid #weartheoriginal \nA photo posted by G.KERO (@gkeroparis) on Oct 26, 2015 at 11:15am PDT \n\nNews from L.A // Last summer she had picked up our birds shirt here she is wearing our free animals blouse // So cute with #gkero #ellefanning ‚ù§Ô∏è #hollywood #bestdressedinhollywood ‚ú®üòâüòç \nA photo posted by G.KERO (@gkeroparis) on Jul 20, 2015 at 4:36am PDT \n\nWe have just discovered this googling gkero : Beautiful Elle Fanning in Paris wearing our shirt !
