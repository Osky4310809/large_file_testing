Sergio Ramos gains momentum (Photo: sr4oficial/Instagram) The defender leaps into the air with the ball (Photo: sr4oficial/Instagram) \nRamos posted the video to social media, along with the caption: \"Preparing for the All Star of the NBA. Getting ready for the All Star game.\" \nHe added, calling out the one and only Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James in the process: \"Can you top that? @kingjames\". \nThis is not the first time Ramos has demonstrated his love for the sport, having previously posted images of himself scoring a basket. Getting closer to the basket...
