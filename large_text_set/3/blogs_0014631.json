The man is an idiot, and believes that human influenced climate change is impossible because “God’s still up there.” \nAppearing on the Voice of Christian Youth America’s radio program Inhofe defended his climate change denial by referring to arguments he made in his book: The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future \nInhofe said : \nWell actually the Genesis 8:22 that I use in there is that ‘as long as the earth remains there will be seed time and harvest, cold and heat, winter and summer, day and night,’ my point is, God’s still up there. The arrogance of people to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what He is doing in the climate is to me outrageous. \nNew Republic reports Inhofe made similar claims in a 2015 address to the U.S. Senate. At the time Inhofe declared: \nClimate is changing and climate has always changed and always will. The hoax is that there are some people who are so arrogant to think they are so powerful they can change climate. Man can’t change climate. \nThe Hill reports that under President Trump’s proposed federal budget the EPA is facing a budget cut of 31 percent. The budget only provides $5.7 billion for the EPA, down from $8.3 billion. \nBottom line: A climate change denying Christian extremist like Senator Inhofe has no business speaking about “propaganda,”“brainwashing,” or much of anything else. In fact, the man is clearly confused, and is himself a victim of brainwashing and propaganda. \nWatch the video below: Senator James Inhofe smears the EPA (Image via Screen Grab)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:59:49.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
