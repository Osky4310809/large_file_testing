But that’s only if they spent the rest of their day sedentary, too. The telomere-shortening effects of sitting weren’t present for people who worked out for half an hour or more each day. \nAmong those who didn’t exercise much, the most sedentary participants’ telomeres were an average of 170 base pairs shorter than those of the least sedentary. Since they’re expected to lose about 21 base pairs per year with regular aging, these finds suggest that the least-active subjects’ cells were essentially eight years older. (Here are 5 other ways sitting messes with your health .) \nMore research needs to be done to confirm whether sitting will affect guys’ telomeres the same way, too. \nInflammation and oxidative stress—both which can be prevented by physical activity—can shrink telomeres, which likely accounts for the shortened strands seen in the less-active sitters, says lead author Aladdin H. Shadyab, Ph.D. \nAnd it’s not just a quicker aging you need to worry about with shortened telomeres. It’s also been associated with heart disease , type 2 diabetes , certain cancers , and premature death, he says. \nIf you want to avoid these problems down the line, staying glued to your desk is probably a bad plan. Getting at least two and a half hours of exercise a week can help thwart telomere deterioration, says Shadyab. Research has shown this to be effective in men and younger people, too. \nSo make sure to break up your workday by walking, running, or hitting the gym. A standing desk can help, too. In fact, here’s how many more calories you burn at a standing desk .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:30:51.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
