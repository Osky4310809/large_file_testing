By: FE Online | Updated:  37 PM These crimes are increasing in our state but women are forced to keep quiet because of fear of dishonour, said KS Chitra. \nSpeaking in an interview to Mathrubhumi, playback singer KS Chithra, who is known as Kerala’s own nightingale, made a thought-provoking statement on the recent abduction of a popular Malayalam actress. “Remember your mother and sister before committing a crime like this,” The renowned playback singer stated. \nShe further emphasized that she is not referring to a celebrity’s case but speaking on behalf of all women in the state, “I am speaking in general and not about a celebrity in particular. These crimes are increasing in our state but women are forced to keep quiet because of fear of dishonour. What else can they do? At the same time, Indians who go abroad do not commit such crimes because the laws are strictly implemented. Our laws do not provide harsh punishments which is why today’s generation is not afraid of committing crimes like this. It saddens me when these crimes are increasing in a state like Kerala which has 100% literacy rate.” \nAlso Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:23:51.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
