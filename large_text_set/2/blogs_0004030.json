He recently welcomed a second daughter with wife Blake Lively, he got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and he’s been getting a lot of awards for his hit movie Deadpool. That’s why we thought it was so cool that he recently opened up about something very personal about his life. In an interview about being honored as Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2017 Man of the Year, Ryan Reynolds shared what he loves about being a dad, which he is something he is pretty sure no one else would get.\nRyan Reynolds loves seeing his oldest daughter James show love to his youngest daughter Ines . Reynolds’ words are as adorable as they are funny and self-deprecating :\n“Just seeing my older daughter be so infatuated with our younger daughter, who’s 4 months old. Seeing her kiss her and hug her and hold her, it kinda crushed me. But would put anyone else to sleep.” While it is sweet that Reynolds is trying to be humble and self-aware by acting like the thing he loves about being a dad is no big deal, we’ve got to disagree. Watching a little girl care for and love her little baby sister sounds so adorable. How could anyone be bored by that? Isn’t Reynolds aware of all the cute baby videos on the internet ? There is always an audience for adorableness.\nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic Reynolds, of course, went on to have an amazing time at the Hasty Pudding awards ceremony. He participated in antics including a parade, a dinner, and a celebratory roast where the students made him make fun of his famous flop Green Lantern. \nReynolds, of course, was a great sport throughout all of this.

You really are the man of the year!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:42:03.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
