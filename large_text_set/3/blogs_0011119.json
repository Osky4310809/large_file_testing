He didn’t force them to use the franchise tag.” \nStafford’s contract carries a $22 million cap hit in 2017, which will drive up his price tag should the Lions opt to use the franchise tag on him in 2018. \n“Here’s how it works,” Florio explained. “Forget about the franchise tag as it’s calculated for quarterbacks. With a cap number of $22 million for this year, if they want to use the franchise tag on him next year, he’s entitled to a 20 percent raise over that. So that’s a cap hit and a cash figure of $26.4 million — that’s already more than Andrew Luck is making by about $1.5 million. \n“If you’re going to use the tag, that’s the starting point for a long-term deal and, yeah, Stafford’s average (annual value) will be more than Andrew Luck’s. So it’s not about what other guys are making, it’s about what leverage you have under your specific circumstances regarding the franchise tag.” \nFinally, there’s the factor of a steadily rising salary cap. The cap will climb to $167 million in 2017 , the fourth consecutive year that it has jumped by at least $10 million from one season to the next. That increased financial flexibility, coupled with the growing market rate for high-level quarterback play, has seen several teams in the past four years hand out record-breaking deals to their cornerstones under center. \nIn 2013, the Packers inked Aaron Rodgers to a five-year extension whose $22 million annual salary set a new NFL high. That held up for about three years, until Joe Flacco agreed to terms with the Ravens on a three-year extension worth $22.13 million per season. And that held up for all of two months before Luck’s deal re-set the market again. \nWith Drew Brees having signed an extension last September – he’ll earn $24.25 million in 2017 – Stafford is the next quarterback in line for a major payday. \n“Matthew Stafford’s in a position where if he chooses to push it, he can get more than anyone else ever has,” Florio said. “Frankly, given what the salary cap has done the last four years, there should be a quarterback right now making $30 million a year and there isn’t even one making $25 million.” \nStafford could be the first. In fact, per a report last year, $25 million per season is exactly what Stafford and his agent are seeking in the quarterback’s next contract. Stafford promptly shot down that report , but where there’s smoke there tends to be fire. \nAs things stand today, an extension doesn’t appear to be on the immediate horizon. Stafford said at the end of last season that he and the Lions had yet to engage in contract talks , and general manager Bob Quinn confirmed the status quo at the scouting combine earlier this month. \n“We have not talked to Matthew and his representatives. I think that’s something that eventually we will get to,” said Quinn. “These things don’t usually happen in April or May, that’s not a realistic timeline for an extension for a quarterback, but that’s something that we do have on the agenda and we’ll hopefully be able to have some discussions.” \n“It’s a priority,” Quinn added later, “but it takes two sides to do a deal. I’m not making any promises one way or another, but I’ve always said since I’ve gotten here that I think Matthew’s a good quarterback and I’d like to have him long term. And that hasn’t changed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:31:18.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
