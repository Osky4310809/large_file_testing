A rumor circulated that 118 people, based in Uber's San Francisco office, had resigned following that meeting.\nThis number is not true, according to an Uber spokesperson.\nThe idea had been posted on Twitter, but it had gained traction on an app called Blind , where techies can anonymously share grievances or just chat. Companies are grouped into private channels, and users are verified based on their work email addresses.\nThe rumor had been posted by someone at Uber who gave themselves the title of \"HRinternal\" on the general tech industry channel:\n@sarahcuda sent it on the previous reply but here it is again :) pic.twitter.com/kYxCADWbsU\n— PhysicsandCoffee (@physicsNcoffee) February 23, 2017\nThe post has since been removed. The app is community regulated, meaning that users determine if a user is factual and relevant and then can report. If enough reports come in, a post is removed. Less than 0.5 percent of posts are flagged and removed.\nBlind was not aware of the post until Mashable reached out Wednesday because the app is not actively monitored.\n\"Either Uber users are saying it's trolling or it's wrong. I know Uber HR is on the app, but they don't typical do that. They 'like' the real good posts,\" said Alex Shin of Blind.\nThe app has more than 2,000 verified users from Uber. That's out of more than 11,000 Uber employees.\n@mranney @physicsNcoffee @seldo btw people who work there could be angry people!\n— Sarah Lacy (@sarahcuda) February 23, 2017\nWhile clearly not everything on Blind will pan out as fact, the uptick in activity on the Uber community board is definitely up. Activity from the Uber community on Blind actually tripled in the last week, according to Shin.\nBlind declined to disclose user numbers but said that Uber is one of its most active communities out of the more 100 tech companies on the app. At Microsoft, LinkedIn and Yahoo 1 in 5 users are verified on Blind. There are thousands of users Amazon, Google, Facebook and Intel as well.\nAccording to Blind, Uber has been the only company to make attempts at blocking employee access. The app does not launch when phones are connected to Uber Wi-Fi.\nUber did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that claim.\nBONUS: Drone captures mesmerizing footage of water overflowing in a portal-like 'Glory Hole'", "external_links": ["https://us.teamblind.com/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/a4GVjMmk.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/seldo", "https://twitter.com/mranney", "https://twitter.com/sarahcuda/status/834580132253749249", "https://twitter.com/sarahcuda", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/a4GVjMmk.jpg", "https://twitter.com/physicsNcoffee/status/834566962998960128", "https://twitter.com/physicsNcoffee", "https://t.co/kYxCADWbsU"], "published": "2017-02-24T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:52:17.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
