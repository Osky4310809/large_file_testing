It's not often that days like the third day in Dharamsala happen. Test cricket doesn't get more Mad Max than that. At the end of it though, it was India who look set to take the series. They need 87 more with ten wickets in hand. We've come down to the last day of what has been a truly memorable and undoubtedly wonderful Test series. \nThe off-field controversies aside, the series has produced cricket of a very high quality. Can we get to see one more such day? Can Australia ruffle India or will the latter cruise through? © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:57:54.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
