The ongoing Australian Open is literally proving that age is just a number. After Spanish tennis ace Rafael Nadal put on a superlative performance to win a gruelling five-set match against 19-year-old German Alexander Zverev, it was Roger Federer’s turn to put on a master-class against Japanese 27-year-old Kei Nishikori. Federer, like Rafa, took the match in five sets and showed once again why he is considered a tennis legend.\nThat Federer is 35-years-old now appears to have no bearing on his game. It will be recalled that he, again like Rafa, had cut his season short last year. And the way he has been playing here at Melbourne shows that the time off has had no negative impact on his form. On the contrary, Federer looks fitter and hungrier. Unlike in the early stages of his career, he has even become comfortable with showing his emotions on court.\nTaken together, both Rafa and Federer still seem to have the drive to be the best tennis players despite being on the circuit for many years. They still want to work hard, both on and off the court, and push themselves to the limit. And that is precisely why they have dominated men’s tennis for so long and continue to be formidable.\nIn fact, the long five-setters that Rafa and Federer recently played say a lot about where they stand today in relation to the rest of the men’s draw. They may not be the indomitable force they once were, but they still have the guile, skills and fighting spirit to overcome their opponents. In that sense, the younger lot isn’t ready to take over Rafa and Federer’s mantle. They still have much to learn from these two great players. What does that say about the overall health of the sport of tennis? Well, I would say that tennis continues to be in great hands with Rafa and Federer still setting the gold standard in the sport. And that is indeed great news for tennis fans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T05:25:47.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
