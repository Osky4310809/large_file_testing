We are pleased to confirm that the second person wanted in connection to the murder has been apprehended in S.Carolina. \n— Peabody Police (@PeabodyPolice) February 24, 2017 \nSources tell WBZ investigators knew he was heading south after he allegedly carjacked a man in Middleton . The carjacking victim’s cell phone may have played a role in helping police track Doughty. \nOn Wednesday sources say detectives knew he was south of Washington D.C. and sent out “be on the lookout” for Doughty to all officers in North and South Carolina. \nSpartanburg officers say they spotted Doughty soliciting money in a McDonald’s parking lot, which is illegal in that city. He was arrested without incident. When officers were booking him, they learned he was wanted for murder and carjacking. \nThe vehicle allegedly stolen in the carjacking was recovered from a Waffle House parking lot next door to the McDonald’s. \nDoughty will be arraigned on Monday on a fugitive from justice charge. If he waives rendition, he will be returned to Massachusetts next week. Police remove an item from a wooded area off of Route 128 in Peabody. (WBZ-TV) \nEarlier Friday, officers appeared to remove evidence from a wooded area a short distance from Route 128 in Peabody. At least one item was taken from the area and placed in a box. \nSources told WBZ-TV chief investigative reporter Cheryl Fiandaca the search was connected to the murders of Mark Greenlaw and Jennifer O’Connor inside a home on Farm Ave. in Peabody on Saturday. \nDoughty, one of the men wanted in connection with the double murder , continued to evade police until his Friday arrest. \nMichael Hebb was arrested Tuesday and charged with first-degree murder. \nPolice believe Doughty carjacked a Middleton man on Wednesday night. The two rode around in Ken Metz’s car for about three hours, with Doughty allegedly driving drunk.

I’m just shocked over the whole thing,” the woman said. \nAccording to the woman, someones else took Doughty in growing up because “he didn’t have the greatest of childhoods.” \n“He was a nice kid. I used to see him walking the dog all the time. He helped my dad a lot,” the woman said. \nThe neighborhood where the woman said Doughty lived is just up the road from Hailey’s Restaurant. That is the restaurant where Doughty allegedly carjacked Metz on Wednesday night. A wanted poster for Peabody murder suspect Wes Doughty.

The woman did not, however, know how Doughty and Greenlaw were connected. \n“I still can’t believe it. I’m saddened by the whole thing,” said Doughty. \n“I don’t think this ever would have happened if drugs weren’t involved.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:31:31.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
