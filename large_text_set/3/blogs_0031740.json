Gavin Newsom, bolstered by fellow Democratic voters, is maintaining his early lead in next year’s race to replace Gov. Jerry Brown as California governor, according to the Berkeley IGS Poll released Wednesday. Paul Sancya Associated Press file 1 of 2 i \nBy Christopher Cadelago \nA Republican newcomer now leads the pack of candidates trailing frontrunner Gavin Newsom in next year’s race for California governor, according to a new statewide poll Wednesday. \nAmong the five announced candidates, Newsom, who as lieutenant governor has been grooming himself for the top elected position, is out ahead with support from 28 percent of voters, the Berkeley IGS Poll found. Running behind him at 18 percent is John Cox, a Republican businessman from Rancho Santa Fe who announced his candidacy earlier this month. \nThe pair are followed by three Democrats: former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 11 percent, Treasurer John Chiang at 8 percent and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin at 3 percent. Nearly a third of voters remain undecided. \nReflecting a trend from previous public polls, Newsom – who has never trailed in the race to replace Gov. Jerry Brown – has gathered the largest share of Democratic voters. He continues to hold a considerable advantage with his party faithful, 40 percent to 15 percent for Villaraigosa, 11 percent for Chiang and 5 percent for Eastin. \n“That is what’s driving his lead,” Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said. “There’s no doubt about that.” \nThe two highest vote-getters in the June 2018 primary, regardless of party, will advance to the general election. Newsom’s history of yoking himself to liberal causes, including issues that elicit strong emotional responses, has kept him in the public’s consciousness. After leading a pair of fall ballot initiatives – to legalize recreational marijuana and strengthen gun control laws – he’s slowly ramped up his personal appearances with town hall-style events in San Diego and Hollister, in San Benito County. He also is backed by more than 4-in-10 Bay Area voters. \nCox, the lone Republican to formally declare his candidacy , is supported by 55 percent of GOP voters. Villaraigosa does best with Latinos, and Chiang fares well among non-Hispanic ethnic voting constituencies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:03:58.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
