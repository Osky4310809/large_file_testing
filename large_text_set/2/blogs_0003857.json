Any man can be sick; any man can get well; any man can even die, we are mortals. Anybody can die; anybody falls sick can also get well. \n“”Therefore, all those who peddle those evil, mischievous, malicious and malevolent rumours on social media need to have a rethink. Instead of all those evil wishes they should have goodwill towards the president,’’ he added. \nAdesina in an earlier statement disclosed that President Buhari had written the National Assembly, informing it of his desire to extend his leave in order to complete and receive the results of a series of tests recommended by his doctors. \n“The President had planned to return to Abuja this evening, but was advised to complete the test cycle before returning. The notice has since been dispatched to the Senate President, and Speaker, House of Representatives. \n“Mr. President expresses his sincere gratitude to Nigerians for their concern, prayers and kind wishes,” a statement earlier issued by Adesina on Sunday said. \nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that President Muhammadu Buhari left Abuja for the United Kingdom on Jan. 19 on a short leave, which is part of his annual vacation. \nThe President formally handed over mantle of leadership of the country to his Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.(NAN)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:34:14.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
