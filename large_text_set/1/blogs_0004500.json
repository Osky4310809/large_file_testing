And while she initially cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split, it looks like they’ve been able to work some things out. <img src=\"http://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/anthony-anderson-feat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"783\" height=\"440\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-745519\" /> According to <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/04/anthony-anderson-wife-dismisses-divorce/\"><i>TMZ</i></a><i>, </i>after over two years of separation, Stewart has dismissed their divorce proceedings.

Anthony and Alvina aren’t the only ones who’ve had a change of heart when it comes to their marriages. Here are some other couples who’ve called off their divorces.
