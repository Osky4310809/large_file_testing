Boyer's death is the first for the department since late 1970s.\n\"He was the best of the best,\" Piper said. \"He was a personal friend of mine for over 25 years.\"\nBoyer was fatally wounded around 8:30 a.m. in the area of Colima Road and Mar Vista Street in Whittier while responding to a traffic accident, the Sheriff's Department said in a news release. Another officer and the suspect were also injured in the shooting, sheriff's Lt. John Corina said at the news conference.\n\n\"It's extremely tragic,\" Corina said. \"You've got a couple officers who just responded to a traffic accident, and they think they're there to help out people involved in a traffic accident. Next thing they know, they got this guy shooting at them. He shoots both of them and kills one of them.\"\nCorina said the suspect, who is only being identified as a 26 year-old man, was allegedly driving a stolen car and may be involved in a killing that happened early Monday in East L.A.\nThe suspect is believed to have been released on parole within the past two weeks, though Corina did not know why he had been serving time.\nPiper had a strong message to the community of Whittier, surrounding areas and the state as a whole.\n\"We need to wake up. Enough is enough. You're passing these propositions, you're creating these laws that are raising crimes. It's not good for our communities and it's not good for our officers,\" Piper said. \"What you have today is an example of that. We need to pull our head out of the sand and realize what we are doing to our community and to our officer's who give their life like Officer Boyer did today.\"\nBoyer was a well-respected officer in the Whittier community, both personally and professionally.\n\"He was respected for his many years of experience and younger officers looked to him for advice and guidance,\" Piper said.\nBoyer is survived by his adult children, Piper said. He was in a band and played the drums.\nThe second officer injured, who was hired by Whittier police three years ago, was listed in stable condition, Corina said.\nThe suspect was also in stable condition.\nThe shooting remains under investigation, and anyone with information is asked to call the sheriff's Homicide Bureau at 323-890-5500.\nThose who would like provide a tip anonymously are asked to contact Crime Stoppers by dialing 800-222-8477, or by visiting the website http://lacrimestoppers.org .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:25:52.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
