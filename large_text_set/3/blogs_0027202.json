But, they said, the combined airline would adopt the popular “brand elements” of Virgin, such as the entertainment offerings, lighting and atmosphere. Alaska will also expand their airport lounges in several major hubs, including New York and Los Angeles.\nRichard Branson, who owned Virgin America before selling it to Alaska Airlines, wrote on his blog, “Many tears are shed today, this time over Alaska Airlines' decision to buy and now retire Virgin America .”\n“It has a very different business model,” Branson wrote, “and sadly, it could not find a way to maintain its own brand and that of Virgin America.”\nWhile Branson was sad, the internet was angry, with users lamenting what they deemed the loss of an innovative airline.\nDisappointed to see that @VirginAmerica will be absorbed by @AlaskaAir . No US airline comes close for customer service in my experience.\n— Andrew Walker (@AndrewNWalker) March 23, 2017 \nDear Virgin America, thank you for always making me and my service dog boyfriend feel welcome.\n— lauren (@lorengejuice) March 23, 2017 \n@AlaskaAir @VirginAmerica i don't understand this is not any part of Virgin. If Alaska wants customer they should keep the virgin brand.\n— Corbyn Kendrick (@corbynried) March 23, 2017 \nDear Virgin America,I am sorry to see you go. You were an exciting brand,which makes it frustrating to see you eaten up by a boring airline.\n— Marahuyo (@MarahuyoSF) March 23, 2017 \n\nAt least disappointed Virgin America customers will have about two years to say goodbye.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:36:35.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
