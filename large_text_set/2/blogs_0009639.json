aquaponic greenhouses produce fresh food while desalination centers produce fresh water. artisanopolis’ focus on growth and sustainability make it a viable solution for civilization on high waters while still providing the flexibility for architectural and social exploration. \nthe specific surface structure of the walls and ceiling was developed through extensive material researchimage © gabriel scheare, luke & lourdes crowley, and patrick white | roark 3d \nthe highly dense and extremely heavy engineered gypsum fiberboard panels reflect soundimage © gabriel scheare, luke & lourdes crowley, and patrick white | roark 3d \nafter nine and a half years of construction, the project is finally nearing completion image © gabriel scheare, luke & lourdes crowley, and patrick white | roark 3d \nrestaurants, cafés, bars, and a hotel are now open to the publicimage © gabriel scheare, luke & lourdes crowley, and patrick white | roark 3d \nvarious circulation routes connect the multi-storey schemeimage © gabriel scheare, luke & lourdes crowley, and patrick white | roark 3d \nviews from staircases help activate the interior space image © gabriel scheare, luke & lourdes crowley, and patrick white | roark 3d \nescalators lead visitors to the upper reaches of the buildingimage © gabriel scheare, luke & lourdes crowley, and patrick white | roark 3d \nstorm makes sense of shelterimage © simon nummy | atkins \n\n\ntied for first place with the artisanopolis team is the comparable proposal by simon nunny titled ‘storm makes sense of shelter’, inspired from a quote by french philosopher gaston bachelard . while the geometries that make up the modular platforms may be similar in nature, the overall scheme is quite different. the architectural aesthetic is relatively more homogeneous, as the structures are derived to be self-sufficient and energy producing mechanisms that simultaneously contribute to the city’s social fabric. all buildings are raised one story above the ground allowing for continuous public space and an extra component accounting for bad-weather conditions. \nviews from staircases help activate the interior space image © simon nummy | atkins \n\n\nthe external envelope of the structures defines the start of a spatial buffer between the exterior and interior facades helping to further insulate conditioned spaces against extreme weather. this buffer space, envisioned as a garden area, would produce food along with the various rooftop gardens, while solar halo’s above each building collect the sun’s energy. the architectural nodes, functioning as independent units could also be combined to host larger programs. the platforms are not fully floating but are instead loosely anchored to the ocean floor by fabric ocean pipes that form aqua tunnels fostering the growth of sea life from the rich seabed to the barren surface, over time creating large flexible reefs promoting oceanic biodiversity. \nviews from staircases help activate the interior space image © simon nummy | atkins \nviews from staircases help activate the interior space image © simon nummy | atkins \nviews from staircases help activate the interior space image © simon nummy | atkins \nviews from staircases help activate the interior space image © simon nummy | atkins \nviews from staircases help activate the interior space image © simon nummy | atkins", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:56:30.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
