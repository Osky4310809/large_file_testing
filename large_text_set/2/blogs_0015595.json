A week later, observers say the pair may have a third egg in newly built nest. By Paula Reed Ward / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nObservers watching the Hays bald eagles whose nest was destroyed in a storm Feb. 12 believe the female may have laid an egg in their newly constructed nest a couple hundred yards away. \nRachel Handel, spokeswoman for the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania, said that eagle watchers gathered on the bike trail that passes near the area saw the male and female exchange places sitting on the nest every couple of hours throughout today, with one of them remaining there at all times. \nIt is a “strong indication,” she said, there is an egg in the nest. Another sign to watch for, she said, is the eagles putting their beaks down into the bottom of the nest, as if they might be rolling an egg to ensure its temperature remains constant. \nBecause the camera that for years has streamed video of the eagles online no longer has a clear shot to the new nest, Ms. Handel said they will have to rely on old-school methods, like observing their behavior, to determine if there is an egg. That, she said, and wait for the 35-day incubation period. \n“It’s very exciting,” she said. “These are a very resilient pair of eagles.” \nThe female laid her first egg in the eagles’ old nest on Feb. 10. However, storms two days later destroyed the tree they’d been in for five years, Ms. Handel said. The eagles almost immediately began constructing a new nest in a nearby sycamore tree. \n“They, truly, never cease to amaze me with what they’re able to accomplish,” she said. \nPaula Reed Ward: pward@post-gazette.com, 412-263-2620 or on Twitter: @PaulaReedWard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:31:59.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
