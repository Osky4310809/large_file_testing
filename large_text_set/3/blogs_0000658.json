But an update was just made that could make them more effective — or at least much easier to use. \nLet’s take a closer look… What Are Lookalike Audiences? \nLookalike Audiences allow advertisers to create an audience of people similar to those already connected to their brand. For example… \nLet’s ay that you have an email list of the people who bought from you during the past year. You create a Custom Audience out of that list, resulting in 2,000 people you can target with Facebook ads. \nThat’s great, but you’re pretty limited with 2,000 people. Lookalikes help you leverage that group of people. \nWhen creating a Lookalike Audience based on the original source audience of those who bought from you, Facebook looks at the similarities between those in the original audience. They then search out others in the Facebook universe who are similar to those people. \nThe result: A much larger group of people to target who may not know your brand, but who may have similar interests. This essentially automates the process of selecting interests to target — an often confusing and overwhelming endeavor. The Problem With Old Lookalike Audiences \nLookalike Audiences are a good top-of-the-funnel targeting option, particularly for advertisers with small built-in audiences. But until now, the creation of Lookalike Audiences has been a painstaking and annoying process. \nThe reason for this is that Facebook limited you to creating a Lookalike Audience for one country at a time. So if you wanted to target people similar to those who bought from you in the United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and Spain, you’d need to create those five individual audiences and combine them in your targeting. \nThat’s messy. It took longer. And you ended up with way too many audiences. \nThis also led advertisers to focusing only on a few countries rather than checking off a longer list of 10-20 or more. Update to Lookalike Audiences \nThankfully, Facebook made a long-awaited update to Lookalike Audiences. Let’s go through that new process. \nFirst, go to your Audiences page in your Ads Manager and click to create an audience. Then select “Lookalike Audience.” \nSelect a source audience to model the Lookalike Audience on. This is typically a Custom Audience of some sort or a Facebook page audience. \nNothing new yet. Until now… \nRecall that previously you could only select one country per Lookalike Audience. Annoying. But now there’s a “Browse” link at the far right which brings up menus for countries and regions. \nExpand “Countries” and a beautiful thing happens: Groups of countries appear. \nSo you can create a Lookalike Audience for all countries within these groups, for example: Africa Oceania South America \nYou could select one or multiple groups to create a Lookalike Audience that includes all of the countries within them. Or you can expand those groups to pick and choose which countries you want to include… \nOr you could expand “Regions” to get options for free trade areas, app store regions, and emerging markets. \nFree trade areas groups countries into the following: European Economic Area (EEA) North American Free Trade Agreement ASEAN Free Trade Area Commonwealth of Independent States Free Trade Area \nHover over any of the groups to see which countries are within them. \nApp store regions could be a great opportunity for anyone looking to promote their app. Choose from iTunes App Store Countries, Android Paid Store Countries, or Android Free Store Countries. \nThe final option is emerging markets, which could be a source of cheaper clicks. \nNote that another recent Facebook change makes this all possible: There is no longer a minimum number of people required in a source country to create a Lookalike Audience based on it. \nIn other words, you could have 100% of your source audience in the United States, but you could still create a Lookalike Audience in Australia, Spain or Cambodia. Try It! \nAs I’ve said many times before, I would never recommend you target Lookalike Audiences as your primary audience to target, especially for conversions. But new companies may have no choice. \nLong-term, Lookalike Audiences are good for top-of-the-funnel actions (reading helpful blog posts or watching videos), and you can then build Custom Audiences based on these engagements (that you, of course, can use for promoting opt-ins and products). \nSince I recently started a track for entrepreneurs , I’ve had to start experimenting with Lookalike Audiences again. While I have a large built-in audience, I don’t know how many of them are entrepreneurs. So I am experimenting with Lookalike Audiences and interests to drive traffic while I build my Website Custom Audiences of traffic on blog posts that I wrote for entrepreneurs. \nHave you started experimenting with this yet? What do you think? \n  196 SHARES Filed Under: Facebook Marketing Tutorials Tagged With: Facebook Ads How To , Facebook Advertising , Facebook Lookalike Audiences   Waqar Azeem \nHi Jon, \nThanks for this informative post. It was a huge pain in the a$$ to create lookalike audiences for multiple countries. One had to do the same process over and over again. But this update will make the process much smoother now. \nLately, Facebook has stepped-up their ads manager and released some awesome features such as rules for adsets, A/B split-testing and such. It’s becoming more powerful without using any 3rd party apps. What’s your take on it? \nI have it in one ad account I manage but not others. Any idea why and do you have an ETA for global availability? Rami Djeffal \nUnfortunally , still don’t have it, however I have a question about the other recent update: Facebook suggest that you need at least 100 people from one country in your custom audiences and it does not matter if it is the country -or countries- that you are creating the lookalike audience for, do you mean by the update that we are no longer in need of those 100 people from one country?? \nYes, I use Lookalike Audience for diverse Facebook pages I manage…love them and they are cheaper mos of the time. Chapter House \nthanks, jon. i’m really liking your site and all the great info. i have a rather simple (?) question. i use boosted posts occasionally and i get lots and lots of likes. is there any way to capture/ capitalize on those likes? Kim K. \nToo bad, I don’t have that option (yet). Still don’t have the A/B split testing feature either. Jedrix Villa \nThanks Jon for providing superb information for us! I started without any audience two videos and one click link campaigns for PPE and videos views objectives and targeting with duplicates two different targeting for three days. \nAs you well know video trump the pic ad, my question is if you recommend me to retarget those again with another video or ad using LAA by video consumption or PPE data or continue tapping into different audiences? • Thorough, LIVE 90-minute webinar • Q&A at the end • Primary reasons ads succeed or fail • Occurs on near-monthly basis", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T19:23:24.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
