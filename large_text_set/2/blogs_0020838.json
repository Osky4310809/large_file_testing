I hope to one day become a public interest lawyer and defend the poor and other communities marginalized by society. \nAlthough D.C. is my home now, Alabama still crosses my mind. She's like an old lover you never truly get over, one that you would be with if things had turned out differently. \nMy roots in Alabama are deep and intertwined. I was born and raised in a working-class family in the small rural town of Chickasaw, just outside the port city of Mobile. My family has lived in Alabama, and Mobile specifically, for the past five generations. I am the first person to have considered leaving the Yellowhammer state. \nFrom a young age I was taught to take pride in my Alabama identity and heritage. Alabamaians had Southern hospitality. We would welcome a stranger into our homes and cook them a home style meal, and when they left, we'd tell 'em: 'y'all come back now, ya hear?'. \nNortherners, on the other hand, were rude and busy people. A New Yorker carrying a brief case would knock you over during rush hour and not stop to check to see if you were okay. \nBut as I got older, I realized that Alabama wasn't what she seemed. Alabama only welcomes in those who are like her and kicks out those who aren't. When I came out as bisexual and an atheist, Alabama disowned me. \nAlabama touts family values, but the state spent hundreds of thousands of tax dollars to prevent same-sex couples from marrying and adopting children into loving homes. \nAlabama touts loving one's neighbor, but the state passed one of the harshest anti-immigrant bills that would have criminalized giving shelter or a ride to undocumented immigrants. \nAlabama touts limited government, but the state seeks to deny women the ability to control their own bodies without government interference. \nWhile I was in Alabama, I fought for a more just and equal state. I served on the Board of Directors of the ACLU of Alabama defending our constitutional liberties. I founded my own organization, Mobile Equality, dedicated to advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Alabamaians. I volunteered for Planned Parenthood and helped escort Alabama women to and from the clinic to protect their safety. \nI call upon those still in Alabama to challenge the state government---and fellow Alabamaians---to live up to its own ideals. To practice what it preaches. You can love Alabama and still criticize it. You can stay and make it a place that welcomes all and one that everyone can be proud of. \nAs for me, well, I'm still healing from a broken heart.
