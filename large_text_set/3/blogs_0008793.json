Bob Casey hosts the first town hall of his reelection campaign at the Univ. of Penn. March12, 2017. The Democrat is up for re-election in 2018 and is only the second senator or congressman from our area to host a town hall meeting since Trump's election. TOM GRALISH / Staff Photographer Will Bunch Daily News Columnist Will Bunch has worked at the Daily News for 20-plus years and is now senior writer. Since 2005, he’s written the uber-opinionated, fair-but-dangerously unbalanced opinion blog \"Attytood,\" covering a range of topics (but mostly politics and the media these days); it’s been named best blog in the state by the Associated Press Managing Editors and best blog in the city by Philadelphia Magazine. He’s also authored three full-length books and three Amazon Kindle Single e-books, including 2015’s The Bern Identity: A Search for Bernie Sanders and the New American Dream. Prior to coming to Philadelphia, he worked at New York Newsday, where he was part of a team that won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for spot news reporting. \nre gigs. \nholding aloft signs that read simply, \"AGREE.\" \nCasey's first town hall anywhere in Pennsylvania in more than five years . But given the reputation won by the heir to the Scranton-based Pennsylvania political dynasty -- as a centrist too bland to excite liberals or to anger conservatives -- it previously would have been doubtful that anyone would have showed up. Now, hundreds trekked through wind chills in the teens to hear the state's senior senator, and most were progressives wanting to show appreciation for Casey's unexpectedly stalwart opposition to Trump. \n\"We want him to fight like hell to keep the affordable health care, to keep EPA -- I mean, what's going to happen to the climate and the water and the air without EPA?\" \nrecently described as Woke Bob Casey -- with a relentless and occasionally acerbic anti-Trump presence on social media? \nthe two-term senator has relentless criticized and hectored the new president and his team over everything from Team Trump's ties to Russia to cutting billionaires' taxes while \"decimating\" health care. When Trump's new Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt questioned the conventional science on whether carbon dioxide is a pollutant, Casey and his young and energetic social-media team, tweeted, \"We should probably leave this to, you know, actual scientists, but since you asked. Yes, it is.\" But the senator has also opposed Trump irl (in real life), voting against his controversial Cabinet nominees and expressing wariness on Sunday about Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch, whom he accused of favoring corporations over workers. \nwho's been under fire for weeks from the activist group Tuesdays with Toomey for failing to have such a gathering . Keeping in the spirit of the political subtweet, Toomey's name wasn't mentioned Sunday. \nraced to the airport in his tuxedo and white tie to protest Trump's initial travel ban and negotiate for the freedom of detained migrants. \nCasey is also a staunch supporter of funding for Planned Parenthood , a point he again drove home to loud applause on Sunday. \nthe contentious town halls that some GOP lawmakers have held this winter , many of which devolved into shouting matches over health care reform or Trump's fitness for the White House. \nwas oddly one-sided. The only tension came when Casey -- asked about banning fracking to support clean energy -- said \"I think we can do both\" and got a smattering of boos from the left-leaning crowd. \none possible rival, U.S. Rep. Pat Meehan, has already begged off the race . Looking further on down the road, there's even the fleeting thought that with Pennsylvania and particularly Casey's native Scranton so critical for 2020, the Democrats might eye him for the ticket -- kind of a Tim Kaine with less dramatic eyebrows.
