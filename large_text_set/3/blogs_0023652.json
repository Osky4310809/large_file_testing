She campaigned mainly on her much-touted strength as a capable longtime public administrator, having worked in the Hong Kong government ever since she graduated from college in 1980.\nShe received more than double the votes of John Tsang , her main rival. Tsang, Leung’s former Financial Secretary until last December, received 365 votes from the election committee. His support largely came from electors belonging to the pro-democracy camp, many of whom described him as the “lesser evil” among the slate of candidates.\nWhile Tsang was far more popular with the people in Hong Kong during the campaign, the result comes with little surprise, in part because Lam was seen as the candidate blessed by Beijing. Public polling conducted throughout the two-month period of the election consistently found that, although the people of Hong Kong preferred Tsang, they thought Lam would be the likely victor. (A third candidate, former justice Woo Kwok-hing, got 21 votes, far fewer than either Lam or Tsang.)\nOutside the waterfront-facing Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where members of the election committee had cast their ballots for two hours earlier that morning, protestors rallied against the decision and the fact that they did not have any votes in this election. In protest of their disenfranchisement, a local artist invited everyday Hong Kongers to stream their Sunday morning routine on Facebook under the hashtag #1194only — in reference to the number of people who could cast a ballot.\nInside the hall, loud cheers erupted from the public gallery shortly after 12:30 p.m. local time once local TV stations projected the victor. Appearing to be somewhat coordinated, the crowd, consisting largely of middle-aged or older people, unfurled congratulatory signs and both the Chinese and Hong Kong flags as they celebrated. “Mrs Lam, I support you,” one sign reads. Applause and cheers came from the crowd again as the returning officer confirmed the election results.\nMany, however, appeared far more cagey when approached for comment, shaking their heads or telling TIME that they were unwilling to talk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T09:00:21.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
