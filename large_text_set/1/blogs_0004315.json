Enter the Asus ZenFone AR.\nThe Asus ZenFone AR focuses on the ever-popular VR trend, while subsequently making use of Google’s Tango and Daydream software. The phone’s processor, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, is also specifically designed to handle such a hefty workload.\nAsus’ new smartphone is just the second device ever to include Google Tango, a 3D-mapping technology. Tango takes advantage of a set of three different cameras to enable motion tracking, depth, and room mapping, thus detecting how far the phone is from a wall, the distance between two points, or where it’s located inside a building.\nIn addition to Tango, the ZenFone AR features Google Daydream, allowing users to quickly convert the phone into a VR machine.\nAsus also claims that the ZenFone has the highest resolution mobile camera sensor on the rear, thus combining four native 23-megapixel photos to create a single image, which they are ultimately calling a 92-megapixel “super resolution” photo. According to Asus, such a photo boasts four times the clarity and less noise than a standard HD photo.\nFor now, Asus has yet to reveal price details for the ZenFone AR, but expect a release to take place in Q2 of this year.\n\n\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:14:47.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
