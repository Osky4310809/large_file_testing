My dad would have six tickets and there'd be eight of us in front of him. We'd all run through the turnstile and he'd give the six tickets and we all scamper away — just to get into the gymnasium. \n“It's not really an arena; it's a gymnasium. Then the smell of it, the smells of great basketball, of great history.” \nMORE COLLEGE BASKETBALL USA TODAY Sports' bracketology: 10 (or more) ACC teams could go dancing \nThe Cathedral of College Basketball needs little introduction, but it will receive due fanfare as it celebrates its 90th anniversary Tuesday night when Penn hosts Princeton. \nOn Tuesday, popcorn will cost 90 cents and student tickets will cost 55 cents — their original price when the Palestra opened Jan. 1, 1927 as one of the world’s largest arenas. Ten thousand fans attended the first game, then the largest crowd to watch a basketball game on the East Coast. \nOther historical venues — Hinkle Fieldhouse, Cameron Indoor Stadium and Phog Allen Fieldhouse — were soon built, borrowing design aspects from the Palestra as they prepared to write their own basketball history. Crowd sizes have evolved in the years that followed, and many arenas nationwide have grown, changed and been remodeled. Some of the most pivotal NCAA tournament games now take place in football stadiums. \nThe sight lines are ridiculous. You can yell at the referee from wherever you're at, and you feel like he hears you,\" Penn coach Steve Donahue says. (Photo: Derik Hamilton, USA TODAY Sports) \nBut the trend toward raised floors, dome ceilings and bad sight lines has had at least one side effect: It’s helped fans appreciate the intimate settings even more than they already did. And nothing quite matches up with the charm of the Palestra. \nPenn coach Steve Donahue, who also grew up in Philly, remembers going to Big Five doubleheaders as a kid alongside his father. \n“It wasn’t just one home team, so there was the uniqueness of having a couple teams going at it and the fans on opposite sides of the stands cheering and going crazy,” Donahue said. “Back then there were noisemakers allowed, so Saint Joe's had the drum, and Penn had the cowbell, and then the streamers — we were allowed to throw streamers after each first basket. I was just like, ‘Wow. This, this is unbelievable.’ … All of that stuff just made for incredible tradition.” \nThose heated Big Five rivalries still play out to this day, though no longer always at the Palestra. \nDonahue has been to Cameron and Allen Fieldhouse. He’s coached all over, but he said nothing compares to the intimacy of Palestra, which is a strange word to use when considering that capacity is almost 9,000. \n“It’s funny, you can look into the last row and see the person's face when you're coaching,” he said. “To me, fans have a direct impact on this game because of the intimacy of it and the loudness of it. … The most fun there is, is just being a spectator. The sight lines are ridiculous. You can yell at the referee from wherever you're at, and you feel like he hears you.” \nBecause of those renowned doubleheaders and the age of the structure, the Palestra has hosted more college basketball games than any other arena in the country. \nThe floor has felt the feet of the greats — Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Oscar Robertson all played there as members of visiting teams in the same year. Kobe Bryant and LeBron James played there as high schoolers. \nBanners of the Philadelphia Big 5 hang in the rafters at the Palestra.

At least seven or so NBA teams practice at the Palestra each season, Donahue said, just because they have a coach on staff who’s never been and wants to share it with his players. Donahue remembers, when he was an assistant at Penn, that North Carolina coach Roy Williams scheduled a game against the Quakers just so he could coach at the Palestra for the first time. \nHall of Fame coach Tom Izzo wanted to come, too, calling the experience a “bucket-list item.” Chambers, because of what he termed “the mystique of the Palestra” and the fact that he has six Philadelphia kids on his current Penn State team, decided to move a home game out of State College during winter break and play Michigan State at the Palestra instead. \nThe two teams played there on Jan. 7. The Nittany Lions won 72-63. \n“To be able to play in that atmosphere and give my kids that experience, give them that memory that they'll be able to cherish for a lifetime, it became a very, very easy and simple decision to say, ‘We have to do this,’ ” Chambers said. \nIt was much less a choice than an obligation — which is similar to the way most people who love the Palestra talk about the almost-magnetic pull they feel to the building. \nJack Scheuer, a sportswriter who covered games at the Palestra for the Associated Press for more than four decades, estimates he’s covered at least a thousand games at the arena. He’s played in plenty more; his legendary Wednesday afternoon four-on-four half-court media pick-up games began in the mid-1970s and continued weekly. Scheuer played until two years ago — he continued into his 80s — until knee problems forced him to stop. \n“It’s a great trivia question: Who has scored the most points at the Palestra? Me,” Scheuer said. “It’s all these games of half-court.” \nHe chuckled. \n“It’s been my home away from home for years,” he said, “and I still get a little chill walking down the ramp.” \nThe Palestra has hosted so many of the greats over the years — Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Oscar Robertson all played there as members of visiting teams in the same year. Kobe Bryant and LeBron James played there as high schoolers.
