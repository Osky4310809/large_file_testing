Last weekend, autobot lovers were thrilled when a new trailer for Michael Bay ’s final Transformers flick dropped during the Kid’s Choice Awards on Nickelodeon. And, now, it seems like another full trailer is just around the corner. According to a report from Trailer Tracks , a brand-new trailer for Transformers: The Last Knight will make its debut this week - just don’t expect it to drop online. \nIn a recent update, the site announced that the Transformers flick would air a new trailer ahead of Disney’s Beauty and the Beast when it premieres. Paramount Pictures is said to have partnered with Deluxe Digital Cinema for the occasion, and the footage has already been sent to North American theaters. \nHowever, it doesn’t look like the trailer will feature entirely new footage. The cut itself will be different, but Trailer Tracks has heard the new video is an extended version of the Kid’s Choice Awards trailer. And, at this point, there is no guarantee that Paramount will release the trailer online either before or after its theatrical debut. Previously, other family-friendly trailers for projects like Star Trek Into Darkness were intended to be theater-exclusives. But, if reception goes well, then Paramount would be amiss to keep the trailer sequestered in theaters for long. \nMore Transformers: The Last Knight: Trailer / Did We See Unicron? / Will We See Primus? \nTransformers: The Last Knight shatters the core myths of the Transformers franchise, and redefines what it means to be a hero. Humans and Transformers are at war, Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving our future lies buried in the secrets of the past, in the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Saving our world falls upon the shoulders of an unlikely alliance: Cade Yeager (Wahlberg); Bumblebee; an English Lord (Hopkins); and an Oxford Professor (Haddock). \nThe cast of Transformers: The Last Knight features Mark Wahlberg ( Planet of the Apes ) as Cade Yeager, Isabela Moner ( 100 Things To Do Before High School ) as Izabella, Josh Duhamel ( Life as We Know It ) as Lieutenant Colonel William Lennox, John Turturro ( The Big Lebowski ) as Seymour Simmons, and Tyrese Gibson ( Furious 7 ) as Robert Epps, as well as Jerrod Carmichael ( Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising ), Anthony Hopkins ( Thor: The Dark World ). The voice cast includes Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime and John Goodman ( 10 Cloverfield Lane ) as Hound.

Heroes will become villains. Only one world will survive: theirs, or ours. \nMichael Bay will return to direct. Transformers: The Last Knight opens in theaters on June 23, 2017.
