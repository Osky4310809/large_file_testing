Reynolds, on the other hand, doesn’t fare too well. People seem to think that he’s missing a tooth, and ask if he’s mean.\nHowever, the most important thing we learn is that Ryan Reynolds has also never heard Migos’s “Bad and Boujee.” Gyllenhaal previously got some heat for not knowing the song, after cameras caught him looking very confused during Donald Glover’s Golden Globes shout out .\nReynolds, however, takes it one step further. He confuses the group’s name with the song title, referring to “Bad and Boujee” as “the Atlanta band.” Watch the full video above.\nIn other movies news, you can now watch the first five brutal minutes of Ghost in the Shell .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T12:58:01.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
