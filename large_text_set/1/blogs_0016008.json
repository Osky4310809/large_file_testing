All the world will be watching as Trump is sworn in to the stylings of 3 Doors Down and associated acts. Advertisement \nIt’s a painful moment for those who enjoyed The Hunger Games series but never envisioned it becoming their own reality. The timing couldn’t be worse, considering just this week, NOAA and NASA confirmed 2016 was the hottest year on record for the third year in a row—in case you forgot, Donald Trump has adamantly denied the existence of climate change, calling it “very expensive,” “bullshit,” and a “hoax.” He points to winter as proof that everyone smarter than him is wrong. \nDespite overwhelming evidence that climate change is real—and that people play a critical role in catalyzing it—our President-elect, a failed reality star, has refused to listen to literal scientists. Before he takes office, let’s take a look back at some of the most terribly misguided statements he’s made about global warming. 10. “A total, and very expensive, hoax!” \nGlobal warming is no hoax at all, according to the thousands of Earth scientists who are studying it. And if Trump thinks moving off fossil fuels is going to be expensive, he should take a look at the staggering cost of doing nothing. 9. “Global warming HOAXSTERS” \nWhile global warming and global climate change are often used interchangeably, scientists prefer the latter term today because it encompasses the broad range of environmental shifts taking place. There is no shadow cabal paying scientists to trick people. 8. “Our planet is freezing” \n👏 Weather 👏 does 👏 not 👏equal 👏climate! 👏 7. “Big fat dose of global warming” \nAgain, this phenomenon is called winter. 6. “Snowing & freezing in NYC” \nAgain, winter. It’s a thing. 5. “They don’t believe it $$$$!” \nI know Trump’s not a fan of paying taxes , but I’d like to think the rest of us would chip in if it meant “saving the planet.” 4. “very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit” \nShow me on the maps where the record low temps are. 3. “I am tired of hearing this nonsense” \nCounterpoint: more than half of Americans live in counties with unhealthy levels of particle pollution and ozone. 2. Not from Trump himself, but who could forget this gem from The Guardian in November 2016: \nBob Walker, a senior Trump campaign adviser, said there was no need for NASA to do what he has previously described as “politically correct environmental monitoring.” 1.
