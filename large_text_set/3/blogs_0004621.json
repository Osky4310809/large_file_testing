Seeing Jackman, he says, made him realize that Logan would be a powerful send off for his character as well. Stewart had played the role of Professor X for just as long, and with James McAvoy there to carry the torch it would be an emotional but understandable end. He, James Corden, Rupert Grint, and Dan Stevens attempt to recreate the hand-hold, with questionable results.\nNever say never, though, as the burst of energy Stewart gets when Deadpool is mentioned suggests that he’s not quite ready to say goodbye. Even more hopeful is when Stevens jumps in with an offer and mentions Legion , as his mutant character David is the son of Charles Xavier. Stewart responds, “Absolutely! 100%!”\nWhat do you think, are you rooting for Stewart to return and maybe make a Legion appearance?\n(image via screencap)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
