Louis van Gaal's final act as a football manager was lifting the FA Cup before being sacked by Man United (Photo: Man Utd/Getty) \n“When they have put you on a stage with your head on the block, my head was in a noose for six months. \n“Under those circumstances I was expected to inspire those United players every day. Going to the absolute climax of the FA Cup Final, ending with ten men and having to score to win In extra-time. Having gone through all that, and then walking away with the trophy, was incredible for me. \n“I’ve had lots of offers since including millions from China. They are prepared to pay a fortune.” \nAsked if it was true the Chinese had offered Van Gaal £45 million over three years, he said: “Yes, they want to pay that sort of money and I could have gone but I have a lovely pay-off from Manchester United. \nThey still pay my wages every month and that is a nice sum.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:29:15.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
