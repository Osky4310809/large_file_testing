My purpose was not to do that. The game is hard. \n\"I can talk about my situation. I jumped straight up, he jumps in for me. Ibrahimovic is adamant there was no malice in this clash with Mings...

He jumps into me and jumps into my elbow — nothing on purpose and hopefully he’s not injured. \n“It had nothing to do with the situation before because I didn’t even know who had stepped on me. It’s the game. I’m not a player who will stand here and blame a player. What happens on the field stays on the field.” \nFor his part, Mings insisted neither player deserves to be hit with a violent conduct charge. \n“It was a good battle,” said the 23-year-old. “I haven’t seen it back, but you know exactly what you’re going to get against him. He’s a big physical player and if he says he didn’t mean it [the elbow], then he didn’t mean it. That’s fine. \n“I jumped over someone else, I think, and then if I caught him, I caught him.
