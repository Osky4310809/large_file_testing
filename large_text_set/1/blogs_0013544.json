This is how the Times has presented. Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) \nAnd here is the Guardian’s overnight follow-up story. Donald Trump's first UK post-election interview: Brexit a 'great thing' Read more \nGove has been giving interviews this morning and, on the Today programme, he firmed up the line that Trump wants to negotiate a trade deal with the UK quickly. The president-elect wanted a deal that would be “signature ready” by 2019, when the UK is due to leave the EU, Gove said. (The UK cannot sign one while it is still a member.) Gove said: \nJudging from both the interview and also from the conversation that we had off the record, he wants to see Theresa May as quickly as possible, he wants to invite her to the White House as quickly as possible, and then lay the groundwork for a deal. \nMy understanding - I have to stress I’m no expert in trade negotiations - is that we have to wait until Britain has concluded its divorce from the European Union before we can sign any new deal. But I think the president-elect wants to have something signature ready at the earliest possible opportunity, and I think there are two reasons for that. Firstly, he sees real economic benefits for both Britain and America in forging this deal. The other things is that he feels a certain, what’s the word, sympathy for Britain as a result of our decision to leave the European Union . \nI will post more from Gove’s interview soon. Meanwhile, here is a Guardian summary of what Trump said in the interview. And here is a story about Trump criticising Angela Merkel’s refugee policy. \nMay is due to deliver her big speech on Brexit tomorrow, but we’ve got a Number 10 lobby briefing at 11am, and so we should get some reaction to Trump then. Otherwise, the diary is relatively empty. \nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time.
