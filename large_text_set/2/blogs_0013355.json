Many of my cousins have died in that process or have been jailed,” protester Rim Woldeslassie said. “I understand in a country like that they’re not able to protest like we are today. So I am happy that I am able to do that here and not be persecuted because of it.” \nMinneapolis police estimate about 800 people marched Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:05:38.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
