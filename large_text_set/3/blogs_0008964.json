The group officially announced The Ruin Daily , which should open very soon at 328 N. Jefferson St. in the West Loop, according to a news release. They’ve brought in Revival collaborator Mindy Segal from Hot Chocolate in Bucktown to consult with her morning pastry recipes. Chef Gabino “Bino” Ottoman, a 16” On Center vet who worked revamping the menu at the group’s Saint Lou’s Assembly (located only five minutes away), is in charge of the sandwiches. There should be a diverse sandwich lineup of at least 10 which will rotate. Sample items include a Tasso ham and cheese with cheddar, shredded lettuce, sliced pickles and rosemary truffle Dijonnaise in between an Italian baguette. There’s also a Buffalo blue cauliflower with roasted cauliflower, blue cheese dressing, shredded lettuce and celery on a sesame challah bun. This deli will also serve booze with 16” On Center’s usual creative cocktails. Happy hour charcuterie will be served. Also, expect a coffee program similar to the variety of roasters featured at Revival. Breakfast, featuring Segal’s baked goods, will start at 7 a.m. The cafe will only be open on weekdays, capitalizing on work-week commuters. The name is kind of a tribute to President Martin Van Buren. The media would blast the eighth U.S. president for his economic policies by using the nickname “Martin Van Ruin.” Expect more on The Ruin Daily in the coming days.
