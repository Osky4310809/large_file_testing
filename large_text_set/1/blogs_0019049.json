In the space of a few days, he has swung from being against a border adjustment, to possibly being for it, and now today confirming that \"we are going to impose a major border tax.\" Yen, Peso, and Loonie are all sliding further on the headline. \nSpecifically, as the clips below show, Trump promised business leaders a \"very major\" border tax and said he would cut regulations by 75%. Trump held a breakfast meeting with the business leaders he named to an advisory panel on manufacturing, led by Andrew Liveris, chief executive officer of Dow Chemical Co. Other business leaders at the morning meeting with Trump included Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Inc.; Jeff Fettig, chairman and CEO of Whirlpool Corp.; Mark Fields, president and CEO of Ford Motor Co.; and Marillyn Hewson,chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin Corp. \nLater in the day, Trump will meet with a group of labor leaders and U.S. workers, according to his public schedule. In between, he’ll sign executive orders related to trade and labor issues, an administration official said. The official didn’t provide further detail on the orders. \"We want to make our products here,\" Mr. Trump says at meeting with business executives; adds focus will be on manufacturing in U.S. pic.twitter.com/pDJwEcjqqI \n— CBS News (@CBSNews) January 23, 2017 \nTrump says he is going to cut taxes massively for middle class and companies Mr. Trump says he plans to cut taxes and regulation during meeting with business executives.
