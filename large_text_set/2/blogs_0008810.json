Whilst other White House sources claimed that \"the knives are out\" for the retired general. \nMr Flynn, who was previously forced to resign as the head of Defense Intelligence Agency, stands accused of discussing the lifting of sanctions on Moscow with the Russian ambassador in Washington before Mr Trump had taken office, in an act which may be illegal. \nThe White House previously said that he had contacted the ambassador in December for a Christmas greeting, but this account was challenged by recordings of the conversation by an intelligence agency. \nThe NSC has traditionally brought together the expertise from intelligence world, the state department and defence agencies, advising the president on everything from counter-terrorism and foreign policy to nuclear deterrence. \nBut in the first three weeks of the new office, professional staffers have found themselves largely shut out of the West Wing, with decisions being made without adhering to the normal protocol for developing strategy. \nSources who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, told The Telegraph they worried that the White House's impatience with bureaucracy was part of a wider disregard for the institutions that underlie a functioning democracy.

Civil servants are said spend their time trying to discern his policy priorities from his tweets. \nThe policy papers that do reach the president's desk have reportedly been shortened from the three to six page reports preferred by Mr Obama to a single page with lots of graphics. An aide is quoted as saying that \" the president likes maps\" . \nSimilar concerns have been voiced by staffers at other departments. Sources at the state department say their research papers, even on matters as complex and critical as the fight against Isil in Iraq and Syria are going largely disregarded.
