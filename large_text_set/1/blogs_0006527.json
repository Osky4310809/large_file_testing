Hiruzen gave them a bell test for the team's first exercise, during which Jiraiya repeatedly fell for Hiruzen's tricks, and for failing to acquire a bell, he was tied to a stump as punishment. Hiruzen encouraged Jiraiya to be more like Orochimaru, but Jiraiya countered that his Transparent Escape Technique was a fair testament to his skills, as he could spy on bathing women without getting caught: Hiruzen offered to accompany him to see if this was true. [8] Jiraiya had a certain interest in Tsunade from their first meeting, [9] and when her breasts developed, she became a frequent target of his peepings. She nearly killed him when she caught him on one occasion, forcing to be more discrete about his interests. [10] Jiraiya and his students. \nJiraiya at some point discovered Mount Myōboku , the residence of the toads ; in the anime, he was brought there when he tried to summon a toad without first having a contract with them. [11] Fukasaku trained Jiraiya in their ways, most prominently senjutsu . While he was at Mount Myōboku, the Great Toad Sage made a prediction about Jiraiya: that he would travel the world and during that time meet the Child of the Prophecy , a student who would grow up to either save or destroy the world depending upon how Jiraiya taught them. [12] When he returned to Konoha and began training a team of his own, Jiraiya started to suspect that one student, Minato Namikaze , might be the Child of the Prophecy because of his natural genius. [13] As such, he took Minato as his disciple and taught him many of his skills; Minato would eventually teach Jiraiya the same . Hanzō dubs the Sannin. \nAlthough their team under Hiruzen's leadership had disbanded, Jiraiya, Orochimaru, and Tsunade continued fighting together during the Second Shinobi World War . During one such fight in Amegakure , they were the only three to survive an encounter with Hanzō , for which accomplishment Hanzō dubbed them Konoha's \"Legendary Sannin \". [14] After the battle, three war orphans approached them and asked to be taught ninjutsu . Jiraiya, guilty for his involvement in the war, decided to stay in Ame for a time in order to look after them. [15] Shortly after he joined them, he discovered that one of the orphans, Nagato , possessed the Rinnegan , once used by the Sage of the Six Paths to save the world. Jiraiya decided that Nagato was the Child of the Prophecy, and as such agreed to teach the orphans ninjutsu so that he might guide Nagato towards the world's salvation. [16] \nNagato was a kind child, torn between his desire to not hurt others and his wish to protect Yahiko and Konan . Jiraiya comforted Nagato that it was enough to want to protect people one holds to be important, as the world is plagued with seemingly endless conflict. Nagato decided that it was possible to end the constant bloodshed and, though he didn't know how, that he would someday find the path to peace. Jiraiya was inspired by Nagato's words and started writing what would become The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi . After three years of training the orphans, Jiraiya decided they were ready to forge out on their own and he returned to Konoha; he left them a finished copy of Gutsy Shinobi , dedicated to Nagato. [17] News of the orphans' deeds would reach him from time to time, but eventually he heard that they'd all died. [15] \nGutsy Shinobi did not sell well when it was released. Minato - selected as Konoha's Fourth Hokage after Jiraiya refused the position [18] - enjoyed the book, finding the main character very much like Jiraiya. He decided to name his and Kushina Uzumaki 's then-unborn son \" Naruto \" after the main character, hoping that their Naruto would be just as determined as the character (and thus its author). Jiraiya tried to convince them not to since that would make him Naruto's godfather, but Minato and Kushina insisted this was a good thing. [19] Minato died during the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack , giving his life to seal the Nine-Tails into the newborn Naruto; as one of his last acts, Minato sent Jiraiya Gerotora , on whose stomach he wrote the key to Naruto's seal. Jiraiya guessed that Minato wanted him to help Naruto gain control of the Nine-Tails' power, though he couldn't guess what that power would be needed for. [20] \nAlthough Orochimaru had always been his better, someone that Hiruzen pointed to as an example for Jiraiya to live up to, Jiraiya considered Orochimaru to be one of his closest friends. For this reason, when Orochimaru eventually defected from Konoha, Jiraiya pursued him and tried to convince him to return. Orochimaru refused and attacked Jiraiya in order to secure his escape. For a time, Jiraiya tried to find a deeper meaning in Orochimaru's betrayal, something that, if changed, would bring Orochimaru back. He could ultimately come up with nothing. [21] From that point onward, Jiraiya started following Orochimaru's movements as well as those of Akatsuki , an organisation which Orochimaru eventually joined. His investigations often took him away from the village, preventing Jiraiya from becoming Fifth Hokage like Hiruzen wanted him to. Personality Edit Jiraiya posing. \nJiraiya was generally light-hearted and gregarious, making jokes at his own expense and giving a mirthful laugh about it afterwards. In his interactions with others, he liked to pretend to be smug or selfish, upsetting them so that he could further rile them up with his humour. [9] Even when entering combat he did not miss an opportunity to be flashy and over-the-top, striking kabuki poses and giving dramatic self-introductions; these intros were often interrupted in some way, and Jiraiya was quick to express his annoyance at whoever was responsible. Friends and foes alike were fond of Jiraiya for his eccentricities, admiring that somebody so seemingly irreverent could in actuality be an extremely competent shinobi: he was deeply loyal to Konoha despite how often he is away from it, not hesitating to threaten to kill Tsunade if she betrayed the village, despite their long history. Jiraiya felt that his personality quirks render him incapable of being Hokage, as he either lacked the responsibility for the position or he had, through his past infractions and failures, proven unworthy of such an honour. \nJiraiya was a self-proclaimed super-pervert with no equal. [22] His favourite hobby was spying on women while they bathe, a passion he flaunted openly and in fact took pride in because of how infrequently he was caught. Despite this, Jiraiya disliked it when Naruto Uzumaki referred to him as the \"Perverted Hermit\" ( エロ仙人 , Ero-sennin , English TV: Pervy Sage) in front of others. With the \"research\" from his peepings, Jiraiya wrote a series of adult novels called Icha Icha . The novels were based on his personal experiences in love - particularly his rejections by Tsunade - retold in a comical way. The books were wildly popular, giving his chequebook a balance that is \"filled with zeroes\"; this fact did not stop him from taking Naruto's money when he got the chance and spending it on alcohol and women. In the anime, Naruto ghost-writes an Icha Icha book without anybody noticing, suggesting that either Naruto can write like an adult, or that Jiraiya's writing abilities were no better than a child's. Tsunade suspected it was the latter, as she notes that a report Jiraiya wrote when he was younger was poorly written and accompanied by crude crayon illustrations. Jiraiya's perverted nature. \nJiraiya's perversion has backfired on him a number of times. When he first meets Naruto, he has no interest in training him. Naruto convinces him to change his mind by using the Sexy Technique , which Jiraiya so strongly approves of that he asks Naruto to continue to use it for the duration of their training. Itachi Uchiha and Kisame of Akatsuki later hypnotise an attractive woman to lure Jiraiya away from Naruto so that they can try to capture him; though it works at first, Jiraiya quickly realises that women aren't usually attracted to him, allowing him to return to Naruto in time to rescue him. When he was younger, he spied on Tsunade while she was bathing and, when she caught him, she broke both of his arms, six of his ribs, and ruptured a number of organs as punishment. Ever since, he's used greater discretion in expressing his interests in Tsunade, careful to make his advances come off only as playful. Jiraiya considers his inability to win Tsunade's heart to be one of the greatest failures of his life. \nJiraiya in fact regreted a number of things in his life. He believed the world was plagued with violence and long wanted to find a way of bring peace to it, but was never been able to come up with a way to do so. He never had children of his own, for which reason he thought of Minato Namikaze as his son and, by extension, thought of Naruto as his grandson. Jiraiya stated simply that to be happy was not his fate; [18] Tsunade doubted he believed his own words. He did, however, have great faith in the next generation, Naruto in particular, believing that Naruto would be able to create and enjoy the world that Jiraiya could only dream of. When he dies, Jiraiya decided that, despite his numerous failures, the successes of his time with Naruto made everything worthwhile. Appearance Edit Jiraiya's full appearance. \nJiraiya was a rather tall man in adulthood with fair skin. He had a wart on the left side of his nose and waist-length, spiky white hair that he usually ties back into a pony tail, with two shoulder-length bangs framing his face. There were red lines under his eyes which extended further down his face as he got older, going all the way to the bottom by the time he was an adult. His usual attire consisted of a green short shirt kimono and matching pants, under which he wore mesh armour that is visible at his wrists and ankles. He also wore hand guards, a black belt, traditional Japanese wooden sandals , and a red haori with two yellow circles on each side. He often carried a large scroll on his back, and had a tattoo on his left palm, and he wore a horned forehead protector with the kanji for \"oil\" ( 油 , abura ), which denoted his affiliation with Mount Myōboku . Abilities Edit Jiraiya attacks Pain with one of his strongest techniques. \nLike his fellow students of the Third Hokage , Jiraiya is an exceptionally talented shinobi. It wasn't until the Second Shinobi World War that their skills became widely known; dubbed by Hanzō as the Sannin , the strongest of their generation. He was offered the position of Hokage three times, [23] [18] and would have been offered it a fourth time had he lived longer. [24] Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki of Akatsuki prefer to avoid a fight with Jiraiya as Itachi estimating that both he and Kisame would be killed, even with more aid. [25] [26] During his long career as a ninja, Jiraiya has had only two near-death experiences, once by fellow Sannin, Tsunade , and once by Naruto Uzumaki in a Nine-Tails ' version 2 form [27] (though both came from people he cares for with the latter he focused more on containing rather than defeating). Though he finally dies against Nagato , Nagato believes Jiraiya would have won had he known the secret of the Six Paths of Pain ; [28] , which Tobi feels is a major testament to the Sannin's abilities. [29] Chakra and Physical Prowess Edit \nJiraiya has chakra reserves large enough to summon Gamabunta and chakra potent enough to use senjutsu . The manga shows little of his physical prowess other than being able to fling Naruto several metres with a single finger tap. [30] In the anime, he is shown lifting and throwing large boulders [11] as well as kicking away some of the Giant Multi-Headed Dogs . Ninjutsu Edit Jiraiya spewing oil. \nJiraiya is famous as the \"Toad Sage\" ( 蝦蟇仙人 , Gama Sennin ) because of his affinity for the toads of Mount Myōboku . This affinity most commonly manifests as summoning toads, either to fight alongside him in battle or simply summoning a toad's œsophagus to coat the area and restrict any movements within that area. Other toad-based skills include spitting oil from his mouth , hiding himself within a target's shadow to control their actions undetected, or using toads to infiltrate sensitive areas . Jiraiya erecting a dome around himself. \nJiraiya is well-versed in fūinjutsu , as he deduces the workings of Naruto's Eight Trigrams Sealing Style within moments of seeing the seal's design. He also quickly notices the seal is being restricted , and as such removes the restriction. He can create seals for others that they can use to suppress the chakra of those who have been applied with Jiraiya's seal . He also displays a certain skill for barrier ninjutsu , erecting barriers to either detect all movements within a wide radius or toad-themed barriers for him to take shelter in. Jiraiya defending himself with his hair. \nJiraiya's natures include Fire , Earth , Water , and Wind , as well as Yin and Yang Release . [4] He most often uses fire, typically to ignite his own or one of his toad's oil. With Earth Release: Swamp of the Underworld , he can create a swamp beneath a target to trap them. [31] He is able to grow and manipulate his hair, either to bind and destroy targets or to surround him as a defense , injuring any who try to contact him. Minato Namikaze taught him the Rasengan - the highest form of shape transformation - but Jiraiya is most proud of his Transparent Escape Technique , which he uses to spy on women while they bathe. Senjutsu Edit Jiraiya in Sage Mode. \nJiraiya was taught how to use senjutsu by Fukasaku , which he can use to increase his speed, durability, and physical strength. [32] He can also use it to empower his other ninjutsu , such as the Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan . Before he can gain these benefits, Jiraiya must enter Sage Mode , which he does not have mastery of. This causes his Sage Mode form to make him more toad-like in appearance, such as warts and webbed hands and feet; although his frog-like legs enable him to jump better, he dislikes the overall appearance because he believes women will find it unattractive. Using Sage Mode requires his supply of natural energy be constantly replenished, something that is difficult to do while in combat. For this reason, Jiraiya summons Fukasaku and Shima and fuses them to his body , having them gather natural energy for him. As an added bonus, Fukasaku and Shima can combine attacks with Jiraiya's, as with the Sage Art: Goemon , or they can perform justu that he can't, as with genjutsu . [31] Intelligence Edit \nDespite what his personality might suggest, Jiraiya is actually very shrewd in the field. His specialty is intelligence gathering, having a spy network that runs throughout the Five Great Shinobi Countries that he can use to gain information about a particular person or group to be used to his or his allies' advantage. In combat, this translates to a keen perceptiveness; Jiraiya observes all of the opponents' various actions, forms a theory about the how and why, and uses that theory to try and capitalise in the battle. [33] His memory is apparently very good, as he, while dying, is able to craft a coded message using the page numbers of Icha Icha Tactics , with the first word on each page serving as his message.
