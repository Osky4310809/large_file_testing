Hey, at least we die happy. \nKFC Singapore just announced the (un)holy fusion of pizza and fried chicken: The KFC Chizza. Swapping out the unnecessary dough crust with a fried chicken fillet base (low carbs!), the creation is heaped with pizza toppings like cheese, slices of turkey ham and what seems to be pineapple. Just like KFC's infamous Double Down (aka the Destroyer of Worlds), you don't need to waste your time and chewing efforts with bread, son. All killer, no f*ckin' filler. \n\"Do we really need this?\" you may ask. We will fire back with, \"That's a rude question — it's absolutely mandatory\". Just look at it. Just look. Bow down to your new delicious deity. Photo: KFC / Facebook \nBut as with all fast food ads, the item IRL almost always turns out to be depressingly disappointing. Though the Chizza only just appeared in Singapore, KFC's new greasy monstrosity already made landfall in other parts of Asia such as Taiwan, India, Japan and the Philippines. Reviews were mixed though — some said it's made of pure awesome ness ; others expressed a simple \"meh\" ; but all agreed that you need to eat it piping hot because it becomes real doughy once the Chizza gets cold .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:28:45.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
