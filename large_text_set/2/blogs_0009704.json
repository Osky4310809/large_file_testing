This involves turning off the main power supply to the Interchange. \nThere are currently no Metrolink services running between Manchester Victoria and Bury Interchange. Metrolink tickets will be accepted on the 135 and 98 bus services. \nAll bus services running to and from Bury Interchange will continue to run, but will start and stop outside the Interchange until around 8am. \nFirst’s services will terminate and leave from outside the Town Hall and Rosso’s services will terminate and leave from Moss Street. \nThe Travelshop is unable to sell tickets, so passengers are advised to allow more time for their journey. TfGM staff are on hand to advise passengers. From 8am there should be enough daylight to safely start and finish all bus journeys in the Interchange. 07:27 Bus station closed due to health and safety reasons \nThe bus station in Bury has also been closed this morning. It is not yet known yet if it is linked to the tram problem. 07:26 No trams between Bury and Manchester Victoria \nManchester Metrolink have tweeted: “Due to a points issue at Bury, we currently have no services operating between Bury & Victoria. We have ticket acceptance on the 59 98 & 135. \n“Bury line passengers: Ticket are being accepted on the 59, 97, 98, and 135 bus services.” Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:36:05.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
