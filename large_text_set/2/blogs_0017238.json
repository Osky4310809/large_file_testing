They may be right. Torres just turned 20 in December. He played all last season in Class A, and most of it in the Low-A South Atlantic League. As excited as the New York Yankees are about the super-talented kid they got from the Chicago Cubs in last July’s Aroldis Chapman trade, general manager Brian Cashman made clear back in November that Torres will start the 2017 season at Double-A Trenton. \"Next year he’ll start at Trenton and get introduced to the cold weather of the Eastern League in April for the first time,\" Cashman told reporters, including George A. King III of the New York Post . \"He’ll be ready whenever he’s ready. I’m not currently thinking about his timeline. Once he has extensive success at Double–A level, you can start doing that. He hasn’t taken that step yet.\" Notice, Cashman said only that Torres will start the season at Trenton, not that he will end it there. There’s no need for the Yankees to push and no need for them to promise. But if 2017 goes the way for Torres that 2016 did, why wouldn’t he be ending the season in New York? The kid is special, and he has already shown he can handle assignments that others his age aren’t ready for. Torres was the youngest player in the Arizona Fall League in 2016. He was also the youngest player ever to win the AFL batting title and the youngest to be named the AFL’s Most Valuable Player. \"Just keep him challenged,\" a scout told me in November, when I first wrote about Torres for Bleacher Report . There’s a challenge for Torres this spring, even with the early announcement that he’ll begin the season in Double-A. With starting shortstop Didi Gregorius leaving to play for the Netherlands in the World Baseball Classic, there will be innings and at-bats that normally wouldn’t be available to a kid who isn’t supposed to make the team. Torres is most advanced as a hitter, as shown by his league-leading .403 average in the Arizona Fall League. Matt Rourke/Associated Press There will be chances for Torres to make an impression, something he has already proven he can do. Check out the headlines in the New York newspapers just from the opening week of spring training. \"Gleyber Torres is dazzling Yankees camp,\" said the Post . \"Yankees prospect Gleyber Torres 'can be the star' everyone’s talking about,\" said the Daily News . \"Yankees’ Gleyber Torres turning heads at spring training,\" said NJ.com . In Dan Martin’s story in the Post , Yankees infield coach Joe Espada talks about Torres’ maturity and how he has already proven he can deal with quick advancement. \"If he gets to New York, he’ll be able to handle what goes on there,\" Espada told Martin. \"He already knows how to deal with a lot of expectations at a young age.\" Espada also addressed the other Torres issue, the one about where he plays. Not where as in what city and what level, but where on the infield. While Torres has played all but one game in his minor league career at shortstop (he made one start at second base last season), scouts have been divided on whether he’ll end up there in the majors. In my story in November, one scout described Torres as \"erratic\" defensively and suggested he’ll eventually move to second base or third base. Espada told Martin he believes Torres should stay at short for now but agreed he could eventually move. It makes sense for the Yankees to have him ready to play other positions. Gregorius just turned 27 and is coming off the best year of his career. The Yankees figure to have a more immediate need at second (where Starlin Castro is the starter) or third base (where Chase Headley returns). Headley has two years to go on the four-year, $52 million contract he signed after the 2014 season. But the Yankees talked about trading him over the winter. They’ve already shown they won’t let veterans with contracts stand in the way of kids with talent. The Yankees brought Torres (left, with Clint Frazier) to New York for their Winter Warm-Up. Kathy Willens/Associated Press Last August, Gary Sanchez became the Yankees catcher, and Brian McCann became a part-timer behind the plate who saw more at-bats as a designated hitter. When the season was over, the Yankees traded McCann to the Houston Astros . There’s no need yet for them to move anyone out of the way for Torres. They’ll get a chance this spring to see how Torres does against some major league pitching (at least the spring training variety). They’ll see starting in April how he handles the big step to Double-A. They won’t be disappointed if he takes another year to get to New York. Torres will be 21 when he goes to spring training in 2018. That’s still young for a major league rookie. Only three players under 21 saw time in the majors in 2016: Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Julio Urias, Kansas City Royals infielder Raul Mondesi and Texas Rangers outfielder Nomar Mazara. Baseball history, though, tells you the best players can move fast and compete when they’re young. Torres’ history tells you he can handle playing against others who are older. He’ll get a chance this spring. He’ll get a chance in Trenton. Later this year, he could very well get a chance in New York.
