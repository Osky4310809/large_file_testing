He's not the first artist to do something of this sort; last year, The Weeknd and Meek Mill have also deleted every post on their accounts before dropping new projects. The Freebandz general's latest releases, \"That's A Check\" and \"Buy Love,\" arrived in the form of visuals and have yet to be available on iTunes or other services; Future's last solo project is last February's EVOL album. While no further details regarding a new release is currently available, frequent collaborator Zaytoven had announced last year that Future has finished the follow-up to their 2015 Beast Mode mixtape.
