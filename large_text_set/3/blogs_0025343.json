It’s no surprise since dating online leads to many new relationships. In fact, 1/3 of US Married couples met online ! \nStill, the options can be overwhelming. While popular choices are a safe bet for their huge user base, smaller sites offer starting off with more common ground. Overall, consider each option with an open-mind because even if some of these dating sites have only 200,000 users, you’re only trying to find one. 1. Plenty of Fish – The Cream of the Crop \nTrue to its name, POF (as users calls it) has more users than any free dating site, and the fourth most of any dating site out there. There are over 40,000,000 “fish” to be caught. Like most free sites, you can purchase some additional features, such as seeing whether other users read your messages, but for the most part, you’re getting the full package free. \nPOF.com was one of the first dating websites and because of this, they have had time to develop and refine their matchmaking system. They make some big guarantees: \nIf you are in contact with 100 different singles, 50% of the time your future partner is in the top 10, and 17% of the time we can pick the exact person you will end up dating. \nPOF is an easy first choice, but it’s not the only one! 2. OkCupid – A Worthy Second Place \nYou can do most things on OKCupid for free, but like POF, there are perks available to “A-List” members, OKC’s term for premium users. While it has about an eighth the user base of POF, clocking in at around 8 million, OKCupid is generally a lot of fun as it matchmakes using user-generated questions and quizzes, allowing users to determine how compatible their match might be with them. \nOn top of that. OKC has a Tindr like feature that allows one to rapidly rate other users, and if you and someone else rate each other highly, then OKC will let you know. It’s a good time and not quite the craziness that POF is. Plus, the App is considered one of the best out there. 3. Tastebuds.fm – The Unique Twist \nTastebuds.fm is much smaller than the first two sites, but you have to give it credit for originality: despite its user base of only 200,000 users, Tastebuds is about meeting people through music. If going to concerts, listening to music, or playing an instrument is your thing, then tastebuds.fm is the right place to find like-minded people. \nThe site also has Pandora-like music suggestions and can be a great way to discover platonic “concert-buddies.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:16:53.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
