(Photo credit SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) \nBOSTON (CBS) – In the wake of Friday’s GOP healthcare debacle, the blame game is in full swing, and that’s a good thing. \nThe only way to avoid repeating bad mistakes is to learn from them, and when there’s a screw up of this magnitude, a key part of the learning process is determining who screwed up and why. \nAnd there’s plenty of blame to go around, not just for the implosion of the Republican plan, but for the ongoing problems with Obamacare it was allegedly aimed at fixing. \nThen-President Obama and the Democrats made a big mistake back in 2009-2010 when they forced through a far-too-sweeping bill on a straight party line vote, ensuring that there would be huge, politically-devastating problems. Incredibly, Speaker Ryan and President Trump repeated the exact same blunders. \nRyan and his crony in the White House, Health Secretary Tom Price, deserve special blame for being clueless ideologues with no sense of how badly their ideas would bomb with the public. They could have offered phased-in, carefully tailored fixes to Obamacare’s more-glaring problems; instead, they served up a hot mess of think-tank fantasies about the free market fixing everything. \nAnd if you voted for Trump because you believed he had the skill to deliver on his vague campaign rhetoric, you were duped. \nThey say we get the leadership we deserve. \nIf true, maybe the blame game ought to extend to the voters who put these folks in power, as well. \nListen to Jon’s commentary: Jon Keller Follow Follow Jon on Twitter E-Mail Jon Keller Jon Keller is WBZ-TV News' Political Analyst, and his \"Keller At Large\" reports on a wide range of topics are regularly featured during WBZ-TV News at 6PM and 11PM.
