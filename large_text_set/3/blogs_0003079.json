If you want to strengthen your core, you need to think bigger. Your core includes all the muscles in your torso, from your shoulders down to your hips. And it does a lot more than help you sit up. Why a Weak Core Is a Liability \nThis weekend I took a TRX class. Most of the moves require you to keep your core steady while you grab the suspension trainer ’s straps with your hands, and do some kind of pushing or pulling motion. It’s an amazing full-body workout. But there was a guy at the end of my row who was there for the first time, and either couldn’t keep his core steady, or didn’t know how. His back would sag when he was supposed to be in a pushup position, or he would turn a row into a crunch. As a result, he wasn’t getting the most out of the exercises. Advertisement \nA strong core is important for runners and swimmers, too. Your body twists with every footstep or every stroke, so you need to keep your torso steady and strong. In fact, since your core is connected to your arms and legs, controlling your core helps to pull your arm through the water or stabilize your leg on the ground. Without a strong core, you can’t swim or run your best. \nWhen I played roller derby, a strong core was essential to delivering a powerful hit. To shove someone with your shoulder, your body needs to be solid all the way from the floor to the point of impact—so that includes your legs and torso. If you go for a hip check instead, you might think you don’t have to worry about anything above your hips. But without strong, engaged core muscles, your upper body will flop around on impact, throwing you off balance. Advertisement \nEven if you aren’t body-checking people for a hobby, a strong core is important for everyday life. With it, you can move couches and shovel snow without hurting your back. You can easily push open the heaviest doors. You can carry an angry child out of the museum gift shop while they flop around in your arms like a giant, dying fish. (Ask me how I know.) \nOn the flip side, without a strong core your time in the gym won’t pay off nearly as well. You’ll do crappy pushups. You’ll do crappy deadlifts. You’ll have bad posture. As you get older, you’ll have a harder time getting out of bed or up from the toilet. You’ll be more prone to falls . The stronger you are now, the better off you’ll be throughout your life. What Your Core Actually Is Shoulder muscles usually don’t count, but slmost everything else here does. \nA lot of us conflate our “core” with that six-pack-shaped muscle in the front of our belly, called the rectus abdominis . And yes, you can feel that muscle tightening when you do crunches. But how does that train us for real life? Bending forward is just not something we need to do with a lot of force. But when the rectus abdominis teams up with all the other muscles of the core, it helps to hold our body steady in all kinds of positions. Sponsored \nThat’s why planks are better than crunches: done properly, a plank works all of your core muscles at once (plus your arms and legs too, for good measure). Each muscle is contracting, providing resistance for another muscle. The end result is a rock solid core. It’s the same situation as in many of our examples above, where you need to hold steady against some kind of outside pressure, whether that’s a hip check or a flailing child or a heavy door. \nBut there are far more ways to work your core than the old standbys of the plank and crunch. Let’s take a look at what muscles we’re really trying to target: Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:19:10.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
