Renee C. Byer The Sacramento Bee Thunder possible in Sacramento; chance of brief tornado to the south. National Weather Service 1 of 2 i \nBy Bill Lindelof \nThe wet weather of winter 2016-17 continued into the spring as the Sacramento area absorbed plenty of rain overnight and big downpours of precipitation Tuesday as a storm front marched through the area. \nA line of thunderstorms moving through Sacramento produced a half an inch of at Sacramento’s Executive Airport in less than 30 minutes, according to the National Weather Service. That brings the 24-hour total at the airport to 1.29 inches. \nThe morning thunderstorms delivered a lot of rain in a short time. Between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., about three-quarters of an inch was recorded in Sacramento and 0.87 in Arden Arcade, according to the online readings from the California-Nevada River Forecast Center. \nHowever, other spots did not receive much rain, such is the hit-or-miss localized nature of thunderstorms. \nUnofficial 24-four hour rainfall amounts as of 11 a.m. Tuesday: Sacramento, 1.42 inches, Rio Linda, 0.87, Rocklin, 0.63, Auburn, 1.14, Folsom Lake, 0.55, Rancho Cordova, 0.63 and Elk Grove, 0.43. \nIt was about time that some rain fell in March. Less than a quarter of an inch had fallen in Sacramento the first 20 days of the month. \nNormally, 3 inches of rain falls in Sacramento during March, so even with last night’s off-and-on showers, much more is needed to get to the monthly average. NWS forecasters say that more precipitation is on the way. \nThe season’s rainfall total as of midnight Monday for Sacramento stands at 28.11 inches, which is 167 percent of normal. \nAnd for those in the Stockton and Modesto areas watch out for this: A brief tornado or two cannot be ruled out for the northern San Joaquin Valley. \nLooking ahead, figure on showers most days in Sacramento except for Thursday when skies are expected to be mostly sunny. As for the mountains, the snow level on Tuesday is expected to start at the 7,500-feet elevation level but dive around midday,when cooler air begins to make it into the northern Sierra. \nIf a weekend ski or snowboarding trip is planned, the weather service warns that travel could be affected by perhaps a half-foot of snow over Donner Pass or Echo Summit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:10:57.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
