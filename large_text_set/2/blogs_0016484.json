To get started, customers scan their smartphones upon entering the store. Amazon’s proprietary technology is described to detect when products are removed from or returned to shelves. A smartphone app keeps track of the virtual shopping cart, and when the customer is done, he or she can simply walk out of the store with the groceries--without having to line up at a checkout counter--and the corresponding Amazon.com account is charged.\nBut the lack of human interaction in that scenario seemingly raises questions if Amazon will be selling liquor products. According to Recode, Amazon will have staff on the store floor to check identification and verify buyers are over the age of 21.\n\nAmazon Go isn't the first brick-and-mortar project for the primarily online retail, entertainment, and cloud services company.
