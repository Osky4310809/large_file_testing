But Snow undoubtedly felt the pressure from above after Jon Ledecky and Scott Malkin took the reins as majority owners this past summer.\nWith the team at 17-17-8 and in last place in Eastern Conference following a season in which it won a playoff series for the first time in 23 years, Snow surprisingly said a decision had been made prior to this announcement that Capuano was not going to be the coach next season.\n“At the end of the day, organizationally, I don’t think Jack was probably going to be a coach we were going to bring back,” Snow said on a conference call. “At this time, to name Dougie Weight interim head coach, we can start a coaching search now and not have to worry about the ramifications of trying to do that with Jack as head coach.”\nSo it rang incredibly hollow when Snow dropped the cliche about how Capuano “is an excellent coach.” Snow callously added: “When you’re a coach in this league, sometimes you’re a victim of different circumstances.”\nRight, so if all that’s true, there was no way Capuano was going to be the coach next season?\nGarth Snow Getty Images Either way, the circumstances Capuano were put in this season were created by Snow. The GM spent this past summer watching as stalwarts Kyle Okposo, Frans Nielsen and Matt Martin signed elsewhere, and attempted to replace them with a bloated contract for winger Andrew Ladd and the addition of veteran winger Jason Chimera.\nOf course salary-cap constraints played large parts in all those decisions, but both new signees have been integral reasons for the Isles’ failure. Capuano knew it, and he also implied there was nothing he could do about taking them out of the lineup.\n“That’s a management decision, too,” Capuano had said after a brutal 2-1 loss to the Panthers on Wednesday.\nBut Snow didn’t want to say the decision to make Capuano the scapegoat was his alone, or one that came down the pike from ownership.\n“This is an organizational decision, it’s not a dictatorship,” Snow said. “It’s not one person waking up one day and making a decision. There’s lots of dialogue, all through the organization when big decisions are made.”\nSnow would not rule out the idea that the team could hire a full-time head coach before the end of this season. He then went on rambling about how they were still trying to win games this season to “put us in a position to get into the playoffs.” Overall, it was a disjointed message, but at least Snow managed to take some of the blame himself.\n“I don’t think there is a player on our roster that I haven’t had a hand in either drafting, picking up off waivers, a trade, free-agent signing — same with the staff, whether it’s trainers, coaches, scouts,” Snow said. “So obviously [I’m] not hiding from the fact that it starts with me.”\nCapuano did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but did add his thanks to the organization in a statement released by the team.\nCapuano, John Tavares and Snow upon naming Tavares captain in 2013 Getty Images “It’s an honor to have served this historic franchise and its passionate fans,” he said.\nCapuano was the fourth-longest-tenured coach in the league, and leaves second on the Islanders’ all-time list in both games coached (482) and wins (227), behind only Hall of Famer Al Arbour. Along with captain John Tavares, he ushered the franchise from a full rebuilding into one that made the playoffs three of the previous four seasons.\nCapuano’s appointment after the team fired Scott Gordon was the most recent time the Islanders have had a real shakeup. Meanwhile, Snow has been the GM since 2006, when he retired from being a backup goalie and was immediately given a management job by now-minority owner, Charles Wang.\nThe team plays in one of the NHL’s least desirable venues in Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, and Tavares, the superlative captain, is set to be an unrestricted free agent after next season. If he leaves, all is lost.\nFor now, Snow showed his highly honed skill of avoiding a direct answer when asked how he feels about his own job security.\n“I don’t even worry about that,” he said.\nHe might want to start.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:34:32.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
