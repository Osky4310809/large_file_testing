And so with Liverpool having mastered the difficult end of things, it shouldn't be that hard for them to now figure out how to do the easy part. If only it were that simple. \nKlopp has been in charge for 18 months now and Liverpool are just as erratic as ever when it comes to performances and results against teams in the bottom half. His team scares the likes of Arsene Wenger, Antonio Conte and Pep Guardiola far more than it does Sean Dyche, Eddie Howe and David Moyes. That's both encouraging and infuriating at the same time. \nGuardiola was overjoyed at how his team performed in Sunday's draw and went as far as to describe it as \"one of the proudest days of my coaching career.\" But is a home draw with Liverpool really that much to shout about? After all, Craig Shakespeare, Paul Clement, Marco Silva, Paul Lambert and Claude Puel (twice) have all gone one better than that in 2017 by actually beating Klopp's team. Even Moyes managed a draw against Liverpool this year. \nThe Reds are a complete contradiction. They represent the toughest of tests for the best teams but can often be a soft touch for the worst ones. That doesn't bode well for the remainder of the season as all of their nine remaining fixtures are ones that they will be expected to win, games in which Liverpool are often at their most vulnerable. \nIt's a well-worn maxim that you don't win league titles against the best teams; you win them by picking up points against everybody else. You do, however, win the Champions League by beating the best and if Liverpool can secure a place in the top four, they could certainly make some waves around Europe next season. \nKlopp's team look far more suited to taking on the likes of Barcelona and Bayern Munich than they do Bournemouth and Burnley. The better the opponent, the better Liverpool play. If the Premier League were reduced to just 10 teams, Liverpool would probably win it. They would have won the Europa League last season but for a second half implosion against Sevilla in the final. The Merseysiders led 1-0 at half time and looked to be well on their way to lifting the trophy until it all went wrong after the break. \nLiverpool has remained inconsistent under Jurgen Klopp's guidance. \nAs the eighth-best team in the Premier League at the time, though, they really had no right to have even gotten that far. They were far from impressive in the group stages against lesser opposition but when the knockout games came around against a higher calibre of opponent, they dispatched Manchester United, Borussia Dortmund and Villarreal. They also really ought to have led by more than one goal at half-time against Sevilla, such was their superiority. \nIn their current guise, Liverpool appear to have little chance of ever winning the Premier League title but they would be a team that the best teams around Europe would ideally want to avoid, just as they were in the heyday of Rafa Benitez between 2005-2008. The worry for supporters is whether this team can beat enough of the lesser teams between now and May to give themselves a chance to play those big European teams again. \nIf they were to secure qualification, then Liverpool could thrive in the Champions League next season, assuming they got out of the group stages. The good news is they wouldn't be seeded so they would avoid some of those pesky smaller sides and jump straight in with the big hitters. \nIf only the Premier League were like that. \nDave Usher is one of ESPN FC's Liverpool bloggers.
