Putting 'America First,' Trump said to plan lighter foreign travel than predecessors The day of events was slated to include talks, a news conference, and a working lunch. The same itinerary will occur on Friday, Spicer told reporters at the White House. According to aides and analysts, Trump's meeting with Merkel is the most important sit-down with a foreign leader since the Republican businessman took office in January. The pair have much to discuss, including Russia, trade and NATO. Trump is also expected to raise Merkel's stance on refugees, which he harshly criticized on the campaign trail.
