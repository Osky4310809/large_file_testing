As a leader of the Civil Rights movement, he has been arrested, beaten, and disparaged numerous times for over half a century. In fact, he tells the story himself in a graphic novel series called March . \nThe three-volume edition is currently the top-selling book on Amazon . It saw a 106,700% increase in sales after Trump said that Lewis is “all talk.” According to Think Progress , Amazon is also sold out of his biography , Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement. \nThat’s the Trump effect for you, but this time, instead of spiking the traffic at a conservative website, he just sold a bunch of books about civil rights. \n[image: screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
