Check these out Shares \nUpdate: In order to keep our list in line with our refreshed computer buying guide methodology, we’ve updated our list complete with a new order based on a combination of star ratings and awards. \nIf only for a moment, forget keyboards and mice, CPUs and graphics cards and everything else in between. For audiophiles, a worthy pair of cans make the difference between guessing where enemies are and hunting them down like a sonically-enhanced ninja. \nWithout the best gaming headset, you’re depriving yourself of full-on immersion from every angle – after all, who says you need VR for 360-degree fun? Pick the right pair of headphones outfitted with a clear quality mic and you’ll immediately notice a difference in the way you experience games. \nWhether you need a USB or 3.5mm headset, a surround sound or stereo pair, or simply one to communicate with friends online, we've picked out the very best PC gaming headsets for your needs. \nThough we haven’t had the chance to fully review every headset on this list, rest assured that each has been tested comprehensively prior to its consideration. 1. Astro A50 Wireless \nThe best all-round headset just got better \nInterface: Wireless | Features: Dolby Digital 7.1 Surround Sound; Works with PS4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS3, PC, and mobile; Astro Audio; 5.8GHz wireless tech with MixAmp; 6.0mm uni-directional noise cancelling mic; USB charging with base station Full-bodied Dolby 7.1 Surround sound Supremely comfortable Finnicky charging cradle \nWe called the original Astro A50 a \"game-changing, experience-enhancing headset\", and thankfully its wireless successor follows the \"ain't broke, don't fix\" rule. Astro's latest headset does what it says on the tin and adds wireless connectivity to an already stellar package. Though not the cheapest headset on the block, the Astro A50 Wireless has transferred amp controls from its predecessor's cable right into the headcups themselves, giving you the ability to balance in-game audio and voice chat on-the-fly. \nAdd to that the A50's solid aluminum construction, effective noise-cancelling microphone, booming bass and impressive mid-range sounds, and you have one headset that's ready to rock on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. It's also suitable for using with the HTC Vive and other VR headsets thanks to the accommodating shape of the headband. We've found that few headsets can rival the A50's comfort's plush ear cups, which are large enough to give you a realistic sense of sound coming from all directions. 2. SteelSeries Siberia 840 \nA fantastic all-rounder that's hugely comfortable \nInterface: Wireless or wired | Features: Closed back earcups, Dolby virtual 7.1 surround sound, Retractable directional mic with mute indicating light, Two hot-swappable Li-Ion batteries, Sound share audio recording, Click wheel, Memory-foam ear cushions, Works with Xbox 360, PS3/4, PC/Mac, Apple TV/Roku, Home entertainment and mobile devices Dolby 7.1 surround sound Comfortable Pricey \nSometimes you're prepared to pay a premium for a PC gaming accessory that does the lot, and in the headset category that's the Siberia 840. Following on from the already impressive Siberia 800 (and the H Wireless before that from 2014), the upgraded Sibera 840 now works with Bluetooth and is lag-free within games. It also supports SteelSeries Engine 3 - a gorgeous and user-friendly app that lets you manage and tweak every element of the Siberia 840 – from profiles to equalizer settings and what to show on the OLED display on the side of the accompanying base unit. \nAll of that is, of course, secondary to the Siberia 840's sound qualities which are nothing less than sublime. Activating Dolby 7.1 surround sound is like dropping you into the game. Enemies' footsteps can be picked out across a room including behind you, leading to some heart-in-mouth moments in shooters like DOOM. 3. Asus ROG Centurion 7.1 \n10 drivers, 7.1 channels and one impeccable headset \nInterface: Wired (USB) | Features: 10-driver 7.1 surround sound, dual-USB amplifier, Sonic Software compatibility, HDMI passthrough, amplifier with audio profile and channel volume controls, unidirectional microphone Excellent spatial sound Can only be used with its amp Heavy and bulky \nWho cares about style when it comes to gaming headsets? Certainly not Asus. Neglecting all the unwritten rules of fashion, the ROG Centurion 7.1 is a spectacle to behold, both for its garish looks and unruly knack for omitting crystal clear sound waves. It may be a living hellscape to set up, requiring that a pair of USB cables be connected to an amplifier at all times, but that’s not to say it doesn’t offer plenty of room for expansion. \nIn fact, the Asus ROG Centurion 7.1 not only bolsters full-fledged surround sound passthrough for an external set of speakers, but the onboard amp controls grant you complete control over the audio profiles and channel volumes being outputted. You can even take advantage of Asus’s own Sonic Studio software package, which gives you even more dominance over the headset’s functions. There’s a steep learning curve, but for those who don’t mind, this headset is a mighty surround sound offering. \nRead the full review: Asus ROG Centurion 7.1 headset 4. V-MODA Crossfade Wireless \nStylish with powerful bass-driven tones \nInterface: Wireless or wired (USB) | Features: Bluetooth connectivity, built-in microphone (Boom Microphone available for gamers), Lithium-ion battery with up to 12 hours of continuous music, Dual-diaphragm 50mm driver, Metal construction with leather, Military-level MID-STD-810 tested Huge, eardrum-filling sound Divisive design Don't fold \nIf you're more interested in the sounds coming out of your gaming headset, rather than glowing LEDs, macro keys and other nonessential extras, then the V-MODA Crossfade Wireless is the headset for you. These stylish cans are a treat for the ears, emitting booming sound that's bass-heavy with fantastically crisp treble at the other end. Whether you're being rocked by explosions in Battlefield or can hear the roar of the crowd in Fifa, they bring games to life and are equally suited to listening to music; You'll be able to pick out parts of your favorite tracks that you never previously thought existed. \nStepping out of the soundscape for a moment, the V-MODA Crossfade Wireless feature comfortable memory foam ear cups that don't irritate the ears even after hours of use, and you'll get around 12 hours out of its battery life when connected via Bluetooth. This headset's rugged build quality, funky travel case and optional USB connectivity add up to make it one of the best headsets on the market. \nRead the full review: V-MODA Crossfade Wireless 5. Turtle Beach 350 Stealth VR \nThe best gaming headset for virtual reality \nInterface: Wired (3.5mm) | Features: Battery-powered amplification (30 hours on a single charge), Variable bass boost, Full-range audio, Mic monitoring, Removable noise-cancelling microphone, Ergonomic VR design. Swappable cable system Ergonomic design suits VR headsets Battery amplification provides full-bodied sound Mic monitoring lets you hear yourself Feel flimsier than more expensive headsets No surround sound \nWith VR headsets like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift making their way into PC gamers' rooms, specially-designed audio headsets for virtual reality were bound to follow. The Turtle Beach 350 Stealth VR is one of the most flexible out there, featuring a generous amount of adjustability thanks to its sturdy headband which can fit over the top of VR headsets worn on even the biggest heads. Sure enough, the 350 Stealth is designed for practicality rather than sharp looks. Its black-and-white color scheme isn't the most exciting design out there, but an abundance of features makes up for that. There's mic monitoring, which allows you to hear your own voice inside the headset, bass boost for booming lows, a detachable noise-cancelling headphone mic, and a groove in the ear cups that lets you tuck the audio cable out of the way. While it's perfectly suitable for owners of PC-based VR headsets, it's quite literally a great fit for PSVR gamers too. 6. SteelSeries Arctis \nHigh performance with a low profile \nInterface: Wireless or wired (3.5mm) | Features: 2.4GHz wireless technology (Arctis 7 only); 15-hour battery; built-in digital audio control; Virtual 7.1 Surround Sound; Steelseries Engine software, Compatible with PC, Mac PS4, Xbox One, smartphones, tablets and VR Sterling bass and treble quality Professional design Ugly suspension headband \nUnlike some of its competitors, SteelSeries stresses subtlety in its headset designs. The Arctis continues this trend by flaunting sound quality and comfort over gaudy appearances. \nWhen you pop an Arctis on your head, the goal is for your audience to see a professional environment rather than, say, a Dorito stain on your chair. The customizable lighting, however, gives you plenty of wiggle room, though, if the monochrome look isn’t your thing. \nThe SteelSeries Arctis comes in three distinct flavors: Arctis 3, Arctis 5 and Arctis 7, each one more expensive than the last. The Arctis 3 is pretty analog protocol while the 5 ships with an external digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and the Arctis 7 is wireless with 2.4GHz connectivity. Each model comes with digital audio control built-in, with an app available for those looking to take this one step further. \nThe only drawback, then, is a less-than-attractive suspension headband. 7. Razer ManO'War \nSurround sound without the fuss \nInterface: Wireless | Features: Software-based 7.1 surround sound, Earcup-mounted controls, Chroma RGB multi-color lighting, 14-meter range (using an extender, 12 meters without) Great surround sound", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:44:23.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
