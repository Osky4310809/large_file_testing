On 17 June 1974 , the IRA exploded a bomb at the Houses of Parliament. A fierce fire broke out, causing considerable damage to the hallowed Westminster Hall, and 11 people were injured. The destruction that the IRA meted out to London over more than two decades was much more extensive than anything we have faced from so-called jihadi terrorism. Yet this experience is often forgotten as the tabloids cry panic and some officials tell us the current terrorist threat is the worst that Britain has ever confronted. \nAlex Younger, the head of MI6, claimed three months ago that the scale of the threat was “unprecedented”. As prime minister David Cameron told us that global jihadism posed an “existential threat” to the UK. Even the usually sober Max Hill, the UK’s terrorism legislation watchdog, said recently that jihadi terrorism posed “an enormous ongoing risk … at least as great as the threat to London in the 70s when the IRA were active on the mainland”. London attack: police seize three vehicles after armed raid in Birmingham – live Read more \nThese analyses are wrong. At the high points of its campaign, the IRA was carrying out big attacks year after year in England. The Birmingham pub bombings of 1974 left 21 people dead. The Brighton bombing in 1984 killed five and nearly assassinated Margaret Thatcher and some of her cabinet. By the 1990s, British intelligence had infiltrated large parts of the terrorist group and foiled many plots. Yet the IRA still had the ability to explode a series of massive bombs in large economic centres, causing death and billions of pounds worth of destruction. In total, the IRA killed about 125 people in attacks in England, and more than 1,500 people in Northern Ireland. \nThe security services have also foiled many al-Qaida and Islamic State-inspired plots. In contrast to the IRA, which could still break through on a regular basis, jihadis have managed to carry out only three deadly attacks in the UK in the 16 years since 9/11, resulting in the deaths of 57 people. While this is a significant threat, any claim that it is unprecedented does not stand up to scrutiny. Britain has had fewer terrorist attacks over the past decade than at any point in the past 50 years. \nIt is true that the IRA’s approach was relatively restrained – it often gave warnings before a bomb went off – while jihadis seek to kill as many people as possible and publicise the fact in bloodcurdling videos. Isis wants to build itself up to appear as a nightmarish, unprecedented threat. And we can wring our hands all day long about its evil intentions. But this needs to be balanced with proper analysis of its actual capability. Westminster attack survivor: it’s wonderful to be alive \nWhile many worry that the attack on Westminster indicates an escalation of the threat to this country, it is equally possible that it betrays the limits of jihadi capability. As Jason Burke reported in the Guardian, security officials suspect that Isis has not developed a network in the UK with the “deadly coherence and efficiency” that it has shown in France and Belgium in recent years. The attack on Wednesday seems to have been carried out by an individual – not a coordinated group. Isis bases in Syria and Iraq are being rolled back, and the group has never had safe havens on Britain’s doorstep in the way the IRA did. That is a key reason why the IRA was able to carry out countless attacks, while the jihadis have managed only three. \nIn the face of those who wish to spread fear, it is best to take a long view. Yet our immediate reaction to terrorist atrocities is often a relentless search for what is “new” and, by implication, more terrifying about the latest attack. On the BBC Today programme on Thursday, Sarah Montague pressed Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, on what she called the “remarkable damage” caused by this “low-tech” attack and the implications of “something on this scale”. Hers was not a measured tone: “It’s hard to see what can be done to make people feel safe,” she said. Media hype about the Westminster attack will only encourage others | Simon Jenkins Read more \nFallon for his part emphasised the difficulty of stopping lone-wolf, low-tech terrorism. “We’re dealing with an enemy,” he said, “a terrorist enemy that is not making demands or holding people hostage but simply wants to kill as many people as possible. So this is a new element to international terrorism.” A new element? Has Sir Michael forgotten what happened on 11 September 2001? \nThe search for what is new in every terrorist attack can cloud our thinking. And the government’s assessment of the threat needs to be more clear-eyed than that of the defence secretary if it is to respond appropriately to this attack. \nMy research indicates that Britain has shown restraint in its approach to domestic counter-terrorism since 9/11, notwithstanding the draconian instincts of Tony Blair and others. Theresa May has offered a measured public response to the attack on Westminster thus far. Yet this is also the era of Donald Trump and the politics of division and anti-immigrant sentiment. If official and media exaggerations of the terrorist threat go unchallenged and misperceptions deepen, there will be a greater risk of Britain overreacting in a way that would divide communities and play into terrorists’ hands.
