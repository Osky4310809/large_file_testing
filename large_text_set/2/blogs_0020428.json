The heavy rainfall has filled Anderson Reservoir to capacity, causing water to rush down the dam’s spillway.\nSanta Clara Valley water district officials said Wednesday morning that their crews had completed temporary repairs to Coyote Canal work that was aimed at preventing more flooding onto Highway 101.\nThe expanded evacuation orders came hours after fire crews rushed to rescue hundreds of people in the city’s Rock Springs neighborhood, where homes and cars were inundated under several feet of water.\n“I don’t have specific numbers for other water rescue operations, but I can tell you in my career this is probably the biggest,” San Jose Fire Department Captain Mitch Matlow said Tuesday afternoon. “In the history of San Jose, I don’t know if its been bigger, but this is probably in the top 10,” Matlow said.\nAndy Seoung was among the residents rescued by fire crews. “At some parts of the street the water is as high as your waist, my waist, “Seoung said. “I’m six feet tall and my waist is about 30 inches off the ground.”\nSan Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said Tuesday that officials suspect a breach in the creek caused the rapid flooding in Rock Springs.\n“Clearly, there’s a source in the creek where there’s a significantly large amount of water that’s rushing in,” Liccardo said.\n\nKQED’s Peter Jon Shuler contributed to this report.
