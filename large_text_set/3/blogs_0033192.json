I mean, we’ve been through so much together… Remember the good old days, back when everything was new and exciting? You were even trying to disrupt vowels then ! \nOh how innocent we were. How full of hope for the possibility of a 140-character microblogging service. For the joy it could bring, and the good we could do together — even just with SMS . \nNow I look back and I just feel numb. \nWhat you did yesterday finally made me see it, Jack. You can’t hurt me anymore.

Becoming more controlling of what you think I should see . \nI should have spotted the warning signs before it was too late . But I didn’t want to believe it, Jack. I wanted the old you back. So I defended Twitter — even when others were busy laughing . \nAnd then there was the abuse. I pleaded with you to listen — to do something to stop it . I shouted and screamed. But for some reason you couldn’t fix it . \nMaybe your attention was elsewhere. Or you didn’t feel it was your problem to solve. Sure, you said you were going to change things. And tried to fob me off with a few tools or by telling me to tell you when bad stuff happened. But I could see in your eyes you were conflicted .
