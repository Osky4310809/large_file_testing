Royal Jordanian Airlines was also named, which first alerted its passengers of the impending rule change on Monday. In a since-deleted tweet, the airline said it received the directive from \"concerned US departments,\" later confirmed to the Homeland Security. \nAround 50 flights per day from the selected airports will be affected by the new rules, impacting thousands of passengers. \nSenior administration officials speaking on background (reporters were not asked to publish names) on a call Monday did not reveal a specific threat, but said that ongoing \"evaluated intelligence\" pointed to terrorists \"aggressively pursuing\" ways to carry out attacks, such as smuggling explosive devices in consumer items. \nOfficials would not discuss the \"security implications\" of storing consumer electronics in the airplane's cargo rather than the cabin. \nMany of the questions behind the electronics ban were not answered by officials. A spokesperson for Homeland Security did not respond to numerous questions sent following the call. \nIt remains unclear exactly for what reason these 10 airports were selected, beyond a vague inference that a threat exists. The selection process wasn't focused on any one location or country, said an official on the call, adding that the government was \"addressing the threat and how it's perceived.\" \nThere have been numerous attacks involving airports in recent years. \nLast year, a bomb at Brussels international airport killed 32 people and injured many more. Months later, a suicide bombing and mass shooting at Ataturk airport in Istanbul killed 45 people . And, a bomb on a Somali plane exploded mid-flight in February 2016, killing only the bomber. \nJust this weekend, a man was shot and killed by French soldiers at a Paris airport after he tried to grab a soldier's gun. \nBut officials wouldn't budge on any further details. \"As a matter of policy, we don't discuss matters of intelligence,\" said one official.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:55:36.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
