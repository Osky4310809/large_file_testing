Each received a certificate of recognition and park tickets to the Disneyland Resort.\nOn February 25, a third of those students were honored as “Shining Stars” and invited to attend an educational symposium focusing on leadership development and collaborative problem solving, followed by a celebratory luncheon. Each received grants of $1,000 for their high schools and medals of recognition. \nFive were also named top “Luminaries” for going above and beyond in making positive change, earning a weekend prize package to visit the Disneyland Resort with their families and the opportunity to present a $3,000 donation to an Orange County nonprofit of their choice.\n\nCongratulations to the following Luminaries and all of this year’s Disneyland Resort Dreamers & Doers!\nAlisa Ogranovich from Aliso Niguel High School in Aliso Viejo for starting a Second Harvest Food Bank chapter at her high school and holding “mobile pantries,” which bring food to underprivileged communities and families.
