Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA TV producer harassed a work rival by phoning him more than 60 times in the middle of the night - repeatedly asking him why he had not killed himself. \nSocial media expert Joel Young, 30, made 65 calls to terrified work rival Lee O'Hanlon over a five-and-a-half hour period from 2am and 7.30am on September 20 last year. \nYoung - who was working for Disney TV until January this year and has worked for well-known TV shows like Loose Women - also pretended to be a police officer on the night in question. \nAt a court hearing Young admitted harassing the music promoter on the phone, as well as impersonating a police officer. \nThe court was was told this was but one night in a long-running saga lasting 18-months. \nYoung admitted harassment on the basis of making the phone calls on September 20 - but denied making threats. \nHowever, in recordings exclusively obtained by MirrorOnline but not played in court, Young can be heard repeatedly asking Mr O'Hanlon why he hasn't 'killed himself?' Joel Young admitted making the phone calls harassing Lee O'Hanlon (Photo: Collect Unknown) \nIn the distressing audio footage Young says to Mr O'Hanlon: \"Have you killed yourself yet? \n\"Have you killed yourself? Cos you’ve been threatening to kill yourself. Why haven’t you killed yourself? \n\"Why haven’t you killed yourself? Why haven’t you killed yourself? \n\"Cos I want you to kill yourself. Like we all want you to kill yourself. \n\"We all want you to kill yourself. Why haven’t you killed yourself?\" \n\"Cos we all want you to kill yourself.\" \nMr O'Hanlon supplied audio footage of some of the conversations which he recorded on the night of September 20 to MirrorOnline - which he also handed to police. \nIn further rants Young can be heard calling Mr O'Hanlon's wife Sam, 39, a \"speccy c*** of a wife\" - and his ten-year-old son, who Mirror Online has chosen not to name, a \"little fat f \". \nIn the recordings, Young can also be heard to say: \"She'll leave you soon that silly blonde b**** with the gegs (slang for glasses) and your kid will go 'Yeah, oh God, yeah, my Dad's such a c***\". \nSome of the other abuse directed at his family is so vile, Mr O'Hanlon has asked MirrorOnline not to publish what was said. Lee O'Hanlon - pictured with his wife Sam and 10-year-old son - said the experience had been \"awful\" \nAt a court hearing on January 3, Young, who is originally from Middlesbrough but lives in London, admitted harassing Mr O'Hanlon without violence and impersonating a police officer on September 20. \nThe latter charge relates to another call on September 20 when Young phoned Mr O'Hanlon pretending to be a 'PC Smith' wanting to interview him about the case. \nHe gave a false collar number and Mr O'Hanlon - who recognised the voice as \"put on\" - claims he feared Young was using the subterfuge to obtain details of his home address. \nThe January court hearing was told Young wanted \"to try and scare Mr O'Hanlon\" who had called police to his house. This saw one officer even answering the phone while Young rang pretending to be a policeman. \nMr O'Hanlon said it made the family further worried about their safety - forcing them to add more locks and video cameras to their home in Lichfield, Staffordshire. \nMr O'Hanlon, 45, said his family had been living in fear for many months - even refusing to let his football-mad son play on his own in the garden. \nAnd he even feared for the safety of his wife Sam every time she walked from the front door of the house to the car. Joel Young has worked on shows like Loose Women and Sunday Brunch \nMr O'Hanlon said: \"It's been worse that we can possibly explain. It's been awful - a living nightmare. \n\"He'd gone to such lengths to find out where we lived - we were worried he would turn up. \n\"We ceased operating as a family. We feared answering the phone or going out. We've not been sleeping at night. \n\"He wanted to cause trouble. He has just been hell bent on attacking us. It's been hard to explain to our son who is too young to understand.\" \nYoung is a well-known figure in the TV and social media community in London - and his Facebook page is littered with photos of him pictured with celebrities. \nFrom October to January this year - according to his LinkedIn profile where he describes himself as a TV Producer/Social Media Expert - he worked as \"Social Media Manager\" for Disney ABC Television Group in London. \nFor five months from May to September last year, Young's profile says he was a \"Producer\" at FremantleMedia. \nThe company - which produces prime-time TV shows for ITV, BBC and Channel 4 including The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent and The Apprentice - refused to say what show Young was working on at the time. \nIn a statement it said: \"Joel Young was a freelancer with us for a short period of time last year. As we do not believe that this matter involves FremantleMedia we will not be commenting further.\" \nPrior to that Young worked as a \"Social Media Producer\" for ITV for five months and \"Communities Manager\" at ITN for seven months. He has previously referenced his work on shows like Loose Women and Sunday Brunch in posts on social media. Lee O'Hanlon and his wife Sam were worried about what would happen next \nAt a hearing on January 3, Young's defence said he admitted making the phone calls and admitted they were harassment and regrets it. He also admitted impersonating a police officer - but he disputed elements of what was claimed he had said to Mr O'Hanlon. \nThe CPS confirmed that, at a subsequent hearing, his eventual basis of plea was that he accepted making ‘a large number of calls’ to Mr O’Hanlon but denied making threats or trying to damage Mr O’Hanlon’s companies. \nAt a further hearing held at Newcastle-Under-Lyme Magistrates' Court last month, Young was handed a 12-month community order. \nThe court was told the saga began when Young was offered a work contract but had to decline it after suffering a mental breakdown. \nHe then tried to go back and continue the work but was told it had been given to Mr O'Hanlon who runs a Staffordshire-based firm called tinyCOW. Magistrates heard various comments were made on social media before Young rang Mr O'Hanlon 65 times in the early hours of September 20 last year.

He was also ordered to pay compensation of £100 to Mr O'Hanlon as well as prosecution costs of £135 and an £85 victim surcharge. He was given a five-year restraining order, which he hadn't opposed, banning him from making approaching or having any contact with Mr O'Hanlon. Joel Young was angry that his business rival had been given work he wanted (Photo: Collect Unknown) \nSentencing Young, chairwoman of the bench Janet Stanyer said: \"These offences have arisen out of a catalogue of issues involving phone calls and social media over an 18 month period. \"We have heard you have mental health issues but this was no excuse for your behaviour and you agree you acted immaturely. \"You have pleaded guilty on a basis. That basis we have read and our sentence reflects the basis you have pleaded guilty to. \"The offence is serious enough for a community order. We made a 12 month community order with 110 hours of unpaid work.\" Young smiled throughout the 30-minute hearing. He also had to be reprimanded by the usher before the magistrates came into court for blowing kisses and winking towards Mr O'Hanlon who sat in the public gallery at the back of the room. \nProsecutor Ruth Bentley said: \"This is a matter of harassment by the defendant against the victim Lee O'Hanlon. \"The harassment has been via telephone calls, Twitter and Facebook. \"The defendant himself has accepted making a vast amount of phone calls to this victim. \"He doesn't have any previous convictions. \"The injured party does ask the court to consider a restraining order.\" Magistrates also were told Young is receiving support and is medicated for mental health issues. Melanie Camm, defending, told the court the harassment came at the end of an 18-month dispute between Young and Mr O'Hanlon. She said: \"He accepts in his interview that he was wrong, it did amount to harassment because of the number of calls that he made and he should not have done it. Mr Young very much wants to draw a line under the incident and move on.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T11:33:25.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
