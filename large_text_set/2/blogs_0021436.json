Read Full Article \nThe Obama guidelines were put on hold by a Texas federal judge after 13 states sued, arguing the federal government was overreaching. Transgender advocacy groups argued that the guidelines were necessary to address discrimination against trans students. \nCelebrities, many Democrats and transgender advocates quickly denounced the move, including the singer who performed the national anthem at Trump's inauguration. Just seeing the news about removing laws protecting trans people. This isn’t about politics. It’s about human rights, and it’s not okay. \n— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 23, 2017 This is disgusting. This is unacceptable. I #StandWithGavin and every Trans person who deserve nothing less than protection and equality. https://t.co/IK5TO8nWQ8 \n— Brie Larson (@brielarson) February 23, 2017 \nThe \"Outnumbered\" panel, including Judge Alex Ferrer, weighed in today, with the judge explaining that the issue is whether federal protections against gender discrimination should apply to gender identity. \nFerrer said states and schools have an obligation to protect students regardless of the federal guidelines. \nMeghan McCain noted that Trump expressed support for the LGTBQ community at the RNC over the summer and he said last year that Caitlyn Jenner could use whichever bathroom she wanted at Trump Tower. \nMcCain said she believes this is a civil rights issue that should not simply be left to states. \n\"The abuse, murder rate and suicide rates of trans students and trans teenagers - especially trans women of color - is hugely high. I do a lot of advocacy work in the LGBT community. I worry this is opening doors for discrimination in schools,\" said McCain, adding she thought the issue was already \"put to bed.\" \nWatch the full discussion above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:09:21.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
