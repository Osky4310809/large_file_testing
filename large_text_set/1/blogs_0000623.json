The mansion also features five bedrooms and bathrooms (Photo: Exclusivepix Media) It's currently on the market for £7.6million (Photo: Exclusivepix Media) A winding staircase links the four storeys of the house (Photo: Exclusivepix Media) \nAdmitting that she'd been \"haunted\" by the idea that he'd hurt himself trying to find her, she revealed: \"Rene wanted to die in my arms but, alas, I was singing that night. He must have wanted to get up and he fell on the floor. \n\"Normally, after my show when he had taken his last medications, I gave him a kiss, tucking him in and sent him off to sleep,\" she went on. \n\"That evening I didn't want to wake him. It was the nurse who found him the next day. Distraught, she came to find me. I went into the room.\" The mezzanine level has its own mini-library (Photo: Exclusivepix Media) The balcony looks over the property's leafy garden (Photo: Exclusivepix Media) Along with its own private garden, the mansion has a spa, wine cellar and 24-hour security (Photo: Exclusivepix Media) \nWhen doctors examined Rene, they found no sign of injury – so Celine was finally able to find peace with his death.
