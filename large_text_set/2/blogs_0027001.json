He's been at it since last year, and what's interesting is the promotion tactic that he comes up with. Where most celebrities would send out a Tweet or an Instagram post, urging their fans to check out a particular film, Ranveer Singh does it differently (why are we not surprised?). To promote Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan's latest flick, Badrinath Ki Dulhania , he dressed up as a surd, singing along to the Tamma Tamma anthem in the film. \nYou need us to tell you how cute the video is; here, give it a watch. — Ranveer Singh (@RanveerOfficial) February 26, 2017 Photo credits: Twitter / BCCL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:25:08.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
