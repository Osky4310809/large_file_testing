According to ESPN , the team plans to waive Bogut to free up a roster spot. Bogut reportedly plans to return to his native Australia to undergo rehabilitation, opting not to have surgery. \nBogut made his debut with the Cavs on Monday and lasted just 58 seconds when he collided with Heat forward Okaro White. Bogut cost the Cavs nearly $1 million in salary and luxury tax fees and adding another player would cost roughly the same. \nThe 32-year-old has battled injuries for much of his career after being taken with the No. 1 pick by the Bucks in 2005. Bogut played a key role in the Warriorsâ€™ back-to-back trips to the Finals, providing a steady defensive presence that the Cavs hoped would help the defending champs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T03:17:18.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
