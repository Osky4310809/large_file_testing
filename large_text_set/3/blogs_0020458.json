The first full trailer for the Love Actually sequel has been released on NBC's Twitter account. Watch the full thing below: To us, #RedNoseDay is perfect! The night of Red Nose Day kicks off on May 25 at 8/7c. #RedNoseDayActually pic.twitter.com/IpD69JqDSs \n— NBC (@nbc) March 22, 2017 Advertisement   The cheeky trailer features features Love Actually actors Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Andrew Lincoln, Martine McCutcheon, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rowan Atkinson, Lucia Moniz, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, and Olivia Olson holding up those infamous cards —you know, the ones that Lincoln's stalker-ish character Mark used to reveal his love to Keira Knightley's Juliet. Twitter Most Popular The brand new cards tell us all about the forthcoming sequel—and make fun of Colin Firth at the same time: \"On Red Nose Day we'll meet again in Red Nose Day Actually (because on Red Nose Day unexpected things happen). Tune in to see what happened to everyone and, amongst other things, which one of us has aged best. One thing's for sure...it's not Colin Firth. I think it's obviously Liam isn't it?\" See, Colin, that's what happens when you don't show up for the trailer like everybody else. Twitter Twitter Thomas Brodie-Sangster adds some millennial angst to the trailer with a sign that says: \"Whatever. I've grown up.\" Bill Nighy's reads: \"I haven't really.\" Twitter Brilliant! We can't wait. The Red Nose Day Love Actually Special will air on NBC on Thursday May 25, 10/9c.
