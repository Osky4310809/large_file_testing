But it happened during my labor because I had a very strong connection with my child. I felt like when I was having contractions, I envisioned my child pushing through a very heavy door,” the chart-topping diva told the magazine. “And I imagined this tiny infant doing all the work, so I couldn't think about my own pain .... We were talking. I know it sounds crazy, but I felt a communication.” PHOTOS: Beyonce's Best Instagram Style \nDuring that same interview, Beyoncé also revealed that she never felt sexier than after she became a mom. “Right now, after giving birth, I really understand the power of my body, just feel my body means something completely different. I feel a lot more confident about it,” she said. “Even being heavier, thinner, whatever. I feel a lot more like a woman. More feminine, more sensual. And no shame.”   \nAfter Blue made her debut, the 20-time Grammy winner realized that the love she has for her career could never compare to the feelings she has for her first child. “I feel like I have something that has grounded me so much more. Family has always been important. I’ve always had my mother and my father and my husband,” she told Vogue in 2013. “But it’s just …. Life is so much more than … It’s not defined by any of this [fame and money].” \nThat said, she does her best to juggle her responsibilities as a mother with her jam-packed work schedule as one of the most successful entertainers in the world.

I see these women and I think, 'Yes, it can be balanced, it can all work out,'\" she told Cosmopolitan UK in 2011, the year she announced her first pregnancy at the MTV Video Music Awards . “I do believe that it's possible to have it all — work, a career, babies. It's all a question of being very organized. That's what I'm getting my head around.” Beyonce arrives at the 28th Annual MTV Video Music Awards in 2011.

There is something so relieving about life taking over you like that,” she said. “You’re playing a part in a much bigger show. And that’s what life is. It’s the greatest show on Earth.” \nThat same year, the pop icon sat down with Good Morning America and revealed that she wished to add to her family of three.

I   sister,” Beyoncé, whose younger sibling is Solange Knowles, said at the time. “And I am very protective. I just want to make sure that she can have a healthy, safe, normal life.   now. I feel really, really just lucky that I can still do what I love, and now have a way bigger meaning. And that’s to be her mother.” PHOTOS: '90s Pop Stars, Then and Now \nAs the Beyhive learned on Wednesday, February 1, Beyoncé’s dreams of adding to her brood are coming true. The Destiny’s Child alum took to Instagram to let fans know that she and her hip-hop star hubby, 47, will be welcoming two new bundles of joy.
