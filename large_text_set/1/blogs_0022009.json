By Fritz Hahn By Fritz Hahn January 23 at 3:37 PM Follow @fritzhahn Eight beers brewed at the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Mills River, N.C., are being recalled because of potential problem with the glass bottles. (Jacob Biba for The Washington Post) \nSierra Nevada, the nation’s third-largest craft brewery, is voluntarily recalling eight beers sold in 12-ounce bottles in 35 states, including Maryland and Virginia, plus the District, because of a bottle flaw that could cause glass-related injuries. The recall includes several of the company’s most popular brands, including Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Hop Hunter IPA and Torpedo Extra IPA, which were bottled and packaged at its brewery in Mills River, N.C., between early December and mid-January. The problem, according to a news release from the brewery, is “a very limited number of bottles with a flaw that may cause a small piece of glass to break off and possibly fall into the bottle, creating a risk for injury.” \nMike Bennett, Sierra Nevada’s chief supply chain officer, said in a news release that the company believes the condition exists in 1 in 10,000 bottles, though no consumers have reported injuries related to the flaw. Bottles included in the recall have a packaging code that includes an “M,” for Mills River, printed on the shoulder of the bottle, above the label, or on the outside of a 12-pack or 24-bottle case. Any bottles with a code that includes the letter “C,” designating the company’s original plant in Chico, Calif., are safe, as are all cans and draft versions. \n[ Beer: Why large West Coast breweries are building East Coast plants ] Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is one of the recalled beers. (Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post) \nBeers affected are Sierra Nevada Pale Ale bottled between Dec. 5 and Jan. 8, and bottles of Beer Camp Golden IPA, Hop Hunter IPA, Nooner pilsner, Otra Vez gose, Sidecar Orange Pale Ale, Torpedo Extra IPA and Tropical Torpedo packaged between Dec. 5 and Jan. 13. Customers who purchased recalled bottles should visit sierranevada.com/qualitymatters to find more information about deciphering the bottle codes and applying for a full refund. \nConstellation Brands, the parent company of Corona, issued a recall last year after warning that particles of glass could be found in some of its bottles. Most recent beer recalls, however, have concerned the quality of the beer rather than customer safety: Goose Island recalled most of its vaunted 2015 line Bourbon County Brand Stout in 2016 after off flavors developed and bacteria was detected in bottles , while Washington’s 3 Stars Brewing recalled its Pandemic Porter in 2015 due to “unintentional development of flavors” in bottles. \nSierra Nevada, founded in 1979, is celebrated as one of the pioneers of American craft brewing. The Mills River brewery opened in 2014 as part of a push by West Coast breweries to open facilities on the East Coast, including a number in North Carolina and Virginia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:52:55.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
