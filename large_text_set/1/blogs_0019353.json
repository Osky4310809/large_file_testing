Fifteen years is a long time, so maybe you'd think something like that wouldn't scare you now. Nope, definitely still scary — especially if the girl surprised you IRL. \nIn a promo for Rings, a sequel that takes place 13 years after the events of the first movie, Paramount coordinated a little prank in a TV store. \nPretty surprising that nobody in the store had a heart attack, cause that's some terrifying sh*t. \nThe Rings plot is as follows: \"A young woman becomes worried about her boyfriend when he explores a dark subculture surrounding a mysterious videotape said to kill the watcher seven days after he has viewed it. She sacrifices herself to save her boyfriend and in doing so makes a horrifying discovery: there is a “movie within the movie” that no one has ever seen before.\" \nHoo damn, here we go again. \nFor anyone willing to have this creepy girl haunt their dreams, Rings will debut in theaters on February 3rd. Drop This Fact \nDaveigh Chase, the actress in the original movie, isn't as creepy as the girl she plays. She's actually quite the looker.
