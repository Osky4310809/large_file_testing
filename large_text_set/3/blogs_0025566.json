As Premier League season heads toward the final stretch, the FC crew debate which sides will finish in the top four. \nDivock Origi this week spoke about his \"frustration\" at a lack of regular playing time at Liverpool. \nAs so often happens when players go away on international duty and speak to their national media, Origi took the opportunity to get a few things off his chest. Some might say it's the only opportunity he has taken in recent months. \nLiverpool desperately need Origi to be playing at the level he was this time last year, and it has hurt them that he isn't. His complaints about a lack of playing time will therefore carry very little weight with Jurgen Klopp or the club's supporters, because if he was performing then he'd be playing. \nThe opportunity has been there for him to stake a claim for a regular spot and he hasn't taken it. Though it's true that Liverpool have had fewer games this season than last, it's also true that competition for places is not what it might have been. \nEverything has fallen into place for Origi this season, and the door to the first team has been wide open for him. Danny Ings was once again ruled out for the season, Daniel Sturridge has largely been a nonfactor because of various ailments and Philippe Coutinho and Sadio Mane have also missed time. \nSo here's the thing; if Origi was playing at the level he was a year ago then he'd be in the team more often than not, especially given the poor form of Coutinho since the turn of the year. Instead of expressing frustration, perhaps Origi should be asking himself why he has not played as much as he would have liked. \nHe's shown sporadic flashes of his best form, but usually he's looked passive and tentative rather than direct and aggressive. He has mostly been used from the bench and his skill set should make him an ideal impact substitute, but too often he has made the team worse rather than better when he has come on. Had Ings not suffered from such cruel luck with injuries he'd probably be getting the minutes Origi has been getting, and he'd be doing a lot more with those minutes. \nThough it's true that Origi has occasionally been brought on in difficult situations with Liverpool chasing games, there have been other times when everything has been set up for him to shine by using his pace and skill on the counterattack. He just hasn't done it though, and last Sunday's 1-1 draw at Manchester City is a prime example of why Origi has no right to bemoan a lack of regular football. Injuries have left the door to the first team wide open for Liverpool's Divock Origi. \nHe replaced Coutinho after 73 minutes with City having just equalised, leaving spaces in behind as they pushed forward looking for a winner. With his physical attributes, Origi should be terrorising teams who play a high line with little full back support, but once again he offered nothing. Liverpool needed him to hold the ball up and offer a threat in behind; they needed the kind of performance he gave them away to Borussia Dortmund last season. Instead they got nothing. It's happening too often this year. \nOrigi compared his situation to that of his compatriot Romelu Lukaku, who is established as Belgium's No.1 striker and is the Premier League's leading marksman this season with Everton. \n\"If I play so little it's also because I'm at a big club where it's more difficult to get into the starting lineup than it is at Everton\" he said. \nIt's difficult to muster up any sympathy for that viewpoint, not least because Lukaku would get into most teams in Europe right now, including Liverpool's. Would Origi get into the Everton side if Lukaku wasn't there? Not on recent form. \nBesides, this is a situation entirely of his own making. Origi did not have to move to Liverpool at such a young age. He could have stayed at Lille and developed his game there, playing regular first-team football and steadily improving out of the spotlight and with less expectation. Instead he made a big money move to one of England's top clubs, just as Lukaku had done a few years earlier. \nLukaku could not get a regular starting place at Chelsea and was loaned out to West Brom and then Everton before he eventually made the move to Goodison Park permanent. Despite his huge potential, Lukaku wasn't ready to hold down a regular place at a top club and needed the time to develop into the player he is now. \nOrigi has had far more opportunities to play for Liverpool than Lukaku had at Chelsea, but both are a good example of why young players should think twice before making a big move before they are ready for it. If you want to play regularly, don't move to a big club at such a young age. If you make that move and don't get the playing time you want, you have nobody to blame for it except yourself, particularly when you've not performed when the opportunity has come. \nOrigi has no reason to feel hard done by at Liverpool, and if he wants to play more then the opportunity is there for him, but if he doesn't take it soon then it might not be there for much longer. \nIt's time to let his feet do the talking. \nDave Usher is one of ESPN FC's Liverpool bloggers.
