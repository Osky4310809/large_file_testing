But it won't go very far,\" said Cory's financial manager, Neil Blockley. \nCory Band is the world number one ranked brass band and has its own youth academy, developing young musical talent across south Wales, especially Rhondda Cynon Taff. \n\"Music education can be a catalyst for so much more than just learning an instrument,\" added Mr Blockley. \n\"It is about diversity and inclusivity - music gives youngsters a chance in life. So yes, it is great to see this investment - and no, it is not enough.\" Image copyright Getty Images \nMs Williams said it was part of a package to \"ensure that all children in Wales have the opportunity to study music\". \n\"We know that there have been some very difficult austerity measures that are weighing very hard on local government, who have the prime responsibility for this service,\" she added. \nAs well as making the cash available for buying instruments, it will also help councils establish a database of where their instruments are and how they can be shared across authority boundaries more effectively. \nIt follows an announcement in February of a £1m \"endowment fund\" to encourage Welsh school children to become musicians. \nEmyr Wynne Jones, a member of a group that reported to the Welsh Government 2015, said there had been a \"crisis in music services\" after \"10 to 15 years of successive cuts\". \n\"We applaud that this Welsh Government, in challenging times, has found funding,\" he said. \nHe said the money could provide a county with up to 200 student training instruments, or perhaps a few expensive items such as tubas or harps - depending on where the money was spent. \nBut he also admitted: \"Of course, it's not going to go very far. It's not enough - it's never going to be enough.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:00:24.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
