Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.” \nKalanick was the target of criticism when he said he would continue his involvement with the president after Trump signed an executive order to ban citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days.

More general critics of Uber also ised the hashtag to voice their complaints about the company’s labor practices and low pay of their drivers. The hashtag picked up steam when two Iraqis were detained at JFK Airport and the New York City Taxi Worker’s Alliance stopped all pickups from JFK to show their support against Trump’s order.

I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the President or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that. \nI spent a lot of time thinking about this and mapping it to our values. There are a couple that are particularly relevant: \nInside Out – The implicit assumption that Uber (or I) was somehow endorsing the Administration’s agenda has created a perception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are. \nJust Change – We must believe that the actions we take ultimately move the ball forward. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America. Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants. \nImmigration and openness to refugees is an important part of our country’s success and quite honestly to Uber’s. I am incredibly proud to work directly with people like Thuan and Emil, both of whom were refugees who came here to build a better life for themselves. I know it has been a tough week for many of you and your families, as well as many thousands of drivers whose stories are heartfelt and heart-wrenching. \nPlease know, your questions and stories on Tuesday , along with what I heard from drivers, have kept me resilient and reminded me of one of our most essential cultural values, Be Yourself. We will fight for the rights of immigrants in our communities so that each of us can be who we are with optimism and hope for the future. \nTravis Trump vs Schwarzenegger: 9 Moments in History of Friends Turned Rivals (Photos) \nHere's a look back at the long and complicated history between the two celebrities-turned-politicians. Getty \nArnold Schwarzenegger and Donald Trump were buddy-buddy at first, seen joking around at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York, according to a 2016 Politico article . At Trump's request, Schwarzenegger even moved his entourage from the Mandarin Hotel to one of Trump's hotels, which irked Schwarzenegger's wife, Maria Shriver. Wikimedia Commons \nSchwarzenegger had a guest appearance on an episode of \"The Apprentice: Los Angeles\" in 2007, when he was governor of California. He invited contestants into his private conference room in Sacramento. Back then, Trump described the Governator as a \"great friend.\" NBC \nApparently he was such a great friend that a month later, Trump donated $10,000 to Schwarzenegger to help pay off debts from his 2006 re-election campaign. The donation got Schwarzenegger in hot water, as political watchdogs saw it as him using his celebrity status to solve his political problems. Getty \nIn September 2015, NBC named Schwarzenegger to take over as host of \"Celebrity Apprentice\" following Trump's entrance into the the presidential race -- and after the candidate's statements about Mexicans prompted NBC Universal to cut its business ties with real estate mogul. Getty \nDuring Trump's presidential campaign, Schwarzenegger would not provide the same support, instead endorsing Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the Republican primary. Getty \nEven after Trump won the GOP nomination, Schwarzenegger took to social media to he would not vote for Trump...whom he would not refer to by name. \"It's not only acceptable to choose your country over your party -- it is your duty,\" he said. \nTrump struck back a few weeks before his inauguration in January 2017, mocking the low ratings Schwarzenegger was getting as host of \"Celebrity Apprentice\" while referring to himself as a \"ratings machine.\" Trump had made similar taunts at Martha Stewart when she hosted her version of the reality show back in 2005. NBC \nSchwarzenegger responded by wishing Trump luck and saying that he hoped \"you'll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings.\" NBC \nIn February 2017, President Trump mocked Schwarzenegger for his \"Celebrity Apprentice\" ratings at the ordinarily serious National Prayer Breakfast, calling on the crowd to \"pray for Arnold.\" Getty \nIn response, Schwarzenegger suggested in a Facebook video that he and Trump switch jobs: \"You take over TV, because you're such an expert in ratings. And I take over your job. And then people can finally sleep comfortably again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:34:01.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
