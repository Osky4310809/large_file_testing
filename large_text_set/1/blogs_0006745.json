They are asked to keep a straight face and respond matter-of-factly to anyone who asks them if they’re cold. Travellers in London get into the spirit of the no pants ride on Sunday.

Philadelphia’s version was sponsored by a laundry delivery service, which asked participants to show up with extra pants or other clothing to donate to charity.

It’s a fun trip, that’s all.” Tube travellers in London make themselves comfortable.

But there was no hesitation for Angela Bancilhon, a tourist from Australia who had her husband and two young sons along for the ride. “It’s fun. Why the hell not?” Bancilhon said. “We’re in NYC.
