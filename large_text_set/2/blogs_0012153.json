This time, it’s model Carissa Rosario who’s in line for what is arguably one of Eric’s most surreal pieces yet.\n“Can you explain how pretty you are to a blind man?” poses the host, before conveniently shepherding in a blind person from backstage. Carissa does her best to explain, but the joke’s on her as, obviously, it turns out the man is not blind at all and instead possesses ears for eyes. From thereon, the interview only gets weirder, as the dude suspended from the ceiling by meat hooks appears again ( see previous episodes ), this time treating us to a spot of free jazz. If you think that’s bizarre, then wait until you reach the bloody crescendo.\nWatch the hilarious interview in full over at the Adult Swim website .\nElsewhere in TV land, be sure to check out these images from Stranger Things season two.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:43:14.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
