Definitely not an entree though,” Portman read aloud, before revealing her pregnant belly to the camera and whispering, “You are wrong.”\nGosling’s mean tweet appeared to compliment him at first before veering into an insult.\n“Oh, look at me…I’m Ryan Gosling, I have perfect bone structure and kind eyes,” he read. “Go f-ck yourself Ryan Gosling.”\nGoldberg was less than impressed with a tweet comparing her to armpit hair. “Really? That’s it?” she asked.\nEddie Redmayne received one of the grosser messages: “Dear Eddie Redmayne, I hate your stinking guts, you make me vomit, you’re the scum between my toes. Love, Zhenya.”\nRyan Gosling, Emma Stone, Natalie Portman and more star in Mean Tweets: #Oscars edition. pic.twitter.com/5NHHvxuT3D \n— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:35:36.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
