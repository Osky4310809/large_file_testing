It also turned out that the paper’s tale was wildly exaggerated. \nThe Vermont utility in question, the Burlington Electric Department, later released a statement clarifying where it discovered the “Russian code” and it turned out it there was not any “penetration” into the U.S. electricity grid. \nLater that evening, Vermont Public Service Commissioner Christopher Recchia told the Burlington Free Press that “the grid is not in danger.” \n“As commissioner of public service we are very concerned about cybersecurity,” Recchia insisted. “I’ve been working with homeland security and our department of emergency management, homeland security to make sure that we are on top of things like this because this is a real concern.” \nUtility officials said that the Russian malware code was found on but a single laptop computer that was not in any way connected to its power grid systems. \nThe utility also issued a statement about the discovery of the code: \nLast night, U.S. utilities were alerted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of a malware code used in Grizzly Steppe, the name DHS has applied to a Russian campaign linked to recent hacks. We acted quickly to scan all computers in our system for the malware signature. We detected the malware in a single Burlington Electric Department laptop not connected to our organization’s grid systems. \nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com .
