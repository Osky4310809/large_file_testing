The ATL rapper linked up with NBA forward Kevin Durant to present this latest offering. In previous editions, Tity Boi had exclusively worked with women including Nicki Minaj, Cardi B and Erykah Badu . \nDespite the fast approaching playoffs, the star of the Golden State Warriors has been sidelined with a season-ending injury. So he had plenty of time to choose his favorite trap joints. And judging from the list, Durant has got good taste. Durant included Future's \"Mask Off,\" Migos ' \"T-Shirt,\" Travis Scott's \"beibs in the trap,\" and 2 Chainz's \"Good Drank 2.0,\" featuring Quavo, Gucci Mane and the heavenly Trap Choir -- Guwop references KD on it. \nOther acts include Lil Wayne, Drake, Rae Sremmurd, 21 Savage and Metro Boomin , Dave East , A$AP Ferg and more. \nStream Durant's \"Pretty Girls Like Trap Music\" playlist on Spotify.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T06:36:03.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
