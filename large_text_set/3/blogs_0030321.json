Yesterday, when Cyclone Debbie made landfall, a number of intrepid Queenslanders reportedly took advantage of the gnarly surf generated by one of the strongest storm systems to ever hit the Sunshine State. They ventured out onto Airlie Beach, and into the giant waves to boogie board and kite surf, with nothing more than a pair of board shorts to protect them. \nOne man was captured on camera by Channel Nine as he wandered into the background of the frame during a live news broadcast . The man was seen wading cheerfully into the churning water, board in hand, as his friend watched on. \"That's obviously not a good idea at all,\" reporter Jessica Millward told to her audience. \nThe boogie boarders weren't the only citizens of Queensland to laugh in the face of Cyclone Debbie. A Bowen resident interviewed by Channel Seven brazenly described how Debbie was about to give the town \"a blow job\" on live TV—he appeared drunk at the time. Bowen also went viral for its \"CYCLONE DEBBIE BRING IT ON, BOWEN IS NOT A PUSSY TOWN DO THE BEST YOU GOT\" slogan that was spray painted on a picket fence near the centre of town by local man Graham Wilson. Meanwhile a group of friends in the town of Ayr painted a large purple \"FUCK OFF DEBBIE\" sign on their garage door, before posing next to it on Instagram with beers in hand. \nWhile many Queenslanders chose to see the bright side and enjoy a day off while the storm ran its course on Tuesday, not everyone was, um, on board with the storm festivities. State Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has criticised Queenslanders for not taking Debbie seriously enough—appearing on The Project last night, she described the boogie boarding in particular as \"appalling.\" \n\"People are taking their own life into their own hands when they are doing absolutely stupid things like going out and surfing, boogie board riding or going out and taking photos when they shouldn't be,\" Premier Palaszczuk told Carrie Bickmore . \"Why would you put your life at risk and put the lives of others at risk who would actually have to go and help you?\" \nWhile the Cyclone Debbie storm threat was eventually downgraded and didn't turn out to be nearly as destructive as category five Cyclone Yasi in 2011, it still caused plenty of damage. It is estimated that the cyclone has left more than 60,000 homes without power, with the coastline between Airlie Beach and Mackay worst hit. The storm is now moving inland, bringing heavy rain with it. Boogie boarding conditions are likely still pretty good. \nFollow Kat on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:48:58.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
