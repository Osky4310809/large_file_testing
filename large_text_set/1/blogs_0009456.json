Huawei, not Apple, now drives the mobile conversation \nTo make matters worse for Samsung, the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan's industry and accelerated the slowdown of their economy, as well as their ability to compete in the consumer electronics industry, led to Foxconn's acquisition in August of 2016 of Sharp, a company considered to be the leader in OLED and IGZO display technology. \nThe Chinese now own one of the key Japanese technologies used in the iPhone. \nThe industrial might of Guangdong and Sichuan may have been built on iPhone and iPad, but their future was going to be Android. \nA lot of this Asian smartphone brain trust ended up at five very large Chinese companies -- Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, Xiaomi, and Oppo -- that leveraged much of the same manufacturing capabilities Apple effectively ceded. \nAs the horsemen of the smartphone apocalypse battled for market share all over the world by continually driving down the cost of premium products, customers began to win. We no longer had only two premium smartphone manufacturers to choose from (or to pay their prices) to get high-quality devices. \nLeading that charge is Huawei, which was selected as the contract manufacturer for Google's Nexus 6P smartphone. Having experienced some initial success in North America, Huawei began releasing smartphones in multiple international markets under its own brands, first with Qualcomm chips , and then with multi-core ARM SoCs of its own design, the HiSilicon Kirin 9xx. \nHuawei demonstrated its ability to match Samsung and Apple on build quality and come in much lower on price point last summer with the dual-camera, premium P9 , which preceded the iPhone 7 Plus launch by several months. \nIt then quickly followed that with a value-priced version of the P9, the Honor 8, which got accolades from our own Matthew Miller and other outlets for its sleek design and excellent performance. \nAt this year's CES, on the heels of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 debacle, Huawei unveiled the Mate 9 , their flagship phablet. Early response to this phone has been overwhelmingly positive -- I have been using one myself for several weeks, and it easily matches the Galaxy Note 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus on features, at a lower price point -- and without the added combustibility of Samsung's ill-fated device. \nBut don't take my word for it, read what our mobile columnist has to say. Spoiler alert: He loves the thing. \nAnd if you feel bad that you aren't spending enough money on a Chinese-made smartphone to impress your friends, you could always opt for the Porsche Design version of the device with 6GB of RAM, 256GB of flash storage, and an AMOLED 2K display. It is an absolute monster device. \nNobody knows what it costs yet. I've handled one, and it is the sexiest Android phone that has ever been made. \nIt would be easy to point out that the Chinese Android monster is of Apple's own making and is a major reason why the company's industry dominance is fading as its growth slows. But it isn't the only reason. \nApple is actually a victim of its own success. It has made so much money from iPhone that it has become complacent, and its product releases have become entirely data-driven and iterative and ham-fisted and ignorant of customer needs since Tim Cook took over as CEO after the death of Steve Jobs. \nI mean, what do you expect when you put a supply chain genius at the helm of a company known for its innovation, one that traditionally was never afraid to throw its babies out with the bathwater every five or ten years or so? \nHow else do you explain the purely iterative iPhone 7 with the headset-port-ectomy and the new MacBook Air with the dated, Star Trek-TNG style LED touchbar of questionable functionality, sans full touchscreen, dongle-chaining nightmare that has even Apple fans scratching their heads? \nYeah, remove key functionality instead of a complete redesign. That's a recipe for success. I know another very large West Coast technology company that tried that a few years ago and learned their lesson the hard way. They ended up replacing their CEO. He's doing an awesome job. \nA recent blog post by former Apple employee and Silicon Valley Kremlinologist Chuq Von Rospach made this point particularly well: \nApple's always been a data driven company, but I think they've gotten overly reliant on data to drive business decisions. Spreadsheets can tell you where the sweet spots in the market are and how to hit them, but they struggle at finding and bringing forward strategic areas that also need coverage. That was, actually, one thing that Steve excelled at. It means you need people in leadership who understand their user base and which bits are strategic and need to have product coverage. \nApple's view of its users doesn't match its users: I think Apple's lost sight of its users. It clearly has a model of what their user base is, but there have been multiple instances in the last 18 months where the user reaction has clearly been much different than Apple expected it to be. \nUnlike Tim Cook, a.k.a. Mr. Data, Steve Jobs was the Silicon Valley god of product line sacrifice. I had my qualms with the man while he was alive , but in hindsight, even with all the issues I had with the way he dealt with partners and developers, and ultimately burning customers, I recognize that he had an incredible ability to drive his company to do disruptive things. \nThere are certainly plenty of people worthy of market disruption at Apple today. The problem is they are not the people driving the balance of the company's revenue. Instead, they are working on R&D type stuff and in lines of business that are not the most profitable part of the company. \nApple's culture has now become so \"not invented here\" that anyone in those organizations that could possibly gestate something potentially disruptive to their own cash cows would likely be taken out and shot. \nIf anyone thinks that I want Apple to fail, they would be completely wrong. Apple is one of the jewels of the U.S. technology industry, and it is critical to that industry's survival that Apple remains a center of innovation. \nI don't want any of our technology leaders to fail. But now that it has created the Chinese monster, Apple needs to make course changes and disrupt from within -- or all mobile industry conversations going forward will be in Mandarin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T04:28:23.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
