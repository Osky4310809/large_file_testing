We’ve already seen the fellas dressed up as Ghostbusters for Halloween, remember? Will has made a miraculous return, although “He seems to be seeing images from the Upside Down—the question is whether they’re real or not,” says co-creator Matt Duffer. “So it seems like he’s having some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder.”\nWill’s mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder), has started dating an old high school classmate, Bob (Sean Astin), while “trying to mask a lot,” explains Ryder. “I think she’s made this choice with Bob because she wants a good father figure in her sons’ lives.”\nHopper (David Harbour), however, is working feverishly to keep the inexplicable secrets of last season in order, including the much talked-about disappearance of Barb.\n“It kind of falls on Hopper to be the voice of authority to say, ‘This did happen and this didn’t happen,’” says Harbour. “He’s struggling with the compromise that takes him to, having to lie and cover things up.”\nSiblings Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Mike have themselves been mourning the expectant deaths of friends Barb and Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown).\n“She and Mike are both the most screwed-up because they’re the ones who both lost someone,” says co-creator Ross Duffer. “They’re both grappling with that, and we see the effects.”\nIn terms of newcomers for season two, we note the arrival of brother-sister duo, Billy (Dacre Montgomery) and Max (Sadie Sink) to Hawkins. While Max befriends the boys, Billy in turn has a hard to getting close to anyone.\n“Stephen King always has really great human villains. The evil in the real world is often as bad or worse than the supernatural evil, so we wanted to introduce a character like that,” hints Matt Duffer.\nOf course, the rift to the Upside Down remains open, in addition to the lab who is now run by Dr. Owens (Paul Reiser).\nLastly, Matt Duffer reveals that the new assortment of episodes will be exploring “different kinds of horror.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:22:55.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
