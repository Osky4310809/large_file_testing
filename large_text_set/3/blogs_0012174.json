Each time I add a new friend on social media, who then stalks me (we all do it, TBH), each time I check my Facebook memories, each time someone happens to glance at my childhood album, I get jibed at with this one. And let me just tell you this, I HATE IT. \nHonestly who are these people who think that a sentence like \"you USED to look so nice\" can be a compliment? How?? Yes, I get it that you THINK that I used to look nice when I was thin, but that's the thing - think it, don't SHARE it. \nAlso, \"Wow you've lost so much weight, you look so nice now\" or \"You look nice, now that you've gained some weight\" isn't a compliment either. Comment on the weight loss/gain, but please stop indicating that the person looked horrendous before they reached this stage. Seriously, it's doing nothing for the confidence. \nAnother horrible, so called compliment you need to stop doling out is \"Congratulations on your job/marriage/baby, you are now settled.\" Just say congratulations, and end the conversation. The whole point of compliments is that they need to make people happy, not feel worse about themselves.Any compliment that starts with \"you sure are amazing for a \" is not any fun either. I am amazing because I am me, not despite being me, get it? \nOne last thing on the list is this: \"You look way better in...\" Don't even try, just don't. Because this indicates that any other day I don't look my best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T05:07:34.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
