Will the Rams cut Lance Kendricks, Eugene Sims or Greg Robinson? By Bryan Kalbrosky 7 hours ago 337 shares By: Bryan Kalbrosky | 7 hours ago \nThe Los Angeles Rams front office has some huge decisions to make in the upcoming offseason when it comes to cap space and player personnel. \nThe Rams have $38,985,625 in cap space to work with in free agency, which is No. 14 overall in the NFL. That’s certainly a better position than the Dallas Cowboys (more than $10 million over the cap) as well as the New York Jets ($2 million above the cap) next season. \nBut the Rams may still look to cut some players on their roster to have more money to spend on attractive free agents. Here’s what Spotrac predicts : \n“Even with ample cap space it’s hard see the Rams keeping Lance Kendricks (TE, $4.25M) on the roster past March 11th (when he’s due a $500,000 roster bonus). Eugene Sims (DE, $3.25M) could be the odd man out on the defensive line, while Greg Robinson (OT, $6.77M) is a veritable bust as a #2 overall pick, but with zero saved to release him he probably survives his contract year season.” Related: Lance Kendricks was a yard away from $250,000 contract bonus from Rams \nIf the Rams were to cut both Kendricks and Sims, the Rams would save a total of $6.75 million next season. \nA decision to cut Greg Robinson, despite his poor production, would not actually give Los Angeles any more money to spend in the offseason as his contract has a fifth-year team option at disposal. \nIt also seems like the Rams have not given up on Robinson and want to see how he performs under new offensive line coach Aaron Kromer. \nPerhaps it would make more sense to cut Tim Barnes, which would save Los Angeles $3 million in cap space, but he was a relatively productive center for the Rams. Related: Rams coaches do not seem worried about offensive lineman Greg Robinson \nAt the tight end position, Tyler Higbee and Temarrick Hemingway are both serviceable replacements for Kendricks. The former Wisconsin tight end has underproduced as a starter in the NFL. \nMeanwhile, Sims had 536 total snaps as an edge defender last season with the Rams. But according to Pro Football Focus, he had the worst overall grade at his position on the team — behind William Hayes, Robert Quinn and Ethan Westbrooks. \nPlus, there is a huge depth of talent in the upcoming 2017 NFL Draft if the Rams want to draft a replacement tight end as well. Expect both Kendricks and Sims to not last until next season in Los Angeles with the Rams. \nIf both were cut, Los Angeles would have an extra $6.75 million in cap space to work with moving forward.
