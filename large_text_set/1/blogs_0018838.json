It can be paired up to three devices simultaneously, and comes with three different backlit settings. It can not, however, shield you from snide remarks about how much of a hipster you are for using one.\nIf you would like to purchase, you can sign up here to receive details as soon as they’re available.\nSpeaking of hipsters, didn’t they change the world or something? \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T12:58:49.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
