Perth will be a ghost town . China will ditch coal . Our planet will become sentient . Tim Flannery’s list of climate predictions is long and almost always wrong. \nLet’s add one more. Here’s Flannery in 2010 : \nThe potential is also there in the next forty years to fundamentally transform energy. We’ll see it I think in the next half decade, with electric cars particularly. The sort of era we’re moving into now, it’s going to come very quickly and it will be very surprising to people, the way electric cars start rolling out. \nBut more than half a decade later : \nAfter being touted as the next big thing in motoring, sales of electric cars have almost come to a halt in Australia after more than five years of experimental models. \nOfficial sales figures show just 219 electric cars were reported as sold last year or just 0.0018 per cent of the total market – a staggering drop of 90 per cent from the previous year. \nIndeed, electric car sales are so unpopular, Nissan and Mitsubishi have stopped stocking their electric hatchbacks, the Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi iMiev, because they struggled to move them even after slashing prices. \nYou know, a fellow could get mighty rich betting against Flannery’s forecasts. Possibly even as rich as your typical eco-activist executives . ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T06:57:26.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
