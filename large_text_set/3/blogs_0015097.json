(PTI) \nAs the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) today declared Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath as the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, the CM designate met governor Ram Naik and claimed stake to form the government in the state. After his meeting with the governor, Adityanath thanked Ram Naik for inviting him to form the government. Addressing the media, Adityanath said that while it won’t be easy to run in UP, he will follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s ‘sabka sath sabka vikas’ slogan to bring better governance in the state. \nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has today announced the name of Yogi Adityanath as the next Uttar Pradesh chief minister after much speculation about a number of other contenders including Rajnath Singh , Manoj Sinha, Swatantra Dev Singh, Keshav Prasad Maurya or others. \nThe safron Party has held its legislature meeting to elect the successor of Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav , with party president Amit Shah empowered to take the final call. Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu and BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav were among others who were present at the meet at the party’s central observer. \nThe swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected CM will be held tomorrow in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The safron party has clinched victory in the crucial assembly elections after winning a clear majority of 325 seats out of the total 403 seats, thereby making the ruling Samajwadi Party face humiliating defeat. \nMahanth Yogi Adityanath is a fifth time Member of Parliament from Gorakhpur constituency in UP. He is a BJP Member of Parliament who has represented Gorakhpur in the Lok Sabha since 1998.
