However, as Visual Capitalist's Jeff Desjardins notes, one of the few departments that did not receive a haircut was the Department of Defense. If the proposed budget ultimately passes in Congress, the DoD would be allocated an extra $54 billion in federal funding – a 10% increase that would be one of the largest one-year defense budget increases in American History. \nTo put the proposed increase in context, the United States already spends more on defense than the next seven countries combined. Meanwhile, the additional $54 billion is about the size of the United Kingdom’s entire defense budget . \n“BE ALL YOU CAN BE” \nWith over half of all U.S. discretionary spending being put towards the military each year, the U.S. is able to have extensive operations both at home and abroad. Our chart for this week breaks down military personnel based on the latest numbers released by the DoD on February 27, 2017 . \nIn total, excluding civilian support staff, there are about 2.1 million troops. Of those, 1.3 million are on active duty, while about 800,000 are in reserve or part of the National Guard. \nOn a domestic basis, there are about 1.1 million active troops stationed in the United States , and here’s how they are grouped based on branch of service: \nInternationally, there are just under 200,000 troops that are stationed in 177 countries throughout the world. \nIn 2015, Politico estimated that there are 800 U.S. bases abroad, and that it costs up to $100 billion annually to maintain this international presence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T03:54:08.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
