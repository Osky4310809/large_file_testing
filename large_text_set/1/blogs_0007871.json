Barry In Recurring Role Charlie Ridgely Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of \nIt's almost time for Gotham to return to FOX's lineup, and the network has announced that a new character will be entering the fold - and a veteran actor is taking on the role. \nRaymond J Barry has taken a recurring role on the Batman origin series, according to Deadline . The actor has had main roles on Ray Donovan , The 100 , and Justified . Most recently, the actor appeared as the terrifying main antagonist of the horror franchise film, The Purge: Election Year . (Photo: FX) \nAs far as his role on Gotham goes, the report states that Barry's character will have a heavy influence on young Bruce Wayne. Take a look at the character bio the site revealed, and you'll notice he sounds an awful lot like a popular Batman villain we've all come to know. Barry will play the temple Shaman, a mysterious figure who enters Bruceâ€™s (Mazouz) life with the stated intention of unlocking the potential of his own mind. While the Shaman says the fate of Gotham depends upon Bruce becoming the man the city needs him to become, the truth behind his intentions proves to be far more sinister. Those details seem to suggest that Barry's character could be the legendary Ra's Al Ghul. The villain began as a mentor to Bruce Wayne, and was often a thorn in his side throughout the comics. While the character could be new to Gotham, he has appeared on Arrow several times. Whether or not Barry's character is Ra's Al Ghul remains to be seen, but fans are eager to see the actor debut on the show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:47:55.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
