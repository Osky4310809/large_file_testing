Kyle just so happens to be the most famous member of a secretive self-help organization called The Institute of the Higher Mind, and while Megan has a mysterious past she's trying to conceal, Kyle has secrets of his own. \"We're just doing a scripted series on Hollywood,\" Henderson says. \"I don't put a lot of thought into it. We're a very unique story on our own.\" \"This isn't a documentary at all,\" Evangelista adds. PIC: Katie Holmes Embraces the New Year With a Makeup-Free Selfie! Michael Vartan plays the head of The Institute of the Higher Mind on the show, which some have compared to the Church of Scientology, but the former Alias star is confident there won't be any backlash from the organization. \"Our show has nothing to do with religion,\" he insists. \"I see how some people could see certain parallels that might seem like certain stories we've heard. I've never personally heard of any, but I understand that contract marriages have been going on since the '30s and the '40s.\" WATCH: Michael Vartan Says He'd 'Absolutely' Do an 'Alias' Reboot Ultimately, Abrahams says the story is two people who are in love and battling all odds to maintain their romance. \"It's really a show about these characters and their relationships, and it's a love story, and it's rare in today's television landscape that we get to tell stories like that,\" Abrahams says. \"We really have an opportunity to tell a story about these two people who fall in love and all the forces that conspire against them, and can they make it through despite all these potential problems.\" The Arrangement premieres Sunday, March 5 on E!.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T04:01:41.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
