They showed no emotion. \nHorner said it appeared that Alex had received an insufficient level of care for \"likely a number of years,\" even though the Raditas were fully trained on how to look after him. \nAlexandru, who was one of eight children, weighed less than 37 pounds when he died in 2013 of complications due to untreated diabetes and starvation. \nAlberta's chief medical examiner testified at the couple's trial that an autopsy showed the teen was severely underweight, covered in ulcers and nearly toothless.
