John Lewis has skipped after all Posted at 9:45 pm on January 16, 2017 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nRep. John Lewis managed to dominate the news this weekend by declaring that, like at least 30 (update: make that 40) other Democrat members of the House so far, he will not be attending the inauguration, nor does he consider Donald Trump a legitimate president , blaming Russian tampering in part for helping “destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.” \nOn NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Lewis said the inauguration Friday “will be the first one that I miss since I’ve been in Congress.” Rep John Lewis on #MTP : \"I don't plan to attend the inauguration..first one that I miss since I've been in Congress\" https://t.co/4wRHSuFtmM \n— Alex Moe (@AlexNBCNews) January 13, 2017 \nA few, however, fact-checked that claim and found that Lewis did not attend George W. Bush’s inauguration in 2001 either. According to this @washingtonpost story, this statement is untrue: he also boycotted GW Bush's inauguration. https://t.co/tq1pggXqnh https://t.co/NrL2A1DNSc \n— Fred Bauer (@fredbauerblog) January 16, 2017 \nHmm … according to this article published on Jan. 21, 2001, “Some members of the Black Caucus decided to boycott Inauguration Day; John Lewis, for instance, spent the day in his Atlanta district.” Why? “He thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in because he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.” John Lewis Boycotted George W. Bush’s Inauguration, Too https://t.co/Z5hl9cf8uv \n— Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) January 16, 2017 What John Lewis is doing isn't partisan. He's a man of principle who can't normalize such an unprecedented racioh wait he did it to Bush too pic.twitter.com/JA9E3v2OkF \nLooks like that excuse can be used more than once. @Heminator @NRO Funny, he said he's attended every inauguration since he's been in congress. \n— Jay Stewart (@jpstew54) January 17, 2017 John Lewis goes to every* presidential inauguration. \n*Democratic presidents only. \n— Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) January 17, 2017 @Heminator and gave the same reason, not legitimately elected. Yawn, welp. \n— Beirne White (@BeirneWhite) January 16, 2017 Almost like this isn't really about Trump https://t.co/4O714y9C3j \n— Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) January 17, 2017 @redsteeze Almost like claiming illegitimacy is a long tradition among Democrats. \nAlmost. \n— Pradheep Shanker MD (@Neoavatara) January 17, 2017 @redsteeze Also boycotted Bibi's speech to congress. \n— Doug Gorman (@DougGorman1) January 17, 2017 @Heminator is it possible for someone to be both a civil rights hero AND a knee jerk partisan?
