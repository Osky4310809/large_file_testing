This way, you can answer the “when will you get here?” question before it’s even asked. Now, you can do that in Google Maps too. Advertisement \nTo share your location with a contact all the time, open up the side menu, then tap Share Location. Tap a contact, and you’re location will be shared with them. Tap that same menu to turn off sharing. \nMore useful is sharing your ETA on a trip. To do this, start navigation, then tap the More button at the bottom of the screen. Tap Share Trip and select the friends you want to send your ETA to. You’ll stop sharing your location the second you arrive at your destination. As always, Google’s rolling this feature out gradually, so keep an eye on your Google Maps app on Android and iOS over the next week or so.
