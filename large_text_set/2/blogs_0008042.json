We should,\" Krauthammer said. \"But I think it was unnecessary to order an immediate suspension for 90 days, as if there was an imminent threat that hordes of Yemenis and Somalis were about to board airplanes and attack the United States.\" \nHe said that barring people doctors, students and grandmothers from entering the U.S. was what caused the backlash to Trump's order, and it hurt the administration's argument. \nKrauthammer noted that polls show the American public has changed its opinion on admitting Syrian refugees into the U.S., with a majority of people now in favor of the refugee resettlement program. \n\"I think it's a direct result of the fact that this was an unnecessary overshoot,\" Krauthammer said. \"Yes, tighten up the vetting. But there was no reason to suspend the visits of people who were already in the air.\" \nWatch more above, and let us know what you think in the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:16:32.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
