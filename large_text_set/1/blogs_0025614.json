For a start, it’s outside – the musicians performing on a converted balcony in a house that overlooks the city. For another, nobody’s exactly keeping an eye on the clock – musicians limber up as and when they feel the need to contribute, with the natural ebb and flow of the day absorbed into the vibe of the music.\nIt’s here – among the chirping crickets and occasional interruptions of wind and rain – that some of Jamaica’s biggest legends regrouped to record Soul of Jamaica, part of French label Chapter Two ’s Inna De Yard project. The likes of the Viceroys, Ken Boothe and Cedric Myton of the Congos were all present to rework old classics with fresh, acoustic arrangements. And a new generation of talent – such as Var and Derajah – were brought on board to offer their vision of reggae’s future.\n\nLuckily there was a cameraman present to capture it all beautifully – in this first instalment we get to see Kiddus I performing Jah Power, Jah Glory and explaining the roots of the project. And we witness the Viceroys recording for the very first time with Ken Boothe. “I don’t just sing for money,” says Boothe. “I have to sing for the love of music.”\nA full report on the Inna De Yard sessions from Kingston will be available to read on the Guardian in March – until then enjoy this video!\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Inside Jamaica’s most chilled-out reggae studio", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T18:11:18.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
