It is currently based in the eastern Mediterranean where it is helping carry out anti-terrorist operations in Syria. The ship carries Su-33 fighter jets along with Ka-27 and Ka-27S helicopters for anti-submarine warfare. Unlike other aircraft carriers, the Admiral Kuznetsov also serves as a missile cruiser, as it is equipped with Kinzhal (Dagger) missiles that it can use to protect itself from incoming aerial attacks, as well as enemy warships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T15:45:16.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
