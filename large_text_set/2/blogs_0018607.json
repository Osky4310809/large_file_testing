Days after outspoken Trump-supporter Milo Yiannopoulos appeared on Bill Maher's panel of idiots where he was subject to a liberal hit-job, the left decided to execute operation McMuffin; a collaboration between liberals and former CIA \"never-Trumper\" Evan McMullin to strategically release dredged up flippant remarks Milo made about homosexual grooming - which led to a canceled book deal and his resignation as tech editor for Breitbart. With over 1500 sex trafficking and child exploitation arrests in the first month of Trump's presidency, this was clearly the left's desperate attempt to try and insinuate some sort of hypocrisy on the right concerning pedophilia. Weak.\nThe MSM, predictably, wasted no time attacking Milo - a strategy which surely couldn't backfire:\nSalon.com even deleted a pro-pedophilia article so they wouldn't look like total hypocrites when they ran an story quoting Bill Maher , who took credit for kicking off the Milo smear campaign:\nHours later, thanks to 4chan and Reddit - the tides are turning, and Bill Maher's about to get blown the fuck out...\nTurns out the 61 year old host of HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher , who attends a $75K / year elite Los Angeles sex club, is also a huge fan of pedophilia as long as the abuser is a woman - as told in a 2007 issue of Playboy magazine:\nThis isn't the first time Maher has defended statutory rape. While the official DSM definition of pedophilia has an age cutoff of 13 , the HBO host vehemently defended former teacher and convicted statutory child rapist Mary Kay Letourneau for having a sexual relationship with one of her students, which began when the boy was 12 - firmly putting Maher's advocacy for the relationship in pedo territory.\n(Note how Henry Rollins is completely on point?)\n Karma Bill, karma. Oh, and about that sex club mentioned earlier; it appears Maher is into some Eyes Wide Shut shit. While normally I wouldn't care - the hypocrisy of his ivory tower judgment of a gay conservative, and the fact that he piled on and took credit for kicking off Milo's \"downfall\" for the exact same practice he's advocated several times, makes it fair game to point out that the HBO host loves him some expensive orgies!\nAt a swanky party in a Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion last Saturday, I spot Bill Maher in a sea of beautiful young women and make my approach.\n“Are you a Leo?” I ask the host of HBO’s “Real Time,” while eyeing a lion pendant around his neck.\n“No, they make me wear this stupid thing because I’m a member,” he replies, stroking the back of his date, a pretty younger woman in a short black leather dress.\nSingle men pay $1,850 per party, or $1,500 if they come with a female partner. For the erotic elite, there’s an annual Dominus membership for $75,000 , which includes admission to all parties, a sterling-silver necklace with a lion pendant and access to private rooms at parties and Lawner’s network of sex experts.\nThe sex club also has an interesting initiation:\nDominus members sign a “ blood oath ,” involving blood and a paper document, to join — but Lawner won’t go into details. - NY Post\nWhat??? AIDS tests are in the back of the store at the pharmacy counter, Bill.\nThe crickets are warming up for yet another prolonged silence from the MSM.", "external_links": ["https://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/files/2017/02/23.png", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/zerohedge/feed", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170223021751/http://nypost.com/2017/02/01/inside-las-most-exclusive-sex-party/", "http://www.cafepress.com/zerohedge", "http://zerohedge-newsletter.iclnd.com/", "https://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/files/2017/02/oopsa.png", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VrOsEVrD0PA?feature=oembed", "https://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/files/2017/02/total.jpg", "https://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/files/2017/02/1487651062844.jpg", "https://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/files/2017/02/posta.png", "https://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/files/2017/02/salon2.png", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/awY1MRlMKMc?feature=oembed", "https://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/files/2017/02/salon12.png"], "published": "2017-02-23T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:40:49.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
