Sanders returned to the NBA by joining the injury-hit Cleveland Cavaliers after a two-year absence following testing positive for marijuana. AFP \nLOS ANGELES, United States — Free agent Larry Sanders ended his two-year exile from the NBA by joining the injury-hit Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday, the team announced. \nFormer Bucks star Sanders, 28, has not played since 2015, when he walked away from the NBA following multiple positive tests for marijuana. \nHe later underwent treatment for anxiety, depression and mood disorders. ADVERTISEMENT \nHowever he announced in January his intention to return to the sport and Cleveland have swooped following the injury which ruled out Andrew Bogut for the remainder of the season. \nAussie big man Bogut was waived by the Cavs on Monday, the team confirmed. \nSanders was selected by the Bucks with the 15th overall pick in the 2010 draft. In five seasons with Milwaukee he averaged 6.5 points, 5.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game. \nCleveland star LeBron James said at the weekend Sanders would be welcome at the Cavs. \n“With his hiatus, I don’t know what he was going through so I can’t comment about somebody’s personal life because I wasn’t a part of it,” James told Cleveland.com. \n“But it looks like he wants another opportunity and hopefully if we’re the team, hopefully we give him an opportunity. Why not? \n“Everyone deserves a second chance and it looks like he wants to get back to playing the game he loves and hopefully this is his destination. You don’t know how much you can get out of a guy that’s been out so long, but I’d love to see it. Why not?” CBB", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:54:25.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
