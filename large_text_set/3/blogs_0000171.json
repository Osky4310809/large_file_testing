Maybe it was a job you didn't think you were qualified enough for. Maybe it was an outfit you didn't think you were fit enough to pull off. Or maybe it was a relationship that you avoided because you thought you were genuinely too impossible to be with. \nThis new video for \"Don't Feel Bad\" from Daisyhead, a four-piece rock band from Nashville, is about the latter. \"Rest assured I will let you down, and don't you dare feel bad, I wouldn't stick around for me,\" screams the singer over a thick wall of guitar, in a frustrating but very recognizable example of what happens when you let your low self-esteem win. \nWatch below and feel emo. \nThe band's second studio album, In Case You Missed It , is due out on April 28, 2017 and will be available to pre-order from No Sleep Records here . They've been through a band lineup change and a near breakup, so it's enough of a celebration that they made it this far to pour that emotion into their new tracks. \nFollow Noisey on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T06:23:21.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
