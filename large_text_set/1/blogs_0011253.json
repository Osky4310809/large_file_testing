This southern classic is simple to make, it has infinite possible twists, and it can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner (we prefer and ). This version from chef of New Orleans restaurant Compère Lapin and Top Chef alum Nina Compton is as good as it gets. RECIPE: Shrimp and Grits \nThese shrimp and grits go together like Netflix and chill: the grits are perfectly creamy and cheesy, providing the soft, inviting bed for the succulent shrimp; the ragu is savory and spicy; and the egg on top ensures it’s perfectly acceptable to eat right after you wake up in the morning. \nPlus, the whole thing only takes about a half hour to make: not bad for a dish whose leftovers you can eat at any time of day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T18:43:42.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
