Ben Riley-Smith , Assistant Political Editor  15pm \nA n inquiry into “fake news” is set to be launched by an influential cross-party committee of MPs within months amid fears the phenomenon is undermining democracy. \nExecutives at Facebook, Google and Twitter are expected to be called into Parliament and grilled on whether they are doing enough to stop the trend. \nThe Commons Culture Committee is discussing launching the inquiry internally and hopes it can begin holding sessions by late spring or early summer. \nDamian Collins, the Tory chairman of the committee, told the Telegraph he fears “malicious” fake news is especially damaging around elections.

There are calls for internet giants like Facebook and Twitter to do more to stop fake news circulating. \nM r Collins said: “Some fake news is presented to look like real news coming from real news websites. It can be difficult to distinguish between them. \n“The concern is a fake story can get out and be distributed on the internet and become the received wisdom before the truth can get out. The truth is always trying to catch up with a fake news story.” \nHe said that “clearly” some fake news is being distributed “maliciously” and questioned whether social media companies were doing enough to combat this. \n“What’s interesting is we've accepted that search engines have a responsibility to combat piracy on their websites,” Mr Collins said. \n“In a similar way, I think social media [companies] have a responsibility to ensure their platforms are not being used to spread malicious content. \n“Particularly around elections there is a responsibility to democracy as well to ensure their platforms aren’t being perverted to support the distribution of fake and malicious news.” Donald Trump recently attacked news organisations over 'fake news'.

It is an essential part of our free speech and our democracy.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:19:13.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
