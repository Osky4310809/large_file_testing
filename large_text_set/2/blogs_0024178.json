This applies to all Mazda models excluding the BT-50 pick-up truck , which retains the same warranty as before. \nThis finally puts Mazda on par with most mainstream manufacturers in terms of warranty coverage, although it should be pointed out that its mileage limit is still below the likes of Proton and Perodua, which have a 150,000 km limit. Honda, Toyota and Nissan, on the other hand, all offer unlimited-mileage warranties, with Nissan having a class-leading seven-year coverage . \nAside from the extended warranty, Bermaz also provides a three-year/60,000 km free service package on all models (again except the BT-50), the same as before.
