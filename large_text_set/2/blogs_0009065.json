It was the first trip to the playoffs for the Raiders since their Super Bowl appearance against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at the end of the 2002-03 season. The team didn’t post a single winning record over the next 13 seasons before making the playoffs last season. \nThe new four-year contract would keep Del Rio with the Raiders through the 2020 season.
