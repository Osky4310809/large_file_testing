However, unlike Instagram, Retrica will allow you to apply those filters in real time, so you can see how a photo will look even before you take it. In total, Retrica includes more than eighty different filters with many different styles, although all of them have a 'vintage' spin to them. You will find filters with sepia tones, black and white tones, muted tones, etc. There are definitely filters for all different tastes and (almost) every color. In addition to being able to take normal photos, you can also make photo collages in Retrica just by selecting that option. You can take single photos or take up to nine consecutive snapshots in order to create a fun, original composition. Retrica also includes other options like artificial shading (also included in Instagram) or a timer, which allows you to take photos using a tripod. Retrica is an excellent photo app. After triumphing in iOS, where it became one of the main points of reference in the category, it has now arrived to Android and it offers some very nice, completely free features. Instagram releases Layout, its own collage-creating app \nIt’s odd, considering its status and media impact, that Instagram hasn’t gotten on this particular ball before. Layout is a completely independent tool that lets you create collages of your photos and manipulate them as desired (including with filters). You can post your collages to both Instagram and Facebook or any other social network associated with your smartphone. Having already been launched for iOS, Layout has now just been launched for Android.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:59:04.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
