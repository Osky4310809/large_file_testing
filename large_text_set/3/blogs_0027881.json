CBC quoted the group’s regional director in Quebec, who decried the imam’s quoting of an Islamic hadith: “This is inciting violence, and this is inciting radicalization.” \nCNN’s Jake Tapper zeroed in on the channel’s reporting on the issue in a Friday re-Tweet (see screengrab below): \nThe Canadian broadcast outlet also noted that some in the wider Muslim community in Quebec blasted the sermon for directing “hatred towards non-Muslims.” \nCBC later quoted a representative from B’nai Brith Canada, who criticized the city’s police for not acting quickly enough against anti-Jewish hate speech, as it was “the second complaint against a Montreal-area mosque filed with the Montreal police’s hate crime unit in just over 40 days.” \n[image via screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
