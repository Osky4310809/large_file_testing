We’re welcoming 2017 with its neighbor, an elegant finished Book Cadillac penthouse that has a chandelier in the bathroom. This 2,500-square-foot condo is one of the three stand alone units on top of the Book Cadillac, and it’s going all out with an asking price of $2,495,000, making it the most expensive single family listing in Detroit right now. This is nearing $1,000 per square foot...in Detroit. This condo has three bedrooms, two and a half baths, and 35-foot vaulted ceilings in the living room. The master bath has Italian Carrera marble and a chandelier. The kitchen is loaded with high end appliances, custom cabinetry, and Brazilian marble counter tops. From this penthouse atop the Westin Book Cadillac, the new owner can gaze at the river, Ambassador Bridge, and downtown Detroit.
