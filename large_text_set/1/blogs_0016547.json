Last night’s performance in Hobart, Australia, marked their first show since Cave’s son Arthur tragically died in July 2015 , an event that weighs heavily on the new album. We’ve collected videos of the band performing tracks from the album; watch them below. \n“Girl in Amber”: \n“Magneto”: \n“Skeleton Tree”: \nCave also granted his first interview since his son’s death to The Australian (via NME ), talking about the making of Skeleton Tree . “For me, going into the studio in Paris was not a good idea, and I hope I never have to do anything like that again,” he said. “It was only a few months after Arthur died. It was too early. But it just felt important that I do it. You know, life goes on and all. It was crazy. Terrifying, really.” \nHe also talked about the fan reaction to the album’s companion film, One More Time With Feeling , and how it helped him move on: “You know, I saw the things people wrote about the film on social media … the way the film seemed to open something very deep for people, and how so many people out there had lost people they loved, you know, just how many grievers there were. It was a very powerful feeling, and ultimately shifted something in me, and Susie too, and stopped us feeling so completely hopeless all the time. It was like we had done something good for Arthur, all of us, and had placed the memory of him up there in the stars.” \nNick Cave and the Bad Seeds 2017 Tour Dates: 01/15 – Ballarat, AU @ North Gardens 01/17 – Wellington, NZ @ TSB Bank Arena 01/18 – Auckland, NZ @ Vector Arena 01/20 – Sydney, AU @ ICC Sydney Theatre 01/21 – Sydney, AU @ ICC Sydney Theatre 01/22 – Newcastle, AU @ Newcastle Entertainment Centre 01/25 – Brisbane, AU @ Riverstage 01/27 – Melbourne, AU @ Sidney Myer Music Bowl 01/28 – Melbourne, AU @ Sidney Myer Music Bowl 01/29 – Adelaide, AU @ Adelaide Entertainment Centre 01/31 – Perth, AU @ Perth Arena 05/26 – Brooklyn, NY @ Kings Theatre 05/27 – Brooklyn, NY @ Kings Theatre 05/29 – Montreal, QC @ Metropolis 05/31 – Toronto, ON @ Massey Hall 06/01 – Toronto, ON @ Massey Hall 06/03 – Detroit, MI @ Masonic Temple Theatre 06/05 – Philadelphia, PA @ Electric Factory 06/07 – Asheville, NC @ Thomas Wolfe Auditorium 06/08 – Pittsburgh, PA @ The Warhol at Carnegie Music Hall 06/10 – Boston, MA @ Boch Center Wang Theatre 06/13 – New York, NY @ Beacon Theatre 06/14 – New York, NY @ Beacon Theatre 06/16 – Chicago, IL @ Auditorium Theatre 06/18 – Denver, CO @ Paramount Theatre 06/19 – Salt Lake City, UT @ Kingsbury Hall 06/21 – Portland, OR @ Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall 06/22 – Vancouver, BC @ Queen Elizabeth Theatre 06/24 – Berkeley, CA @ Greek Theatre 06/26 – San Diego, CA @ Civic Theatre 06/29 – Los Angeles, CA @ Greek Theatre Artists", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T14:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T12:18:10.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
