He was eventually taken off on a stretcher after nearly 14 minutes of treatment to be replaced by Philip Billing. \nThe stoppage understandably knocked the Terriers a little off track, and it was Bristol City who opened the scoring on the half-hour mark as Tomlin capitalised on a Hudson error at the back before rounding the goalkeeper and slotting home. \nHuddersfield continued to look laboured throughout the rest of the half, and in the very last of the 14 added minutes, Bristol City doubled their lead. David Cotterill picked up possession on the right before whipping an absolute peach of a ball into the path of Abraham in the box, but he still had plenty to do as he darted across his man before poking the ball inside Huddersfield's near post with a delightful, instinctive finish. \nBristol City should have put the game to bed just after the break as Abraham whipped a ball right onto the head of Callum O'Dowda in the middle, but his header was touched onto the bar by Danny Ward in the Huddersfield goal. \nAnd a flat Terriers performance was compounded in the closing stages as Flint flicked home a third with a classy backheel on 79 minutes, while Cotterill thumped a fourth four minutes later from the spot after Joe Bryan had gone down under a Billing challenge in the box.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:07:29.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
