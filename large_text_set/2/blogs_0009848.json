Then we have a fast day where we try to train for at least 60 per cent of the session above game-speed. \n\"We don’t do any extra fitness. It’s all done within those training sessions.” \nA week after Ben Te’o struck eight minutes from time to beat France, Elliot Daly broke Welsh hearts with a 76th-minute winner in Cardiff. \nJones joked afterwards that England had used up all their get-out-of-jail-free cards, but the science behind their training suggests it is less down to luck than preparation. \nAs Mourinho put it: “For me, training means to train in specificity. That is, to create exercises that allow me to exacerbate my principles of play.” England have taken a page out of Mourinho's book to improve late in games (Photo: Man Utd via Getty) \nWhen Jones took over the England job, he quickly concluded fitness levels were not high enough to beat the best. \nHe was shocked by England’s ‘bounce time’ – the period between a player hitting the turf and getting back into the game. \n“I think some of the blokes had a cup of tea and a scone with jam and cream before they got off the ground,” he recalled. “It was terrible. In terms of getting off the ground we are still seven per cent below New Zealand – so we are still not where we need to be. \n“We are not happy being the best team in Europe, we want to be the best in the world.” \nFor much of Saturday’s game, they did not even look the best team in Cardiff. \nThey started well and led through a fine team try, finished by Ben Youngs on the 26th phase.

Wales’ did not. \nBut above all England now believe so strongly in their levels of fitness that they do not recognise a lost cause. \n“We know we can wear teams down,” said Jones. “We were always in a position to win.” Wing Williams went over for the hosts after a well-worked backline move (Photo: AFP/Getty) Read More Skipper Hartley insists he's still a key man despite being subbed seven minutes into second half \nThe energy and determination not to lose, he added, had been forged in the crucible of humiliation. \n“Some of them were here (in Cardiff) in 2013 when they got their pants pulled down,” he said. “A lot were involved in the World Cup where they got beaten in the pools.” \nThose nightmares are distant memories. \nEngland roll on, very much fit for purpose. poll loading Will England win 19 in a row? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:22:30.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
