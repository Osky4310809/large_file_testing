And in that time, it became even meaner. The car packs a tweaked, twin-turbocharged W12 engine that now pumps out 700 horsepower and 750 lb-ft of torque. That's an extra 79 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque over the old model .\n\nWith output like that, it's no surprise the new Supersports can demolish a 0-60 mph run in 3.4 seconds and has a top speed of 209 mph. The convertible also returns, although the soft top does cost a bit of outright speed. It's 0.3 seconds slower to 60 mph with a time of 3.7 seconds. It also has a slower top speed of 205 mph. But the headroom is amazing.\n\nFortunately, Bentley has equipped the new Supersports with handling and stopping upgrades, too. The suspension is lower and stiffer than normal a Continental GT. Power goes through a torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system. That all-wheel-drive system also diverts 60 percent of the power to the rear by default, but can adjust the bias as needed. To bring all 5,000+ pounds of the Supersports to a stop, it has massive carbon ceramic brakes at each corner â€“ 16.5 inches up front, and 14 inches in back.\n\nThe Supersports sports plenty of style changes, too, although whether they're upgrades is up to the beholder. The car has sprouted a wide array of vents, gills, and wings. It also gets some huge 21-inch forged wheels and rifled exhaust tips. An \"X Specification\" package also gives buyers the option of eight two-tone color schemes along with carbon fiber mirrors and other trim pieces. It also includes a titanium exhaust that saves about 10 pounds of weight. Inside is plenty of leather and Alcantara, along with a new dash trim in a checkered carbon fiber finish. Of course other existing Bentley trims and veneers are also available. Bentley did not give details on pricing or availability of the Supersports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:38:03.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
