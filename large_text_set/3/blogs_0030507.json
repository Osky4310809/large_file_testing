Some of the new changes require a one-time activation code to play new games. This means that purchased games cannot be resold, and the console itself will require a constant Internet connection. \nFor consumers who live in neighborhoods that don’t have the best bandwidth, this could be a dealbreaker. If Microsoft moves forward with these plans, gamers can no longer share games among friends, and will not be able to buy second-hand games from well-known stores such as Gamestop and Best Buy.
