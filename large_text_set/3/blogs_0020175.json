It is a painfully sad moment for Liverpool, but for the entire football world too, because he really was a true football man. \nMoran was synonymous with the Anfield boot room. He may have been born, and lived most of his life, in a modest Crosby dwelling a short journey away from the famous old Stadium, but for this Liverpool great, that pokey cubby hole hidden under the stands was his real home. \nMany say the boot room is the spiritual home of Liverpool Football Club, and that legend was born thanks in no small part to the man who served the club for half a century as player, coach and - briefly - manager.

He was a player when Bill Shankly arrived in 1959, and became his captain, with the new manager recognising the leadership and mentality he wanted to navigate the club from second division backwaters towards the European high seas. \nMoran joined Liverpool as a 15 year old in 1949, combining his role as left back in the 'C' team with an electrician's apprenticeship, before turning professional and making his debut for the first team as an 18 year old in 1952.

Most of the players the new manager inherited were discarded because they didn't know how to be winners, according to Shanks. \nBut not Moran, he helped steer the Reds back into the First Division in 1962, and was a regular member of the side that won the title two years later. \nHe missed out on the FA Cup final in 1965 as his playing career drew to a close, but when his replacement at left back Gerry Byrne dislocated a shoulder, he returned to play both legs of the infamous European Cup semi final with Inter Milan. \nThe away defeat under controversial circumstances - where Shankly claimed the referee was bribed and history subsequently vindicated the claim - was his last as a first team player who earned the princely sum of Â£30 a week at the peak of his career.

But Moran was far more than that, a driven coach who pressed his players to improve, and never be satisfied with their latest triumph. \nHe was Mr Liverpool. The thread between the doldrum days of the second division and the greatest European nights of all. He was, as Robbie Fowler said \"a man who not only had Liverpool in his blood, but WAS the lifeblood of Liverpool.\" \nPerhaps the biggest tribute of all though, is that Ronnie Moran will be remembered forever at Liverpool Football Club.
