The event has previously been held on Facebook on February 4 for the last two years.\nIn 2015 (on February 4) Mark Zuckerberg wrote: ‘Today is a day to celebrate friends. It’s also Facebook’s birthday, but today isn’t about celebrating us. It’s about friendship.\n‘Friendship isn’t a distraction from the meaningful things in life. Friendship is what gives meaning to our lives.\n‘Our friendships make the world work. We laugh, we cry and we learn with friends. We eat, we shop and we work with friends. And when we fight for what we believe and change the world, we do that with friends too.’\nPeak when facebook shows you a personalised 'friends day' video and it just shows you ur family members lmao.\n— ❋✿Talaylay✿❋ (@taylarwong) February 2, 2017 \n\nThe UN says the official friendship day was created in 2011 to ‘recognise the relevance and importance of friendship as a noble and valuable sentiment in the lives of human beings around the world.’\nHowever the reaction to this year’s Friends’ Day has left many asking why it happened.\nSome bemused users took to Twitter to share how less than impressed they were with the innovation.\n*opens Facebook*\nSees only Friends Day videos! \n*closes the app* pic.twitter.com/fVrLorVauz \n— Shruti Sud (@shrutsays) February 2, 2017 \n\"Happy Friends Day, Philip! Here is a montage of photos of you with people you don't speak to any more. Enjoy!\" – Facebook.\n— Philip Ellis (@Philip_Ellis) February 2, 2017 \nIt's Friends day on Facebook pic.twitter.com/wcPTrQ698b \n— Betty (@BettySC91) February 2, 2017 \nMy Facebook \"Happy Friends Day\" video seems mainly comprised of people I met once backstage at Park at Glastonbury…\n— Dan Cadwallader (@Dancad) February 2, 2017 \nFacebooks friends day video is one ugly design. Eeooowww my timeline is all filled up with that creepy dance & music #facebook \n— Asma Sultan (@asma_sultan) February 2, 2017 \nHappy friends day!!!!
