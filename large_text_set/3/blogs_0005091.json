Public good \nThis would mean giving cities and larger local authorities the right to create \"new home zones\", where land can be bought at the value of its existing use. \nAnd public, private and voluntary organisations would be encouraged to work together to build homes for the public good, rather than private profit. \nIt cites examples of homebuilding by Victorian philanthropists like Sir Edward Guinness, who donated £200,000 to set up the Guinness Trust in London, and the Georgian new towns of Edinburgh and Bath, the Edwardian Garden Cities and the post-war \"new towns\" and garden suburbs. \nA Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \"We've already got the country building again with the highest number of housing starts for nine years. And since 2010, government-backed schemes have helped more than 362,000 households to buy a home of their own. \n\"But there is more to do and our Housing White Paper will help do just that, making sure this is a country that works for everyone.\" \nIt added that its reforms would help build more well-designed and affordable homes, encourage smaller scale building and give local councils the powers they need to get homes in the places that people want to live. \nA spokesman for the Home Builders Federation said the only way to address the housing crisis was to increase supply over a sustained period. \nHe said there had been a 52% increase in the number of homes over the past three years, but added that more needed to be done. \n\"Help to Buy has played a significant part in the increase in supply by helping over 100,000 people, the vast majority of who are first-time buyers, purchase their own home. \n\"The industry is committed to delivering further increases in supply and more of all types and sizes of homes such that we can better match supply to demand.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:48:23.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
