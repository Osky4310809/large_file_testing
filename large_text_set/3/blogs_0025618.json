(Photo: Courtesy of Milt Habeck). More The father of a girl who was suspended by her school for allegedly selling “sex toys” is calling for the dismissal of the principal . On February 10, Trinity Lutheran Church & School in Racine, Wisconsin, handed 12-year-old Frances Habeck a three-day suspension for selling “dildos” to her classmates, however her father Milt Habeck says the cylindrical tubes commonly known as “water snakes” are merely toys. “Frances had never heard of the word ‘dildo’ before the school taught it to her,” Milt tells Yahoo Beauty. “I’m calling this dido-gate.” Frances volunteers at Sunday school and first learned of the toy there while caring for an autistic child. “She was trying different ways to comfort him but nothing worked, not even hugs,” says Milt. “She found the water snake in his wheelchair and since it provided comfort, she decided to sell them and give a third of the proceeds to charity.” In mid-January, after getting permission from her teacher to sell the toys during recess and lunchtime, Frances opened shop, selling two-dozen toys for about a dollar per piece. According to Milt, when Principal Pamela Amling discovered the snakes she demanded that students forfeit them or be subject to desk searches, then lectured Francis in front of her classmates. In a post on the site Vindicate Frances , Milt describes the treatment as “sexual harassment, shame, and public humiliation.” “The principal also searched everyone’s lockers and found a cardboard box in Francis’ that contained sales receipts,” he adds. “Frances had named the toys “Dyllies,” after a type of ice cream and the principal assumed they were sex toys.” Yahoo Beauty could not reach a school representative for comment, however, according to a press release sent from Reverend David Gehne, toys of any kind aren’t allowed on campus and Francis had ignored orders to stop sales. What’s more, parents had complained about the toys’ “sexual overtones.” The school also denies that Frances was suspended for three days, clarifying that her punishment lasted one day. And that the matter was resolved at a March 13 school board meeting which Francis’ parents attended. However, on March 22, Milt called for the termination of Amling, the resignation of Trinity Education Board President Kevin Zawicki, and the removal of Gehne and Pastor Stephen Jennings, due to what he calls a “cover-up” in the school’s actions. Milton is also pulling all three of his children from Trinity Lutheran Church & School however, the children have to finish the remainder of the year. “My daughter’s grades have slipped and she cries herself to sleep,” says Milton. “Imagine being a 6 th grade girl and being accused of selling sex toys at school,” Read more from Yahoo Style & Beauty:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T06:12:43.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
