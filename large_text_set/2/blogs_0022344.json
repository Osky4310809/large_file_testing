They rescued a 6-day old colt from the bottom of a ravine. The poor baby had been there for a shocking two days , with a broken pelvis and freezing in a pool of water. To make matters worse, the colts broken pelvis was close to severing a major artery with any movement her made. After the Fremont Fire Department and Fremont Animal Services successfully got the colt out of the ravine, hope for this sweet boy surviving was bare. “He has a will to live,” Sarah Cattaneo of Fremont Animal Services said. “The vet was shocked that he made it through it.” One year ago, Valentine the baby horse was found abandoned with a broken pelvis at the bottom of a ravine. \nNow named Valentine, the former owner of the colt surrendered him to the city of Fremont. Valentine was quickly rushed to UC Davis for emergency treatment and we are happy to say he survived his surgery and rehabilitation. Ready to see Valentine today? Watch the above video to see how happy Valentine is now just one year later. The Fremont Police Department posted the video to their Facebook page and note that Valentine is spending time with a trainer and is doing wonderfully. The trainer said , “he is a pleasure to be around.” And we can certainly see why. He looks so happy and healthy! \nShare this post with your friends and family to brighten their day.
