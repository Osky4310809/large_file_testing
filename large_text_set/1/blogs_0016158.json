Although Ivanka has said she does not plan to have a formal role in the Trump administration, her husband will serve as a senior adviser to her father. \nDuring the interview, Ivanka noted that she will continue in her friendship with former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, and turn to her for advice. The two women had become friends in New York City, but their friendship was put on the back burner during the hard-fought presidential campaign between Trump and Hillary Clinton.   \nIvanka noted that she will miss her New York City office and her roles as an executive vice president with the Trump Organization and the head of her brand of clothing and jewelry. \n“It’s emotional that I’m stepping away from my business,” she said. \nAlthough Ivanka has said she will not serve as a first lady substitute, experts expect she will remain a highly public figure. \nHistorian Carl Sferrazza Anthony of the National First Ladies Library in Canton, Ohio., likened Ivanka Trump to Julie Nixon Eisenhower.
