Getty Images \nThe BJP issued a whip to its MLAs to attend the special meeting that was held at 10 am on Wednesday. \nThe glaring lack of communication between the two parties was evident for the second time with the first being when the land handover ceremony for the former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray memorial land was held at the Shivaji Park. Only one Shiv Sena MLA had turned out for the event with the BJP quick to take credit for the grant. \nWith the opposition MLAs resorting to disruptive tactics like displaying banners on the floor of the House when the Budget speech of Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar was on, state Parliamentary Affairs Minister Girish Bapat presented the proposal seeking the suspension of the 19 MLAs for their unruly behaviour. During the Budget day speech, these MLAs had raised slogans demanding loan waiver for farmers. Some members had even raised banners inside the house, while some burnt copies of Budget outside the house in Vidhan Bhawan campus. \nBagde suspended 19 opposition MLAs till 31 December 2017 for insulting the House. Out of the 19 suspended MLAs, 10 belong to the NCP while nine are from the Congress. However, the Shiv Sena which was taken by surprise had too little time to decide which side they are on. \nDespite the initial jolt, senior ministers from the Shiv Sena after receiving instructions from party supremo Uddhav Thackeray met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis seeking revocation of the suspension. \nThe Shiv Sena delegation pointed out to Fadnavis that the suspension was not legal. The proposal for the suspension was made after the House met after a three-day recess. \n\"We are not sad over the suspension, but the way the government is trying to silence the voice for farmers is worrying,\" said NCP MLA Jitendra Awhad, who was suspended. \nThe state government, however, justified its action. \"No one has the right to burn copies of the State Budget. They were objecting without even listening to the Budget speech,\" said Mungantiwar. \nHowever, opposition party leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and NCP leader Ajit Pawar sought that the suspensions be revoked immediately otherwise threatening to boycott the ongoing session entirely. \nThe Budget session of the Assembly ends on 7 April. \n 25  25 pm Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:08:20.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
