It's unclear from which storey, but it looks high enough to at least incapacitate her at least. \nAccording to footage uploaded on the All Singapore Stuff Facebook page, the Indonesian lady had to be coaxed and reassured that she would be able to return back to her home country. Unbeknownst to her, the conversation was a ruse to let Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers get into a hidden position before they grabbed her back to safety. As you can see, the suicidal lady wasn't too pleased about getting rescued. \nWhatever the outcome of the investigations, hopefully the distressed maid gets to return back to her homeland. How distressed must she have been to climb out onto the ledge?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T12:56:50.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
