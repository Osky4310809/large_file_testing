We have to win. We have to start winning wars again,\" he said. \"I have to say, when I was young, in high school and college, everybody used to say that we never lost a war. 'We never lost a war.' You remember. And now we never win a war. We never win. And we don't fight to win.\"\nTrump also said that the war in the Middle East has not been successful and has \"gone nowhere.\"\n\"Actually, if you think about it, we're less than nowhere,\" he said, The Week reported.\nTrump also made controversial comments this week about former President Barack Obama - claiming that he believes Obama is behind the leaks within the Trump White house and responsible for the angry town hall attendees and protesters throughout the country. \n\"It turns out his organization seems to do a lot of these organizing to some of the protests that these Republicans are seeing around the country against you. Do you believe President Obama is behind it and if he is, is that a violation of the so-called unsaid presidents' code?\" Trump was asked on Fox and Friends, CNN reported. \n\"No, I think he is behind it. I also think it is politics, that's the way it is,\" he replied.\n\"You never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes. You know, you're probably right or possibly right, but you never know. No, I think that President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly behind it. And some of the leaks possibly come from that group, which are really serious because they are very bad in terms of national security. But I also understand that is politics. In terms of him being behind things, that's politics. And it will probably continue.\"\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:47:39.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
