It's waterproof \nThe waterproof feature often seems to be reserved for top-range devices, especially at Samsung. Luckily, things have changed this year because Samsung has decided to make its A3 and A5 models waterproof. Both devices have an IP68 certification , just the same as that which was given to their big brother: the Samsung Galaxy S7 . \nThis certification means they are protected against water and dust. Not only can you use your device in the rain but you can submerge it in water up to 1.5 meters deep for a maximum duration of 30 minutes. Sounds too good to be true? We have the proof: the smartphone we tested was submerged under water for several minutes and it's still working now. Is your smartphone waterproof? A note on IP67 and IP68 ratings 2. It's compact in size \nThis is probably the smartphone’s main selling point. While the current trend is for manufacturers to produce devices with larger screens (to such an extent that foldable screen technology is now being developed), some users still remain loyal to screens measuring less than 5 inches. Unfortunately, relatively few manufacturers are producing high-quality devices with a small screen. In the top-range domain, there are hardly any and in the mid-range market, Sony is the only one: Sony Xperia Z5 Compact (former top-range Sony) and Sony Xperia X Compact . \nThe new Samsung Galaxy A3 has the advantage of being less expensive than the Sony Xperia X Compact and is also waterproof, a concept that Sony abandoned with its X Compact. With a 4.7-inch screen, the A3 2017 will delight all compact screen enthusiasts. There aren’t many competitors with a 4.7-inch screen. / © AndroidPIT 3. It has good battery life \nLast year, one of the A3’s main strengths was its battery life. This year, again, the phone doesn’t let its users down. That said, it's important to point out that Samsung does everything it can to optimize the device: the slight improvements in capacity compared to the previous model (from 2,300 to 2,350 mAh) and the simple HD definition (720 x 1,280) enable these excellent results. \nThe slight improvements in capacity compared to the previous model and the simple HD definition enable these excellent results. \nThe battery life obviously depends on how you use your smartphone but if you use your device intensively (videos, chats, games…), you should get at least a day and a half of battery life. You can double your battery life with moderate usage! How to save battery life on your Android device 4. It comes with a great camera \nGenerally, mid-range devices don’t stand out because of their cameras. Everything taken into consideration, the A3’s camera is great. Of course, it doesn’t have the same potential the high-end devices have but it still allows you to take high-quality images with the 13-megapixel camera and an f/1.9 aperture. \nSometimes you have to take your time taking a photo in order to get the best lighting but on the whole, the photos are good and details are captured well. When lighting isn’t great, the quality is affected but we were satisfied with the results for a camera in this range. The camera lens barely protrudes. / © AndroidPIT 5. Its design and finish is worthy of the Samsung Galaxy S7 \nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 was the design inspiration for the A3 and A5, that much is obvious. The Galaxy S7 is a beautiful smartphone and this new A3 is just as elegant. The finishes are perfect, the handling is excellent, it’s a visual delight… The brushed casing is as close to perfection as you can manage - even the camera lens barely protrudes. However, while we’re talking about the back of the phone, it's important to point out that it has a glass cover. \nOn the front, on the Home button, Samsung has placed a fingerprint scanner. On the right-hand side, there is a SIM card and microSD card slot. Samsung is therefore offering us more than ever on a device designed for the mid-range market. \nAre you considering buying the Samsung A3 (2017)? Do you think is it still too expensive for a mid-range device?
