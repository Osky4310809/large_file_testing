The reality, however, is that they’re far closer in points to the Baggies (7 ahead) than they are to leaders Chelsea (19 behind).\nAntonio Conte report card: Near-perfect start with Chelsea on course for the double Arsene Wenger has understandably taken the flak for another poor result in what is now officially his worst period in the Premier League in all his 20 years in charge, with the debate once again about the Frenchman’s tactical versatility and questionable commitment to drilling his players into good defensive habits on the training ground.\nPetr Cech does not believe that is the issue , saying yesterday: ‘We have no (problems) during preparations or in training. The issue is taking it all to matches. That’s the worst part. When things don’t go well in training, you can work on that, make it right, but this is not the case.’\nPetr Cech has admitted it’s hard work talking to his defenders (Picture: Getty) More tellingly, perhaps, was this quote from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain , who since the game in an unrelated interview told Arsenal Player: ‘On the pitch you don’t really need to speak the same language to be able to understand what each other want. It’s more just shouting and pointing and you can get by just fine by doing that.’\nCould this sum up all that’s wrong with Arsenal? While they are far from the only Premier League team these days to have a number of different nationalities all trying to communicate with each other, there have been suggestions in the past that the communication at the club is not what it could be.\nGoals conceded 2016/17 Chelsea, Tottenham – 21 \nManchester United – 23 \nManchester City, Everton – 30 \nArsenal – 34 This would certainly go some way to explaining not only a lack of defensive organisation, but also the glaring lack of team spirit and togetherness every time things seem to go wrong; not only do they simply lose to Bayern Munich, they concede three goals in less than a ten minute spell in both matches.\nMore: Football Pep Guardiola's personal phone call secures Man City's £35m summer transfer \nTransfer targets to deadwood: How Arsenal could line up next season amid talk of overhaul \nFormer Chelsea star tells Mesut Ozil not to waste his career at Fenerbahce \nThe go-to argument among Wenger’s biggest critics is that there are no leaders, no one barking out instructions to hold the team together and keep it from falling apart, but what if it’s the simple issue of language barriers meaning a clear message isn’t getting through to everyone?\nWhile it is understood that in Wenger’s early days at the club he was keen on all his players speaking English on the pitch, that seems to have changed over time if recent quotes from both players and the manager himself are anything to go by.\nArsenal were punished on set-pieces by West Brom on Saturday (Picture: Getty) ‘Everybody speaks French, with the Swiss players, the Africans, the French lads and Arsene Wenger all in there,’ Samir Nasri said shortly after joining the club in 2008. ‘It is not easy to speak English in the Arsenal dressing room. The boss talks in French when he has discussions with players and only speaks English in team meetings.’\nLast season, Cech explained the rather tricky job he has communicating with the defenders in front of him, saying: ‘I speak to the full-backs in Spanish, to (Laurent) Koscielny in French and to Per (Mertesacker) in English because for him it is the same as me. He organises people in English. Sometimes foreign players wouldn’t know what you say. That’s when you realise it’s easier to say it in their language than hoping they will understand.’\nArsenal have become seen as a soft touch defensively (Picture: Getty) Wenger is a known multi-linguist, fluent in no less than six languages, and it seems that is now the necessity for players at the club as well. With no clear common method of communication between his players, it perhaps shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that the manager himself has sent out rather mixed messages on this issue over the years.\nArsenal form (all comps) LLWLWLLWL ‘People who cannot speak together can play together because you use your body and the way you understand the game to communicate, and you can share exactly the same vision of the game,’ he said in 2012. ‘A Russian, an American and a Japanese can play together and have a fantastic time together without talking together.’\nGabriel arrived at Arsenal without speaking a word of English (Picture: Getty) However, shortly after signing Gabriel, whom he admitted was his first defensive signing to join Arsenal without speaking any English, he said: ‘Look, it is a problem. When you don’t speak English and you don’t understand: “Come out, come back, right, left,” it is a problem for a defender. You need to know the key words: “Referee. Offside. Foul”. He’s the first defender I’ve brought in with no English.’\nArsene Wenger in numbers Premier League trophies: 3\nFA Cup wins: 6\nLeague Cup and European trophies combined: 0\nNumber of times failed to qualify for Champions League (in full season in charge): 0\nYear he arrived at Arsenal: 1996\nBBC Sports Personality of the Year best coach award wins: 2\nYears since last league trophy: 13 \nIn this modern era where clubs and managers have caught up with Wenger in terms of sophistication of tactics, scouting and nutrition, the finer details are more important than ever. More than any part of the pitch, a defence has to be a unit, and that hasn’t looked the case for a long time at Arsenal.\nWith Cech having to switch between three or more languages, none of which his mother tongue, to get the bodies in front of him into shape, then it becomes easier to see where Arsenal might keep coming up short each season.\nArsenal fans have made it clear where they stand (Picture: Getty) Can Wenger survive this latest challenge? (Picture: Getty) While it would be churlish to take Oxlade-Chamberlain’s line of ‘it’s more just shouting and pointing and you can get by just fine by doing that’ as literally being the full extent of Wenger’s defensive strategy, his use of the words ‘get by just fine’ speaks volumes – the fact is, Arsenal do generally ‘get by just fine’, but that’s no longer good enough for the fans paying some of the highest ticket prices in the country.\nArsenal’s supporters made that pretty clear with their protests on Saturday. If only their players communicated so well.\nMORE: Piers Morgan offers to pay Arsene Wenger’s redundancy cheque \nMORE: Arsene Wenger needs to make this change, says Jens Lehmann \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:52:53.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
