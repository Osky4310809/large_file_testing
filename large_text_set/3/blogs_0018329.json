The Football Whispers Index takes the latest transfer rumours and gives them a score out of five; the higher the score, the more realistic and reliable the whisper. \nHere are today's top five emerging whispers for the summer. And keep an eye on Transfer Talk for all the latest gossip. \nKylian Mbappe to Manchester United \nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho is looking to reshape his attacking options next season with a more youthful outlook. According to the Daily Star, the Red Devils are monitoring Monaco sensation Kylian Mbappe's progress ahead of the summer. The 18-year-old burst onto the scene this season, scoring 19 goals while helping his club to the top of Ligue 1 and into the quarterfinals of the Champions League. Mourinho is still sweating over the future of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, with the 35-year-old striker, who has netted 26 goals this term, yet to sign up for the optional second year of his Old Trafford contract, having joined last summer. \nGylfi Sigurdsson to Everton \nEverton have reportedly identified Iceland star Gylfi Sigurdsson as a major transfer target, but the Daily Mirror claims they face a battle to lure him away from Swansea City, who are demanding £35 million. Without the 27-year-old, Swansea would be in deeper trouble than they currently are, as they sit in 17th position. His six goals and 11 assists have given the Welsh side a genuine chance of survival, but they will have a lot of enquirers in the summer, not least Everton. \nKingsley Coman to Chelsea \nBayern Munich may have an £18m agreement in place to make Kingsley Coman's loan move from Juventus to the Allianz Arena permanent, but that has not put Chelsea off. The Blues are preparing a £43m bid, according to The Sun. The 22-year-old joined the Bundesliga club the beginning of last season and, despite being used sparingly by Carlo Ancelotti this season, is developing into a fine player. Antonio Conte reportedly wants to freshen up his attacking options, with Diego Costa's Stamford Bridge future up in the air and Coman could fit the bill. \nMilan Skriniar to West Bromwich Albion \nAfter missing out on defensive targets in January, West Bromwich Albion boss Tony Pulis is reportedly keen to sign Sampdoria defender Milan Skriniar, according to the Daily Mail. The 22-year-old Slovakian is a left-sided central defender who can also play in midfield and is one of the brightest prospects in Italy's Serie A. \nInaki Williams to Liverpool \nAccording to the Daily Express, Liverpool have set their sights on triggering the £43m buyout clause in Inaki Williams' contract at La Liga outfit Athletic Bilbao. The 22-year-old winger has earned rave reviews since breaking into the team at San Mames. He has scored three goals in 28 league games this season and Jurgen Klopp reportedly sees him as the perfect man to provide competition for Sadio Mane and Philippe Coutinho in the wide areas at Anfield.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T12:51:59.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
