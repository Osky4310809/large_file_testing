Love & Sex How laws are putting strippers in greater danger \nMembers of the East London Strippers Collective campaign group have seen the rise and fall of the 'bonaza era' of exotic dancing, and they say women are the ones suffering  03 GMT Click to followIndy Lifestyle Online \n“Performing, I love performing,” says Sassy Billie, recalling her time as a stripper. “And learning pole dancing, and adding belly dance to my routines and making my own outfits. I love the creative side of it and making the best friends I’ve ever had,” Billie, a member of the campaign group the East London Stripper Collective (ELSC), tells The Independent . \nBillie, who is in her early 30s, was a full-time dancer at strip clubs for over 10 years. It was a job that saw her travel to Japan, Australia, and New York as well as work in clubs across London. She now runs the London Lap Dancer website and campaigns with ELSC. \nShe is aware that she bucks the stereotype of a victimised stripper. \"I’m a white, middle class girl who went to university and spent most of her 20s in steady relationships. I’ve never been to rehab, or had a course of therapy, or stuck needles in my arm or given my money to a pimp.\" The morality of seeing strippers on a stag do has split the web \n“I have had lots of different jobs, from working in the city to being a milliner, but exotic dancing was always both my passion and the one job I could always rely on to fall back on.\" \nBut s he and other dancers say that changes in the law almost a decade ago have almost killed the industry. It has not only become tougher to earn a wage at a time when women are hit hardest by job precarity and austerity, but more dangerous. \nThe issues can be traced back to the Licensing Act 2004, which was introduced to boost the nighttime economy. This allowed strip clubs to open up with similar licensing to pubs, cafes and bars. Establishments that were otherwise hidden away in the underbellies of towns and cities appeared on high streets. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of strip clubs and lap dancing bars in the UK doubled to 300, according to estimates by the campaign group Object. \n“This meant for five years there was a proliferation of the industry nationwide, and a lot of people didn't like that,” says fellow ELSC member Edie, who is in her 40s and used to dance in what she described as the bonanza era of strip clubs for a decade. She now works in events promotion. \nSoon, conservative campaigners and feminist groups that want sex work to be more heavily legislated against, such as Object, worked towards a crack-down on strip joints citing concerns about sex trafficking, exploitation, and a rise in sexual offences. Local authorities were given more powers over these establishments, and clubs were re-classified as Sex Entertainment Venues (SEVs). The sex work revolution that no one is willing to talk about \n“The passing of the law and the media circus around it has served to massively re-stigmatise our work,” argues Edie. \n“Our job has changed from entertainer to hustler. We do less performing and more emotional labour, less actual dancing and more deferential fawning to our clients. It used to be that if a customer was abusive we could walk away, again because of our lack of options we have to accept a lot more fucked up behaviour than before.\" \nAnd the finger of blame lands on several groups, it seems, but what is clear is that the women who work in the clubs felt they weren't listened to. \n“The campaigns run by women's rights organisations framed us as victims. A lot of the research used by the lobby was spurious, claims about trafficking were contentious,\" says Edie. \"No one appeared interested in listening to our voices and opinions and perhaps consulting dancers themselves about improvements. The main voices in the public discussion in defence of the clubs were male industry operators, which didn't help matters as it made us seems like chattel property. If the argument was that we were objectified women, because men looked at us as sex objects, they forgot that they were also objectifying us by looking at us as victims.\" \nIn Edie's experience, the situation was nowhere near so clear cut. “All the dancers I’ve ever met over the 20 years I danced for are self possessed, independent and took a logical choice,\" she says. \"For example I know a Brazilian girl who had a five year plan to learn English and save enough money to go back to Brazil, buy a house and set up a business in the tourist industry. She worked hard and achieved that. There are many other stories like this.\" UK porn laws a year on: Censorship and destroyed businesses \nEdie also points to a survey of 300 lap dancers by the University of Leeds in 2010 - one of the few major studies into sex work - which found that a third were students, whether in university or on vocational courses, and that a quarter had a university degree. \nBut little could save them from the consequences of the crackdown. Councils introduced a “nil policy” restricting the number of clubs in an area, and owners had to adhere to new licensing laws. Clubs closed and the control over the industry fell into the hands of a few surviving establishments. The number of women dancing in one night, therefore, shot up and working conditions worsened. The dancers, who are largely categorised self-employed, have to pay a house fee in order to perform. More women meant more competition and a shift in their repertoire. \n“House fees went up. Commissions went up. Zo nes were introduced so that you couldn’ t appro ach a customer if he was standing in a particul ar spot, and he had to have a drink in his hand. Dress codes were changed, and then changed again, so we always had to buy new outfits and couldn’t wear our favourites anymore,” says Billie. \nRecalling her time dancing in the mid-2000s, Edie says: “We used to have staff Christmas dinners and social events together with the bar staff, DJs and bouncers. It was a more prosperous time in general and the average person had money to spend. The money flowed so people could achieve their savings or education plans, unlike today where there is a lot of uncertainty, and the money has gone.\" Feminist porn director wins right to reinstate fetish website \n“Now with the industry being focused around lap dances only as opposed to stage shows girls frequently leave without making their house fee for the night,” explains Edie. “This changes the power dynamic. If 20 guys have given you £1 then you control the show, if one guy gives you £20 it becomes about pleasing him rather than being a creative performer.” \n“The business model switched from 'having a good fun venue' to 'rip off the dancers and customers as much as possible',” adds Billie. “The definition of having ‘a bad night’ changed. Before, a bad night was one where you’d make back your house fee, and go home with less than a hundred quid, with costs it roughly equated to the minimum wage, maybe a bit more, say £8 to £10 per hour. \n“Now bad nights are evenings when the dancer loses money. She pays to work, and then never earns it back, and goes home cold, hungry and tired at four or five am wondering what the point of it all is. Those were the nights when I’d get home, make myself a big cheese on toast, and cry in my bed.” Where tech meets sex Where tech meets sex 1/6 Lovely - the smart sex toy that has been dubbed 'the Fitbit for your penis' \nTired of not being able to track the average speed of your thrusts during sex? Well, your problems will be solved with the Lovely - a sex toy that's been touted as 'the fitbit, but for your penis'. The lovely is a stretchy silicone ring, which attaches around the base of your penis. It also has a vibrator tucked inside, which stimulates both sexual partners. So far, so Ann Summers Lovely Inc 2/6 The 'sex selfie stick' lets you FaceTime the inside of a vagina \nFurther proof that the sole goal of mankind is now to take selfies absolutely everywhere possible, a vibrator that can video capture an orgasm from its epicentre has been invented. The nightmarish love child of an endoscopy and a vibrator, the 'Svakom Gaga Camera Vibrator' allows for a new level of explicitness in amateur sex tapes. Footage taken can be uploaded to PC or smartphone and the device also syncs with FaceTime, offering the unprecedented opportunity to be on the phone with someone's genitals Lovehoney 3/6 Pornhub turns masturbation into energy \nWith an estimated 41 million people visiting it every day, Pornhub figured it might be time to channel all that furious fapping into something more useful than brief, boredom-relieving ecstasy. \"Every day, millions of hours of adult content are consumed online, wasting energy in the process and hurting the environment,\" the porn site writes on a dedicated website. \"At Pornhub we decided to do something about it. Introducing The Wankband: The first wearable tech that allows you to love the planet by loving yourself.\" The band creates power when moved in an up and down motion, with a kinetic charger inside storing the clean (albeit slightly dirty) energy generated. It can then be connected via USB to smartphones, tablets and computers, powering them with 100% sustainable energy PornHub 4/6 Men have begun 3D-printing their penises \n\"What would happen if I put my penis in it?\" It's a question man has been asking ever since it discovered it was useful in certain situations for procreation thousands of years ago. But now it has reached an absurd and mildly dystopian conclusion: 3D-printed d*ck pics. The means? A handheld 3D scanner such as Fuel3D's Scanify above. The method? By pointing it at *any* object and capturing it three-dimensionally. The reason? Who can say Fuel3D 5/6 Japanese developer creates virtual breast-squeezing 'game' for the Oculus Rift \nAlthough gadgets like the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR are promising to take virtual reality into the mainstream, there are still plenty of virtual ‘experiences’ that we hope never make it out the basements they were dreamt up in. Exhibit a: a ‘game’ which lets users squeeze a virtual woman’s breasts who responds by squealing in disgust and covering up her chest. That’s right, the guy who made this didn’t even want to fabricate a positive sexual experience – instead he went for virtual abuse. The set-up works like this. The user dons an Oculus Rift to enter the virtual world populated by an anime character, he can then squeeze a novelty mouse pad with foam breasts with pressure sensors inside them. This hooked up to the virtual character who reacts accordingly 6/6 Have sex with your iPad thanks to the new sex toy no-one asked for \nMany of us have become inseparable from our smartphones and tablets, but if you're looking to take the relationship to the next step and actually 'f*ck your iPad', sex toy brand Fleshlight has now made this possible for some reason. The company launched Fleshlight Launchpad, which allows users of their flashlight-shaped, vagina-like toy to plug it into the back of an iPad in order to 'fully immerse themselves' in whatever they're watching. The gadget \"enables the user to enjoy the full Fleshlight experience while enjoying content or communicating live with a friend via applications like Facetime or Skype,\" makers Interactive Life Forms claim, with its trailer showing a man making use of one while video-chatting with his girlfriend \n“In the late 90s to early 2000s London was the best place to dance, even better than American or Australia. Now it's dreadful and I'd advise anyone who wants to dance to avoid London,\" warns Edie. \nWhile Edie and Billie have stopped dancing, their friends in the industry are struggling. One woman they know worked in an establishment for 13 years and had her shifts cut because she complained about work on Facebook. “This demonstrates the kind of precarious nature of our work,” says Edie. \nRecounting the experiences of a 20-year-old exotic dancer and friend, she adds: “She’s had a terrible experience of exploitative business practises and demoralising circumstances, despite being in demand for her pole expertise at pole schools all over the country.\" \nNow, the ELSC are calling on careful legislation to protect women while enabling them to earn a decent wage. Contracts, for instance, would protect women from being fired and introduce normal disciplinary processes such as verbal and written warnings. The “nil policy”, they say, should be scrapped in order to tackle creating monopolies that makes it easier for employers to exploit staff, while a re-think of house fees would prevent women, in Edie's words, \"getting naked for free.\" \"Every industry needs regulation and legislation, but there needs to be a careful balance between protecting women and labelling them as vulnerable and snatching their livelihoods away,\" she adds. \n\"When women still routinely earn less than their male counterparts, and work schedules are stacked up against mothers who need flexibility, and childcare costs are so high, well we need job opportunities like exotic dancing.\" \n\"The law was brought in to destroy the industry and that is what is happening, but the people worst affected but the changes are the women.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:15:42.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
