Hernández) Friday’s Metro ridership was the lowest in at least two presidential Inaugurations, and also was lower than that of an average weekday, the agency said Saturday.\nMetro said 570,557 people took trips in the system between its early 4 a .m. Friday opening through midnight closing.\nThe figures are significantly lower than those from the 2009 and 2013 Inaugurations of President Barack Obama; 1.1 million trips in 2009 and 782,000 in 2013, according to Metro.\nThe numbers were also significantly lower than Saturday, when thousands of people overwhelmed the rail system to get to the Women’s March on Washington.\nBy 11 a.m. Saturday, 275,000 people had taken Metro, about 82,000 more than at the same time Friday. By mid-afternoon Saturday, ridership was approaching the half-million mark, officials said.\n[ Backups on Metro as people streamed into D.C. for the Women’s March on Washington ]\nBy 11 a.m. the day Obama was sworn in for his first term in 2009, about 513,000 Metro trips had been taken — and the day’s ridership totaled about 1.1 million, making it the transit system’s busiest day ever.\nFriday’s lower numbers reflect what many riders observed; many had remarked about empty station platforms and trains with plenty of seats available. In some stations, there appeared to be more police and Metro employees than riders.\nThe numbers are also significantly lower than average weekday ridership of 639,000 trips.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@luzcita"], "published": "2017-01-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:46:09.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
