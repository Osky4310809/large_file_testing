Until recently, users were limited to options like share, copy and open in full browser, but now they also have the options like bookmark, request desktop site, find in page etc.\nAccording to 9to5Google , the Progressive Web Apps which are added to your home screen also come with “significantly more features and access to Android” in Chrome 57, and appear in system settings like an individual app. Google launched these features in the Chrome Beta app in early February .\nFurther, 9to5Google states that the new Media Session API means Chrome notifications pull more metadata and can have more controls. On sites which have audio, for example, you could see info like song title, artist, and album in your notification tray when playing a song, alongside controls for navigation. It’s a useful addition.\nSee also: Chrome 57 to limit power consumption for background tabs 2 days ago Google also announced the following changes via its Chrome blog:\nMore frequently updated article suggestions on the New Tab page Use recently visited search engines as your default search engine See Physical Web suggestions, based on your surroundings, in the address bar The number of websites (and no doubt people) taking advantage of progressive web apps is still very small so much of the recent updates could just slide by for the moment. But, in the coming months, I expect we’ll be seeing many more developments regarding them.\nLook out for Chrome 57 (57.0.2987.108) rolling out in the Google Play Store over the next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:10:18.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
