First of all, it gives Google a major enterprise customer for its cloud platform, something that it’s trying to promote in big way. Secondly it gives them an established enterprise software partner inside large organizations, which it could potentially use to leverage other enterprise business as it tries to expand GCP’s business \nSAP is the world’s leading ERP company, which helps companies manage back-end services related to technology, human resources and finance. Traditionally, it has been delivered as on-premises software, but over the last several years it has started delivering it in the cloud for customers who don’t want to manage all of the complexity related to running software like this. \nIt’s important to keep in mind that SAP is so large that it also has its own cloud datacenters, but this gives customers another option, and the fact that it chose GCP has to be welcome news to Google, which finds itself far behind AWS and Azure in the Infrastructure as a Service market. \nAn interesting twist in this deal, is that it allows SAP to remain custodian of the data in the cloud, meaning that SAP remains responsible for this data, regardless of the fact that it’s running on GCP. This could remove a significant barrier to entry for customers, who might be reluctant to the move the cloud because of governance and compliance concern — and it’s a pretty unusual approach. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T20:13:51.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
