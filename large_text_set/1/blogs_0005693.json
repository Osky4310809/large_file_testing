The mountains block clouds and pollution, and the sky always seems to be a bright, clear blue. The city's unique architecture with vibrant colors make it an internationally-recognized resort town, but it's a place many call home. That includes documentary photographer Nancy Baron . She began living in Palm Springs part-time in 2005 and has come to view the city as a fountain of endless inspiration. \"It's a place that exists both as a fantasy and an actual place,\" Baron said. \"I was really struck by how different it was from the city I experienced as a tourist. That really fascinated me -- the rich life beyond the resorts and the main street. For a small town, there are endless opportunities for discovery.\" The city of Palm Springs was first developed in the 1930s, and became a popular destination for Hollywood stars, but it wasn't until the 1950s that it gained wider appeal, evolving in the process into the image of the American Dream.

The women wear colorful, printed dresses and their homes are immaculately styled with mid-century furniture, as if springing from a design catalog from the 1950s. Homes were made to accommodate an indoor-outdoor lifestyle and there's a seamlessness in the way one moves from inside the house to a large backyard and pool. \"Typically the people who live here are coming from other places and it's interesting to find out what brought them here and how they experience it,\" she said. \"They're very much in love with their home.\" Join the conversation \nFollow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to keep up with our latest work and share your comments.
