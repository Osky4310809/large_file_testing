Netherlands-based concert and festival organizer Mojo Concerts issued a statement on Facebook on Wednesday (Jan. 25). \n“Earlier we informed Drake fans on the rescheduling of his Ziggo Dome concerts. We are very sorry to inform you again that the Drake concerts on January 26 (original date January 20) and January 27 (original date January 21) in the Ziggo Dome have been moved to new dates,” read the message. \nIt continued, “Drake wants to bring a complete new show to Europe and not a copy of the shows in the US. Unfortunately due to unforeseen production setbacks it will need a little bit more time to be ready. The international and local crew have been working on this production since January 17 in the Ziggo Dome and Drake was all set and has started his rehearsals this week. He can’t wait to start this new tour and show his fans this amazing concert.” \nThe statement noted that rescheduled dates, Jan. 28 (originally slated for Jan. 22) and Feb. 26 (originally Jan. 18), will go on as planned. \nDrake’s forthcoming Euro-trek will include stops in Glasgow, London, Manchester, Sheffield, Dublin, Birmingham, Stockholm and Paris. The outing follows his successful U.S. run, the Summer Sixteen tour, in support of his latest studio effort Views, which returned to the Billboard 200 No. 1 spot for its 13th nonconsecutive week last September. Views currently sits at No. 8 on the list. TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:45:19.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
