Photo: Nick Wass/ AP Images . \nThis is weird even for Washington, where weirdness is the natural order of things. Advertisement \nGeneral manager Scot McCloughan is not at the NFL Combine , which begins tomorrow, and he confirmed he will not be attending . That’s especially odd given that McCloughan’s skill lies in talent evaluation, and in the division of Skins front-office responsibilities, scouting and the draft are typically his domain. \nWhen McCloughan’s absence became know, both he and the team attributed it to a personal matter. \nIt’s notable that only McCloughan cited a death in the family, while the Skins kept it ambiguous. It’s even more notable that the death was apparently McCloughan’s 100-year-old grandmother , whose passing was not a surprise to the family. Marie McCloughan passed away on Feb. 6; according to her obituary , funeral services were held Feb. 13.

If it feels shitty to speculate, there’s a whole lot more smoke here. \nChris Russell, a radio host on 106.7 The Fan, reported last night that McCloughan appears to have been pushed out.

Advertisement \nAll of this comes against the backdrop of increasing whispers of a power struggle between McCloughan and team president Bruce Allen. \nLast week, official-unofficial team mouthpiece Chris Cooley, speaking on a Dan Snyder-owned radio station, speculated that McCloughan, a recovering alcoholic, might be drinking again. No one from the Skins admonished Cooley, leading to informed speculation that the talking point was either planted via Cooley, or it was a deliberate silence meant to hang McCloughan out to dry.
