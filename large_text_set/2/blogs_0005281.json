You best believe it. Mesut Ozil posted a video of himself working out in the gym today and one detail stuck out: He was wearing Alexis Sanchez’s shorts. Cue transfer stories about how Ozil is Arsenal’s new number seven. Not really, although Arsenal might need to consider finding a replacement soon. This shows something else. \nIt shows how close the pair of world class attackers are. Like that scene in Rick and Morty where our cartoon heroes save Scary Terry from further dream humiliation, Alexis came to Ozil’s rescue. Don’t even trip, dawg. Short-changed \nWhile this is all light entertainment, Gooners want something more hard-hitting when Saturday comes. They feel – yes, you’ve guessed it – short-changed about the level of performances on the pitch. Two successive defeats mean they’re now sitting in that oh-so-familiar fourth place, one point ahead of Liverpool and two ahead of Man United. \nAnother set of folk who feel short-changed is the aforementioned dynamic duo. Ozil and Alexis are both stalling over new contracts and one of the reasons for this is that Arsenal haven’t offered a financially tempting package. \n— 101 Great Goals (@101greatgoals) February 7, 2017 Loading tags...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T19:36:35.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
