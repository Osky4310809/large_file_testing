At first you think it's just a deer or something, but wait until you see a stopped frame from the video. That's no deer. It has the head, body, and legs of a humanoid running on all fours. What the heck is that thing?! Review: We always have to consider that videos like this could be faked. There are some very talented and very clever people out there who know how to create such things. But according to Paranormal Investigations, who provided this video, they \"checked with local authorities who oversee the CCTVs in this area and this is not faked. They say it is genuine footage. This creature was filmed on CCTV running across a motorway in the UK in 2007.\" If genuine, this is a very weird, disturbing-looking creature. What do you think ?
