Carpenter directed the film and co-wote with Nick Castle. Ernest Borgnine , Isaac Hayes, Harry Dean Stanton, Lee Van Cleef and Adrienne Barbeau co-starred. \nNeal Cross, creator of the BBC crime series “Luther,” beat out several writers to win the writing job, and delivered a first-draft in last October.
