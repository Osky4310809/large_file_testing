The rest of the sessions he's available \n“It's not the moment to feel nothing. He feels it a little bit but he can cope with it.” Henderson was feeling the effects of the problem during the loss to Swansea (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T18:05:31.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
