Dele Alli has now scored three consecutive braces in the Premier League - against Southampton, Watford and Chelsea Dele at the double again (Photo: Getty Images) Spurs have never lost a Premier League match in which Alli has scored, a run which now stretches to 16 games (12 wins, 4 draws) It's probably going to be a good day from here, lads (Photo: Reuters) Alli scored 10 goals in 33 Premier League appearances last season, but has 10 in just 19 games in the current campaign No wonder he looks so happy (Photo: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images) Alli has scored 20 league goals since the start of 2015/16 - no Premier League midfielder has managed more He's in there somewhere (Photo: Chelsea Football Club) And those 20 goals are more than any other player under the age of 23 in Europe's top five leagues since the start of last season Dele the young gun fires again (Photo: Reuters) It took him 52 games to reach 20 Premier League goals - Scholes took 74, Beckham 90, Lampard 140 and Gerrard 169 And all with Danny Rose on his back, too (Photo: Mike Hewitt) Chelsea conceded two headed goals to Alli on the same night, having previously not conceded a headed goal all season Getting a-head of the game (Photo: Reuters) Not bad, Dele.
