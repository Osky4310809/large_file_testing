Fifth Harmony’s Lauren Jauregui and her ex-girlfriend’s beautiful photoshoot proves that love doesn’t have to end when the romance does.\nOn Wednesday, photographer Nicole Cartolano revealed stunning photos of Jauregui and her ex, Lucy Vives. The gorgeous photoshoot shows that love has no bounds and breakups aren’t always messy.\nAlthough the Fifth Harmony singer and Vives were dating at the time the photos were taken, their attitudes towards the shoot now are equally as beautiful.\nThe two former lovebirds posed together in November in New Orleans. Each shot is more stunning and intimate than the next.\nThroughout the “Bare With Me” photo collection you can see the love and respect each woman has for the other.\n2016 Wildflyme's most loco adventure| Muses: @lucyvives @laurenjauregui | Styling: @kasstagrama |#35mm #unretouched #wildflyme #nicolecartolano \nA post shared by Nicole Cartolano (@wildflyme_) on Mar 22, 2017 at 12:59am PDT \n“Both girls trusted me to photograph them together as sort of a coming-out, but they were nervous how their families would respond and the publicity they’d attract, especially from the Latin American community,” Cartolano told MTV News .\n“‘Bare With Me’ is a compromise which allowed us to describe what Lauren called ‘love in the 21st century,'” she added.

It was important to use their voices to show the world that this is OK, this is acceptable, in the gentlest way possible.”\n@lucyvives & @laurenjauregui Wearing @americanapparelusa @kendallandkylie @lulus @meundies @dolcevita @nissajewelry Photo by @wildflyme_ Styled by me \nA post shared by Keeping It Kassey (@kasstagrama) on Mar 22, 2017 at 4:15pm PDT \nEven though Jauregui just came out in November as bisexual , she’s known Vives for a long time.\nDespite the fact the two have broken up since the pictures were taken, Cartolano revealed they are happy the photos exist.\n“They agreed, and Lauren said this: that it’s a reminder of a really good moment in time. Because at the time, they did really like each other. And it was a very good memory,” the photographer explained.
