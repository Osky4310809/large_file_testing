Seems like a cultural anathema, especially when considering half-English and half-French style blogger Camille Charrière. Having endeared herself to her nearly half a million Instagram followers with that enviable “done, but undone” insouciant style that seems like a birthright to our Gallic sisters, it seems her fate as a fashion phenomenon was more than sealed. But, as the 29-year-old former lawyer explains, growing up in a house full of intellectuals, a career in the creative industry wasn’t necessarily encouraged. Still, after a short stint in the finance world, Charrière finally took the plunge into fashion with the launch of her blog, Camille Over the Rainbow, and the rest, as she says, is history. From documenting her cool-girl style on her buzzy blog to recently launching a podcast, Fashion: No Filter , the Pau, France-native always brings a fresh, unstudied elegance to her style for work—a sentiment that also translates into her beauty routine. With the help of Wella’s nourishing Oil Reflections products–such little maintenance! Such big results!–Charrière maintains that blonde bedhead of hers brilliantly. Here, the blogger tells us how she came to work in fashion, why she invests in quality hair care products, and how her multilingual and multicultural background inspires her style. Wella Luminous Reveal Shampoo, $22, loxabeauty.com ; Wella Luminous Instant Conditioner, $22, loxabeauty.com Fashion Is an Acquired Taste My mom is half English and half French, and only agreed to marry my French dad and move back to France with him on the condition that our household would be English only. So I grew up speaking English at home, and had to learn French on the go or at school. I now consider my bilingual and bicultural upbringing my secret weapon—no one expects me to have a British accent! My parents are incredibly intellectual and eccentric, with books pouring out of every corner of my house, and opera always playing at top volume. But I wouldn’t credit them for my interest in fashion. They were very much against me crossing over into the creative industry. I think I always liked clothes, but it was only at university that I started to love the stories behind the garments, and started to develop my own sense of style. I would say, in my case, that my fascination with fashion was acquired and not something I was born with. I graduated as a lawyer and worked in finance for a bit before taking the leap of faith into fashion. I definitely never imagined I’d work in this industry. From the Finance World to the Fashion World I was going out with an English guy, and decided to move to London despite having just graduated from law school. Being unable to practice law in the U.K. without doing a conversion course, I decided to go into finance, thinking it would add some edge to my linear CV. It was the best/worst decision I have ever made. I hated it so much, I decided very quickly working for a big salary was never going to work for me. I decided to figure out what I really wanted. I started my blog, Camille Over the Rainbow , as a creative outlet and realized that I wanted to be a part of the fashion industry, so I applied for a job at Net-a-Porter, quit my city job, and the rest is history! Wella Luminous Smoothing Oil, $20, loxabeauty.com Uniform Dressing, the French Way I don’t have typical days and that is the best thing about what I do. Every day is completely different. If I’m running around London, I will make sure I am in comfortable clothes, as the city is massive and you end up having to practically jog everywhere so as not to be late. I only dress up when I can be bothered. My daily uniform is classic jeans teamed with a big chunky knit or a loose-fit tee, and either sneakers or Chelsea boots. Easy does it—I’m French after all! Done But Undone at Work My go-to look for work is the “done, undone” messy bedhead. I focus on very rich products to look after my bleached locks, but I like to have a quick routine. I feel the need to wash my hair every day because I don’t like the color it turns on day two of being unwashed—the drawback of daily washing being that it can get quite dry. I love using Wella’s Luminous Smoothing Oil straight out of the shower, after towel drying. Even in winter, I don't use a blow-dryer as I like the natural-wave look. The oil makes this easier. By using quality products every day, I don’t have to worry about brushing my hair. I also love the Wella Luminous Reboost Mask as it really nourishes my locks without making them heavy or greasy. I’ll use it instead of a conditioner as a part of my daily routine. It does wonders for my damaged, dry highlights. It’s air-dried and takes care of itself! Wella Luminous Reboost Mask, $22, loxabeauty.com Constantly Accessorizing My jewelry never comes off. I have worn the same rings for three years. I have a diamond horn necklace which I like to say is a croissant in honor of my genes. I also wear a signet ring, and sexy hoops that will make even the most boyish outfit more feminine. Hardworking Staples for a Day of Work I like to think that I have embraced the idea of wearing a uniform and building a wardrobe of hard-working staples, à la francaise, mixed in with the English mentality of “do what you want.” In my case, that probably means being the least dressy person in the room at a cocktail party. Same ease goes for my hair (just five minutes with Wella’s Luminous Reboost Mask . Come as you are!
