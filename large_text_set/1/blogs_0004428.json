It seems that Universal Soldiers duo Jean-Cladue Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are going to reunite for a new film called Black Water . \nThe story revolves around a deep cover operative (Van Damme) who wakes up in a submarine that serves as a CIA black site prison. \nTHR reports that Dawn's Light Media is backing the movie, based on a script by Chad Law, whose resume is reading list of action B-movies with former big stars (like Van Damme). No director has been chosen yet. \nVan Damme and Lundgren previously headlined the Universal Soldiers franchise throughout the '90s (and once more in 2009); they also both starred in the ensemble throwback film The Expendables 2 in 2012. As has been pointed out, in those previous pairings Van Damme and Lundgren were foes; in Black Water they will play allies - though Lundgren's exact role hasn't yet been described. \nNo word on a production start or release date yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:08:13.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
