Despite his gruff appearance and unorthodox delivery and vocals, his debut album — 2003’s Philadelphia Freeway — earned him a gold plaque, and after the dissolution of the OG Roc, he released well-respected works such as The Stimulus Package with Jake One in 2010. A post shared by Freeway (@phillyfreeway) on Mar 8, 2017 at 4:47pm PST \nWhether it’s history repeating itself or coming full circle, it appears Freeway will be back underneath the tutelage of Jay Z as he posted a series of Instagram flicks that allude that he signed with Roc Nation. \n“2017 should be a Great year!!” Philly Freezer captioned in a picture with Jigga, accented with ?? ? emojis. Another solo photo-op depicted the 38-year-old MC born Leslie Pridgen in a room he geotagged with Roc Nation HQ and hashtagged with “roc4life.” \nIt could mean anything, right? Requests for clarity to Roc Nation weren’t immediately returned as of press time. A post shared by Freeway (@phillyfreeway) on Mar 8, 2017 at 5:27pm PST \nEven with his post-Roc-A-Fella independent success, the road to remain a rap star hasn’t been easy for Freeway. In September 2015, he quietly battled kidney failure before undergoing emergency surgery and opening up about the dialysis treatments the following spring. \nBefore the ball dropped on 2016 to bring in the current year, he shared an Instagram inspirational message to fans by writing, “Don’t give up. There are too many nay-sayers out there who will try to discourage you. Don’t listen to them. The only one who can make you give up is yourself.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!
