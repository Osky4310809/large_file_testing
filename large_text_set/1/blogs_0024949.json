(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque) \nPresident Trump's first week in office has been marked by two things: Controversy (over things like his inaugural crowd size and voter fraud accusations), and executive orders. \nThe first is old hat for Trump. But for casual observers — and even some political junkies who are paying close attention to Trump's policy moves — the second might be a little foreign. Trump signed two more executive orders on Friday , attempting to fulfill his promise of “extreme vetting” to keep potential “radial Islamic terrorists” out of the United States. \nSo what is an executive action or executive order? And how unusual is what Trump is doing with them? \nBelow, an explainer. What is an executive order? \nBasically, an executive order is an official statement from the president about how the federal agencies he oversees are to use their resources. \nIt falls under the broader umbrella of “executive actions” which derive their power from Article II of the Constitution, and it is the most formal executive action. Executive actions also include presidential memoranda (which are a step below executive orders and basically outline the administration's position on a policy issue), proclamations and directives. \nAn executive order is not the president creating new law or appropriating new money from the U.S. Treasury — both things that are the domain of Congress; it is the president instructing the government how it is to work within the parameters that are already set by Congress and the Constitution. \nTrump's executive order on building a border wall , for example, basically establishes building the wall as a federal priority and directs the Department of Homeland Security to use already-available funding to get the ball rolling on its construction. \nThe president's executive orders are recorded in the Federal Register and are considered binding, but they are subject to legal review. (More on that next). How can a president do this? \nIn a word: Carefully. Executive orders have often been the subject of controversy, with the opposition party accusing the president of overstepping his authority and acting like a dictator. Basically, they're arguing that he's changing the law rather than working within it. \nThis came up most recently after former president Barack Obama signed executive orders exempting the children of illegal immigrants and parents of legal children from deportation. There were known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — or DACA — and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents — or DAPA. \nThe plans would shield about 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation, but Republican governors and attorneys general have sued, alleging that Obama was essentially implementing immigration reform on his own — overstepping his authority. In June, the Supreme Court deadlocked , leaving a federal judge's ruling blocking the programs in place. \nAnd questions have already arisen about the legality of an early Trump executive order involved illegal immigration: His order denying federal funding the sanctuary cities . Expect a court fight there, too. What is the history of executive orders? \nThey have been around for as long as we've had presidents, in fact — all the way back to George Washington. \nSome of the more most historically significant — whether for good or ill — include:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:53:34.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
