However the former Baltimore Ravens running back hasn’t abandoned the desire to resume his career. \"I can still play football,\" Rice told ESPN on Sunday. \"I'm never going to give up. You're never going to hear me say I gave up.\" Rice was suspended indefinitely by the league and quickly released by the Ravens days before the 2014 season after video surfaced of his assault on his now-wife inside the elevator of an Atlantic City Casino earlier that year. He hasn’t drawn much interest in this latest free agent period, which began earlier this month. \nRice, 30, has been eligible to sign with a team since the NFL lifted his ban upon appeal in November 2014. \nMORE COVERAGE Tom Brady's stolen Super Bowl jersey found \n\"The reason why I'm not playing football, you do the dots,\" Rice said. \"It ain't because I'm a bad football player. That's just keeping it real. I'm never giving up and never giving in.\" \nThe NFL revamped how it investigates and punishes players accused of domestic violence after the league came under scrutiny for how it handled the cases of Rice, Greg Hardy and others. The NFL initially suspended Rice for two games after he entered a diversion program early in 2014 as part of a deal with prosecutors before it changed course after the video became public later that year. 222 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:07:23.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
