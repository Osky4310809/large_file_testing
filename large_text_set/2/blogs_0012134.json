Almost no one is buying the Clinton title, co-authored by Devi Sridhar, a Global Public Health Professor at the University of Edinburgh. It currently stands at No. 74,374 on the Amazon Bestsellers Chart. Weirdly, Chelsea Clinton herself appears disinterested in promoting her book. Her Twitter bio only mentions her children’s book It’s Your World (which is higher on Amazon’s charts than the new work). Not exactly the most popular author in the world… Hillary wasn’t likable. At all. It’s starting to look like Chelsea might have the same problem. LIKE this article? I hated this article.
