Trevor Mahlmann SpaceX LC-39A \"rain birds\" viewed during media remote camera setup on Friday. Trevor Mahlmann NASA built two main launch pads during the Apollo program, 39A and 39B. The former was used for every crewed Apollo launch, except for Apollo 10, and most of the space shuttle missions. After the final space shuttle flight in 2011, NASA decided it needed just one of the pads for its future operations. So it leased Launch Complex 39A to SpaceX.\nThe company had intended to use Launch Complex 39A primarily for launches of its new Falcon Heavy rocket and commercial crew missions. However, on September 1, 2016, a static fire test accident at SpaceX's other Florida launch pad, Launch Complex 40, caused severe damage to facilities there (repairs may be complete later this summer, according to company president Gwynne Shotwell). This pushed SpaceX to expedite its refurbishment of Launch Complex 39A and to expand its use for all launches from the East Coast.\nFurther Reading SpaceX makes a triumphant return to flight—but hard work is just beginning Now, after modifications and upgrades, the historic pad is finally ready for its second life. The first SpaceX launch from the historic pad is scheduled for Saturday at 10:01am ET. A Falcon 9 rocket will boost a Dragon spacecraft carrying about 2.5 tons of food, water, and scientific experiments to the International Space Station. About 10 minutes after launch, the first stage of the rocket will attempt to land back at Landing Zone 1, near the launch pad. So far, SpaceX is two for two with land-based returns of its rocket.\nWeather conditions are improving for Saturday morning's launch, with forecasters now estimating a 70-percent chance of \"go\" conditions during the instantaneous launch window. A backup launch opportunity will come at 9:38am ET on Sunday. SpaceX also disclosed on Friday that it is monitoring a \"tiny\" helium leak within the rocket's upper-stage. The company will monitor the issue during the overnight hours and proceed with launch on Saturday if it determines the problem is not a threat to the rocket.\nListing image by Trevor Mahlmann", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:18:04.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
