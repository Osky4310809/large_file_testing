The South Carolina senator added that he “left out all the ones that use the n-word.” \nScott went on to charge that Democrats engage in selective tolerance: \n“The liberal left that speaks and desires for all of us to be tolerant do not want to be tolerant of anyone that disagrees with where they are coming from.” \nWatch above, Via C-SPAN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:36:41.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
