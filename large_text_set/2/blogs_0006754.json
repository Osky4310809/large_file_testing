It does mean we have to build good relations with everybody across Europe .” \nInsisting the government had already made concessions over both the fact of the article 50 bill, and over a parliamentary vote on a final Brexit deal, Corbyn said there was scope to shape the process. \n“The government does not have a blank cheque to set up an offshore tax haven in Britain,” he said. “All that it has is authority to proceed with negotiations, which is what the referendum was about.” \nThe bill was passed overwhelmingly, by 494 votes to 122, and will now pass to the House of Lords, where Labour and Liberal Democrat peers will press for concessions on key issues including the status of EU citizens living in the United Kingdom. \nClive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, resigned after deciding to go against the three-line whip. He became the fourth shadow cabinet member to step down rather than vote in favour. \nCorbyn denied it meant there was a crisis in Labour over the issue. “It’s not a disaster,” he said. “The majority of Labour MPs voted to trigger article 50. Fifty-odd voted against it, mainly on the basis of a strong message from their own constituents. On all the other votes there is unity, on all the other campaigning there is unity.” \nAsked about his claim in a tweet that the “real fight” for Brexit starts now, Corbyn argued there was little that could have been achieved with the article 50 bill. \n“Do you not understand – this was a one-clause bill,” he said. “A one-clause bill that authorised the government to start negotiating, and recognised the result of the referendum.” \nThe bill’s passage through the Commons was hailed by Brexit supporters. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who campaigned for decades for an EU referendum, said: “I never thought I’d see the day where the House of Commons overwhelmingly voted for Britain to leave the European Union.” \nBrexit secretary David Davis said: “We’ve seen a historic vote tonight – a big majority for getting on with negotiating our exit from the EU and a strong, new partnership with its member states.” \nLewis was one of 52 Labour MPs who rebelled against Corbyn’s three-line whip to vote against the legislation, which authorises the government to trigger article 50, the formal process for exiting the EU. \nLewis represents Norwich South, a constituency that voted strongly to remain in the EU, and had been openly agonising about whether he could bring himself to support the legislation. \n“When I became the MP for Norwich South, I promised my constituents I would be Norwich’s voice in Westminster, not Westminster’s voice in Norwich,” Lewis said. “I therefore cannot, in all good conscience, vote for something I believe will ultimately harm the city I have the honour to represent, love and call home. \n“It is therefore with a heavy heart that I have decided to resign from the shadow cabinet.” \nWidely seen as a rising star on the left of the party, Lewis voted for the bill at its second reading last week, but made it clear that if Labour failed to amend the legislation he could not do so again. When the last potential amendment failed on Wednesday night, Labour issued a statement saying he had stepped down. \nSome see him as a potential leadership candidate, who could act as a bridge between the Corbynite wing of the party, and the so-called soft left. But in the corridors MPs were being quite disparaging about what some called his “flip-flopping” in recent days about whether he could back the bill. \nDiane Abbott, the Hackney North MP who was absent from last week’s second reading, citing a migraine, voted in favour of the bill, despite speculation that she was concerned about the reaction of her pro-remain constituents. \nIn her official response to the vote she said that while she accepted the result of the referendum, “this does not mean that we have to accept Brexit in the haphazard way in which it is being handed to us”. \nAbbott said: “This passage of this bill has been a challenge for Labour. Our MPs represent the top six most passionately pro-leave constituencies, and the six most passionately pro-remain constituencies … I voted for the bill as a loyal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and a loyal member of the shadow cabinet.” \nShe later said Brexit was not the leftwing idea imagined by Labour stalwart Tony Benn, but an “ugly” state of affairs more akin to the politics of US president Donald Trump. \nShe told BBC Newsnight: “I respect the result of the referendum and no one wanted to thwart it in a perverse kind of way. But we need to be clear, this is not a Tony Benn Brexit, this is Donald Trump Brexit, and it’s got a very ugly side.” \nCorbyn will now have to embark on a reshuffle, and must also decide how to treat frontbenchers outside the shadow cabinet, including three of his own whips, who rebelled. \nLabour sources said decisions would be made in the next few days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:19:00.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
