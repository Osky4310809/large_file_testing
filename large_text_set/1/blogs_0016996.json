WATCH: Demi Lovato Flaunts Amazing Bikini Bod in Kenya \"I did get bit by the acting bug a little bit [working on this movie], but I think I started thinking about it the other day, about wanting to go back into acting. I think I have too many tattoos now,\" shared Lovato, who has at least 20 known tattoos. \"You'd have to cover all my tattoos up and it would take forever.\" The former Disney darling has a while to think about making her big return to the screen. For now, she's got a lot on her plate, including new music. \"I'm in the studio right now,\" Lovato revealed. \"It's going really great. I'm just trying to figure out what sound I want to have for the next album.\" But the \"Stone Cold\" singer might not want to change up her sound too much, as her last album, Confident, is nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2017 GRAMMYs next month.

I didn't have to go through hair and makeup, and I didn't have to worry about my camera angles and what not,\" she said. \"So, it was nice to be as animated as I wanted to be, play with my voice and to just have fun with it.\" \"It's very exciting for me to play such an iconic character, and to be a part of such a classic and timeless franchise,\" she added. Smurfs: The Lost Village is in theaters April 7.
