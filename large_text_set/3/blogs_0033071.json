Reuters 11 Sculptor Emanuel Santos claims Cristiano Ronaldo likes his work \nThe 40-year-old, who like Ronaldo comes from the Atlantic island, admitted he only took 15 days to complete the statue after proposing the idea to airport bosses when he found about the renaming pla ns. \nKeep up to date with ALL the latest football news , gossip and rumours \nAnd he confessed he had to work off photos of the footballer because it would have been impossible to get “very busy” Ronaldo to model for him in person. \nSpeaking to Brazilian outlet Globo, he said: “It is impossible to please the Greeks and Trojans. Even Jesus did not please everyone. This is a matter of taste, it’s not as simple as it seems. I have seen works by great artists that follow this parameter. \n“What matters is the impact that this work generates. There is always the possibility of making a difference, I was prepared for all this. \n“I used photos of Cristiano Ronaldo that I searched on the internet as a base. I put the photos next to me and started working on the bust.” \nBut the former airport cleaner, who confesses to being self-taught and devoting himself full-time to sculpture for only the past two years, said he was happy with the result and said it had been given the thumbs-up by Cristiano and his doting mum Dolores as well as the airport chiefs who commissioned him.

I asked him what he thought of the result and he said he liked it.” \nThe statute was trolled on Wednesday after it was unveiled at the Aeroporto Cristiano Ronaldo. \nThe footballer, flanked by Dolores, Spanish girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez, and six-year-old son Cristiano Jr , said afterwards he was ‘happy and honoured’ at the honour. \nBut instead of the rebranding taking centre stage, it was the bust that made all the headlines with some fans claiming the sculptor had drunk too much Madeiran wine before starting his work of art and others joking it made Cristiano look like something out of a horror film. \nThe controversy is set to make Emanuel, who still lives in the small fishing village of Canical in the eastern part of Madeira and whose hobby before he focused on sculpture was making naval models, a big name outside the island.
