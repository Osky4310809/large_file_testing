Superior Court. In a court filing last month, Trump’s attorneys said that the president-elect was too busy to venture to Washington for the deposition as he prepared for the Jan. 20 inauguration. The attorneys agreed to meet with Trump in New York.\nThe Trump-Andrés legal battle began in July when the chef backed out of a deal to open a restaurant in Trump’s luxury hotel complex in the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue. Andrés cited Trump’s derogatory comments about illegal immigrants from Mexico, saying those remarks made it impossible for him to run a successful dining establishment in the Trump property.\nTrump’s hotel opened in September. In court documents, Trump’s attorneys argued that Trump had two months to find an alternative restaurant to open in the space vacated by Andrés. Trump secured BLT Prime by David Burke as a replacement.\nUnder his contract with Andrés, Trump would have obtained a percentage of revenue from Andrés’s operation once the restaurant reached a monthly gross percentage.\nTrump has also filed a similar lawsuit against celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian, who also bowed out of Trump’s hotel deal, he said, because of Trump’s comments regarding illegal immigrants. Trump’s attorney argued that the hotel was not able to find a restaurant to replace Zakarian’s and instead was forced to turn the space into a ballroom and meeting space. On Tuesday, attorneys for Zakarian and Trump said they were at an “impasse” in settlement talks. A judge set a pretrial conference hearing for May 17.\nTrump originally filed $10 million lawsuits against both chefs. But in the Zakarian lawsuit, economists estimated Trump’s losses closer to $14 million. Trump was deposed in the Zakarian lawsuit last summer.\nIn a recent tweet , Andrés suggested ending the legal dispute and instead donating money to a veteran’s organization.\n“Mr. @realDonaldTrump can we end our lawsuits and we donate $ to a Veterans NGO to celebrate? Why keep litigating? Let’s both of us win,” Andrés tweeted.\nDrew Harwell contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@keithlalexander", "https://twitter.com/chefjoseandres/status/808747231259947008", "https://twitter.com/@OConnellPostBiz"], "published": "2017-01-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:03:01.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
