View this image › \nKaren Lancashire / Via mineanthology.bigcartel.com \nID: 10763936 Karen Harte, who put together the anthology with Jessica Maybury from Girls Like Comics, told BuzzFeed News she was inspired by American feminist comics.\nThey wanted to create an art book that people could share that would show an Irish perspective on abortion. Ciara O'Neill / Via mineanthology.bigcartel.com , Roisin Blade / Via mineanthology.bigcartel.com ID: 10763911 The eighth amendment of the Irish constitution states that abortion is illegal and punishable by imprisonment unless the life of a pregnant woman is considered to be in immediate danger.\nMany have been campaigning for a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment and replace it with legislation that would allow women free, safe and legal access to abortion. Proceeds from the anthology will be donated to the Abortion Rights Campaign , which is instrumental in driving the movement.\n“For so long in Ireland, abortion has been stigmatised and not talked about,” Harte said. “In the last few years we’ve seen people coming out more and more to tell their stories and there is so much power in that.” View this image › \nClaire Browne / Via mineanthology.bigcartel.com \nID: 10763921 “There is a huge psychological impact of knowing that once you get pregnant in Ireland, if things don’t go well – you’re on your own. That needs to change,” Harte continued.\nImages were collected after Harte put out a call for submissions on social media. The anthology includes designs by both men and women.

Neidin Rodgers / Via mineanthology.bigcartel.com , Roisin Blade / Via mineanthology.bigcartel.com ID: 10763940 Harte said illustrations allowed people to see the issue from the perspective of somebody else, as the form allowed a “glimpse into their world”.
