Handout \nIt is believed Kain Blackwing and his third wife, 25-year-old Diana Blackwing (who also goes by the name Theresa Baker), are the masterminds behind the home invasion and attempted murder. \nThe NY Daily News reports Kain Blackwing and his wives are now facing charges of solicitation for aggravated murder, conspiracy to commit aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder. \nRaven Blackwing was ordered to serve up to 15 years in state prison as a result of the crime. \nHer 19-year-old accomplice, who remains unnamed due to the fact she is a victim of sexual assault, received one year of probation. \nAccording to KSL , Kain, who forced his victims to call him “Lord,” was charged with multiple counts of rape, forcible sodomy and forcible sexual abuse against the woman who broke into the 14-year-old girl’s home with Raven Blackwing.

Google \nThe three used the phrase “playing video games” whenever they referred to the murder plot and referred to their targets with code words such as “Juggernaut” and “Boss.” \nDuring the time of the home invasion, the 14-year-old victim was residing with her mother and mother’s fiancé, who is believed to be one of Kain’s relatives. \nThe Deseret News reports the fiancé awoke to the sound of footsteps in the home just before 4 AM and was able to stop the attackers. \nAccording to police records, the fiancé went upstairs to find the source of the noise and found two people dressed in black who allegedly lunged at him and tried to grab him by the throat. Handout \nThe fiancé told FOX News 13, \nI heard a creak, and there was silence for about 30 seconds. \nI went to the bottom of the stairs and saw a couple of ninjas coming down. They were all dark gray or black, and they had black rubber gloves on and masks. All I could see was their eyes. \nMy adrenaline was pumping so bad. They grabbed for me and one of them covered my mouth, and the other grabbed my throat, but they were both pretty small so I threw them back and started shouting to get anybody awake that I could. \nThere was another man in the home who heard the shuffle and came the fiancé’s defense.
