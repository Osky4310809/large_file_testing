He has also proposed a tax holiday for corporations to repatriate profits held overseas at a 10% rate. These changes are expected to reduce incentives to increase the proportion of foreign earnings relative to domestic ones, to hoard cash overseas and to shift tax bases to other countries through corporate inversions . Manufacturing firms will have the option to expense capital investment in exchange for giving up the corporate interest expense deduction . After three years, this election becomes permanent. Trump's plan will also increase tax incentives for employers to provide onsite childcare facilities. \nInfrastructure (skip to top) \nTrump has promised to dramatically increase infrastructure investment. His most notable project is the wall he has promised to build along the border with Mexico, which he insists that country will pay for. Trump's proposal to force Mexico's hand involves amending the Patriot Act to disrupt the flow of remittances to Mexico, which his plan values at $24 billion per year. Two days later – according to Trump – the Mexican government will make a one-time payment of $5 to $10 billion to fund the wall's construction. The Washington Post has estimated that wall's costs at a significantly higher $25 billion. \nTrump's other infrastructure proposals include investments in railroads, highways, airports, bridges, pipelines (including the Keystone Pipeline), the energy grid, telecommunications, clean water and security infrastructure. In a \"contract\" laying out promises for his first hundred days in office, Trump proposed $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years, adding that the spending would be \"revenue neutral.\" In August, he floated the idea of funding an $800 billion to $1 trillion investment through infrastructure bonds . His campaign site says the money will come from private-public partnerships , cutting red tape, eliminating wasteful spending, and \"leverag[ing] new revenues.\" Despite his promise not to increase the deficit – and occasional promises to eliminate the national debt – few observers expect the infrastructure plan to be revenue neutral. \nHealthcare (skip to top) \nTrump has promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act , universally known as Obamacare. The exact nature of this replacement is still unclear, but Trump has promised to release a plan once Tom Price , his nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, is confirmed. \nA section of Trump's campaign site promises simply to \"replace Obamacare with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) .\" A document posted to the site lists a number of proposals, but cautions that these are \"simply a place to start.\" Trump puzzled observers two days after Election Day by telling the Wall Street Journal that he would keep popular portions of Obamacare, including the provision that prevents insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and the one that allows children to stay on their parents' plans longer then before (until age 26, under current law). \nTrump has ruled out keeping the individual mandate, which requires those who can afford it to purchase insurance or pay a penalty. He has repeatedly said he wants to to fund Medicaid through block grants to states and to allow insurers to sell plans across state lines. Other promises include: allowing individuals to deduct health insurance premiums from their tax returns, enabling them to shop for the most cost-effective treatments, allowing for imported drugs, ​forming high-risk pools, reforming mental health programs cutting back on costs through stricter immigration policies. \nRegulation (skip to top) \nTrump has railed against what he has characterized as excessive, stifling regulation. In his pledges for his first hundred days, he promised to cut two existing federal regulations for every new one that is introduced. He also promised to \"cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.\" He has been particularly critical of energy regulations meant to curb pollution and climate change; his nominee for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, is participating in a multi-state lawsuit against the agency on behalf of Oklahoma, where he is attorney general (see \"Energy\" below). \nShortly after his election victory, Trump promised to \"dismantle\" the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act , a 2010 financial regulation law that passed the House without a single Republican vote and the Senate with only three. Steven Mnuchin , Trump's pick for Secretary of the Treasury, said the law was \"way too complicated and cuts back lending\" in a November 30 interview with CNBC. He identified the Volcker Rule , which aims to prevent banks from making risky bets with consumer deposits, as a particular source of unneeded complexity. \nImmigration (skip to top) \nTrump has made immigration a centerpiece of his campaign since he announced his candidacy in June 2015. In that speech, he offered this description of Mexican immigrants: \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" He proposed building a wall along the southern border, deporting all undocumented immigrants in the United States – an estimated 11 million people – and changing federal law to prevent those born in the U.S. to undocumented parents from automatically gaining citizenship (it is not clear whether a change in the law would be sufficient to eliminate birthright citizenship, or if a constitutional amendment would be needed). \nIn December, Trump called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" \nTrump has since moderated his positions slightly. His promises for the first hundred days in office include beginning to deport \"the more than two million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back.\" The number of criminal undocumented immigrants Trump gives has been disputed. Trump has also walked back on his \"total and complete shutdown\" of Muslim immigration, calling instead for a suspension of immigration from \"terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.\" He has called for \"extreme vetting\" of everyone entering the U.S. \nHis \"contract\" for the first hundred days also proposes a two-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for re-entering the U.S. illegally after being deported; those with previous felony convictions will get at least five years. Trump also intends to punish overstaying visas more harshly and \"to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.\" \nNational Debt (skip to top) \nTrump repeatedly criticized the growth of the national debt – which stands at $19.8 trillion at the time of writing – under the Obama administration. In March, Trump told the Washington Post that he could eliminate the debt within eight years. During the vice-presidential debate , Mike Pence said, \"when we get back to 3.5% to 4% growth, which Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.\" Independent analyses, on the other hand, see Trump's plan to lower taxes and boost spending on infrastructure and defense as adding trillions to the debt. \nIn May, Trump appeared to indicate that he would consider repaying less than the full amount the U.S. had borrowed. While his statements were unclear, and he denied he was \"talking about with a re-negotiation,\" he argued, \"you can buy back at discounts, you can do things with discounts,\" and, \"I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.\" \nEnergy (skip to top) \nDonald Trump has repeatedly called climate change a \"hoax,\" and in 2013 he tweeted, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\" \nGiven this stance, and his enthusiastic courting of voters in Appalachia's coal country, Trump's positions favoring fossil fuels shouldn't come as a surprise. In his promises for his first hundred days, he said he \"will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.\" His nominee to head the EPA, Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, has said the \"debate\" on climate change is \"far from settled.\" \nIn May, Trump said he would \"renegotiate\" last year's Paris Agreement , which saw the U.S., China and 109 other states pledge to limit average global temperature rises to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Later in the month he threatened to \"cancel\" it. His plan for the first hundred days includes a promise to \"cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure.\" \nMonetary Policy (skip to top) \nTrump has been at his least consistent when it comes to monetary policy . He said the Fed was \"creating a bubble\" with low interest rates in August 2015. He warned the following May that raising rates could strengthen the dollar and cause \"some very major problems,\" adding that the dovish Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen , is a \"very capable person.\" By September he was back to criticizing low rates, as well as charging the Fed with doing political things and being \"more political than Secretary Clinton.\" \nThe Fed has a Congressional mandate to generate maximum employment (4.5% to 5% unemployment ) and steady prices (annual core PCE inflation of 2%). Aside from those requirements, however, it is independent , meaning it does not have to seek approval from any branch of government to change monetary policy. Given Trump's accusations that the Fed is acting politically, some have expressed the worry that Trump will attempt to curtail monetary policy independence, as several past presidents have done. Narayana Kocherlakota, who was president of the Minneapolis Fed until December, wrote the week after Trump's victory, \"there is absolutely nothing in U.S. law preventing Trump from violating the Fed's independence, a post-1979 development that rests largely on the restraint of the president.\" Trading Center", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:29:16.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
