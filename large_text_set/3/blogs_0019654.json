(© Gary Hershorn / Reuters/REUTERS)   \nAn Upper East Side woman left her husband on the floor of their apartment for eight days — covered with open wounds and caked in his own filth — leaving him fighting for life, the Daily News has learned. \nLynne Roberts, 68, listed as a Douglas Elliman rep on the real estate company’s website, was charged with endangering the welfare of an incompetent or disabled person, a felony, for the inhumane treatment of her longtime partner, 67-year-old Peter Locker, authorities said. \nLocker had fallen to the ground in the couple’s E. 63rd St. apartment on March 8 and could not get up on his own. \nHe was stuck there for so long, prosecutors said, that the skin on his chest was decaying and he had open wounds on his face, elbow and knee. \nTV producer tied to L.I. mom's drug overdose death pleads guilty \nLocker was “laying on the ground on his stomach, barely conscious and covered in feces, urine and vomit,” when medics were finally summoned around 4:15 p.m. on March 15, according to court papers. \n“The wounds under (Locker’s) chest (are) so deep that you could see his chest bones,” Assistant District Attorney Danielle Turcotte said of the man's disturbing condition at Roberts' arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court on March 16. \n“He had to be put under in order for doctors to attempt to repair the wounds.” \nProsecutors said Locker, who was rushed to New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, could die from his condition. \nTurcotte said that the “best case scenario” was that he could be patched up enough to \"live a little longer, but he will not be able to leave the ICU.\" \nLocker was still admitted to the hospital as of Tuesday afternoon. \nUpon his rescue, Locker told police that he had asked his wife for help — but that she’d refused, according to Roberts’ criminal court complaint. \nRoberts allegedly offered a lame litany of excuses for why she left her beloved to possibly die inside their luxury building. \n“I tried to get him up but he told me no, that he will do it. I was afraid that if I kept trying to help him, he was going to yell at me,” she told police. \nLocker was rushed to Cornell when EMS workers were eventually called to the terrifying scene. \n“He wasn't hostile today so I decided to call 911,\" Roberts said. “He did call out for me and I gave him water and kisses when he did.\" \nRoberts was released on her own recognizance at her arraignment by Judge David Frey. Prosecutors had asked for $25,000 bail — but she was allowed to walk out without posting anything. \nCops hunt man who tried to attack woman in Queens building \nThe wife, who had her own marketing company at one point according to a professional bio, was ordered to stay away from Locker. \nShe’s due back in court May 3, at which time she will find out if she’s been indicted of any crime. \nProsecutors expected to present her case to a grand jury on Tuesday. \nAt her arraignment, her lawyer Adam Felsenstein echoed her version of events and even suggested she was in need of help herself. \nRevelations about Officer Pantaleo's record before Eric Garner \n\"She herself is recovering from a very nasty fall with some very serious latent medical issues,\" Felsenstein said. \n\"She offered her assistance and he refused it for a period of time. During that period of time, she continued to bring him food and tend to his needs,\" he added. \nHe argued that she called 911 once “the relationship softened some.” \nProsecutors said they have been together for 25 years, although it was unclear if they were ever legally married. \n\"He’s actually been the caregiver to her up until he took a fall in their apartment,” the lawyer insisted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:26:44.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
