Charlie Baker warned, saying forecasts were calling for 8 to 14 inches across the state. \nThe snow is expected to hit Boston by 6 a.m., Baker said. \"We are asking folks to stay off the roads tomorrow and not travel unless absolutely necessary,\" he said. More high-res guidance coming in; seeing multiple banding signatures; still thinking 8-14\" widespread but do not rule out areas 12-16\" â€” NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) February 8, 2017 \nAnticipating impacts from the storm, airlines canceled more than 2,400 arrivals and departures from Wednesday through Friday, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. Most of those cancellations, 2,010, were for Thursday flights. \nThe winter storm is being caused by a southward plunge in the polar jet stream, causing a low-pressure system that's moving northeast, according to The Weather Channel . \nA wide swath of the East Coast, from eastern Pennsylvania through New Jersey and north to the Maine coast, was under a winter weather warning, the National Weather Service said. Much of Long Island, New York, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, were under blizzard warnings. People make their way across the Brooklyn Bridge in balmy weather in New York on Wednesday. The city is preparing for up to a foot of snow on Thursday.

Dan Malloy told reporters Wednesday. \nThursday's storm is expected to be the first major snow to hit metropolitan New York in 2017. The heaviest snow is expected to arrive about 7 a.m., just in time for rush hour. \n\"This is going to be a big punch,\" Benjamin Sipprell, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Massachusetts, told The Associated Press. \"It's originating in the Ohio River Valley and starts cranking as it comes across Appalachia.\" \nThe weather is expected to be dramatically different from conditions across the Northeast on Wednesday, which saw highs of 74 degrees in Washington, D.C., 72 degrees in Baltimore, 66 degrees in Philadelphia and 62 degrees in New York City. \n\"You're seeing people out there on bicycles today. Don't be fooled,\" New York City Emergency Management Commissioner Joseph Esposito said. \nEarlier Wednesday, icy conditions were suspected in a 55-vehicle pileup in Wakefield, Massachusetts, north of Boston. Eight people were taken to hospitals, but none of the injuries was considered life-threatening, NBC Boston reported . \n\"When I tapped my brakes, it was just a sheet of ice, and there's nothing I could really do after that. Everybody just started sliding into each other,\" Nathan St. Onge told the station.
