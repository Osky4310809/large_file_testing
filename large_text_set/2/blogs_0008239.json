Fans in the early days found her annoying - snippy; but quickly as the show rolled on and Ahsoka grew in the series, she also grew more and more beloved by fans. Ashley Eckstein's expert voicework, accompanied by Dave Filoni's love for the character and assurance that she has an important role to play in the overall Star Wars story translated into one of the most beloved new characters in the entire franchise. \nFans were heartbroken when she left the Jedi order, and the show. Then with its abrupt cancellation, they started tweeting out \"#AhsokaLives\" - and it came true . Ahsoka survived Order 66 and the Jedi Purge, and she'd eventually go on to return in Star Wars Rebels . Of course, there, once more, she appeared to die, or at least went away. There are further plans for the character, though. One suggestion from fans? Bring her to live action! \nWell, one fan specifically suggested on twitter that Rosario Dawson play an adult Ahsoka Tano in a live-action film, and the actress jumped all over it - even using the appropriate hashtag. â€” Rosario Dawson (@rosariodawson) February 7, 2017 \n\"Um... yes please?!\" Dawson tweeted, adding \"#AhsokaLives #AhsokaTano #StarWars.\" \nThe fan request was in response to friend of Comicbook.com BossLogic, so hopefully he'll do a little mockup. \nSure, it's just a fun one-off comment and there are no known plans at this time for Ahsoka to jump to live action, but the fan campaign to see Ahsoka brought to life is very real. We know some of her stories from the time between Revenge of the Sith and her appearance on Rebels thanks to a great novel, but if she did in fact survive the fight with Darth Vader, her stories could continue well into adulthood, through the original trilogy and beyond. \nRosario Dawson is no stranger to the geek world, after all, currently appearing across the Marvel/Netflix shows as Claire Temple; she's also voiced Wonder Woman, but she's never gotten to jump into the Star Wars world just yet. \nFor now, we have to keep an eye on Star Wars Rebels for Ahsoka's eventual next appearance, but Rosario, we'd be down, too - how do you feel about headtails? --- \nHave you seen LEGO Batman yet?

Executive produced by Simon Kinberg and Dave Filoni, the in-canon series helps to connect the worlds of the films and the previous animated series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars , with guest appearances so far by characters like Lando Calrissian, Ahsoka Tano, Darth Vader, Darth Maul, Leia Organa, Wedge Antilles, and more.
