The company will kick off proceedings with the introduction of the second-generation Porsche Panamera in March – this will be followed by the new 718 Cayman “soon after,” joining the 718 Boxster that was launched last August . \nThe new Panamera is faster and slightly larger than the car that came before it, with a sleeker, sharper exterior design that banishes memories of its ungainly predecessor. The interior has also been completely redesigned, with a 12.3-inch touchscreen and touch-sensitive controls that replace most buttons and switches – even the air vent louvres are adjusted through the touchscreen. \nAlso new is the Executive , with a wheelbase stretched by 150 mm as well as more standard kit including a panoramic roof and adaptive air suspension, along with rear-axle steering and soft-close doors on the 4S and Turbo models. There’s also a new Porsche Rear Seat Entertainment system with 10.1-inch tablets. Given Malaysia’s propensity for longer luxury sedans, the Panamera will likely be offered exclusively in this form. \nFive models are currently available worldwide, all using direct injection and either twin-scroll turbocharging (standard Panamera) or twin turbos. All of them – including the diesel, for the first time – may be equipped with a permanent all-wheel drive system and a new eight-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission. \nAt the base of the range sits the Panamera, powered by a 3.0 litre turbo V6 producing 330 PS from 5,400 to 6,400 rpm and 450 Nm of torque from 1,340 to 4,900 rpm. Zero to 100 km/h is dealt with in 5.7 seconds (5.5 seconds with the Sport Chrono Package), while the top speed is 264 km/h. \nThe Panamera 4S features a 2.9 litre biturbo V6, good for 440 PS at 5,650 rpm and 550 Nm from 1,750 to 5,500 rpm, an increase of 20 PS and 30 Nm over that in the previous model. As such, it will go from 0-100 km/h in 4.4 seconds (4.2 seconds with the Sport Chrono Package) before hitting its 289 km/h top speed. \nMeanwhile, the Panamera 4S Diesel’s 4.0 litre V8 with sequential turbocharging and variable turbine geometry (VTG) develops 422 PS at 3,500 rpm and 850 Nm from 1,000 to 3,250 rpm. It’s the world’s fastest production vehicle with a diesel engine – with a 285 km/h top speed – and manages the 0-100 km/h sprint in 4.5 seconds (4.3 seconds with the Sport Chrono Package). \nAt the top of the range sits the Panamera Turbo, equipped with a 4.0 litre V8 – with cylinder deactivation, cutting fuel consumption by up to 30% – that produces 550 PS at 5,750 rpm and 770 Nm between 1,960 and 4,500 rpm, which is 30 PS and 70 Nm more than in the previous outing. Performance figures include a 0-100 km/h time of 3.8 seconds (with a Sport Chrono Package present, 3.6 seconds) and a top speed of 306 km/h. \nThe environmentally-conscious can step towards the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid , with a new 2.9 litre V6 churning out 330 PS and 450 Nm. Mated to that is a 136 PS/400 Nm electric motor, bringing total system output to 462 hp at 6,000 rpm and a whole 700 Nm of torque between 1,100 and 4,500 rpm – 46 PS and 111 Nm more than the previous E-Hybrid. \nZero to 100 km/h is accomplished nearly a second quicker at 4.6 seconds, while the top speed is slightly higher at 278 km/h versus 270 km/h. It sips less fuel too – combined fuel consumption is significantly improved over the old car’s 3.1 litres per 100 km rating, now sitting at 2.5 litres per 100 km. A larger 14.1 kWh battery means that the all-electric range has also been bumped up from 36 km to 50 km. \nAs for the 718 Cayman, that one is pretty much a facelifted second-generation Cayman, but there are more changes under the skin. The old naturally-aspirated flat-six has been replaced by a 2.0 litre turbo flat-four that produces 300 PS at 6,500 rpm and 380 Nm from 1,950 to 4,500 rpm, up 25 PS and 90 Nm from before. \nThe 718 Cayman S gets a larger 2.5 litre mill that kicks out 350 PS at 6,500 rpm and 420 Nm from 1,900 to 4,500 rpm, gains of 25 PS and 50 Nm. The chassis has also been retuned with stiffer springs, thicker anti-roll bars, a 10% quicker steering rack and 13 mm wider rear wheels. The brakes, meanwhile, now measure 330 mm in front and 299 mm at the rear, with the S using four-piston callipers and 6 mm thicker discs. \nGALLERY: Porsche Panamera Executive", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T10:50:41.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
