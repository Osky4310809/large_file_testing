File photo \n  Ayala Corp., the country’s oldest conglomerate, is tapping the debt market again with the issuance of P10 billion in eight-year bonds, the second tranche of a P20-billion bond program. \nThe listed company is targeting to issue the bonds in February, proceeds of which will be used for its general funding requirements. \nWith the P10-billion issue, Ayala Corp. is utilizing the balance of its approved borrowing of P20 billion under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s shelf registration facility, which took effect in June last year. \nAyala Corp. is targeting to issue the bonds on Feb. 10 with the public offer to run from Jan. 30 to Feb. 3. At the same time, Ayala said the timetable is subject to change, depending on market conditions and SEC’s issuance of permit to sell. \nThe conglomerate tapped BPI Capital Corp., China Bank Capital Corp., PNB \nCapital and Investment Corp. , BDO Capital & Investment Corp., East West Banking Corp. and First Metro Investment Corp. as joint issue managers and joint lead underwriters. \nAyala Corp. issued the first tranche of P10 billion on July 7, 2016 in a deal that was 180 percent oversubscribed. Proceeds of the first offering, which had a rate of 3.92 percent, were used to refinance debt. \nThe company borrows to refinance debt and to partly fund its capital expenditures. For the past three years, Ayala’s capex has hovered above the P170 billion mark: P187 billion in 2014, P185 billion in 2015 and P174 billion in 2016. \nFor 2017, Ayala Corp. is looking at a capex that would be in the same order of magnitude as the 2016 program, officials said. \nAyala Corp. is one of the largest conglomerates in the Philippines with businesses in real estate, financial services, telecommunications, water, electronics manufacturing services, automotive, power generation, transport infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Its corporate social responsibility arm, Ayala Foundation, has programs that focus on education, youth leadership, sustainable livelihood, and arts and culture. \nAside from Ayala, the Philippine Dealing and Exchange Corp., the operator of the country’s bond market, is also looking at new debt listings this year. \nIt hopes to hit P150 billion in new bond issuances in 2017 despite the move of the US Federal Reserve last year to hike interest rates, which could eventually raise borrowing costs. \nIn a recent interview, Philippine Dealing System Group chairman and CEO Cesar Crisol said companies would always have fund raising requirements and have a lot of leeway to issue debt based on their shelf registration with SEC. \nHe said the PDS Group also expects a lot of companies that are focused on infrastructure to raise funds given the Duterte administration’s plan to ramp up infrastructure spending. \nTotal value of new listings in PDEX have reached P109.66 billion in 2016, surpassing 2015 listings of P107 billion. \nThe last to list for 2016 was the Lucio Tan-led Philippine National Bank (PNB), the country’s fourth largest private commercial bank in terms of assets and deposits, which returned to the PDEx market on December 6 to list its P5.38 billion Long Term Negotiable Certificates of Time Deposit (LTNCTD) due 2022.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T04:34:47.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
