He was walking in the direction of Holland Park area. He was carrying a brown leather satchel like bag,” Barry said.\n“The burglar suddenly turned round to face Mr. Mendez and said ‘What do you want, what do you want’ and then started to run,” the prosecutor said.\n“And he was pursued by Mr. Mendez. The burglar dropped the bag and we know he was the burglar because he dropped the proceeds of the burglary,” Barry said, adding that February has racked up 37 theft-related arrests.\nAnother prosecutor, Kevin Christie, said the jewelry belonged to Silverman with an estimated value of $1 million. The stolen pieces included several watches, diamond rings, diamond earrings and diamond bracelets.\nIn a statement read to the jury, Cowell said, “No one has the right or authority to steal from Lauren or myself and I will go to court if required.”\nThe British entertainer is best known for his brutal judging style on reality shows such as “American Idol.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:27:27.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
