It was learnt that the suspects were apprehended by policemen attached to the command’s Anti-Kidnapping Squad in a bank in the Oyingbo area of the state as they were about withdrawing the ransom paid by the boy’s family into an account. The police, however, did not give the name of the bank and the victim. PUNCH Metro gathered that upon their arrest, they led the operatives to a hotel in the community, where the boy was held hostage in one of the rooms. A police source told our correspondent that the manager of the hotel – 219 Hotel – was arrested while the boy had been reunited with his parents. She said, “On January 20, at about 1.45am, a case of kidnap was reported to the command. It was reported that a boy of eight years old was kidnapped by unknown men. Police operatives deployed in Oyingbo arrested two suspected kidnappers. “On Tuesday, intelligence report and investigation carried out by men of the Anti-Kidnapping Squad, traced one of the kidnappers to a bank in Oyingbo, where the suspect wanted to withdraw the ransom that was paid into his account. Sabestine was arrested along with Blessing, who accompanied him to the bank and suspected to be one of the kidnappers. “An on-the-spot interrogation led police operatives to 129 Hotel at the Oyingbo area, where the victim was rescued. He was pale and shivering. He was immediately given medical attention and reunited with his parents.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Dolapo Badmos, a Superintendent of Police, said the hotel had been shut off, adding that efforts were ongoing to arrest other members of the gang. “The hotel used for this disastrous act is under lock and key and the manager of the hotel, one Musibau Lawal, has been arrested and is undergoing interrogation at the command headquaters. “The suspects will be charged to court at the conclusion of our investigation. Parents should keep their children and wards under watchful eye at all times; keep them safe and out of reach of criminals,” she said.
