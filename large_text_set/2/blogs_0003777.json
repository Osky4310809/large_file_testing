A right-wing myth is poised for a reappearance carson Heroine, not \"murderess\": Rachel Carson in 1962. Heroine, not \"murderess\": Rachel Carson in 1962. Michael Hiltzik in 1970 (under President Richard Nixon). Carson’s heroic in defense of her argument that indiscriminate use of pesticides was harming people and damaging the environment is covered by a documentary about her aired last month on PBS as part of its “American Experience” series, and still available online.\nOver at the Lawyers, Guns & Money blog, Erik Loomis sounds the alarm that one of the favorite right-wing calumnies against Carson may be poised to make its reappearance on the national stage. This is the myth that Carson’s description of the dangers of the pesticide DDT, the central theme of her book, undermined programs against malaria -carrying mosquitos around the world and therefore condemned millions of people to death from the parasitical disease. We have put poisonous and biologically potent chemicals indiscriminately into the hands of persons largely or wholly ignorant of their potentials for harm. — Rachel Carson, \"Silent Spring\" \nGoogle’s celebration of Carson in 2014, upon the 50th anniversary of her death, prompted Breitbart news to label her “The 20th Century's Greatest Female Mass Murderer” and ask, “Will Google be paying tribute to any of the other mass killers of the 20th century? Hitler? Stalin? Mao? Pol Pot? Probably not. But then, none of the others have had the benefit of having their images burnished by a thousand and one starry eyed greenies.” \nThe executive chairman of Breitbart at the time was Steven K. Bannon, who is now a top advisor—some say the top advisor, to President Trump . \nLoomis observes that the brief against Carson is easily debunked, as has been done repeatedly. As he states, Carson never called for a complete ban of DDT, no such ban was ever actually imposed, DDT already was declining in effectiveness against mosquitoes because of their rising resistance to the chemical, and that her point was not to condemn all pesticides but their indiscriminate deployment by untrained users.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:50:39.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
