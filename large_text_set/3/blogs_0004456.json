But it’s a story that applies perfectly to our football in these matches at home. \n“It’s the same story – we start well, we have one chance in the first minute, another in the third or fourth minute and we accumulate chances. \n“Then the goalkeeper gets confidence, is the man of the match and so on and so on. We need to score goals. Other teams with less chances, they score more goals.

But are we dead in relation to the top four? No, we’re not dead. \n“There are matches to play, points to win, points to lose, points to fight for, so we’re not dead. But the reality is that we’re losing too many points at home.” \nUnited went ahead through Marcos Rojo in the 23rd minute, but were pegged back when Josh King converted from the penalty spot after Phil Jones had brought down Marc Pugh.
