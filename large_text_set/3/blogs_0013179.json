(Reuters) \nFacebook has aggressively and incessantly been trying to put Snapchat down for a long time. The tech giant wants to do that by cloning every Snapchat feature in every app it owns. Yesterday, Snap’s vice-president (product) Tom Conrad mocked Instagram, by posting a sarcastic tweet to Instagram product chief Kevin Weil. The post was deleted later, yet thanks to the Twitterati the screenshot of the reply went viral. Meanwhile, that did not deter Facebook from making its own decisions to take on Snapchat by cloning its popular feature into the Facebook Messenger. The social media giant has reportedly started rolling out Stories, a feature similar to Instagram Stories. \nTechCrunch reported that Facebook has confirmed the availability of the new feature for its app. The new Facebook Stories feature is a clone of Snapchat Stories, where the pictures disappear in 24 hours. The new feature was earlier launched in Ireland on Android, iOS and promotional videos of the same were also shared on YouTube, but were removed later. Now Facebook is rolling out the Stories feature in other regions around the world. The TechCrunch report said that the Facebook Stories will look exactly like Instagram Stories where a little circular profile photo of the user and their friends will appear at the top of the News Feed. Facebook Stories will feature a blue ring around profile pictures of users who post a new story. \nMeanwhile, Kevil Weil had posted a picture of his kids on March 16 and asked for a fun caption contest. Little did he know that Conrad would be one of the people to respond. Conrad, in a response to kids looking surprised, tweeted: “Wait, it’s going to be *exactly* the same as Snapchat Spectacles????” Wherein the Product VP @Snap takes a shot of his own. \n(To the Head of Product @instagram , no less) pic.twitter.com/K7wo51t4RL \n— Blair Hunter (@blairh) March 16, 2017 \nMeanwhile, people are not too happy with the way Facebook has been copying Snapchat features on Instagram, WhatsApp and its own app as well. Here’s how the Twiterrati reacted: First Snapchat. Then Instagram Stories. Then WhatsApp Statuses. Now Facebook Messenger Day. I CAN’T UPDATE SO MANY!
