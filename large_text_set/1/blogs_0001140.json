Months-long inquiry \nEarlier on Monday, screens were mounted at the entrance to the compound in central Jerusalem in an apparent bid to shield the investigators' arrival. \n\"We hear all the media reports. We see and hear the festive spirit and atmosphere in television studios and in the corridors of the opposition,\" Netanyahu told lawmakers from his Likud party on Monday, according to a video posted to his Facebook page. \n\"I want to tell them to wait for the celebrations. Do not rush. I told you and I repeat: There will be nothing because there is nothing. You will continue to inflate hot air balloons and we will continue to lead the state of Israel.\" WATCH: Benjamin Netanyahu - Israel's media manipulator \nPolice have carried out the probe in secret over some eight months and recently made an important breakthrough, reports said. About 50 witnesses are said to have been questioned. \nIn July, Mandelblit said he had ordered a preliminary examination into an unspecified affair involving Netanyahu, with no details given. \nUS billionaire and World Jewish Congress president Ronald Lauder has been among those questioned in the probe over gifts he allegedly gave Netanyahu and alleged spending on trips for him, Israeli media reported. \nLauder, whose family founded the Estee Lauder cosmetics giant, has long been seen as an ally of Netanyahu, who in the late 1990s put him in charge of negotiating with then Syrian president Hafez al-Assad. Israeli minister resigns after row with Netanyahu \nNetanyahu has acknowledged receiving money from French tycoon Arnaud Mimran, who was sentenced to eight years in prison over a scam amounting to 283 million euros ($297m) involving the trade of carbon emissions permits and taxes on them. \nNetanyahu's office said he had received $40,000 in contributions from Mimran in 2001, when he was not in office, as part of a fund for public activities, including appearances abroad to promote Israel. \nHe has also come under scrutiny over an alleged conflict of interest in the purchase of submarines from a German firm. \nMedia reports have alleged a conflict of interest over the role played by the Netanyahu family lawyer, David Shimron, who also acts for the Israeli agent of Germany's ThyssenKrupp. \nBeyond those issues, Israel's state comptroller released a critical report in May about Netanyahu's foreign trips, some with his wife and children, between 2003 and 2005 when he was finance minister.
