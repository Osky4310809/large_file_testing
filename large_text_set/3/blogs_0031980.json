The request will be heard by a judge from the Seoul Central District Court, who will then decide whether to issue the arrest warrant. No date has been set for that hearing. Park was removed from office on March 10 after South Korea's Constitutional Court upheld a decision to impeach her over allegations of corruption and cronyism. The scandal that brought down Park has dominated South Korean politics for months. Read More Park was accused of being unduly influenced by her longtime friend and adviser, Choi Soon-sil, who is on trial for abuse of power and fraud. The Constitutional Court agreed with accusations that Park had abused her authority in helping Choi raise donations from companies for foundations she had set up. Three people died in violent protests that broke out in Seoul after the court's ruling. A presidential election will be held on May 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:56:27.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
