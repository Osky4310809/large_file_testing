The Crimson Tide are also vying to win back-to-back crowns, which would mark the fourth time in program history they've achieved such a feat. All of this as Bama shockingly switched offensive coordinators the week of the game. More CFP How to watch live \nOn the other side, No. 2 Clemson has redemption on its mind after 45-40 to Alabama just one year ago. The Tigers have not captured a national championship since 1981 and have been unable to defeat the Crimson Tide since 1905.
