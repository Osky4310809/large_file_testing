VPN short for virtual private network allows you to protect your privacy, secure information, and bypass censorship. If you’re looking for the best VPN services, then you are in the right place. In this article, we will explain what is a VPN, why you need a VPN, and share our handpicked list of the best VPN services for WordPress users. \n\nWhat is VPN and Why It is Important? VPN is a Virtual Private Network that helps you secure your internet connection and protect your identity.\nWe all use internet on multiple devices, from multiple locations, and sometimes from public internet spots. \nA compromised public WiFi can give hackers access to your personal information such as passwords, credit cards, browsing history, personal files, etc. They can install malware on your WordPress site, hack your social media profiles, steal your bank account information and more.\nEven direct internet connection at your home or office can be used to view data transferred to and from your devices. \nVPN helps you secure your internet connection and protect your identity. It allows you to browse internet privately using encryption and from different countries (IP addresses). This way you can bypass country specific content restrictions on websites like Netflix, YouTube, BBC, etc. \nAs a WordPress site owner, using a VPN improves your WordPress security . If you are already using SSL on your WordPress site , then using a VPN completely hides your activities behind multiple encryption layers. \nHow VPN Works? \nNormally, all your internet traffic travels through different servers spread across the world. This internet traffic can be spied upon. Hackers and governments can see which websites you are visiting, and what you are doing online. \nA VPN creates a private network that acts as a point to point network between your computer and your VPN server. \nWhen you request a website from your computer using a VPN, your VPN client encrypts your request and then sends it to the VPN server. \nThe VPN server then requests the information from the destination website and encrypts it before sending it back to your computer. \nThis allows you to keep your internet connection secure and away from the prying eyes of hackers, your internet service provider, and governments. \nHow to Choose The Best VPN Service? There are plenty of VPN service providers available that you can use. However, not all of them offer the same level of security, privacy, and ease of use. \nHere is what you need to look for in the best VPN service: \nEase of use – You will need easy to use apps for all your devices, so you can quickly connect to your VPN, switch servers, change IPs without any technical skills. \nSpeed and Bandwidth – VPN services can be slow if they don’t have enough bandwidth to support faster connections for all their customers. You need to choose a company that has the infrastructure to support faster connections. \nLocations and Servers – More servers on multiple locations means you can choose servers from different countries with different IPs. It also allows you to switch from a slower server to a faster one. \nPrivacy and Security – You need to make sure that your VPN service provider is offering the best layer of security to protect your privacy. This means not keeping logs and using layers of encryption for all data transfers. \nHaving said that, let’s take a look at the top VPN services and how they stack up against each other. \n1.
