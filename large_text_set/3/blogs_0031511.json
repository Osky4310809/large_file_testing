Kathryn speaks up on KathNiel relationship status By Deni Rose M. Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com) | Updated March 29, 2017 - 9:34am Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla give life to Mia and Ely who would start their lives again in Spain in the film \"Barcelona: A Love Untold.\" Star Cinema/YouTube, screenshot \nMANILA, Philippines — Rumor has it that for career growth, Daniel Padilla’s camp allegedly asked ABS-CBN to have him paired with fellow singer-actor Sarah Geronimo. \nThe suspicion that Daniel is slowly drifting away from his love team with Kathryn Bernardo has been growing stronger as Daniel had been recently seen more and more frequently with Sarah, singing a duet or hosting with her in the Sunday variety show “ASAP.” \nDaniel also expressed his desire to do a movie with Sarah. Is this the beginning of the end for Team Kathniel? \nWhen asked what she feels about Daniel filming with Sarah, Kathryn said: “Ako rin, gusto ko maka-work si Ate (Sarah) kasi fan ako ni Miss Sarah Geronimo. At kung magkaroon man sila ng project together in the future with or without me, i-support na lang natin kasi gusto n’ya ‘yun and para magbigay din tayo ng ibang opportunity dahil cute din naman din if ever mangyari at big fan din ako ni Ate Sarah.” \nDuring her recent launch as beauty brand endorser of Pond's, Kathryn denied that she feels intimidated by the rumors, which is why she has been exercising harder and getting sexier and hotter. Is Kathryn Bernardo getting sexier because she is threatened by Sarah Geronimo?

Paano ba dapat mag-react? Eh ‘di tanungin n’yo na lang ulit s’ya!” the actress told reporters. \nIf Daniel wishes to team up with Sarah, Kathryn said she also has her own wish list for next leading men, including John Lloyd Cruz, Piolo Pascual and Jericho Rosales. \n“I’m very open kung sino ‘yung ipe-pair basta ‘yung maga-guide ako at marami akong matututunan sa tao na ‘yun,” Kathryn said. \nHer wish to spend her 21st birthday in a beach with Daniel came true. Last March 26, Kathryn posted her sweet photos with Daniel in Palawan. #TeamKathniel: Kath and Daniel celebrating the actress' recent birthday in Palawan.
