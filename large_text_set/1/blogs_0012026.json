The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rule the region from their seat of Winterfell and Rickard also held the title Lord of Winterfell . [1] Lyanna is betrothed to Robert Baratheon. \nLyanna had three brothers, Brandon , Eddard , and Benjen Stark . Her father arranged a betrothal between her and Robert Baratheon , Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands . \nSome time after the betrothal, Lord Walter Whent organized a great tourney at Harrenhal , in which Lyanna saved Howland Reed from a group of squires. Later, she took him to their tent, where she introduced him to her three brothers. Prince Rhaegar Targaryen , the heir to the Iron Throne , was the victor. Afterwards, the Prince rode past his wife, Princess Elia Martell , and placed a crown of winter roses, the crown of the Queen of Love and Beauty , on Lyanna's lap. This action was considered an outrage by many because not only was Rhaegar married but Lyanna was already betrothed to another man. [2] Lyanna is taken by Rhaegar Targaryen. At some point after these events, Lyanna was abducted by Rhaegar, who took her south and hid her away in Dorne . [3] Brandon, who had been on his way to Riverrun to wed Catelyn Tully , instead went to King's Landing to demand Rhaegar's arrest and punishment. King Aerys II Targaryen had him and all his companions charged with treason. He demanded all their fathers, including Lord Rickard Stark, come to King's Landing and promised they would receive a fair trial. Instead the King had them all burned alive, except for Brandon, who strangled himself trying to save his father. [4] \nThis incident sparked the uprising known as Robert's Rebellion . Jon Arryn was commanded to arrest and turn over his wards Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark, but he refused. The three of them rose in rebellion along with Hoster Tully of Riverrun after Eddard and Jon married his daughters, Catelyn and Lysa . The war saw House Targaryen almost completely destroyed and Robert installed as king after he personally slew Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident . During the war Lyanna died from childbirth in Eddard's arms, after her rescue . [5] As per her request, she was buried next to her brother Brandon in the crypts at Winterfell . [6] Robert continued to mourn her despite becoming king and marrying Cersei Lannister . [5] Though Eddard was angered at Robert for refusing to hold Tywin Lannister and his army accountable for the Sack of King's Landing , their friendship was rekindled over the mutual grief for Lyanna. [7] Lyanna is buried in the tomb beneath Winterfell. Lyanna's death was revealed to be from complications from giving birth to her son, Jon Snow , whose father is Rhaegar. Her death was witnessed by Ned and two handmaidens and most likely Howland Reed. Before her death, Lyanna asks Ned to promise to keep her son safe from Robert, who would have the child killed if he found out Rhaegar was the father. Ned complies with Lyanna's wish and takes the infant to Winterfell. Fulfilling his promise, Ned says the boy is his bastard son, and named him Jon Snow . Few know the truth of Jon's parentage; with Ned, Howland and the two handmaidens being the only individuals bearing the knowledge. Edit Robert Baratheon visits Lyanna's grave. King Robert Baratheon visits Lyanna's tomb under Winterfell almost immediately after arriving. As part of their romance, he would bring her feathers from an exotic southern bird. During this visit, he places one in the hand of her statue. Robert says the statue doesn't do her justice. He becomes emotional and tells Eddard how he relives killing Rhaegar Targaryen again and again in his dreams for what he did to Lyanna. He asks Eddard if it was necessary to bury Lyanna in a cold tomb rather than somewhere in the sunlight, but Eddard responds that she was of the North and of House Stark ; this is her place. [6] \nWhile departing Winterfell, Jon Snow asks Eddard about his mother, still unaware of her identity, and as to whether or not she is alive or knows about him. Still unprepared to tell Jon the truth about Lyanna and Rhaegar, Eddard merely promises that the next time they meet, they will talk about Jon's mother. [8] \nIn King's Landing , Robert shares a drink with his wife, Cersei Lannister , and they begin to talk about Lyanna Stark for the first time in their marriage. Robert tells her how much Lyanna meant to him, even though now he cannot even remember her face, saying she was the only thing he ever wanted but then someone took her away from him, and even the entire Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left. Cersei reminds him that she once had feelings for him, which he acknowledges. She asks if there had ever been even a moment when he had loved her but Robert says no. He asks her if that makes her feel better or worse. Cersei replies it doesn't make her feel anything. [9] \nWhen Eddard discovers that Cersei has been having an incestuous affair with her twin brother Jaime , he confronts her. Cersei denies Eddard's accusation that she always hated Robert, saying she once worshiped him back when he was young and handsome and muscular. All the girls wanted him, and he was hers by oath. But then that love turned to hate on their wedding night when he came to bed drunk, and afterwards muttered Lyanna's name in her ear. [10] The statue at Lyanna's grave in Winterfell. Bran Stark shows Osha the tombs under Winterfell and gives a quick summary of the events leading to the civil war: how Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna, who was betrothed to Robert Baratheon, and the Mad King then killed Lyanna's brother and father, triggering the war. [11] Edit \nWhen speaking to her daughter-in-law Talisa Stark , Catelyn Stark confesses her guilt over not being a mother to Jon Snow , and even praying for his death \"all because [she] was jealous of his mother\", not knowing she was Ned's sister, Lyanna.
