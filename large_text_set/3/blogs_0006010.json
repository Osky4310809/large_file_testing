The only expression a group of footballers can pull after a 5-1 spanking (Photo: BongartsGetty Images) \nGiven the abject nature of their 5-1 thrashing in the first leg, the likelihood of Arsenal overturning the deficit at the Emirates and progressing to the Champions League quarter-finals is so slim as to be virtually non existent. \nAs usual, the bookies are the ones who have done the best job of illustrating the hopelessness of the Gunners' situation - as these odds from Ladbrokes demonstrate. \"I used to play with Lionel Messi, for God's sake\" (Photo: Getty) \nBefore the first leg in Germany, Arsenal were 2/1 to knock out Bayern and qualify for the last eight. Now, after that 5-1 hammering in Bavaria, they are currently 25/1 to qualify. That's quite a change. \nThere's more. A 4-0 win for Arsenal - the result Wenger's side need - is currently going off at 100/1. At the time of writing, the biggest bet Ladbrokes have had on that is 33p. \nIt gets worse. With the odds on Arsenal going through standing at 25/1, Ladbrokes OFFICIALLY think all these things are currently more likely than Gunner glory this evening… Alien life being discovered within the next year: 10/1 England winning the next World Cup: 16/1 (Photo: Laurence Griffiths/Getty) Piers Morgan closing his Twitter account: 10/1 (Photo: ITV) Tottenham winning the league this season: 16/1 Donald Trump opening a hotel in Mexico: 8/1 (Photo: Getty) The next James Bond being a woman: 22/1 (Photo: Getty Images) Snow falling in the UK in June, July or August: 14/1 (Photo: PA)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:52:36.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
