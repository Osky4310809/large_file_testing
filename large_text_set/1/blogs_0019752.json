Proud to have made my debut for @OL ! To enter the pitch in the clubs shirt felt so good, thanks for the warm welcome! #TeamOL pic.twitter.com/0IX20ht4he \n\"He lacks the rhythm of matches but he is physically well. He has so much desire. This is an additional asset and variety for our team.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T12:33:13.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
