Gemma said she immediately broke out in red puffy skin (Photo: SWNS - Leeds SWNS.com) Her eyes and ears also became gluey (Photo: SWNS - Leeds SWNS.com) \nGemma has vowed never to touch hair dye again - and is urging others to do patch tests before donning the dye. \nGemma, who is naturally mousy brown, said: \"I just can't believe it - it's mad. I'm never touching hair dye again.\" \nMiss Williams claimed that within 24 hours she had bubbly skin, red marks, burns around her ears and her eyes were almost glued shut. \nShe went to Manchester Royal Infirmary and was given steroids and antibiotics to treat the inflammation and rashes after initially putting the hair dye on January 20. Gemma has vowed never to use a hair dye again (Photo: SWNS - Leeds SWNS.com) \nBut Gemma, of Droylsden, Grt Mancs., said a week later the creams and tablets hadn't helped and re-visited the hospital to find out she was being poisoned. \nGemma, who spent two weeks in hospital, said: \"I have used the same dark hair dye before and had no problem. \n\"I had blonde hair for years and wanted to have it darker, so I bought the black one, put it on and it's obviously reacted. \n\"I had swelling in my ears and puss coming out of the burns on my skin - and even my eyes were stuck together. \n\"I had a rash all over my face and it awful - it knocked by confidence, I couldn't sleep.\" \nShe had followed the instructions of the hair dying product down to the tee, but within 12 hours she was \"looking like bubble woman\".
