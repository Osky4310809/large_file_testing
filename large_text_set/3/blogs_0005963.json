Airlines wanting to fly from Wales to Heathrow will be able to bid for a share of a proposed £10m route fund, the Welsh Government has said. \nMinisters and Heathrow have signed a \"strategic partnership\" agreement to identify business opportunities from the planned third runway . \nAs part of that, the Welsh Government confirmed airlines wanting to run a route could bid for the fund. \nBut the Welsh Conservatives said the deal had no \"tangible commitments\". \nIt comes after the Welsh Government was criticised by Plaid Cymru last year after supporting the third runway project without getting anything back in return and after the Scottish Government had reached a \"memorandum of understanding\" which included £200m in construction spending. \nThe UK government said last October, after years of delay, that building a third runway at Heathrow was its preferred option for expanding airport capacity in the UK.

'No strong commitments' \nBut Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative leader, said the announcement \"is a case of the Welsh Labour Government joining the party after last orders with no strong and tangible commitments like those secured by counterparts in Scotland\". \nPlaid Cymru's transport spokesperson, Jonathan Edwards, said: \"Heathrow should be congratulated on having superior negotiating skills to the First Minister of Wales.\" \n\"The Scottish Government secured a commitment from Heathrow to reduce landing charges for all airlines operating services from Heathrow to Scotland, and a £200m commitment on construction related spend in Scotland. No such commitments for Wales,\" he said. \nCardiff Airport is keen to explore opportunities with Heathrow after the new runway is operational, chief executive Deb Barber said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:22:27.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
