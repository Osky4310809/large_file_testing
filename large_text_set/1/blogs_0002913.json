It looks like a new player is riding onto the portable locator scene, and it just might have a go at the established trackers. It’s called Xupo, and we just caught our first glimpse of it at CES 2017 .\nXupo is the second tracker from Connect In, its forerunner being the myLupo. Whereas the myLupo was only available in Europe, Xupo will be coming to the US.\nJust like its competitors, Xupo can be used to keep track of your phone or keys. Or, heck, the TV remote. Attach the sleek little gadget to whatever you’re sick of losing, and never have to worry about it again. It also naturally interacts with your smartphone, meaning a click on its button can ring your handset. You can also map a tracked object and see the exact location where it was last detected. But we’ve seen this stuff before.\nSee also: Tile’s new ‘Slim’ is the tiniest tracker we’ve ever seen August 31, 2016 Xupo’s got a couple of things that set it apart, however. Connect In says that they’ll be opening up their software to developers, meaning soon the crafty minds of devs all over the world will be coming up with creative ways to put Xupo to work for them.\nOne idea they already came up with uses Xupo as a remote shutter-release button for your smartphone. Set up your smartphone for a shot, say cheese, and click the Xupo. Another idea includes using Xupo as a panic button to immediately call the police in the event of a personal attack.\nIt’s also worth noting that Connect In has some eco interests as well. All the packaging that the device comes in is environmentally friendly, and unlike the Tile, which becomes a worthless piece of plastic after a year, Xupo’s battery is replaceable. Connect In representatives say that Xupo’s battery life is also about a year.\nXupo can currently be pre-ordered from myxupo.com , and reps say they plan on having the product out by the end of the month. US customers looking to pre-order will unfortunately have to pay shipping, but when the product goes live it will be available on Amazon with free shipping.\nWhat do you think of Xupo? Will it be giving TrackR and Tile ample competition?
