This one of Adele and Lady Gaga might just be illegal, as it's far too sassy to handle. \nThe two queens of pop posed together at last night's 2017 Grammy Awards, where they both performed – and no doubt bonded over the technical difficulties they both suffered. \nAdele had had to halt her tribute to George Michael when she realised she was singing in the wrong key, and stopped part-way through her performance of Fast Love to apologise to the audience.

Adele and Beyonce go back a long way - here they are at the Grammy Awards in 2013 \nIn a tearful acceptance speech, Adele – who has previously praised Beyonce for her work – said she couldn't possibly accept the award because Bey was a more deserving winner. \n\"The artist of my life is Beyonce and the Lemonade album was just so monumental, Beyonce, and so well thought out and so beautiful and soul-baring,\" she told her mentor. \n\"And we all got to see another side to you that you don't always let us see, and we appreciate that. And all us artists here, we f**king adore you, you are our light. And the way you make my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel is empowering, and you make them stand up for themselves. I love you, I always have and I always will.\" Adele paid tribute to her icon, Beyonce (Photo: REUTERS) She later spoke to Jay Z (Photo: Getty Images North America) The two embraced after Adele won five gongs at the awards ceremony (Photo: Getty Images North America) \nBeyonce looked visibly moved by Adele's message and mouthed \"I love you\" back at her while husband Jay Z stood by her side.
