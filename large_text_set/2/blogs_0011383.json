The transparent bubble design is strategic to receiving an optimal amount of sunlight all day long, making it a perfect tool for growing plants as well as a chill-out area for reading or snoozing in the sun.\n\n\nThe Sunbubble is a one-piece folding pack design with flexible fiberglass rods that allow for quick and easy assembly on almost any surface. The curved design lets the inside warm up much faster than a traditional greenhouse , enabling the surface to stay at 90 degrees towards the sun all day long, achieving minimum reflection and maximum light. Adjustable vents let gardeners control the interior temperature depending on their planting profile.\nRelated: Gorgeous Bubble Gardens Pop Up in the Streets of Paris \nhttps://youtu.be/4ktuqgOEqLc\nAlthough there are many greenhouses on the market, the Sunbubble's fun design doubles as a mini Eden for those wanting to enjoy their garden space year-round.
