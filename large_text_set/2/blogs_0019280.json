You’ve heard George Takei talk about it. Now here’s another guy who you may or may not like talking about it. Except, like the latter and unlike the former, this guy will suffer no professional consequences for it. Because he’s a liberal. \nOne thing to note about the following two clips is that they’re not from some obscure webcast, as in Milo’s case, or from Howard Stern’s show, as in Takei’s case. These were both aired on network television. Millions of people saw Bill Maher say these things. \nHere’s Maher on his old show, Politically Incorrect , defending Mary Kay Letourneau: if bill maher thinks sunlight is the best disinfectant then here's him saying the same shit as milo, that it's ok for adults to fuck kids pic.twitter.com/tqPAzbGY3J \n— warrior cop (@wyatt_privilege) February 22, 2017 \nWhen the voice of reason in the conversation is Henry Rollins … \nAnd here’s Maher on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2005, engaging in what our lib friends in 2017 would call “normalization” of pedophilia: \nNow, as I said however many news cycles ago , I don’t think this is a free speech issue. People have the right to associate, or not associate, with anybody they want. If a political conference decides to cancel Milo’s speaking engagement, that’s their right. If his publisher wants to cancel his book and throw away the $250,000 advance they gave him because the bad publicity isn’t worth it to them, they get to do that. That’s how it works in America. \nBut do I even need to point out the double standard? I honestly don’t see the difference between what Yiannopoulos is in trouble for saying and what liberals in good standing like Takei and Maher have said. The only difference is that George and Bill regularly express the sociopolitical opinions that are expected of them by our friends in the media, and Milo doesn’t. That’s why none of the stuff that’s happening to him will not happen to either of them. \nThat’s also how it works in America. \nYou can hate anybody you want, libs, for any reason you want. But don’t pretend you’ve won some sort of moral victory. You got your scalp. You achieved your political ends. That’s all this really is. \nCongratulations, I guess?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:00:15.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
