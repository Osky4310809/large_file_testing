This is quite the tattoo (Photo: UGC HDE) Reece will be entering the pitch right about now (Photo: PhotoEye.co.uk) \nSmailes' newly-inked tattoo started to become sore when in contact with the barrier, so he claims he had no choice but to vault over it and spill out onto the pitch. \nAs reported by the Huddersfield Examiner , the 24-year-old - who received a football banning order for punching a fan in 2011 - wasn't issued with another order, but the court have ordered him to pay a £484 fine, as well as £85 court costs and a £32 victim surcharge. Reece (seen here on the right) has seriously upgraded his tattoo from this effort (Photo: Internet unknown) \nRachel Sharpe, mitigating, told magistrates: “The defendant was being shoved up against the barrier and then jumped over it to prevent discomfort having had a new tattoo. \n“He ran towards the pitch but stopped himself before entering the pitch. \n“This was in the last minute of the game when Newcastle scored and he was celebrating. \n“He didn’t encroach into the pitch as he knows he shouldn’t and was quickly apprehended.” poll loading Have you got the name of your team tattooed on you? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:41:29.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
