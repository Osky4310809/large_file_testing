Called the Redditch Edition, this bike commemorates Enfield’s time during the hey-days of British bike manufacturing in the 1950s. \nThe Redditch moniker is taken from Royal Enfield’s factory in the town of the same name, 24 km south of Birmingham, England, where the Bullet 500 and 350 were made. The factory closed down in 1967, and the Royal Enfield name continued on as Enfield India until its takeover by Eicher Motors, with the name being changed to Royal Enfield Motors. \nAs a current model, the 2017 Royal Enfield 350 Classic features a distinctly “Brit-bike” retro look, using a 350 cc air-cooled single-cylinder aluminium twin-spark SOHC engine that produces 19.8 hp at 5,250 rpm and 28 Nm torque at 4,000 rpm. The engine drives a five-speed gearbox, and uses a 29 mm CV carburettor. \nWeighing in at 187 kg wet, the Classic 350 uses a single, two-piston hydraulic caliper brake in front, grabbing a 280 mm disc, while the rear uses a 135 mm diameter drum. Having ridden a Royal Enfield Classic 500, performance of any Enfield is, shall we say, leisurely. \nThe 2017 Royal Enfield Classic 350 is listed at an on-the-road price in New Delhi, India, of 1.46 lakh rupees (RM9,637). In Malaysia, Royal Enfield is represented by The Big Bike Shop, which retails the Classic 350 at RM31,272.50, on-the-road.
