[Photo provided to China Daily] \nTwo nurses in Beijing are under administrative detention for putting their own locks on two publicly shared bikes. \n\"The two nurses who put private locks on public-use bikes disturbed the public order,\" said Liu Lin, a lawyer at Beijing Shuangli Law Firm, because it prevented other people from using the bikes. \nThose who intentionally damage property may face a five- to 10-day administrative detention, according to the Law on Public Security Administration Punishments. \nTang Ke from the publicity office of OFO, the company that owns the bikes, confirmed the news and said further investigation was underway. \nThe market for public-use bikes - which are stored along sidewalks and can be accessed through an app - has boomed in China since the middle of last year. The new mode of transportation has brought a greener and more convenient mode of urban transportation, but the model has also caused many problems including illegal parking, theft and vandalism. Parking violations are also a common problem, followed by violation of traffic rules. \n\"Once users scan the app and click 'accept' when they rent the bike, they have signed an agreement with the service provider and should follow the rules,\" Liu said. \nOFO has introduced a blacklist banning users who break its rules. \nMany cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen are proposing draft regulations to manage the market for public bikes. The Shenzhen traffic police department has also announced fines for the illegal parking of bikes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:24:14.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
