According to an arrest affidavit, she was angry because she thought the boy lost her cell phone charger. Police say the crime took place April 30. \nThe affidavit describes how Kennedy-Flores can be seen slamming a booster chair into the child’s playpen, then on or near the child himself. \nThe affidavit also said she can be heard swearing at the child, as well as yelling, “I’m going to kill you.” \nThe report details the bruises on the child’s arms and legs, as well as two dark spots on his forehead that appeared to be bruises as well. \nSee our map, report and neighborhood rankings of violent crimes in Denver . \nAt her sentencing, Kennedy-Flores offered tearful pleas to the court not to separate her further from her child and her family. She felt some good had come out of the case. \n“I kind of think of this as a blessing,” she said. “It’s brought my sister closer to me and a lot of people are closer who want to be there for my child.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:45:08.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
