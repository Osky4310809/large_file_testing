The governors have decided to take local government for a ride. It is constitutional right for local government to exist. \n“It was the ALGON who engaged lawyers to see how the money can be refunded back to the Federal government. Having done that, the right thing was to involve those that made it possible for the money to be refunded and rather the money was paid to Governors Forum. \nGovernors Forum is another parallel government. The governors should how back to their various states and provide governance. Some governors don’t have the interest of the people at heart. Some of the money paid in the first tranche went to voice mail. Some have gotten to private pockets. Some states have not paid salaries or pensioners from the loan refund. \n“Those who fought for the money to return to Nigeria should benefit from the Paris Club refund. This action of the governors is totally wrong.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:08:48.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
