Worse than a Nothing Burger. It was a Help Trump Burger,” the comedian said, noting that the two-page document from President Trump’s 2005 tax returns showed that he paid $38 million in taxes on earnings of $150 million, which is about 25 percent. \n“Which is well within respectable! This is probably the best tax return he’s ever filed… which makes me think this came from Donald Trump!” Maher said, suggesting that “liberals have to be careful these days.” \n“He’s actually good at this,” Maher said, referring to Trump. “If we want to win this, we can’t get played. This is getting played.” Also Read: Rachel Maddow Admits No 'Damning Bombshell' Came From Trump's Tax Return (Video) \n“I didn’t like what she did,” Frank interjected. “Her journalistic scoop was, apparently, to say, ‘Oh, thank you.’ I don’t consider that crusading journalism.” \nMaddow appeared on “The Tonight Show” Wednesday to discuss her reveal of President Trump’s tax returns that left some viewers disappointed earlier in the week. “Was there a huge, damning bombshell in these tax returns? No. The bombshell here is that some of his tax returns were made public for the first time when he’s been trying so hard to keep them secret,” Maddow told host Jimmy Fallon. \nRead original story Bill Maher Calls Rachel Maddow’s Trump Tax Scoop ‘A Big Nothing Burger’  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T12:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T08:52:39.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
