Nangyari lahat, yung mga schedule namin (Everything happened, our schedules), the script is so beautiful, it’s something that I wouldn’t want to miss,” said Toni. \nNo further details about the movie have been released, but Toni said that movie is very different from Starting Over Again, which is a romantic comedy. \n“ Sobrang iba. Actually hindi mo siya puwedeng paglapitin. Magkaibang genre. Hindi ko siya mae-elaborate lahat pero I’ve never been this excited to go back to doing movies nung nabasa ko yung script,” she said. \n(It's very different. Actually you can't compare them. It's a very different genre. I cannot elaborate on it that much but I've never been this excited to go back to doing movies when I read the script.) \nThe two were supposed to work together on a drama show called Written In Our Stars , but it was shelved after Toni got pregnant with her son Seve . Toni has since returned to work on Pinoy Big Brother and Home Sweetie Home , her show with John Lloyd Cruz. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
