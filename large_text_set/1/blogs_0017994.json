The Deploraball took place downtown inside the National Press Club, while protesters tried to disrupt the proceedings from the streets outside. A fire was set on the street, reportedly of Trump-related items.\nFootage of the fire showed a crowd around it, including a young boy flipping his middle fingers at the flames. Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins asked the boy who said he was part of starting the fire why he did so.\n“Because I felt like it and because I’m just, uh, saying ‘screw our president!'” the boy said.\nJenkins reported that arrests have been made and tear gas may have been used.\nOther scenes from the protests showed lights with messages shining on nearby buildings and even a Trump supporter beaten by a mob.\nSome #protest lights on the National Press Building. #Inauguration #DeploraBall pic.twitter.com/rSHRVqTxdN \n— Ben Kesling (@bkesling) January 20, 2017 \n\nYoung Republican wades into volatile crowd of protesters in front of Washington’s National Press Club building, site of the Deploraball. pic.twitter.com/BAUXEeM8sF \n— Neil W.
