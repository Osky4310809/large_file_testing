(George Jiang via Flickr ) \nFor much of March it has felt like the winter that never came. Through two-thirds of the month, cold days have outnumbered warm days. The biggest snow event of the winter happened. Wind chills seem like a daily occurrence. Remarkably, March may end up colder than February. \nFebruary was, of course, historically warm. D.C. finished an astounding 8.7 degrees above the average temperature of 39 degrees. \nBut March is the new winter, apparently. We seem poised to finish with a cooler March than February for one of the few times in recorded history — although it will likely be a close call. \nFebruary was weirdly warm \nThe main reason we are able to possibly finish this month colder than February is because it was so darn warm. \nFebruary’s average temperature of 47.7 degrees was warmer than the March average of 46.8 degrees. \nThe month had 23 days with temperatures above average and only five below average. Nine of them were an astonishing 10 degrees or more above average! \nDespite setting a record high of 80 degrees on March’s first day , the month has already seen 12 colder than average days. This includes a winter-long seven-day streak of colder than normal conditions that included a snowstorm in the region. We should finish with at least two or three more cooler than normal days before the month is over. \nMarch has been colder than February before, but … \nPrevious instances of a March colder than February don’t look a whole lot like this year, at least when it comes to temperature. This February’s average temperature of 47.7 degrees was almost four degrees warmer than any previous February which was warmer than March. \nSo while we may end up with a colder March than February, it will be quite a bit warmer than any other time this has happened in history. \nNonetheless, it’s a weird outcome. There have only been seven instances prior (and one year that was a tie), comprising 5 percent of the modern record. Almost all were when D.C.’s weather observations were recorded downtown, before the mid-1940s. \nInterestingly enough, all of the years with a colder March than February also had accumulating snow. If 2017 joins this prestigious list, it will bring along a snow tally in tow as well. \nA photo finish? \nFor a while it seemed like 2017 was a lock to enter the elite club of years with a colder March than February. But that’s no longer the case. Warmer than normal weather is predicted for the next nine days. It’s not out of the question March’s average temperature ultimately nudges past February’s. GEFS temperature forecast for D.C. over the next 16 days. (Weatherbell.com) \nPresently, we’re in a several day dip in temperatures, but it won’t be a long-lived one. Temperatures trend upward late this week and may surpass 70 Saturday. Beyond, there may be a bump or two in the road, but springlike 60s look to dominate. \nSo, at this point, we project a final monthly temperature between 46.0 and 47.5 degrees based on the best modeling. This would mean March finishes 0.5 to 1.5 degrees colder than February. \nBut if D.C.’s temperatures end up warmer than predicted, which often happens it seems, February could still end up a hair colder than March. In that case, March will have put up a valiant fight to out-winter February and, at the very least, produced more snow. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:53:22.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
