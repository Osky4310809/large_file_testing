It could be, but it’s not. It’s actually a whole lot more fun than that.\nNimuno Loops toy block tape is all about letting you stick Lego creations anywhere you want. It looks a lot like a long, rubberized, two-by plate. The adhesive on the back is reusable, too, so you can stick and unstick a section over and over again.\nThe tape itself can handle curves with no problem, but keep in mind that Lego bricks won’t necessarily be as forgiving. To get a nice, firm hold, you’ll need Nimuno Loops fairly flat in the spots where you plan to stick bricks. Other than that, the sky’s the limit.Slap some up on the fridge and leave your roommates and loved ones brick-built messages. Lego up a boring old picture frame or decorate your keyboard or monitor. Stick it to the bottom of another Lego piece and pull off some sneaky illegal builds! Booby trap your room by rolling out bricky spike strips to assail the feet of unwanted visitors!\n\nEach roll measures 6.5 feet. Pledge your support for the Indiegogo project , and you can pick one up for $5.50 or less. A two-pack goes for $11, and you can buy in bulk, too. Starting at the 10-roll level, the price drops to $5 a roll.\nRustle up $500 bucks with your co-workers, and you can turn the whole office into a Lego wonderland! Build on the water coolers, whiteboards, copier, or right on top of your cubicle partitions!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:31:10.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
