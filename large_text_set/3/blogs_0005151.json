The effort is led by the nonprofit Committee of Melbourne.\nMartine Letts, the group’s chief executive, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that “t he idea is to install traffic lights with female representation, as well as male representation, to help reduce unconscious bias. ”\nRather than mere symbolism, Letts believes that the change is “ a practical and meaningful way to demonstrate that in fact 50% of our population is female, ” reports ABC. The group hopes that, in the long run, men and women can be equally represented across the state of Victoria.\nStefan Postles—Getty Images Female traffic light signals are installed an intersection in Melbourne, Australia on March 7, 2017. Melbourne isn’t the world’s first major metropolis where pedestrian lights have become a vehicle for spreading messages of gender equality. Silhouettes of women on pedestrian crossings have been used in New Zealand and Germany, according to the Guardian . And in 2015, Vienna featured gay and lesbian couples on pedestrian signals temporarily, around the time the city hosted the annual Eurovision Song Contest.\n[ ABC , Guardian ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T10:32:53.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
