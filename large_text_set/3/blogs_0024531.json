ADVERTISEMENT \nThe announcement was a surprise considering that Muller is still in his prime at 29 years old. In fact, Muller was in fine form for Ceres in its first three AFC Cup matches recently. \nBut when it came to the Azkals, Muller had to battle English League One veteran Neil Etheridge for the starting spot—something that sources said hastened the Filipino-German’s decision to quit. \nAzkals manager Dan Palami paid tribute to Muller’s efforts to raise the level of the Azkals when he started playing for the team in 2011. \n“I’m sure Roland (Muller) thought over his decision,” said Palami. “The Philippines is lucky to have a talented player like Roland represent the country. We wish him luck in his career and life outside international football.” \nMuller’s best games came in the 2014 Challenge Cup in the Maldives, where he helped the Azkals to a finals appearance in the last edition of the tournament. \nKnown for his shotstopping and agility, Muller came up with huge penalty saves against Turkmenistan and Maldives in the Challenge Cup, underlining his quality. \nFollowing Muller’s retirement, Azkals coach Thomas Dooley called up Global’s Nicholas O’Donnell to serve as third-choice goalkeeper with Patrick Deyto serving as Etheridge’s chief backup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:11:42.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
