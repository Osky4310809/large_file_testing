Dubbed the A 200 Activity Edition, the new variant comes without the sportier look of the A 200 AMG Line (for those who’d like a more subtle appearance, perhaps), but adds a number of aesthetic tweaks inside and out as well as a bit of extra kit. \nJust 30 units will be made available nationwide, each priced at RM205,888 on-the-road without insurance – exactly the same price as the AMG Line. Included is a four-year, unlimited-mileage warranty. \nAs mentioned, the Activity Edition ditches the AMG Line pack in favour of the less aggressive Urban Line also fitted on the A 180. On top of that, the car is also fitted with the Night Package (consisting of gloss black front and rear bumper strips, wing mirrors and beltline trim), matte black side stripes and a new 18-inch alloy wheel design in black with a machined finish. There’s also Activity Edition badging on the front fenders. \nInside, there are new floor mats embedded with Activity Edition script; an “Urban Hunting Activity Edition” plaque, featuring the numbering of each unit in the 30-car series, has also been affixed to the centre cupholder lid. Also equipped is the Exclusive interior package that throws in real leather upholstery, black headlining and a dashboard wrapped in Artico faux leather. \nOtherwise, standard kit is identical to the AMG Line and includes automatic lights and wipers, power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors, power-adjustable front seats with memory and four-way lumbar support, manual air-conditioning, Parking Pilot, a reverse camera, a basic Audio 20 CD infotainment system and an eight-inch Media Display. A Light and Sight package with ambient lighting and illuminated door sills is included as well. \nSafety equipment is the same as the rest of the local A-Class range, with seven airbags, Active Brake Assist, Pre-Safe, automatic front passenger airbag deactivation and rear ISOFIX child seat anchors. \nPower comes from a 156 hp/250 Nm 1.6 litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine, mated to a 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission. Zero to 100 km/h is dispatched in 7.8 seconds, and the car will hit a top speed of 224 km/h. Combined fuel consumption is rated at 5.4 litres per 100 km. \nBrowse full specifications and equipment on all Mercedes-Benz A-Class models , and find the best deals on a new car on CarBase.my .
