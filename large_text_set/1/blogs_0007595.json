A decision could be reached “as soon as today [Wednesday],” NBC’s political correspondent Cynthia McFadden said. \nEdward Snowden’s 2013 leaks also played a role in Manning’s harsh sentence, according to officials, with the impact of his leaks emerging as Manning’s case was drawing to a close. Mr. President, if you grant only one act of clemency as you exit the White House, please: free Chelsea Manning. You alone can save her life. \n— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) January 11, 2017 \nFour former and current Army intelligence officers Intelligence officials told the outlet that in retrospect the sentence is “excessive.” \nShould Obama choose to commute Manning’s sentence, her conviction would stand but she would likely serve a shorter term in prison than the 35 years to which she was originally sentenced, or be released. If Obama commutes Manning sentence: conviction stands but punishment reduced; not a pardon \n— Cynthia McFadden (@CynthiaMcFadden) January 11, 2017 \nManning leaked more than 700,000 documents to WikiLeaks in 2010, which detailed US war crimes and exposed classified information about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. She has already served seven years in military prison. \nShe was sentenced by court martial in 2013 after being found guilty of 20 charges, included six under the Espionage Act of 1917. At that stage, she had endured three years in custody, with one year spent in solitary confinement. The UN accused the US government of “cruel, inhuman and degrading” treatment of Manning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T16:29:23.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
