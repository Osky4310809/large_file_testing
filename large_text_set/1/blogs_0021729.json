He is, perhaps most famously, the founder of Island Records and a pivotal figure in the explosion of reggae. We have him to thank for Bob Marley not to mention Grace Jones, Cat Stevens, U2, The B-52’s…. Blackwell has his own liquor line, too: Blackwell Black Gold Rum . And then there are his resorts — yes, plural — in Jamaica, under the umbrella company Island Outpost . And while you really can’t go wrong with any stretch of sand + sun + sea + luxury spa and villa, there’s something intoxicating about Blackwell’s particular slices of paradise: Strawberry Hill , GoldenEye , The Fleming Villa and The Caves . Just take a look at the slideshow above. \nPerhaps the most famous is GoldenEye . It’s pure utopia — and one with a history like no other. As the name suggests, author Ian Fleming was behind the property. Built in 1946 as his hideaway, it’s where he wrote all the James Bond novels (reportedly from a corner desk in the master bedroom). Countless starry friends spent nights under its roofs, such as Truman Capote, Cecil Beaton and Errol Flynn. Noël Coward was an early renter before he opened his own vacation home nearby, Firefly (now also owned by Blackwell). Sting wrote The Police hit “Every Breath You Take” there. And the celebrity draw continues today with Naomi Campbell, Beyoncé, Harrison Ford and others. \nFor Blackwell, who bought the estate in 1977, the connection is personal: His mother Blanche was Fleming’s longtime mistress and, as the rumor goes, the inspiration behind Goldfinger ’s Pussy Galore.
