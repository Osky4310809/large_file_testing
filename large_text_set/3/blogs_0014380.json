It was then that he shared his motto for a long life: survival of the fittest. And he takes that seriously, spending every Tuesday and Friday working out with his trainer. \nIt was only fitting that the gym would be where Chavez kicked off his birthday celebration. He completed a workout and then had cake with friends. \nOn Saturday, a vehicle procession fit for a president led Chavez and his family to the USS Midway. The old ship, now a museum, was the docked location for a sunset bash in Ray's honor. Hundreds gathered for a concert, and speeches celebrated Chavez's life as part of the greatest generation. \nRelated: Oldest Known Pearl Harbor Survivor, 104, Returns to Honor the Fallen \n\"It's been surprising because I didn't expect so many people,\" Chavez said. \nMany letters with birthday wishes were sent ahead of the event. One of those letters, sent from former President George H.W. Bush, was read aloud to the crowd: \"This former World War II veteran and former Commander in Chief salutes you.\" A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) \nFinally on Sunday, just his closest crew gathered at a church reception hall. Friends and family shared lunch and time with Chavez as he listened to a mariachi band perform, the weekend's events still not exhausting his tireless spirit. Several members of the local chapter of Pearl Harbor survivors came to salute their friend. \nThe group meets once a month and Chavez rarely misses a meeting. \n\"It's very important because we're going one by one and we want to capture as much of the enjoyment of being together as possible,\" said chapter president and veteran Stuart Hedley. \nBut all the weekend's birthday fanfare couldn't shake Chavez's enduring humility. \n\"I'm not a hero,\" he said. \"I did what I did because I volunteered and I enjoyed doing it.\" \nChavez feels he's just an old sailor with a completed bucket list and 105 reasons to be grateful. He took the microphone to thank the crowd at Saturday's event. \n\"I will never forget it for the rest of my life, I don't know how long that will be,\" said Chavez. \nAnd as he blew out the candles on his cake, a wish was made for birthdays to come.
