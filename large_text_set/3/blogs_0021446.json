The incident happened few hours after members of the state chapter of Petrol Dealers Association of Nigeria (PEDAN) suspended their two-day strike, following the intervention of traditional rulers. The uncompleted filling stations were demolished for allegedly being located in residential areas. Our reporter, who moved round at 6.30 pm, noticed that one of the filling stations in Irona was very close to AUD Primary School; the other one was situated at Ijigbo near Fayose Market. The last one was located in Okeyinmi. The situation at the sites was rowdy as large crowds, including suspected thugs and commercial motorcyclists, gathered causing traffic snarl. The owner of one of the demolished filling stations, Chief Remi Oguntuase a.k.a. REMOG, confirmed that agents of government carried out the demolition. Oguntuase, who spoke with our reporter on phone, said he was in the office of the police commissioner in connection with the incident. Government bulldozers also leveled a land acquired to build a filling station at Okeyinmi area. The pit dug for the tank of the station had been covered with sand by workmen deployed to carry out the exercise. The exercise started on Monday and was completed yesterday. The governor, who later visited the scene, to assess the level of work said the land has been confiscated from the owner “in overall public interest”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:43:02.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
