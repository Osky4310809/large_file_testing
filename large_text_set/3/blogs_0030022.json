From a former US military base abandoned after the devastating eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, Clark Freeport Zone rose from the ashes. \nTouted by the Ramos administration as a manufacturing and logistics hub for local and foreign companies, it became the base of operations for various multinational corporations engaged in electronics, hotel and restaurant, tourism, logistics, gaming, entertainment, among others. \nA newly founded government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC), Clark Development Corp. (CDC), managed its affairs, providing leases to multinational locators and putting up the necessary infrastructure and incentives that made the freeport zone an attractive investment destination. \nToday, it is one of the highest-earning special economic zones in the country, with a net income of P1.6 billion and remits about P700 million in dividends to the National Treasury. \nThroughout its history, men and women from outside of the company have led the CDC — from the first president Antonio Henson to the most recent, Arthur Tugade, who is now Transportation Secretary. There has been no employee that has risen from CDC’s ranks to become the company’s leader. Business ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nThat is until late last year, when President Duterte appointed former CDC officer-in-charge and vice president for Administration and Finance Noel F. Manankil as CDC president. Rising from the ranks \nDuring his time as vice president for Administration and Finance under Tugade, Manankil preferred to work on the sidelines with his calculator, crunching numbers and figures to ensure that CDC’s finances are efficiently and accurately dealt with. Well-liked among CDC employees for his mild-mannered demeanor, he is a fixture in the company’s corporate social responsibility endeavors, handing out books, medicines, and relief goods to beneficiaries. \nBefore working for the company, Manankil — a true blue Kapampangan from Angeles — was an accounting professor at the city’s Holy Angel University, having been a graduate of BS Commerce, Major in Accounting at the De La Salle University in Manila. \nHe started at CDC on Jan. 10, 1996 as a financial analyst for the Corporate Planning Department. From there, he held different positions in the company: first as internal auditor, then as assistant manager, and then as officer-in-charge of Administration and Finance. Former CDC president Emmanuel Angeles then promoted him to vice president for Administration and Finance in 2001, a position that made him a member of the Management Committee which he held until his appointment as CDC president. His rise from the ranks is indicative of favorable views that former CDC presidents have of him. \nManankil’s climb up the corporate ladder served as his training ground for the larger role that he now assumes. “I was exposed to a higher level of disclosure and discussion in ManComm (Management Committee) compared to the other committees. It dealt not only in admin and finance but also with a wide range of topics concerning Clark’s management and finances,” Manankil told The STAR . Humble, simple, straightforward \nA simple and no-frills person, Manankil sticks to a strict work ethic. Like his predecessor, he refuses bribes and never gives in to machinations or influence-peddling from locators with vested interests. He likes quick meetings and never beats around the bush when making deals. During presentations, he makes it a point that proposals are scrutinized as to their long-term financial impact on the freeport zone. \nHis empirical approach to management is perhaps what led Clark Investors and Locators Association (CILA) chairperson Jeannie Ng to say, “He is unique because unlike previous presidents who came from the outside, he has been with CDC for 21 years and he rose from the ranks. He has the potential to become the best president of CDC.” \nLikewise, CILA president Joselito Go expressed that he is looking forward to establishing “a close working relationship with CDC” under Manankil “to achieve more milestones inside the freeport.” \nBut ever the humble gentleman, Manankil said that these compliments are more directed toward CDC as a whole than himself. \n“I think, for the first time, there’s somebody from the ranks that held the highest position in CDC. The usual fear people have is fear of the unknown, so having somebody from the inside being appointed as CDC president, it kind of dispels people’s fears and apprehensions,” Manankil said. Preserving the gains of the past \nManankil assures Clark investors that he will continue the wonderful legacies that previous CDC presidents left behind, particularly their culture of anti-corruption, anti-red tape and transparency. \n“We have to preserve the gains of the past. To do that, one is, of course, to continue improving our processes that benefit our locators. We are complying with the directive of President Duterte regarding processing of permits within three days. And this will become even faster once we complete our automation which will allow locators to process and pay for permits online, thus, eliminating the need for personal filing,” Manankil said. \nManankil also welcomes the current administration’s thrust toward rural development which benefits Clark in the long run. He said the freeport is among several areas that will benefit from the Duterte administration’s “build, build, build” initiative, which focuses on building new and improving existing infrastructure networks. \nResponding to this initiative, Manankil said that Clark has plenty of things to do on its part. \n“Given these developments planned for Clark, what is best way for us to move forward? We are taking advantage of these developments by employing the services of a master planner. We would like to be guided by a master plan in determining the best use for Clark’s land bank, especially since there are several land leases in the zone that are about to expire in two years once CDC turns 25. There will be big projects that will surround or lead to Clark and we have to take advantage of these opportunities,” Manankil explained. \nAmong the forthcoming infrastructure developments that will benefit Clark include the Subic-Clark Cargo Railway, Manila-Clark Railway, expansion of the Clark International Airport and completion of Clark Green City. \nCDC has alloted P1.2 billion from its internally generated funds to improve Clark’s infrastructure. It will be spent on road-widening projects, construction of bicycle lanes and building new venues for various tourism events that attract visitors to Clark. The aim is to turn Clark into a work-live-play environment in preparation for the 2017 ASEAN Summit, where Clark is one of the host venues. All these are also aimed at helping pump-prime the communities around Clark. \nManankil also touts the previous administration’s gains. Under the leadership of Tugade, the number of Clark locators grew to more than 800, employing around 93,000 workers. Locators such as Texas Instruments, Phoenix Semiconductor Philippines Corp. and Nanox Philippines — all involved in electronics manufacturing and exportation — have all expanded their operations in the freeport. \nNew hotel leases have been approved, with Hilton Resorts & Hotels and Marriott Hotels set to open their respective developments in the next two to three years. To improve the connectivity of the Freeport to the cities of Mabalacat and Angeles and other places in Pampanga, the Mabalacat-Clark East Perimeter Road was constructed. \nReflecting on the legacies left behind by his predecessors, Manankil said, “The way I see it, the presidents of the past were the building blocks for CDC. To fill the shoes of any president is challenging. We make our own mark and build on the legacy of the past administrations. We build on their strengths. I would like to think that we carry in ourselves as a team all the good points and culture that the previous administrations left behind, and that makes us more ready as an organization to face the new challenges.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T10:35:43.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
