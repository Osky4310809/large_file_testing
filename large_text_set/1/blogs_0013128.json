Aspire claims to have signed Drake in 2008 and also claims to have signed a deal with Cash Money the following year to split profits for any commercial exploitation of the Canadian rapper. Additionally, Aspire is being sued by James \"Jas\" Prince who claims to have discovered Drake. Prince is also suing Aspire Music Group's Co-owner Derrick Lawrence and his company \"On The Road\" for Drake profits. \nThe lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal issues for Cash Money, which is involved in several lawsuits regarding the fractured relationship with Lil Wayne, who has also alleged that the label won't provide accounting figures. Wayne has threatened repeatedly to leave the label and take Drake and fellow Young Money signee Nicki Minaj with him, though \"Birdman\" has held firm that that won't happen.
