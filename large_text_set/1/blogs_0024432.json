[Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn] \nA scientist from one of China's leading researching institutes is calling for more cooperation between researchers and businesses to tackle pollution more effectively and efficiently. \nLin Xiao, a researcher with the Institute of Process Engineering of China Academy of Sciences, is taking a slightly unconventional approach offering to help businesses address pollution. \nHis team of about 15 researchers mostly born in the 1980s have just won a reward from the environmental ministry for their innovative and pioneering work in reducing pollution in the production process of tungsten and molybdenum. \n\"Most of the previous pollution control efforts focus on the end of production, when the volume and degree of pollution are already multiplied several times,\" Lin Xiao said. \"By intervening in the process of production, we can reduce pollution more effectively and with less cost.\" \nWith a doctorate degree specializing in pollution control and years of research experience, both at home and abroad, Lin knows a lot more than the average person about the real facts of China's pollution. Despite his knowledge, he has never thought about migrating to a foreign country for better air or water. \n\"Europe and the US are just what China will be like in 30 years time,\" Lin said. \"China for sure has more problems, which, however, also mean more opportunities. I wish I can do my own bit in making the mountains greener and water clearer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T09:39:57.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
