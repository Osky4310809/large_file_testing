By karthika raveendran |  14 pm GV Prakash-Saindhavi reception! \nVjay’s massy entertainer – Bairavaa released this Pongal as an ultimate treat to all fans! Ever since it hit theatres, it has been creating waves at the BO. As of Day 4, the movie has collected Rs 61.64 crore at the Tamil Nadu box office. Each of the day collections have been consistent at Rs 16 crore, except for Day 2, it saw a dip in collections as it minted only Rs 12.3 crore. Worldwide as of day 3, the movie has raked in Rs 86.8 crore Are we looking at another 100 crore win for Vijay? Tweets have been pouring in about expecting Bairavaa to touch the Rs. 100 crore anytime now. We can’t wait. Now we are left to see if Biaravaa will challenge Theri’s collections? Bairavaa as a movie received mediocre reviews as the movie had nothing new to offer. It w as a typical Tamil mass entertainer with Vijay stepping in as the ultimate hero to save the day. The only new thing about the film was the fresh pairing of Vijay and Keerthy Suresh. The film marked Vjay’s 60th project. \nFew days ago, Vijay’s Bairavaa had fallen prey to piracy as the movie got leaked online just after it premiered in foreign countries. Despite efforts on behalf of the Bairavaa team, the movie link was avaible on torrent sites. But seems like, this unofficial leak hasn’t affect the BO collections. The film was released across 55 countries. Considering it was a solo Tamil release, the movie has evidently cashed in on the profits. #Bairavaa TN Collection Details 4 Days \n* D1 16.6 Cr", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T08:53:47.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
