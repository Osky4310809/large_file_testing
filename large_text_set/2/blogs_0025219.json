He had previously been a follower of John the Baptist , but when John proclaimed Jesus \"the lamb of God,\" Andrew went with Jesus and spent a day with him. \nAndrew quickly found his brother Simon (later called Peter ) and told him \"We have found the Messiah.\" (John 1:41, NIV ) He brought Simon to meet Jesus. Matthew notes that Simon and Andrew dropped their fishing nets and followed Jesus as he was passing by. \nThe Gospels record three episodes involving the Apostle Andrew. He and three other disciples asked Jesus about his prophecy that the Temple would be torn down ( Mark 13:3-4 ). Andrew brought a boy with two fish and five barley loaves to Jesus, who multiplied them to feed 5,000 people ( John 6:8-13 ). Philip and Andrew brought some Greeks to Jesus who wanted to meet him ( John 12:20-22 ). \nIt is not recorded in the Bible, but church tradition says Andrew was crucified as a martyr on a Crux Decussata , or X-shaped cross. Accomplishments of the Apostle Andrew \nAndrew brought people to Jesus. After Pentecost , Andrew became a missionary like the other apostles and preached the gospel. Andrew's Strengths \nHe hungered for the truth. He found it, first in John the Baptist, then in Jesus Christ. The Apostle Andrew is mentioned fourth in the list of disciples, indicating he stayed close to Jesus. Andrew's Weaknesses \nLike the other apostles, Andrew abandoned Jesus during his trial and crucifixion . Life Lessons from the Apostle Andrew \nJesus truly is the Savior of the world . When we find Jesus, we find the answers we have been looking for. The Apostle Andrew made Jesus the most important thing in his life, and we should too. Hometown \nBethsaida.
