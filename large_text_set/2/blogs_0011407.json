From Marvel to DC Comics, no property is safe from Bruce Wayne as the fiery vigilante goes toe-to-toe with his biggest enemies. The film’s irreverent humor makes it so that nothing is out of bounds when it comes to parodies, and Suicide Squad took a major blow thanks to Will Arnett’s Batman. \nDuring the latter portion of the film, Batman is seen gearing up to save Gotham from an impending catastrophe. It’s during this scene that the hero takes a shot at Suicide Squad when he says using criminals to fight other criminals is dumb. \nNetizens clearly noticed the shady nod and have storm social media with comments about the reference. While Suicide Squad was a commercial success, the film left fans and critics with much to be desired, and Warner Bros. has since publicly commented on the film’s controversial reception. \nSpeaking with The Huffington Post , the director of The LEGO Batman Movie took a moment to explain how his team got the DC Extended Universe shot approved. \n“I can’t remember if that was one we really had to run up the flagpole or not, or just the executives who were on the movie saw it and were OK with it, but that was just us kind of riffing in a voice booth,” Chris McKay explained. \n“It was me [writer] Jared Stern and Will Arnett. It was one of those things where we gave Will an idea, and he took it and made it his own. I love working with him. He’s amazing, but being able to get away with stuff I think is kind of one of the things we do well in all of the Lego movies. You feel like you’re sort of getting away with it.” \nSo, let us know what you think about The LEGO Batman Movie ! Give it a rating in our ranking widget below! \nIn the irreverent spirit of fun that made The LEGO Movie a worldwide phenomenon, the self-described leading man of that ensemble – LEGO Batman – stars in his own big-screen adventure. But there are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if he wants to save the city from The Joker’s hostile takeover, Batman may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others and maybe, just maybe, learn to lighten up. \nWill Arnett reprises his starring role from The LEGO Movie as the voice of LEGO Batman, aka Bruce Wayne. Zach Galifianakis (Hangover films) stars as The Joker; Michael Cera (TV’s Arrested Development) as the orphan Dick Grayson; Rosario Dawson (TV’s Daredevil) as Barbara Gordon; and Ralph Fiennes (Harry Potter films) as Alfred. --- \nHave you seen LEGO Batman yet?
