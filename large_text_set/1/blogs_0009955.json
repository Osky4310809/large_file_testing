The prices listed are nett, excluding insurance, road tax and registration. \nUnaffected is the 718 Boxster , which was just launched in August – the significantly revised two-seat roadster is priced at RM480,000 for the standard model and RM620,000 for the 718 Boxster S. Prices for the facelifted 911 are also unchanged, at RM870,000 for the Carrera, RM970,000 for the Carrera S and RM1,040,000 for the all-wheel drive Carrera 4S. \nMeanwhile, the Cayenne S is still priced at RM820,000 , while the Cayenne GTS retails at RM960,000 – prices of these models were increased by RM60,000 last year. Lastly, the base Macan retails at RM425,000 , RM10,000 pricier than before. The rest of the Macan range is unchanged, at RM610,000 for the S, RM590,000 for the S Diesel, RM710,000 for the GTS and RM840,000 for the Turbo. \nThe company is also introducing a new complementary Introduction to Porsche driving programme for all new four-door Porsches (we assume it includes the Panamera, Cayenne and Macan) registered in 2017. Held at the Sepang International Circuit (SIC), the programme enables drivers to be mentored by Porsche instructors to improve their driving skills, and also includes a driving experience in a two-door model on the track.
