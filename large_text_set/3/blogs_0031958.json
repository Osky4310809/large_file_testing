I’ve talked to Nic about it, and I think both Nic and HBO, we’re open to a third season,\" Bloys said. \"I think it’s fair to say I don’t think Nic has a take. He is working on some other projects. But we’re open to somebody else writing it, with Nic supervising it ... it’s a really valuable franchise for us. I think both seasons averaged about 11 million viewers an episode. So not dead, just I’m not sure we have the right take for a third season yet.\"\nSEE ALSO: Everyone is loving Reese Witherspoon on 'Big Little Lies' and it’s about damn time\nThere's no word on the extent of Milch's involvement, and HBO declined to comment on EW's report, but it's worth noting that True Detective was Pizzolatto's first foray into running a series, while Milch has decades of producing experience under his belt, including creating three shows for HBO: Deadwood , John from Cincinnati and Luck , although the latter two were both canceled after one season.\nStill, a rookie could find a worse partner to hit the mean streets with than the man best known for gritty crime dramas and prestige HBO fare — and their collaboration might hold us over until Milch can get his long-awaited Deadwood revival back on track.\nWATCH: Ed Sheeran is set to make a tour stop in Westeros", "external_links": ["http://ew.com/tv/2017/03/27/true-detective-season-3-david-milch/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/vfxUCrEN.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/vfxUCrEN.jpg", "http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-mcconaissance"], "published": "2017-03-28T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:24:43.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
