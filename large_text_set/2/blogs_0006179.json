Terrible!” \nThe luxury retailer, which has faced calls for months from the #grabyourwallet movement to drop Ivanka merchandise, said that Nordstrom switches out about 10 percent of its assortment each year to refresh it as a matter of course in running its business, culling lines that aren’t selling well enough. \n“We’ve said all along we make buying decisions based on performance ,” a Nordstrom spokeswoman told Fortune i n an emailed statement. “In this case, based on the brand’s performance, we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.” \nIt appears that many other retailers have followed Nordstrom’s lead. Among those who no longer feature Ivanka’s line on their website: Neiman Marcus , Belk, Jet, ShopStyle and Home Shopping Network, none of which have commented but all of whom faced calls to dump the line from the “Grab Your Wallet” campaign to boycott businesses the Trump family profits from.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T18:33:49.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
