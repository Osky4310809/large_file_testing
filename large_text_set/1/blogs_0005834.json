NANCY PELOSI: I really say to you, my friends in the press, with all due respect for the guardians of the First Amendment that you are, that you were accomplices in this. It was every single day you reported that there was an email that was embarrassing to the Clinton [campaign] without saying, âWe know this because of disruption by a foreign power into our electoral system.' You knew that. You knew it was the Russians. And so did it affect the Clinton campaign? Of course, it did. Would it have come out differently? I donât know, because there are many factors in an election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T03:17:19.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
