Andrew Cuomo just rolled out a plan for free college in the Empire State. \nSen. Bernie Sanders was in attendance during Cuomo’s speech, naturally. \nYou think liberals go to bed at night thinking of how they can best destroy the nation the following day? \nFrom The Hill : \nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced a plan Tuesday to offer free tuition at state and city colleges for qualifying students. \nAccording to The New York Times , any student who has been accepted to a public university in New York will be eligible for free tuition if their family earns $125,000 or less a year. \n… \nNearly one million New York families would qualify for the program. \nInitial estimates show the program would cost the state $163 million when fully put in place in 2019. Faculty & Staff, please report to your designated slave quarters https://t.co/DYeZymQnnQ \n— David Burge (@iowahawkblog) January 3, 2017 We're going to provide New Yorkers with free tuition to two- and four-year colleges. This is going to reverberate across the country. pic.twitter.com/FQBR3DQw1A \n— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) January 3, 2017 \nSo, you’re telling me that not only is this a great idea, but it’s cheap, too? \nLET’S DO IT!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:31:18.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
