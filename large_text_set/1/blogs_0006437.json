Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in May introduced a federal bill requiring major-party candidates to release their returns, but that legislation didn’t advance in the Republican-controlled Congress. \nThe state lawmakers say they want to enshrine into law what’s been a long-standing norm among presidential contenders: the public release of tax returns detailing sources of income, business interests and charitable giving. \nIt will be interesting to see if any of these states pass the TRUMP Act. \nBut will it matter if Trump still hasn’t released taxes by 2020? \nIt’s not like he won any of those five states in 2016 (aside from splitting Maine). \nClassic, lefties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:26:08.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
