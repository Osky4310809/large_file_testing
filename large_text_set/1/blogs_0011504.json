With friends and family watching, he proudly walked across the stage on the floor of Bender Arena and received his degree in liberal studies from American University.\n“I couldn’t get excited,” he said this past week, “until I’d been handed my degree and walked across the stage and back to my seat without tripping and falling. Then I got excited.”\nTreadwell is 42. He got his degree 191/2 years after leaving AU to play basketball overseas. Chris Knoche, who played at American for Gary Williams and coached the Eagles for seven seasons, recruited Treadwell out of Good Counsel High School in the Washington area and then again after he went to Allegany Community College for two years because his SAT scores weren’t good enough to get him into American.\nAs a senior in 1996-97, Treadwell averaged 15.4 points and 5.7 rebounds for the Eagles.\n“The kind of kid you’re proud to say you coached,” said Knoche, the color analyst on radio for Maryland basketball. “He came from nothing to be a very good basketball player and someone who wasn’t that far from his degree when I got fired” in March 1997.\n[ Freshman Huerter could be growing into option ‘1B’ for Terps ]\nTreadwell took the firing almost as hard as Knoche.\n“Chris Knoche wasn’t just a friend or a coach, he was also a father figure to me,” Treadwell said. “When he got fired, I felt as if I’d been fired, too. I know I could have stayed to finish my degree, but I just couldn’t. I needed to get away from there.”\nTreadwell was six classes short of his degree when he left AU. He came home several years later, married, had three daughters and went to work, most recently at Democracy Federal Credit Union in Alexandria. Then the basketball bug hit him again.\n“I guess I’m like anyone who played the game: It never got completely out of my system,” he said. “I wanted to coach — I want to coach.”\nTreadwell began coaching last year as a volunteer at Montgomery College. But you can’t be a full-time coach at a four-year college — or, in most cases, at the high school level — without a college degree. Wanting to coach, knowing he needed a degree, Treadwell turned to Knoche, whom he had stayed in touch with through the years.\nKnoche has never completely gotten over the way he was treated by his alma mater. But when Treadwell called and said he’d like to coach, Knoche had two reactions: “Are you crazy, you want to coach?” And then: “Let’s see what we can do.”\nKnoche still has one good friend working in AU’s athletic department: senior associate AD Athena Argyropoulos, who was working in the school’s communications department when Knoche was there and moved to athletics 16 years ago. In the fall of 2015, Knoche and Treadwell went to see Argyropoulos.\nArgyropoulos, who officiated women’s college basketball for 20 years, had the same first reaction as Knoche: “You sure you want to do this?” And then: “Okay, let’s see what we can do.”\nInitially, it looked like the answer was going to be “not much.”\n“We clearly didn’t have the kind of money that was needed to pay the cost of Thomas coming back to school in our athletic budget,” Argyropoulos said. “But then I remembered that we might be able to get help from the NCAA.”\nThe NCAA, actually helping an athlete? That’s a little bit like thinking President Obama might support the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\nAnd yet, Argyropoulos was aware of a program run by the NCAA called the Degree Completion Award Program. It was started in 1989 to help athletes exactly like Treadwell — men and women who left college without a degree and can’t afford the money it would cost to return and finish.\n“I told Thomas I didn’t know if he qualified and it might be a long shot because I knew there were some fairly strict parameters,” Argyropoulos said. “I said I’d check and let him know.”\nArgyropoulos had helped an AU wrestler get money for graduate studies several years ago, so she knew who to call in the NCAA’s bureaucratic morass. She contacted Ellen Summers, who, along with her boss, Betty Reagan, administers the program. She was told that a candidate had to be within 30 credits of a degree. Treadwell needed 18. He had to fill out a lengthy (11 pages) and detailed application.\nHe also had to write a letter explaining his reasons for applying and fill out a financial questionnaire, including a copy of his tax return. In addition, he had to apply for readmission to AU and set up a schedule with an academic adviser before he could be approved.\n“It was a lot of work,” he said. “But if it got me where I wanted to go, where I needed to go, I was willing to do it.”\nThe NCAA committee that reviews applications for the program approved Treadwell’s in November 2015, just in time to register for the spring semester at AU. It agreed to pay for his tuition, his fees and his books, a total of $27,928. In all, according to the NCAA, it has doled out about $20 million to about 2,800 athletes through the program.\n“In truth, that was the easy part for Thomas,” Argyropoulos said. “The hard part was figuring out a way to balance his job, his family and school.”\nTreadwell lives in Silver Spring. His office is in Old Town Alexandria, about a 45-minute drive away on a good day. AU is in Northwest D.C., a half-hour from the office. The courses he needed to complete weren’t offered online. One course he wanted to take wasn’t offered anymore, and two others weren’t offered in the summer.\n“So last winter I had to take four classes,” he said. “I didn’t sleep very much.”\nHis schedule most days went like this: get up and go to work in the morning; go to AU midday for classes; then back to work and back to AU for classes at night. Get home, try to spend some time with his daughters, study and sleep for a few hours.\n“I don’t know how he did it,” Knoche said. “If nothing else, he proved how much he really wanted to do this. No one can say he didn’t earn it.”\nTreadwell survived the winter with one potentially huge setback: during Snowzilla, the 20-plus-inch storm that hit the Washington region, his car broke down. Treadwell went to Craigslist and found a 2001 Lincoln Town Car on sale for $3,000. He snapped it up.\n“Believe me, it’s showing the effects of all the driving I had to do,” Treadwell said, laughing.\nThe Town Car survived the rest of the winter, and so did Treadwell. After he got through the four-course spring semester, it was all downhill: one summer class, one more in the fall semester.\nOn Dec. 20, he went to pick up his cap and gown and texted a photo to Knoche of him, holding his youngest daughter, Jordan, in his arms while wearing the cap and gown.\n“Thank you,” he wrote, “for being so much more than a coach to me. Tomorrow’s the day.”\nKnoche choked up reading the text but responded like a coach: “About freaking time,” he wrote.\nThe next day, the time came. When the ceremony was over Treadwell, family and friends went out to celebrate.\n“We went to IHOP,” he said. “My 5-year-old had final say on where we were going to eat.”\nAs 5-year-olds always do. Even on the day when their daddy graduates from college.\nFor more by John Feinstein, visit washingtonpost.com/feinstein .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:35:06.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
