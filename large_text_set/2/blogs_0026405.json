Not only do we now have so many more characters (many with fantastical powers) thanks to Flash, Legends, and Supergirl - we also have multiple versions of those characters from throughout the multiverse . \nSupergirl 's setting on an alternate Earth (Earth 38 to be specific) already placed it within the DC TV Multiverse - yet we haven't run into dopplegangers of DC TV characters from Earth's 1 and 2. That's something of interesting flaw in continuity, so will it be something that Supergirl will address? \nAccording to executive producer Andrew Kriesberg (via TV Line ) : it won't be. According to Kriesberg, “the problem with that is if we do that once, we’re going to open the floodgates of insanity.\" \nThere's a lot of truth in that statement: alternate Earth dopplegangers already make the characters of Flash and Arrow harder to keep straight - not to mention Legends plucking characters from different time periods, as well. Behind the scenes, getting actors to play different versions of their characters on the same show is easy enough; scheduling things so that actors can play alternate versions of their characters on different shows is a whole other beast. \nAccording to Kriesberg, it would take “a really good story” for Supergirl to get alternate versions of Barry or Oliver on the show; or conversly, an alternate version of Kara on Earth 1. In short: it would have to be an event . Good thing we'll be getting said event! \nMORE Supergirl: Episode 14 Photos / Kevin Smith Shares Behind-The-Scenes Photo / Mr. & Mrs. Mxyzptlk Spoilers Recap \nDistributed worldwide by Warner Bros.
