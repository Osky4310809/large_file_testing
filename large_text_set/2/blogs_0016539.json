File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - The peso declined by another 23 centavos to close at its weakest level in more than a decade yesterday, spooked by prospects of higher interest rates in the US. \nThe local currency closed at 50.23 to $1, its lowest level for the day. It opened weaker at 50.08 from Friday’s close of 50 to $1. \nYesterday’s close was the weakest for the peso since closing at 50.32 to $1 on Sept. 26, 2006. \nVolume was heavy at $723 million, higher than Friday’s volume of $532 million. \nThe peso has been under pressure from the high demand for the greenback from importers as well as uncertainty from the expected interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve. \nUS Fed chair Janet Yellen signaled the likelihood of another interest rate increase amid an improvement in the jobs market as well as inflation surging toward the two percent goal set by the US central bank.   \nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco Jr. said the local currency continued to track the movement of other currencies in the region. \n“The peso movement tracked the softness in most regional currencies, and was also driven by risk-off sentiment amid geopolitical concerns, especially in Europe,” he said. \nThe dollar continued to strengthen against major currencies amid rising political uncertainty in Europe and the weak retail sales in the United Kingdom. \nBPI Asset Management said the peso continued to close weaker against the dollar despite the sustained growth in remittances from overseas Filipino workers. \nLatest data from the BSP showed cash remittances climbed five percent to a new record $26.9 billion last year from $25.61 billion in 2015 amid the strong demand for skilled Filipino workers abroad. \nTraders said the peso together with other currencies in the region remain weaker due to the strong hawkish statements from Yellen and other members of the US Fed.
