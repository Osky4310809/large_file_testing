If times had been different, Thierry Henry could have signed for Footy McFooty Face (Photo: Getty) \nFootball (sorry, we mean soccer) fans in San Diego have been tasked with naming the city's new potential MLS expansion team via a Facebook knockout poll. \nAnd, quite brilliantly, Footy McFooty Face is almost leading the charge. \nAt the time of writing, the suggestion is just SIX votes away from taking top spot - just behind San Diego Surf (sweet dude!) and in front of San Diego FC (boring) and San Diego Bad Hombres (ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT). (Photo: Facebook/SoccerCitySD) \nThere is actually 50 names in the running which have been whittled down from over 1,000 suggestions - but these are definitely the best. \nThe proposed team is part of the Â£800m \"Soccer City\" plan to create a new sports complex - which includes a 30,000 seat stadium, housing, offices, hotels, shops and green spaces - which former USA international Landon Donovan is part of. \"VOTE FOR FOOTY! VOTE FOR FOOTY!\" (Photo: Robert Laberge) \nSpeaking about the naming process, Donovan said: \"There's quite a few names. Mission is one, Athletic San Diego is one, San Diego Surf is a popular one. \n\"The fun part is that people actually get to be part of this from day one. [It's] not ownership up here making decisions, it's the people who get to decide this. What the Footy McFooty Face complex could look like (Photo: http://soccercitysd.com/) \n\"So we want to be inclusive and we want people to be a part of this.\" \nAnd part of this they very much are. If you want to make Footy McFooty Face a reality, you can head over to Soccer City's Facebook page to cast your vote. If this comes off, we think it'd be safe to say we'll all have a new favourite MLS team, eh? poll loading What should Soccer City name their team? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:23:57.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
