And then: “CORRECTION @ChrisCuomo said 12-YEAR-OLD girls are ‘THE PROBLEM’ for not wanting people with penises in girls locker rooms. YOU SICK MAN!!!” \nExcept maybe that isn’t quite what Cuomo meant. \nIn my mind, a possible translation is this: The CNN host of “New Day” thinks the 12-year-old girl’s father should teach her tolerance when using the restroom. In other words: If she sees a penis, she shouldn’t worry about it or pay attention to it. \nA follower remarked, “12 yr old girls objecting to seeing penis is intolerance? You’ve lost the damn plot!!” \nCuomo replied, “How do you envision this happening? A girl’s room with no stalls or some person just walking around bathroom naked?” \nCuomo fired back several times at Dice. In one remark, he seethed, “That’s a lie and you are wasting time. I was clearly saying this isn’t about the girls it is about parents judgments now prove the risk.” \nThis is when the discussion took a sharp turn into Crazyland. \nDave Herculeon (not anyone you should know) said: “So because of liberal logic, parents need to show their little girls an adult male penis at so LGBT adult feels comfortable?” \nCuomo: “Are you thinking?” \nHerculeon: “All the time Chris. People are allowed to think different on this. Don’t forget, this wasn’t an issue for MSM until Obama. Why?” \nAt this point, Brandon Darby , Breitbart News ‘s Texas Bureau Chief, weighed in. \n“In other news, @ChrisCuomo seems to be a pervert or otherwise lack basic decency,” he wrote on Twitter. \nAt 4 p.m., Cuomo was still explaining himself: “The context is clear to me,” he tweeted.”The parent is saying if his daughter is offended and I am saying that he is the issue not her.” \nMore Cuomo-isms from Thursday: “No one is saying you must embrace LGBTQ. you have every right to say you disapprove but equal protection is not only about what you like.” “Don’t use caps and insults. Use facts.” “EVERYONE READ THE TWEET BEFORE AND MINE AFTER. don’t reward bs twisting to avoid real debate. Insights not insults.” “My point was dead clear. This isn’t about a scared girl. It is about an overprotective parent who is afraid without basis. Don’t twist it.” \nMoral of the story: When you have to resort to all caps and use words like “dead clear” something has gone terribly wrong. \nThe Mirror ‘s take: Cuomo isn’t saying a 12-year-old girl should be to blame for seeing a penis in a women’s restroom and getting afraid. He’s suggesting that her father should teach her that it’s okay if she sees one in a public facility and not get afraid. He’s firmly on the side of the LGBTQ community. Except now his detractors think he’s a pervert. My prediction is that this online discussion will not cease anytime soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:30:03.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
