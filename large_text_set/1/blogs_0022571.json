According to ESPN.com's Darren Rovell , citing a league announcement Tuesday, Curry was the biggest individual merchandise-driver in the NBA from October through December, with James finishing second. Curry retains the top spot—leading in 43 of the 50 states—while the Warriors remain No. 1 in terms of team merchandise. Top 15 NBA Player Jersey Sales Rank Sources: NBA.com, ESPN.com's Darren Rovell Top 15 NBA Team Merchandise Sales Rank NR Sources: NBA.com, ESPN.com's Darren Rovell Moving to the Chicago Bulls has resulted in a spike in Dwyane Wade 's jersey sales. He wasn't even among the top 15 at the end of 2015 but climbed to No. 6 in 2016. With Tim Duncan retired, Kawhi Leonard is the unquestioned star for the San Antonio Spurs, and his jersey sales indicate as much. He had the second-biggest rise behind Wade, going from unranked to No. 8. Paul George , Chris Paul and Anthony Davis all fell out of the top 15 after sitting 12th, 13th and 14th, respectively. George and Davis both play in smaller markets, while demand for Paul's jersey may be waning in his sixth season with the Los Angeles Clippers, much as Wade's did during his last year with the Miami Heat. Giannis Antetokounmpo is one of the most interesting names to watch in this year's top 15. The Milwaukee Bucks guard is having a breakout 2016-17 season. He's averaging 23.7 points, 8.8 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game and has delivered a number of highlight-reel dunks.
