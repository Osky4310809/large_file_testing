Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPrince William has been hitting headlines following his trip to the Alps for a ski holiday - thanks mainly to his dance skills. \nSo, it was no surprise that Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid made it the subject of a prime breakfast debate on GMB, however, it seems their viewers were less than happy with much of what was said. \nAs Piers, 51, and his co-host chaired a debate, during which the prince was called work-shy, the public rushed to defend the heir to the throne, 34, telling the journalists to \"leave Wills alone\".

GMB back off Prince William. He's entitled to a NORMAL frw days off. He's got a lifetime ahead of him for 'duty' [sic].\" \n\"GMB piersmorgan hes got a lifetime of royal duties. Let him relax. Least when working he does a proper job does beatrice GMB [sic],\" added @R123HES. \nSome viewers were more concerned that Williams dancing was deemed more important than issues such as famine, with @rapmonsillest asking: \n\"Why is Prince Williams dad dancing getting more screen time than the famine effecting 16 million ??? amazing.\" \nOthers seemed to think there was a special vendetta against the Prince and his brother, Harry, with @Dakota16West opining: \"@GMB Give # PrinceWilliam a break FFS! If you're not slagging Prince Harry off, then your slagging off #PrinceWilliam BACKOFF! GMB [sic].\" \nThe backlash against Piers and his team came after it was revealed that William has been enjoying a holiday away in the luxurious Swiss ski resort of Verbiere, where he has been pictured laughing and joking on the slopes, while a video was also released of him dancing in a club.
