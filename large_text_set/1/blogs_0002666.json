She rushed him inside and saw a hole in his shoulder. \nfacebook \nDoctors say had the bullet been a few inches over, the shot could've pierced Cameron's vitals, resulting in a fatal wound. Thankfully, the bullet was removed from Cameron's arm and he's expected to make a full recovery from his injury.\n\nDustin Compton, Cameron's father, posted about the ordeal and is pleading with others to not fire their guns into the air in residential areas. I want everyone to know that this is what happens when dumb people decide to shoot their guns off on new year's. This is Cameron Eli Compton he is my and Jaime Stclair 2 yr old son. He was shot tonight around 10:30pm on 22nd and Griffiths. I was leaving a service call to fix the heat and when his mom was putting him in his car seat when a bullet hit him in his shoulder. Thank God it's not fatal. Pray for my son and pray even harder for the idiot that done this. I hope if someone knows anything they will do the right thing. Happy New Year everybody from me Jaime and Eli\nDustin says knows that finding the person who shot his son is next to impossible but understandably wants them found and punished as their negligence almost killed his son.
