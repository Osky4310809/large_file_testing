He admits throwing shade for the perceived diss, and claims that boiled over to Wednesday. \nCard described the tense moment when he says he saw team Meek coming for him, and felt he had to defend himself. His cousin,  De'Angelo Webb , also got in the mix.\nWe broke the story ... both men and Meek were charged with misdemeanor assault . They say it cost them their jobs at the airport. It could cost Meek even more because he's on probation, and that means jail time is a possibility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T10:06:09.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
