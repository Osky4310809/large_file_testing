clash with Sydney. \nThe Power have already confirmed big-bodied midfielder Sam Powell-Pepper will play against the Swans on Saturday evening, but he could be joined by as many as three other fresh faces. \nMature-aged recruit Brett Eddy and young defender Dan Houston have both been upgraded from the rookie list and are a chance to play, while Joe Atley has also firmed as a potential debutant. \nAtley was Port Adelaide’s third selection in last year’s national draft, taken by the club after first-round picks Todd Marshall and Powell-Pepper. \nSCROLL DOWN FOR ALL THE LATEST ROUND 1 TEAM NEWS AND WHISPERS \nBoth Atley and Powell-Pepper featured in all three of Port Adelaide’s JLT Community Series matches, impressing captain Travis Boak. \n“What we love most about those kids is that they want to learn and they want to compete — they’re the type of guys you want at your club and on your team,” Boak told foxfooty.com.au . \nLISTEN TO THE LATEST FOX FOOTY PODCAST BELOW, OR TAP HERE TO SUBSCRIBE IN ITUNES \nEddy, 27, was drafted from South Adelaide after easily topping the SANFL goalkicking tables last season, while Houston is into his second year at the club after being picked up as a rookie. \nBoth have been upgraded to the senior list following a long-term knee injury suffered by Dougal Howard midway through last season. \n“Brett’s a really smart forward who has learnt a lot,” Boak said. \n“He’s played in a few different competitions, so he’s super smart in the air and on the ground. He’ll continue to work and hopefully provide a big target for us down forward. \n“Dan is another one who has come off the rookie list and done it the harder way. \n“He just wants to get better and improve and they’re the guys who make it. They want to learn and get better and hopefully they get their chance in Round 1.” Port Adelaide’s Sam Powell-Pepper impressed in the JLT Community Series. Source: Getty Images \nTHE BLUES BOLTER AIMING FOR ROUND 1 \nALL four of Carlton’s off-season recruits are expected to make their maiden senior appearance for the club in its season-opening clash with Richmond on Thursday night. \nCaleb Marchbank, Jarrod Pickett, Billie Smedts and Rhys Palmer are all likely to be picked in the Round 1 side, having arrived at the Blues during last year’s trade period. \nHowever, it’s third-round draft pick Harrison Macreadie who is the bolter to make an early season debut following a promising pre-season campaign across half back. \nWith coach Brendon Bolton picking a near-full strength side for the club’s final JLT Community Series clash against Fremantle, Macreadie was the only draftee to feature. \nIt came off the back of a promising unofficial debut for the 196cm defender, who just a week earlier had 13 disposals and five marks in a solid outing against St Kilda. \nHowever, Carlton’s first selection in last year’s draft — classy West Australian midfielder Sam Petrevski-Seton — is unlikely to play following a quad injury sustained in February. \nHe is more likely to come into contention ahead of the side’s Round 2 clash with Melbourne, despite impressing in a secret intra-club match held over the weekend. \nNEW YEAR, NEW LOOK FOR THE CROWS \nADELAIDE could blood a new-look midfield for its crucial Round 1 encounter with premiership favourites Greater Western Sydney on Sunday. \nReigning best and fairest winner Rory Sloane is still recovering from a fractured eye socket suffered in February, while Brad Crouch and Scott Thompson will definitely be sidelined. \nCrouch is battling a persistent hamstring injury and is unlikely to feature throughout the start of the season, while Thompson has a shoulder problem. \nEmerging on-baller Cam Ellis-Yolmen has already been ruled out for the entirety of the 2017 campaign due to a long-term knee injury. \nAlthough the Crows still hope Sloane recovers in time for Sunday’s clash, coach Don Pyke could be forced to trial a somewhat unfamiliar midfield group at the Adelaide Oval. \nTalented defender Rory Laird spent a large portion of the club’s pre-season campaign rotating through the midfield, while Charlie Cameron and Wayne Milera are other likely options. \nCurtly Hampton and Troy Menzel are also expected to make their club debuts, following moves from the Giants and the Blues respectively more than 12 months ago. \nAdelaide is also sweating on late fitness tests for captain Taylor Walker and young defender Jake Lever, who are both battling hamstring injuries. \nROUND 1 TEAM NEWS AND WHISPERS \nCARLTON v RICHMOND (Thursday at the MCG — 7.20pm) \nCarlton will hand club debuts to off-season recruits Caleb Marchbank , Jarrod Pickett , Billie Smedts and Rhys Palmer . Young draftee Harrison Macreadie is a bolter to play, but the club’s first pick Sam Petrevski - Seton is unlikely to return from a quad injury in time. \nAll three of Richmond’s trade targets will play, with Dion Prestia , Toby Nankervis and Josh Caddy all set to feature following strong pre-season campaigns. Dan Butler was the only Tiger draftee not to debut last year, but he is a confirmed starter. \nCOLLINGWOOD v WESTERN BULLDOGS (Friday at the MCG — 7.50pm) \nCollingwood is battling somewhat of an injury crisis, with Levi Greenwood , Jamie Elliott and Daniel Wells all unfit to play. Those problems have been compounded by Jordan De Goey’s misdemeanours. Henry Schade has been upgraded from the rookie list and should feature, while Will Hoskin-Elliott is a likely starter. \nThe reigning premiers will welcome back Robert Murphy from nearly a year out of the game with a knee injury, while prized recruit Travis Cloke will play against his former side. Don’t rule out a debut for ruckman Tim English due to a hamstring problem for Jordan Roughead . Collingwood is expected to pick Will Hoskin-Elliott. Picture: Wayne Ludbey   \nST KILDA v MELBOURNE (Saturday at Etihad Stadium — 4.30pm) \nFormer Essendon defender Jake Carlisle will finally debut for St Kilda after his year-long suspension, but fellow recruit Nathan Freeman will have to wait. Veteran midfielder Leigh Montagna will definitely miss with a hamstring injury, but Koby Stevens and Jack Steele are likely inclusions. Nathan Brown is also a chance. \nMelbourne has a depleted backline, with Sam Frost , Colin Garland and Michael Hibberd all out. However, prized recruit Jordan Lewis will make his debut for the club. There are still question marks hovering over Jack Watts , while the Dees are considering whether to play a second ruckman in Jake Spencer. \nSYDNEY v PORT ADELAIDE (Saturday at the SCG — 4.35pm) \nIt’s been tipped that the Swans will make seven changes to the side that played in last year’s grand final, with youngsters Ollie Florent and Darcy Cameron expected to debut. However, Isaac Heeney , Jarrad McVeigh , Tom Papley and Gary Rohan are all out injured. \nPort Adelaide could hand debuts to four players, with rookies Brett Eddy and Dan Houston both in contention after being upgraded from the rookie list. Recent draftees Sam Powell-Pepper and Joe Atley are also a chance to play. \nESSENDON v HAWTHORN (Saturday at the MCG — 7.25pm) \nSix suspended Essendon players are likely to return to action on Saturday night, with new captain Dyson Heppell expected to be joined by Jobe Watson , Brent Stanton , Michael Hurley , Cale Hooker and Travis Colyer in the side. Top draft pick Andrew McGrath remains in contention, with coach John Worsfold saying he was “close” to playing. \nNew captain Jarryd Roughead returns to action, while new recruits Jaeger O’Meara , Tom Mitchell and Tyrone Vickery will also line up for Hawthorn. It will be the first time in a long time the Hawks will be without premiership heroes Luke Hodge , Sam Mitchell and Jordan Lewis . \nGOLD COAST v BRISBANE (Saturday at Metricon Stdium — 8.05pm) \nFinally, Gold Coast might be near full fitness. Gary Ablett and David Swallow return from long periods out of the game to bolster the midfield, while top 10 draft picks Ben Ainsworth and Jack Bowes are being considered for senior debuts. Pearce Hanley , Michael Barlow and Jarryd Lyons should play following moves to the Suns in the trade period. \nBrisbane’s top picks in the last two drafts, Josh Schache and Hugh McCluggage , will both miss through injury, as will classy on-baller Allen Christensen . The Lions could hand a start to former Giant and rookie selection Jake Barrett . \nNORTH MELBOURNE v WEST COAST (Sunday at Etihad Stadium — 1.10pm) \nA new-look Kangaroos outfit will be without a host of experience and could blood several debutants on Sunday. Sam Durdin , Ed Vickers-Willis and Braydon Preuss could finally get a call-up, while Mitchell Hibberd and Jy Simpkin are also a chance. Nathan Hrovat and Marley Williams will play following off-season moves. \nFormer Kangaroos veteran Drew Petrie will play due to injuries sustained by ruckmen Nic Naitanui and Scott Lycett . Fellow recruit Nathan Vardy could also play to ease the ruck load, while Sam Mitchell is a certain starter following his move from Hawthorn. West Coast’s Drew Petrie will face North Melbourne. Source: Getty Images \nADELAIDE v GWS GIANTS (Sunday at the Adelaide Oval — 3.20pm) \nThe Crows have a number of key players under an injury cloud, with captain Taylor Walker leading the pack in the race to be fit. Rory Sloane , Scott Thompson , Paul Seedsman , Jake Lever , Riley Knight and Brad Crouch are also in doubt. The club could potentially give debuts to Curtly Hampton and Troy Menzel . \nLast year’s Pick 2 Tim Taranto will made his senior debut after he was told on Tuesday he’d face the Crows, with Stephen Coniglio out due to injury and Lachie Whitfield suspended. New recruit Brett Deledio won’t play due to a calf problem. \nFREMANTLE v GEELONG (Sunday at Subiaco — 7.40pm) \nNew recruits Joel Hamling , Bradley Hill , Shane Kersten and Cam McCarthy could all come into the season, while new skipper Nat Fyfe returns from a long-term injury. The club’s first pick in the draft, Griffin Logue , is also a chance. Harley Bennell’s wait for a first Dockers appearance will continue due to a calf injury. \nDraftees Brandan Parfitt and Tom Stewart could feature for the Cats, while baby-faced rookie Zach Guthrie is also a chance to make a shock debut. However, experienced midfielder Scott Selwood is expected to miss with a toe injury. \nLIVE stream every game of every round of the 2017 Toyota AFL Premiership Season on FOX SPORTS.
