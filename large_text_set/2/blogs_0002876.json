This time around, Riyad Mahrez is struggling to replicate that form due to Leicester’s general woes. The defending champions are a shadow of their former selves, battling relegation after last season’s fairy tale. N’Golo Kante’s departure is a big factor in that. How many other stars wish they’d left? \nJamie Vardy turned down an opportunity to move to Arsenal. \nMahrez was reportedly catching the eye of Barcelona. Those days seem like a distant memory. Having scored 17 goals last season, the Algerian wizard has only followed that up with three this season. He’s scored more goals in the Champions League (four), helping Leicester to the last 16. January enquiry \nTottenham made an enquiry about Mahrez in January but were turned down flat by Leicester. The Foxes told Spurs that he wasn’t for sale at any price. That’s understandable given their current jam. \nBut a summer move looks like it’s on the cards.
