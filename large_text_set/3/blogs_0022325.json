Someone who fills your heart with such light and energy, you sort of can’t believe you’ve managed this long without them. The kind of person who kisses you and everything else ceases to exist. The world is suddenly quiet and it’s just the two of you. No noise. No disappointment. No outside distractions. Just you. Just you and this fantastic person. \nDate someone you’re afraid to lose. The kind of person you thought would never come around, someone impossibly out of reach. Remember how you almost settled for a half kind of love. Remember how you thought expecting too much is a recipe for sadness. Date someone who proves that thinking wrong. \nDate someone you’re afraid to lose. Someone who pushes you to expand your horizons and try new things. This is a person who wants the best for you because they care about your future happiness. Being with them is a reminder to always stretch your wings. But with them flying alongside you. \nDate someone you’re afraid to lose. Someone who listens to your fears and tries to comfort you when everything is crashing down. Don’t expect them to fix everything. But do lean on them when you need a little extra sturdiness. They’re sticking around because they’re afraid to lose you too. Because being with you, even when things get tough, is infinitely better than not being with you. \nDate someone you’re afraid to lose. The kind of person who makes your life better just by being in it. The very thought of not having them around anymore is unbearable. It’s terrifying and real and sometimes gives you little heart palpitations. But that’s how you know it matters. That’s how you know this person is, and always will be, worth pursuing.
