King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 8 hours ago 6 \nAfter being forced to cut their recent recent Copenhagen gig short and cancel the second gig in the city, Metallica have announced that their third gig in the capital of Denmark - scheduled for tonight - will go on as planned. \nThe guys stated : \"We're ON! Copenhagen, we will see you tonight at the Royal Arena! Doors open at 5:30 PM and we're looking forward to hitting the stage and resuming the week long celebration of the new venue. See you there!\" \nAs for that scheduled gig, the show was rescheduled for September 2.Lars Ulrich told Ekstra Bladet about the whole thing (via Google Translate): \"[James] came over to me and said that he could not sing anymore. That he had a guilty conscience about not being able to give the audience the full Metallica experience.\"I asked if I should apologize to the audience in Danish or whether he would do it. We went up to the microphone, but when I started to apologize, James took over show. He got so much energy from the fans in attendance that he nonetheless decided to play on. It was really overwhelming. From there we took ended up playing 16 out of our planned 18 songs.\"Doctors have given him a ban from speaking and singing. He communicates through his wife. I've played almost 2,000 concerts with him in the 36 years we've existed. What happened Friday night was the first time we have seen such a thing. We have of course been sick before, but we've never been this far out and his voice has never been like this before.\"You can check out what ill James sounds like in the player below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:49:28.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
