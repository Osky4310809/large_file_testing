Like at all. And if you were looking at this situation from an objective point of view, you’d be able to see that. \nBy giving you just that small minuscule amount of his attention, he feeds into your creation of a million and one lies you make up to convince yourself that he really DOES love you. \nWhat lies, you ask? Well, here are 17 of them: 1. “He’s been slammed at work.” \nSO slammed that he had to completely ignore you for three months straight until he found the time to send that super time-consuming “miss u” a couple hours ago? 2. “He’s been out of town.” \nWhere has he been that he had literally no means of communicating with you? Please, enlighten me. 3. Literally any form of “he’s been busy.” \nIf he actually liked you, I guarantee he’d make the time for you. Even if it was just one quick text a day to remind you he’s thinking about you. \nIf you haven’t heard from this guy for days or weeks or months because he’s been “busy,” odds are you’re just irrelevant to him . 4. “He’s not hooking up with me, so he’s obviously not hooking up with anyone else.” \nNo. He’s not hooking up with you because he’s hooking up with someone else. 5. “He talks to me too much to be hooking up with other girls.” \nIt’s called multitasking. 5 Stages of Making a Booty Call [5TAGES] To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video 6. “He’d be so sad if I hooked up with someone else.” \nHe might be trying to prove to himself that he can still get you to boost his own ego, but will he be deeply hurt by it? No. 7. “He’s trying to move on from me but he just can’t.” \nThis is NOT why he’s texting you. You are NOT his kryptonite. You’re his Plan B, and he wants to keep you around for his own comfort. “You’re his Plan B, and he wants to keep you around for his own comfort.” \nIf he thinks you’re moving on, he’ll give you a little bit of attention to get you back on the hook and then go back to living his life sans you. 8. “He’s playing it cool .” \nI think we can all agree you two are beyond that phase. 9. “He wants to end up with me at the end of the day.” \nYou’re not dessert. He’s not “saving you” for later. If he wanted you as part of his future, you’d be part of his present. “If he wanted you as part of his future, you’d be part of his present.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:37:41.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
