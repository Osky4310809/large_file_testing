By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 12, 2017 4:04 PM Celebrations are going on in BJP office in Delhi where PM Modi will give a speech. (Source: Reuters) \nBJP and PM Narendra Modi have given many acronyms over the last couple of years but today, it was the turn of Indian Prime Minister to be on the receiving end. To celebrate party’s win in Uttar Pradesh special arrangements were made at BJP’s party office in New Delhi. One of the striking points of these arrangements was a ‘wall of victory’ that was setup so that people could write their wishes for the Prime Minister and BJP President Amit Shah . A message written on that wall gave a new acronym for Modi. The message said M stands for Mission, D for Development and I stands for India. The Prime Minister is organising a roadshow in Delhi which will be followed by a victory march and his speech in presence of all the top party leaders. \nWatch the details of the wall of victory: #WATCH BJP headquarters at Ashoka Road in Delhi decked up for welcoming PM @narendramodi & party workers for the roadshow #NaMoThanksIndia pic.twitter.com/kFzydsDapg \n— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) March 12, 2017 \nYesterday, BJP registered a massive win in Uttar Pradesh. It was saffron all the way in UP Assembly elections with BJP candidates earning the distinction of winning seats with both maximum and minimum margins. While there were five victory margins exceeding one lakh votes, there were as many as eight victory margins, wherein the winning candidate trounced the nearest rival by less than 1,000 votes. The highest victory margin in the state polls was registered by BJP candidate from Sahibabad, Sunil Kumar Sharma who defeated Amarpal of Congress by a whopping margin of 1,50,685 votes. \nREAD | Narendra Modi Delhi Road Show Live: BJP all set to bring ‘saffron Holi’ from UP to National Capital \nUP BJP Chief Keshav Prasad Maurya dedicated this victory to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that trust of the people in his governance has increased. “We have won this election under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
