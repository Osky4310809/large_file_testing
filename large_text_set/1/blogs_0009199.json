He’ll be more than happy to own you in front of a few hundred thousand people. \nIt all started with this tweet about the Raiders, which seems a bit unfair given that their season was ruined when Derek Carr and Matt McGloin got hurt and the team was stuck with Connor Cook at quarterback . \nRaiders playoffs are like Kentucky basketball freshmen. One and done. .\n— shannon sharpe (@ShannonSharpe) January 8, 2017 \n\nSharpe wasn’t the only one out there trolling Raider Nation , but one fan didn’t like that Sharpe went after his team. He wanted to get back at Sharpe, and he got personal.\nhttps://twitter.com/TyBEeasy/status/817900448711483392 \nIt was a bit of a low blow, but Sharpe – who has ripped people for making fun of his lisp in the past – followed up with a pretty sharp reply. \nI talk with a lisp because these stacks in my pockets weighing on my vocal cords. https://t.co/TE6cPdzoai \n— shannon sharpe (@ShannonSharpe) January 8, 2017 \n\nSharpe’s been on television for more than a decade, but making fun of his speech is still kind of harsh. He never exactly shined on The NFL Today , but he’s often used his Fox Sports 1 show to talk about serious issues in sports. So good on him for having a quick response to someone who took the troll bait.\nThe best part is that Sharpe has been in the public eye for nearly 30 years, so some folks were able to meme it using Sharpe’s own words and likeness. \n@ShannonSharpe When Shannon Sharpe kills you and you're still thinking of a comeback pic.twitter.com/m0h8ha9XKA \n— Me (@dontediggs33) January 8, 2017 \n\nSharpe is no stranger to Twitter fights , but usually it’s with a more high profile individual. This was just too easy for him.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T00:05:45.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
