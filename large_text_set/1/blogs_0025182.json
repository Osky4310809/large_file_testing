The Longhorns' verbal pledge more than just enjoyed the time he spent with his future coaches and teammates, he considers it a top experience of his young life. \n\"Overall, it was the best weekend ever,\" Thompson said of his trip. \"We all had a great time.\" \nA familiar face showed the Texas commit around Austin over the weekend. Thompson was hosted by former Nacogdoches teammate, freshman safety Brandon Jones . \nWhile a trip to Dave & Busters was the cornerback's \"favorite\" portion of the visit, feeling the support he already has at Texas was an experience he won't soon forget. \n\"Hanging with the coaches, players and other recruits was fun,\" Thompson recalled of his weekend with the Longhorns. \n\"It's a blessing to be a part of a program where you feel the love everywhere you go.\" \nA Scout 300 four-star prospect, Thompson committed to Texas prior to his senior year. His consistent, on-field showing throughout his senior season sparked additional recruiting interest from several top D-I college football programs. \nWhile Thompson listened to what a handful of schools had to offer, he remained true to his word. \nAfter the termination of former head coach Charlie Strong following a second-consecutive 5-7 season finish, and the hiring of his replacement, first-year head coach Tom Herman , Thompson re-solidified his commitment to the Longhorns, officially shutting down his recruiting process. \nThompson is set to make his pledge official when he inks his name as a member of the Texas Longhorns 2017 signing class on National Signing Day.
