The short clip opens with the pair getting ready in the wrestling ring. They shake hands, get into their poses and then…where is he going? The little boy hilariously opts to run around in circles instead of facing his opponent! I love how the little girl shrugs as she chases after him! \nThe funny clip is going viral because it’s absolutely adorable! \nClick on the play button to start the video. \nIf you have any trouble viewing the video above, watch the short news clip below. \nShare this cute toddler with your family and friends!
