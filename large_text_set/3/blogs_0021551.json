I am a constitutional, y’know, someone that loves the Constitution. I’m someone that's for limited government. So I can’t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I’m for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies. I can sit here and say that, as a Republican and I can say, you know what, I’m for limited government, so stay out of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well.” \nLahren was then mercilessly attacked by conservatives — called everything from an incoherent flip-flopper to a new “abortion Barbie.” \nAs an uncompromising pro-lifer myself, I find Lahren’s position deeply disturbing. Prenatal children, as the most vulnerable among us, deserve (at the very least) equal protection of the law. Libertarian, small-government positions on abortion fail in our most basic moral duty to defend the defenseless. \nBut what I cannot understand is the nearly unanimous condemnation of Lahren by those who share her political philosophy. Fact is, pro-choice views are in many ways consistent with small-government conservatism. \nBefore offering my critique, let me acknowledge that the pro-life movement would be nowhere without the support of small-government conservatives. Though the movement is shifting to less conservative leadership, it remains dependent on the support of those who are skeptical of government. All pro-lifers, including me, owe these conservatives a great deal. \nBut are Lahren’s positions inconsistent with their general political views? True, small-government conservatives can support basic government intervention in protecting the vulnerable from being killed. But making policy which defends prenatal children — attached to the bodies of their mothers — is more complex by orders of magnitude. Consider these questions: \n- Should there be an abortion exception under law to save the life of the mother? Catholic teaching and a number of pro-lifers claim that no direct abortion is ever necessary to save the mother’s life. How, if at all, should the law distinguish between direct abortion and indirect abortion? All pregnancies are potentially life-threatening; what level of danger is necessary in order for the law to recognize such an exception? \n- Should there be an exception under law when pregnancy is a result of sexual violence? Such violence is often difficult, if not impossible, to prove. Should government be in the business of demanding such proof or just accepting the word of the mother? \n- Women are often explicitly coerced into an abortion by a parent or sexual partner. Some argue our broader culture coerces women into having abortions merely to have social equality with men. Should these women nevertheless be charged with murder? If not murder, with what should they be charged? Nothing? Would this really consistent with a view that abortion is the intentional killing of a helpless human being? \n- How should the various possible negative and positives of making abortion illegal be balanced? It is a good thing to have vulnerable children protected by law, but many believe government cannot really stop abortions from happening — and would only drive abortion underground and more dangerous. \nSomeone with Lahren’s views about limited government could be against abortion in principle and nevertheless conclude that cumbersome and blunt instruments of a distant federal or even state government have no business being used to enforced a particular point of view onto women in these situations. Autonomy, freedom and choice should be our default position. \nIf you are conservative and this sounds a lot like the approach of the pro-gun folks, that’s because it is. \nMy Fordham colleague Michael Peppard wrote a wonderful piece for Religion and Politics explaining parallels in the arguments and lobbying efforts in support of gun rights and abortion rights. \nWhat this position ignores, of course, are the vulnerable populations who suffer violence and death when we make an idol out of individual autonomy and freedom. Pro-lifers who are not beholden to small-government ideology believe promotion of justice and nonviolence must overrule the autonomy and choice of the powerful. Even when the policies are complex and the data difficult to interpret, we err on the side of a big, energetic federal government protecting and supporting life. \nIn his must-read book “Defenders of the Unborn,” historian Daniel K. Williams shows that the original pro-life movement in the U.S. was led by anti-war leftists, not small government conservatives. It wasn’t until the “moral majority” strategy of Jerry Falwell that an anti-abortion position was paired with support for limited government. \nAs a pro-lifer who is not suspicious of using the federal government to promote justice, I deeply detest the small-government, libertarian positions that pro-choicers like Lahren hold. But it must be said that her position is, at the very least, a coherent one. \nCamosy is associate professor of theological and social ethics at Fordham University and author of “Beyond the Abortion Wars.” He is on the board of Democrats for Life.
