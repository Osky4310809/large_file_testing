This makes Mabuhay the second-generation captive-bred Philippine Eagle, the national bird. \nPag-asa, the Filipino term for hope, was the first offspring of Philippine Eagles Diola and Junior. Then 29-year-old Diola laid the egg of Pag-asa with Junior, who was found in Agusan, as the sperm donor.   \nPEF runs the Philippine Eagle Center in Malagos, Calinan district, this city, where both Pag-asa and Mabuhay are kept in custody. \nBut while Pag-asa is in a large dome and could be seen by visitors, Mabuhay has been in isolation to prepare the bird to become part of the gene pool of the PEF’s captive breeding program. \nIt took Pag-asa 21 years to sire an offspring because of his sporadic semen production. This means the conservation breeding team had to wait for the perfect timing before delivering Pag-asa’s semen to Kalinawan for artificial insemination. \nKalinawan was rescued in Zamboanga del Norte and turned over to the eagle center in 2009. \nAnd in celebration of Mabuhay’s fourth hatchday, children from various pre-school and elementary schools here and the Balay Banaag Center, a children’s center, in Los Amigos were feted to a party at the eagle center. \nThe half-day event was spent with the children singing Tatlong Agila to the tune of Tatlong Bibe, a hit song in social media, experiencing animal encounter with the bird ambassadors and doing parlor games. \nPEF executive director Dennis Salvador welcomed the guests and gave a simple message to the children on the importance of the celebration. \n“This event underscores the need to educate the younger generation on the plight of the Philippine Eagle,” Salvador said. \n“We hope that the activities prepared… would encourage our youth to become active participants in the conservation of our national bird – the great Philippine Eagle,” Salvador said.
