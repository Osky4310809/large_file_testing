I admire the attitude, the spirit and the values of young English footballers. They have an incredible desire. \nLiverpool are closing in on crisis territory \n\"I have no worries about their motivation and I feel I actually have to slow them down rather than push them forward. \n\"Young British players have a spirit, which I don't see in the Netherlands or other countries where I used to work. \n\"There is a different culture here. The problem is that managers here wait a long time before they launch young players. \nWelbeck shows he can be Arsenal regular \n\"If a player has the talent, my motto is that you must give him the stage to show it. \n\"But maybe it is because I am Dutch and I am used to throwing the boys in at the deep end.\" \nEverton are seventh in the Premier League, seven points adrift of the European places after 22 rounds.
