(Photo: Sergio Estrada-USA TODAY Sports) \nDamian Lillard did what they told him to do last year. He got his shooting percentages up, further improved on his scoring and rebounding, kept the Trail Blazers in playoff contention (despite a season-long frontcourt disaster), dropped a proper album and even showed up in a few great videos. \nYet he's not an All-Star. Lillard is posting career-highs of 26.2 points a game, 44.4 percent shooting and 4.8 rebounds a game. He's adding in 5.8 assists a game. \nYes, one could argue that Chris Paul and Mike Conley are two Western Conference point guard All-Star snubs who have been even better this season. Heck, you could stretch and throw George Hill in there. But those three all missed out because of injuries. Lillard falls short because the coaches thought Klay Thompson and DeAndre Jordan were more deserving. In Thompson's case, that's for the third consecutive year. \nMoreover, this is a pattern with Lillard. The guy gets snubbed. Always. When there's a snub, Damian Lillard finds it. Let's rewind and review. Starts with a snub \nCoaches are often the ones snubbing Lillard, even though they often praise him when asked. That pattern started early. Here's the tale of Lillard in high school, when he briefly joined one of California's top basketball programs. Via the extensive Bleacher-Report feature on Lillard from last year : \nFor Lillard's sophomore year, he transferred to the powerhouse program of St. Joseph Notre Dame, most famous for producing Jason Kidd. Once again, his Oaktown roots would work against him. St. Joe's was a prep school with a men's basketball coach, Don Lippi, who wouldn't warm up to Damian's fire. \"I was one of the better players,\" Lillard remembers, noticeably still unsettled by the memory. \"But the coach had an issue with me like, 'You're too aggressive, and you talk trash.' I didn't talk trash like that, but if I block somebody's shot, 'Get that (s-) outta here.' If I do a move and score on you and I'm running back and you in the way I'm gonna bump you. I'm like, I'm not the problem. These (n-s) need to get tougher.\" Snubbed by the hype machine \nLillard went from Oakland High to mid-major program Weber State, off in Ogden, Utah. How does that happen? Let's review with one of the funniest Rivals.com pages ever , in retrospect. \nEven Russell Westbrook was a three-star recruit - with a photo. Fellow 2008 high school graduate Klay Thompson was a four-star recruit , by the way. FIBA World Snub \nSo Lillard stars at Weber State, makes the NBA, wins Rookie of the Year, makes the All-Star Game in his second season and then joins USA Basketball minicamp for the second year in a row. His goal: Make the team that was headed to Spain for the FIBA World Cup. \nMike Krzyzewski and Jerry Colangelo not only chose Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Thompson (recurring theme, y'all!) over Lillard - those guys are really good! - but also chose Derrick Rose mid-rehab and Mason Plumlee because having three backup centers somehow felt right? The first All-Star snub \n\"I just felt disrespected because I play the game the right way,\" Lillard said back in 2015. A year after making his first All-Star team, the Blazers guard was not voted in by the coaches - or, initially, by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who gave DeMarcus Cousins the first injury replacement spot. A photo posted by Damian Lillard (@damianlillard) on Jan 30, 2015 at 1:35pm PST \nLillard ended up making the team - joining Klay Thompson - as the second injury replacement, and he scored 11 points in 16 minutes in Madison Square Garden. His absence was likely because the coaches had chosen LaMarcus Aldridge as the Blazers' representative, but it still was a major surprise. But at least there was an excuse and a happy ending. The second All-Star snub \nNot last year, though. Aldridge was gone, the Blazers were the surprise team of the first half, Lillard was posting the best numbers of his career and … Thompson still beat him out for that last All-Star spot. Then nobody on the Western Conference team pulled out, and the 2016 All-Star Game in Toronto indeed featured more Kevin Hart jump shots than Damian Lillard jump shots. (Klay Thompson was there.) Red, white and not you \nLillard was unhappy with being left off the World Cup roster in 2014, so he skipped the 2015 minicamp. Still, he reasserted his desire to be part of the program if they would have him - that last part had been the problem. \nSo the Olympic year 2016 rolls around, and USA Basketball announces 30 finalists for its 12-man Rio Games roster. Not on the list: Damian Lillard. Thirty players, no Lillard. (On the list: Klay Thompson, duh.) \nNow they ended up inviting him later in the process, but he skipped Rio because of an injury. Still, it'd be stunning if the 26-year-old ever gives Team USA the time of day again.

Listen for yourself. And now this one … \nDamian \"Snub\" Lillard knows how to deal with this. He goes out and makes 'em look bad, as he did last season by making All-NBA second team despite not being an All-Star. \nMaybe he'll get in as an injury replacement. Maybe he won't. But he's used to it. You adopted the snubs. He was born into it.
