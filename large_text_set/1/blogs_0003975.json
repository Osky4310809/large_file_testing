And this fitness Instagrammer just explained why in the *best* way. Kaitlyn, aka @kaitlynr_fit, is a self-proclaimed bikini competitor and flexible dieter. With over 10k followers and upwards of 400 likes regularly on her posts, she’s clearly making an influence in the world of Instagram fitness and wellness. And we’re seriously loving her message of body positivity.\nIt’s not always easy to love your body , but it does help when you realize that the images you see on social media aren’t always real , and can be deceptive. We’re always here for debunking ideas of perfection, and spreading body love instead of body hate.\nKaitlyn explained that gaining weight isn’t a bad thing, explaining,\n“#gainingweightiscool has been a popular thread on social media, something that I believe should be spoken about more often then it is. On the left picture I was a week out from nationals, weighing my lowest weight at 112 lbs (I am 5’5). On the right is today 8 months into my off season up 30lbs from the left weighing 142 lbs.” A photo posted by Kaitlyn (@kaitlynr_fit) on Jan 3, 2017 at 6:33pm PST \nShe continued, saying,\n“The left picture I was tired, foggy brained and hungry. But, I was in competition prep, which is NOT maintainable for longer then your prepping phase. On the right I feel myself.. balanced (hormones balanced out as well) and strong. We’re living in a society that displays looking more like the left picture is maintainable. Spreading the message that we are more than the number on the scale is truly important. Know your worth, love yourself and encourage others to do the same.” We love that she pointed out the difference for her body when she’s close to a competition versus her “normal” body. It’s so important that we understand that even competitors aren’t always as lean as they are during competition prep, and that we take those images with a grain of salt.\nA photo posted by Kaitlyn (@kaitlynr_fit) on Dec 29, 2016 at 6:07pm PST \nAt the end of the day, we hope you remember that all bodies are good bodies . Weight gain isn’t evil, and your body is just fine the way it is.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T16:15:08.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
