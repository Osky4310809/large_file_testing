The fare aggregator pulls ground transportation schedules from operators like Amtrak and Greyhound, and as Thrillist reports, you can get pretty far on just a dollar. \nThe site’s Explorer section lets you input your location and the day you want to leave to show you where you can go for the cheapest price. Right now, $1 could get you to Boston or D.C. from New York City, and $5 could get you to Providence, Rhode Island. Well, assuming you’re fine with leaving on a four-hour bus trip at 7 a.m. or 7 p.m. (The site will also show you more luxe options, like express buses and trains.) \nIt’s a handy feature for getting ideas for your next weekend trip. Even if you aren’t looking for a ticket under $10, the site makes it easy to compare budget bus and train options that similar sites like Kayak or Expedia don't offer. So even if you discover that yes, you really do have to pay $40 to cram yourself into a bus for four hours, you will at least have saved some time doing it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:19:01.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
