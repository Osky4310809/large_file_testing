Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby said estimated revenue for schools in 2016-17 would be $34 million. If that number holds, approximately $8.5 million would be withheld from Baylor pending the review. Bowlsby said estimated Big 12 revenue per school for 2016-17 will be about $34M. Of that, about $10 already distributed. — Chuck Carlton (@ChuckCarltonDMN) February 8, 2017 \nBaylor removed football coach Art Briles, athletics director Ian McCaw and president Kenneth Starr last May as a result of the Pepper Hamilton law firm's investigation into how the school handled sexual assault allegations. \nThe school's new leadership has made sweeping changes in the reporting process and Title IX office, but recent law suits against the school have brought disturbing details of the school's athletic culture into public view. \nThe Big 12 has pushed for increased transparency from Baylor officials, who have only released a summary of the Pepper Hamilton report. \n“While the withholding of conference distributions is an unexpected financial event, we do not deem these actions to materially impact the overall financial position of the University,\" Baylor interim president David E. Garland said in a statement released by the school. \"We pledge our full cooperation, and we will work with the Big 12 Conference to conduct the audit as expeditiously as possible. \n“This third-party review at the request of the Big 12 Conference will provide an opportunity for us to demonstrate our progress to date and our ongoing commitment in establishing Baylor as a leading institution in athletics compliance and governance and for preventing and addressing sexual assaults on college campuses.” CLOSE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T20:00:24.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
