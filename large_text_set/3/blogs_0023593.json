The scientists at the University of Queensland and Monash University made the discovery when they were examining venom extracted from spiders found in Orchid beach, 402 km north of Brisbane.\nWhile the venom from these spiders can kill a human within 15 minutes, the protein they discovered, Hi1, is not only harmless, but could also be a game-changer in treating strokes.\nA dose of the protein two hours after the stroke cut down the brain damage in rats by 80 per cent, Professor King wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nEven when it was given eight hours after the attack, it reduced damage to the brain by about 65 per cent.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:44:39.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
