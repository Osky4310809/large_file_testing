The Rams need to take a look at him. \nLos Angeles had one of the worst offensive lines in the NFL last season and Albert is a trusted, reliable veteran. He had two years left on his contract and was supposed to make $8.8 million next year. Dolphins will be releasing LT Branden Albert today, source says. It's Tunsil time there. Adds an intriguing option to the tackle market. \n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) February 16, 2017 \nIn protecting Goff, he is not so much an experiment as it would be to draft and develop a rookie — especially when the Rams do not have a first round pick.Robinson, meanwhile, is the most penalized player in the NFL over the last couple years. Related: Rams coaches do not seem worried about offensive lineman Greg Robinson \nRick Wagner, Riley Reiff and Andrew Whitworth were considered the top tackles in the upcoming free agency class. Ryan Clady, Kelvin Beachum and Matt Kalil all also enter free agency as their teams declined to pick up their options for next season. \nKalil went to USC and has an approximate market value of $7.1M per season, via Spotrac . Reiff is a slightly cheaper option with an estimated $5.3M market value . Should be said, Branden Albert knew Laremy Tunsil would be his replacement and still took rook under his care and taught him how to be pro. \n— Armando Salguero (@ArmandoSalguero) February 16, 2017 \nThose six players join Albert as the top available offensive tackles available in the offseason. \nDespite his age, the former Dolphins offensive lineman is an intriguing option for the Rams to bolster their rush and pass protection in 2017.
