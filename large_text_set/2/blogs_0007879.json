You gotta come out of that s**t.\" Drake has lashed out at fans who slammed him (Photo: Splash News) \nSome of his fans immediately turned on the 30-year-old rapper, taking to social media to blast what they saw as an Islamaphobic instruction, despite there being no confirmation of the four women's religion or ethnicity. \nThere was even talk of a boycott of Drake's music and concerts, but he's now hit back at the anger on Twitter. \n\"I make a point every night to end my shows on a time of unity and love so, to find out that I am being utilized in a fake media story about me disrespecting Muslims is devastating to me,\" he said. \n\"At my show I'm the O2 in London I was talking to 4 women one of whom was wearing a jacket and a winter scarf, I made a comment about taking off the scarf because I enjoy a friendly banter with the fans. He revealed the context of his conversation with the four women (Photo: Rex Features) \n\"I am well aware of what a hijab is and I would never make a disrespectful comment like that in my life towards someone who is wearing one. I am proud that my closest friends and fans come from all different religions and races, perhaps whoever made up this story should spend more time learning about other cultures and less time trying to divide us.\" \nIt came after Drake made an impassioned speech against Donald Trump's travel ban, which appeared to be disproportionally affecting Muslim-majority countries. Drake had previously spoken out against Trump (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \n\"Every day I wake up and see all this bulls**t going in the world,\" he told the crowd at an earlier gig in London. \n\"People trying to tear us apart, people trying to make us turn against each other. So tonight, my proudest moment isn't selling tickets or having people sing my songs. My proudest moment â€” if you take a look around at this room, you'll see people from all races and all places.\" \nHe went on: \"And I just want you to understand that if you thought for one second that any one man is going to tear this world apart, you're out of your motherf**king mind, it's on us to keep this sh** together. \n\"F**k that man!\" he added.
