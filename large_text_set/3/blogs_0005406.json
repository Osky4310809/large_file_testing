Records , later becoming the publisher of Billboard . \nAfter a two-year stint there, he was then a music executive for Pandora . \nHe is survived by his partner Charlie , and their three children. \nOur thoughts are with Tommy Page's family, friends, and loved ones during this very difficult, trying time . \nR.I.P. \n[ Image via Nikki Nelson/ WENN . ] 20 Movies You Won't Believe Came Out 20 Years Ago!!
