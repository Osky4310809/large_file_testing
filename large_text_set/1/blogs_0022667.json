For Square Enix's Play Arts Kai series of action figures, that's really the whole point, though surprisingly this is probably one of their tamer redesigns. \nThat's not to say this version of the character is just a by the numbers design, though. Captain America was designed by Hitoshi Kondo, who's also worked on other Marvel Play Arts Kai figures and the insanely cool Batman Rogues Gallery variant series. The color scheme of red, white, and blue is still intact here, as is his trademark shield. The most interesting part is the more three-dimensional aspect to the armor. Everything here is segmented in layers, reminiscent of Iron Man armor. \nThis extends to his shield as well, which has an embedded silver star in the middle. \nWhile there is white in the outfit, there's more dark gray woven into the suit, and the boots have mre texture to them than his traditional solid red boots. \nYou can view the official description below, and Cap is up for pre-order now from the official Square Enix site for $149.99. You can view more images of the impressive figure on the next slide. \nHis iconic costume gets our distinctive variant touch and is rendered in the form of a protective armor to showcase and elevate his awe-inspiring presence. His signature round shield maintains its classic colors, and can be placed either in his hand or on his back with ease. The joints have a wide range of motion for dynamic posing, including him wielding his shield as a projectile weapon, giving you the option of recreating Captain Americaâ€™s characteristic moves. The paintwork is very realistic as well, evoking the gritty situations the Cap had gone through: chipping of the paint from fierce battles, burn marks from explosions, remnants of dirt and grime. These elements and a modern interpretation of the character takes this action figure to another level!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:19:19.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
