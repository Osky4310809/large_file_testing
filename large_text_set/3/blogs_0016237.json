Picture: 7:30 \n“Its filthy its cold its dark its just absolutely horrible,” Aerocare truck driver George Orsaris told ABC’s 730 program. \n“Its definitely not conditions that people in this day an age, especially in Australia, (expect) are going on here. Its unthinkable.” \nLeaked photos show makeshift beds underneath passenger terminals, where staff say they camp out between shifts because they can’t afford to go home. media_camera An Aerocare worker sleeps near baggage carousels between shifts.

Picture: 7:30 \nAerocare has denied the allegations of poor treatment and fatigue-related safety incidents. \nThe company, which reportedly posted a $13 million profit last year, said in a statement it has “invested millions of dollars to improve the quality of its rostering so as to maximise the duration of shifts, with the goal of securing more contracts which would enable Aerocare to offer employees longer shifts and further viable fulltime positions.” media_camera Aerocare has denied the claims.
