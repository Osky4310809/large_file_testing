Investigators say the suspects got away with multiple items from the home, including a Sony PlayStation. \nPolice say one of the witnesses went after the men with a kitchen knife, but took cover when one of the suspects fired at her. \nPolice say that’s when the victim went after the men with a baseball bat and started hitting the car the suspects got into. Then, police say two gunshots went off, the car sped off and the victim was down. \nThe victim was taken to the hospital, where he later died. He has since been identified as Kyle Stauber, 18. \nScholze was arrested without incident and will face a list of charges including, homicide, robbery, aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person. \nOutside of Allegheny County Police headquarters, Scholze claimed he didn’t kill Stauber, saying “I got set up.” \nKDKA’s Amy Wadas: “Did you shoot Kyle?” \nScholze: “No.” \nThe Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office says Stauber died from a gunshot wound to the chest. \nScholze: “I’m sorry that he’s not here anymore.” \nWadas: “Did you know Kyle? How’d you’d know him?” \nScholze: “Through some friends.” \nA second person, a woman only identified as Kayla Naper, is also in custody. Police say she’s the driver of the car the suspects got into before it sped off. \nPolice are also reviewing surveillance video from the area of the shooting. \n  Amy Wadas Pittsburgh native Amy Wadas joined KDKA as a reporter in July of 2014.
