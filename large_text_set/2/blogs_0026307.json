Yes, she has had a brush with Oscar gold before in 2015 when she was nominated for her role in “Birdman.” \nThat was only a brush, though. She didn’t win an Oscar then and has had to wait a full year for another shot at taking home an Academy Award. \nIf anyone thinks they have the right to ruin her big night, they are in for a rude awakening. Just ask Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel. While giving an interview on the red carpet, Emma Stone had to deal with the couple who decided tonight, EMMA’S NIGHT, was the night to try their hand at photobombing. . @jtimberlake and Jessica Biel with the video bomb of Emma Stone at the #Oscars pic.twitter.com/3SxnHcCyFW \n— Patrick Schmidt (@PatrickASchmidt) February 27, 2017 \nEmma doesn’t realize Justin is behind her through a large chunk of the interview, grinning like someone who thought photobombing would be cool but hadn’t exactly worked out what to do when the actual bombing took place. \nAt some point, Jessica Biel was pulled into this thing against her will. \nAfter Emma realized what was happening, she jokingly said, “Who are these people?” \nBURN, BABY! HOW YOU LIKE DEM APPLES, JUICE?!?! WHAT THE SWEET FERK ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL, JUSTIN?!?!

Stop. Freaking. GIFing. This. Catastrophe.
