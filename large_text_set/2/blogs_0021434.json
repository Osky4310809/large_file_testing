If that happens, further iceberg calving could cause a retreat of Larsen C. We won't be able to tell whether Larsen C is unstable until the iceberg has calved and we are able to understand the behaviour of the remaining ice.\"\nUnfortunately, if Larsen C is anything like its old neighbor, we might be in trouble.\n\"After the collapse of Larsen B, its tributary glaciers accelerated, contributing to sea-level rise,\" said the BAS.\nAccording to BBC , if all the ice Larsen C shelf currently holds entered the sea after this inevitable calving, global waters could rise by as much as 10 cm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:02:31.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
