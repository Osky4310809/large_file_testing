Everything from poultry to pasta to freaking cake if you’re feeling real nasty — just kidding, don’t — can now taste like a hot, fresh, New York City everything bagel , minus all of the deliciously empty carbs and schmear of scallion cream cheese.\nThe 2.3 oz bottle of seasoning , per TJ’s website, contains sesame seeds, sea salt flakes, dried minced garlic, dried minced onion, black sesame seeds, and poppy seeds. So it sure won’t make your teeth look cute or your breath smell nice, but who cares? Life is short, fam.\nThis is EVERYTHING! \nA post shared by Trader Joe's Fan Page (@traderjoesfans) on Feb 21, 2017 at 10:07am PST \nBest part is it retails for $1.99, which is decidedly cheaper than most New York City everything bagels.\n“This simple (yet exemplary) blend of sesame seeds (white and black), poppy seeds, dried garlic & onion, and sea salt flakes is all you need for bringing that crunchy, roasted, savory flavor to grilled chicken, buttered popcorn, baked potatoes, creamy dips, pizza dough, salad dressings, pasta, mac & cheese, or panko-breaded anything,” Trader Joe’s explains on their site, adding that you can also (obviously) add the stuff to the tops of plain bagels.\nFor those who were wondering what's in the everything bagel seasoning. \nA post shared by Trader Joe's Fan Page (@traderjoesfans) on Feb 21, 2017 at 7:46am PST \nIf comments on the traderjoesfans Instagram account can be trusted, this stuff is going to be flying off the TJ’s shelves faster than kale from its Atlantic Avenue location. (Trust me, it happens.) Get it while you can…and put it on literally everything.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:57:17.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
