Heading into development, Fox Television Group chairman CEO Dana Walden asked, \"Who’s undeserved (and) where are there pockets of opportunity so you’re not just programming the same derivative types of shows and looking in the rear-view mirror and saying, 'How do I get my Empire ? Where’s my This is Us ?,' referring to her studio's two biggest hits. ABC Entertainment chief Channing Dungey looked for more standalone crime series to supplement her soaps, and wants to \"harken back to lighter, brighter one-hour comedies\" like Ugly Betty and Desperate Housewives . \nA sampling of what's in the hopper: \n'Orville' is from Seth MacFarlane. (Photo: Joe Scarnici, Getty Images) \nSci-fi/fantasy \nFox has already ordered Orville , Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's homage to Star Trek , set in a 25th-century exploratory craft, with a crew of humans and aliens. And ABC has committed to The Inhumans , its next Marvel series, which will get a September launch in IMAX theaters before settling on the network this fall. Hopefuls include Fox's untitled Marvel series, about a suburban couple (Stephen Moyer, Amy Acker) whose teenage kids have superpowers; and a CW adaptation of DC's Black Lightning . \nFreddie Highmore goes from 'Bates Motel' to an ABC pilot about a young surgeon. (Photo: Tim P. Whitby, Getty Images) \nMedical shows \nPlenty of docs in scrubs are vying for spots on network lineups, where a few stalwarts have been crowded by crime series. House creator David Shore is behind another quirky M.D. in ABC's The Good Doctor, starring Freddie Highmore ( Bates Motel ) as a young surgeon with savant syndrome. NBC has a potential real-time drama about a Brooklyn trauma center in the throes of a catastrophic hurricane. Fox has two candidates: The Resident, starring Matt Czurchry ( The Good Wife ) as a young doctor mentored by a \"brilliant senior resident\" (Bruce Greenwood), and The Beast , which offers three weekly medical cases. \n'Big Bang Theory' prequel 'Young Sheldon' had better take us back to the day when Sheldon's mother had him tested to make sure he wasn't crazy. (Photo: CBS) \nRemakes and spinoffs \nProgrammers have cooled (somewhat) on plundering their libraries, but NBC will bring back hit comedy Will & Grace for a limited run; CBS has picked up Big Bang Theory spinoff Young Sheldon , featuring a 9-year-old version of its main character, and ABC is considering a spinoff of The Goldbergs centered on its infrequently seen gym teacher. Other contenders: CW's update on 1980s soap Dynasty , Fox's remake of film franchise Behind Enemy Lines; and NBC's What About Barb?, a twist on 1991 Bill Murray movie What About Bob? \nMilitary invasion \nRed-state veterans may get a kick out of several military-themed series in contention for next season. Jason Biggs plays a Ft. Bragg dentist in ABC comedy Charlie Foxtrot ; CBS may go for a Navy SEALs project; NBC will tap heroic stories in For God and Country ; and CW is weighing Valor , about helicopter pilots on an Army base, with flashbacks to a failed mission. (Two more series, CBS drama Mission Control and NBC comedy Spaced Out , involve NASA). \nEva Longoria will star in a Fox pilot about a team of consultants hired to fire employees. (Photo: Gareth Cattermole, Getty Images) \nBig swings \nAiming for relevance, Fox is piloting a drama about a young student who accuses football players of sexual assault (Archie Panjabi and Anthony Edwards star). The Gilmore Girls ' Lauren Graham is Linda From HR in a touted Fox comedy, while Eva Longoria leads a Type A team of consultants hired to fire employees in another potential series for the network. Deception , one of several procedural pilots at ABC, offers TV's first \"consulting illusionist\" to the FBI. Pretty Little Liars ' Lucy Hale stars as a woman whose terminal-cancer diagnosis proves false in CW's Life Sentence . And CBS's Me, Myself and I follows one man's life, This is Us -style, at age 14, 40 (played by Saturday Night Live 's Bobby Moynihan) and 65. \nFreddie Highmore and Lauren Graham both have new projects hoping to find a place on the fall schedule; 'Will & Grace' and 'Young Sheldon' have already been picked up.
