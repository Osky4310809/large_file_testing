As we’ve previously reported, the SUV will be launched here as a locally-assembled (CKD) model sometime this year , rolling out of the Volkswagen Malaysia Automotive Assembly Plant in Pekan, Pahang. \nThese photos were taken in the aforementioned state, specifically in the Rompin area, and shows a Tiguan with a Pahang trade plate that is only a digit shy from the C115A-registered car we saw previously , as well as a different-coloured body. As before, the VW badges have been taped off to help “mask” its identity. \nA frontal view of the Tiguan does give us some idea of what kit to expect when the model finally debuts, which appears to include LED headlamps (with DRLs) and front fog lamps. The SUV is available in three trim levels in other markets – Trendline, Comfortline and Highline – but we’ll have to wait and see just exactly what Malaysians will receive. \nIn any case, the new Tiguan is a radical departure from the outgoing model, being significantly larger – 60 mm longer, 30 mm wider and having a 77 mm longer wheelbase. The increased dimensions also help in the practicality department, with boot space up by 145 litres to 615 litres, or 1,655 litres with the rear seats folded. \nThis enhancements are a result of the Tiguan’s new skeleton, the VW Group’s modular MQB platform, which also sees a reduction in weight of up to 50 kg. For those who weren’t fans of the previous model’s styling, the new SUV certainly looks a lot more “handsome” than the Typ 5N (first-gen). \nThe Tiguan can be had with a range of turbocharged TSI and TDI engines, while transmission options include a six-speed manual, six-speed DSG and seven-speed DSG. If we had to guess, the Malaysian-spec Tiguan will likely be petrol-powered and come with an automatic gearbox. \nGALLERY: Volkswagen Tiguan GTE and R-Line at the 2015 IAA Frankfurt Motor Show Research Volkswagen Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T12:21:46.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
