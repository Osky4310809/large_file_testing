Russia has denied the allegations. Flynn also was paid tens of thousands of dollars by three Russian companies, including the state-sponsored media network RT, for speeches he made shortly before he became a formal adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign, according to documents obtained by a congressional oversight committee. \nAs the WSJ adds, Democratic lawmakers have requested a copy of the security-clearance form that Mr. Flynn was required to file before joining Mr. Trump in the White House, to see if he disclosed sources of foreign income.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:04:45.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
