But this opportunity will happen within a new scenario,’’ where China fully realizes the potential for its international role, he said. \nAccording to Guelar, last year was crucial for both China and the international system, because China has become a powerful state that actively participates in the most pressing global issues. \n\"A clear example is the environmental matter: a few years ago, China was globally perceived as trying to avoid facing the problem, while, currently, the country has become one of the leaders in this field,\" he said. \nThe ambassador thinks one of the main challenges for the Chinese government in 2017 is to ensure that the world fully understands the political and economic processes that are taking place in China. \n\"Therefore, policies focused on both communication and culture are crucial,\" he said.
