Despite the shortcomings in the system, all the ECs have worked towards ensuring fair elections so far,” Quraishi said. \nCommenting on the situation prevailing in the five poll-bound states, the former CEC said it was like any other election where “there will be attacks, counter-attacks and violation of the Model Code of Conduct”. \n“The EC is equipped to deal with the situation,” he added. \nThe Centre, earlier this month, dropped hints about its plans to bring in changes in poll-funding rules and hold simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and the state assemblies.
