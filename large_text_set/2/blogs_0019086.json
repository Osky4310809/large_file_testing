I mean I wonder, I haven't gotten my check yet. I don't know if you sign up for benefits, or what. The meetings are a mess, let me tell you that,\" Cox said.\nPresident Trump's Press Secretary Sean Spicer suggested in early February that protesters were being paid, saying recent protests against Trump have not been \"organic uprisings that we’ve seen through the last several decades. The tea party was a very organic movement. This has become a very paid, Astroturf-type movement.\"\nCox said that the town hall protests are different from the tea party town hall protests because they are not funded by Americans for Prosperity and the Koch brothers.\nMaking my signs. pic.twitter.com/IzUIyVWfVR \n— Ana Marie Cox (@anamariecox) January 31, 2017 \n\nI was at the rally, too.
