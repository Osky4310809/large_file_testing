The order threatened to cut funds to “sanctuary cities,” local governments that don’t cooperate fully with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n“In light of the provisions of the Executive Order, I direct you and your staff to honor all immigration detainer requests received from the Department of Homeland Security,” his brief memo read.\n. @MayorGimenez issued this Executive Order early this evening. pic.twitter.com/GPG2SVhufe \n— Mike Hernández (@HernandezMA5) January 26, 2017 \nAlthough Miami-Dade has never officially declared itself a “sanctuary,” it has previously refused to indefinitely detain prisoners who are undocumented and wanted by ICE.\nIn a tweet sent Thursday night, President Trump praised the Gimenez’ order. “Miami-Dade Mayor drops sanctuary policy. Right decision. Strong!” he tweeted.\nMiami-Dade Mayor drops sanctuary policy. Right decision. Strong! https://t.co/MtPvaDC4jM \n— Donald J.
