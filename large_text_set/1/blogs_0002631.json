Jeff Horn has climbed the WBO rankings after 16 victories \n\"There'll be no Pacquiao-Crawford fight in the first six months of the year definitely,\" Arum told The Manila Times . \n\"Only if the fight will be in the United States, but we're not planning the next fight in the United States, so we're also not planning on Crawford now. Jeff Horn is a good possibility. I will be flying soon to the Philippines once I finalised every detail. Bob Arum \n\"Now that the New Year is over, I'm going to finalise a location, because we're looking out for an opponent depending on the locations like in Australia, England, Middle East or maybe even in Mexico. \n\"That's what I want to do with the last period of Manny's career. I want him to be known as a worldwide fighter. \n\"Jeff Horn is a good possibility. I will be flying soon to the Philippines once I finalised every detail.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T16:08:20.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
