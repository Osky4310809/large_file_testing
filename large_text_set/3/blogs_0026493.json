Since Hatton didn’t replace his ball, he was penalized two strokes, made a double bogey-6 and was eliminated from the playoff. WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play: Articles, photos and videos \nUnder this year’s format for the Match Play a playoff with three or more players uses stroke-play rules, which meant he received a two-stroke penalty. A two-player playoff, however, uses match play rules, which would have been a loss of hole for the Englishman, but either option would have kept him from advancing. \nCharles Howell III won the playoff on the fifth extra hole, defeating Rafa Cabrera Bello and advancing to the round of 16.
