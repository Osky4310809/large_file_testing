A picture of an empty room from a weird angle reveals little about what could actually fit inside.\nA Redditor posted this picture of an apartment listing he found that provided an item to scale the size.\nA double bed, is the item provided. Fully made. Pillows included. Placed quite nicely, actually. The listers used that for scale.\nApartment hunting. This ad said \"double bed shown for scale\"...\nThe thing about it is, it's actually really helpful. Like yes, now it's much easier to grasp the width of the hallway and the space available in the kitchen. Thank you. No further questions.\nExcept, maybe, what are they hiding?\nComment from discussion Apartment hunting. This ad said \"double bed shown for scale\"... .\nAnd if they're not hiding anything, congratulations, a new standard of scale has been set.\nThe banana's moment in the sun has left it shriveled and dead.\nWATCH: This office accessory leaves the sitting or standing desk debate in the dust", "external_links": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/BananasForScale/", "https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/2DhAojOP.jpg", "https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/60nqho/apartment_hunting_this_ad_said_double_bed_shown/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/2DhAojOP.m3u8", "https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/60nqho/apartment_hunting_this_ad_said_double_bed_shown/df7xvgd/"], "published": "2017-03-22T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:48:43.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
