It was the first time a lot of them had done it, so it was a real good day out.” Well, at least they didn’t lose another game. Source: Getty Images \nNewcastle coach Nathan Brown believes a showing from the club’s old boys inspired his side to snap their 19-game losing streak with a 34-26 win over Gold Coast. \nKnights legends Andrew and Matthew Johns, Danny Buderus and Paul Harragon were just some of the names in the sheds pre-game as part of the club’s 30-year anniversary. \n“A lot of those guys helped build foundations, which led to premierships in ‘97 and 2001,” Brown said after Saturday’s win in their home-opener of the season. “I’d like this group of players to be the players that lay the basis of the club to have a good era. \n“Those old boys, every one of them in the sheds today, there’s not one that’s not tough and a good competitor. That’s really what we’re trying to get to.” Three times the Knights came back after falling behind against a brave Titans side that were forced to play the final 43 minutes with a rotation of 14 players due to injury. \nAmong them was star fullback Jarryd Hayne, who limped from the field midway through the second half after colliding with Knights halfback Trent Hodkinson. In the space of 11 minutes, the visitors also lost winger Anthony Don and Karl Lawton to shoulder dislocations from separate incidents. It was pure elation for Newcastle as the Knights ended a 336-day drought.

A lot of swelling there at the moment but wait until we get a scan and see what’s happened.” Despite their injuries, the Gold Coast appeared headed for a famous victory when Konrad Hurrell scored his second try to break a 22-22 deadlock with 10 minutes remaining. \nBut Knights centre Peter Mata’utia crashed over from a Hodkinson inside ball in the 75th minute to reclaim the lead, before Nathan Ross sealed the win on fulltime. Jarryd Hayne is out for next week’s clash against Parramatta.

It was quite evident that winning’s been something that hasn’t been around for a while for a lot of the young kids.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T06:55:02.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
