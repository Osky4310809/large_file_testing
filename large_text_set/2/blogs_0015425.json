She covered up in a fluffy pale coat, which she wore Kardashian-style thrown over her shoulders.

Kate split from Dan Edgar last year (Photo: FameFlynet) \nIt comes after TOWIE fans saw Kate brokenhearted at her split from co-star Dan Edgar in the summer – documented on the ITVBe series – but just last month she admitted she was moving on. \nIn a live chat with the TOWIE cast, Kate was asked about her love life – and revealed that she has been \"seeing someone\" since her break-up in July. \nAsked whether she'd been getting smoochy with anyone, she blushed and said: \"No, not just a kiss. I've been dating, out and about – you know, that sort of stuff. \n\"I have got with one guy since breaking up with Dan.\" Kate's ex Dan in an episode of TOWIE last year (Photo: ITV) Read More TOWIE's Megan McKenna and Pete Wicks redo their first date after putting year of drama behind them \nBut when she was questioned about how far she'd gone with the new man, she refused to answer, stating it was \"too personal\" and \"unfair\". \nIt's thought the two were introduced by mutual friends in Essex, but it may be some time before they're ready to go public given how Rio hasn't dated anyone since Rebecca passed away.
