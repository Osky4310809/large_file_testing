This is where we lived, and he won't know where we are. And now I can't believe I thought that. Maybe that's what's making me cry is I feel sad for the person who thought he won't be able to locate [us].\" \nOur hearts!! \nOf course, being a single mom to their 11-year-old daughter has been her main focus since, even putting relationships to the side. \n\"It's hard to romanticize romance when you're 36. When you've been a parent for 11 years and you've done it alone, you don't have romantic ideals, because you have a practical understanding that you can do it by yourself. The romantic idea of meeting your person and having a storybook family life that looks like the model you grew up with – that doesn't really exist for me. I've not gotten married because I have not had a person to whom I would — so I have not let my sense of conformity or duty override my instincts.\" \nWilliams continued: \n\"Sometimes it can feel alienating; at school functions, there's only two of us single mothers. Everyone else has a partner, so we buddy up.\" \nAnd even so, the 36-year-old is worrying about being a good parent while juggling her career: \n\"I worry about the next job and when it's coming and will I be able to get it, but when you're looking at something, there's also the criteria of timing, the school calendar, the location, the duration, and just where we're at as a family.\" \nShe's kicking ass at it though! Just in case she didn't already know that. \nCh-ch-check out her spread and cover in the gallery (above)!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:11:35.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
