Kelsey Weekman, AOL.com Mar 23rd 2017 2:42PM \nRemember that glamour shot of Kellyanne Conway someone spotted in the background of an interview at her home? — Franklin Leonard (@franklinleonard) March 13, 2017 \nIt turns out that the stunning shot is one of many featured in a calendar dedicated to attractive, politically-conservative women. \nBetween 2009 and 2012, Conway joined the likes of Ann Coulter, Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachmann in posing for a calendar commissioned by the Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute. \nCBLPI publishes the calendars to raise money for the nonprofit, which was founded in 1993 after Michelle Easton served in the Reagan and first Bush White Houses. \n\"We are an organization that prepares and supports women leaders,\" Easton told Broadly . \"We make them stronger, better conservatives. We use successful conservative women as role models.\" \nThe organization is named for late Connecticut congresswoman Clare Boothe Luce, who mixed femininity with right-wing politics and wrote for various magazines. \nAccording to Broadly, CBLPI employees decided to create calendars in 2004 after watching the movie \" Calendar Girls \" -- a story of Women's Institute members who raise money by posing nude in a calendar. \n\"[A donor] had the idea (we let him think it was his) that we should do a calendar,\" former CBLPI program director Lisa De Pasquale told Broadly. \"[For the first few calendars], I did it on the cheap with the photos they provided or we took from events.\" \nConway's legendary mink photo came from the 2009 calendar, which had a \"Pretty in Mink\" theme. Coulter also posed for it. The same \"Pretty in Mink\" conservative women calendar includes this incredible photo of @AnnCoulter in her own mink https://t.co/JjiyANQJKs pic.twitter.com/K3ZcPt67e0 \nYou can check out the 2008 , 2009 , 2010 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 and 2015 calendars and more in full on the CBLPI website. \nSee how people are reacting to the story: 6 PHOTOS Conservative women calendar spread ignites Twitter See Gallery Conservative women calendar spread ignites Twitter @broadly @jyoohoops even in a photoshoot that conway hair looks thirsty. @Olivianuzzi @mitchsunderland \"There is no backstory, except I was the only one wearing my own mink.\" classic coulter @Olivianuzzi @mitchsunderland It does kinda look like JCPenny glamour shots tbh, but hating on looks is so sexist. #GetEnlightened @Olivianuzzi @mitchsunderland @broadly She looks really pretty, but the whole thing is hilarious. @Olivianuzzi @mitchsunderland Beautiful, successful women.
