The sprint cyclist has already explained how she broke her neck, her back and her pelvis in a terrible accident on a track in Rotterdam just over a year ago but, now, she lingers over her good fortune in avoiding total paralysis from the neck down. Nicole Cooke ‘sceptical’ of Bradley Wiggins and hits out at ‘sexist’ cycling Read more \n“My back and pelvis were broken,” she explains, “but, actually, the back fractures were quite far from the spinal cord so that didn’t cause the paralysis danger. It was my neck. The surgeon measured that break on the MRI scan and it was 2mm from my spinal cord. Another 2mm and from here down …” \nThe 23-year-old moves her hands delicately from her neck down to indicate that the rest of her body would have been paralysed. “I would have had absolutely nothing left, no movement. It’s quite scary when you see it on the scan, when they zoom in and do the measurements. I was unlucky to have the accident but then you think more clearly and it’s easy to say: ‘Right. OK. I am pretty lucky then …’” \nIf they gave out world championship medals for courage, composure and good cheer in the face of adversity then Williamson would be able to claim a trio of golds in the way she reacted to her crash 13 months ago. Williamson was aiming for an Olympic medal in Rio last year but she has since become something of a medical expert as well as an impressively tough young woman on the comeback trail. She has still not been able to get back on her bike but, with the ambition of riding in next year’s Commonwealth Games, Williamson had to first learn how to walk again and to overcome the psychological trauma of her shocking injuries. \nOn her blog she details her catalogue of breaks with a light touch. “The first obvious injury was the large cut to my right flank which went as deep as my spine and exposed my lumbosacral vertebrae. It can definitely be described as looking like a shark bite. I then suffered a C3 fracture in my neck as well as a C5/C6 prolapsed disc. My pelvis had also been fractured and dislocated. However it was my back that took the worst hit. I had multiple fractures of the transverse processes from L1-L5, L4/L5 spinous process fractures as well as a L5-S1 dislocation. So, yeah, pretty much everything.” \nWilliamson smiles when I say I do not even know what a spinous process looks like. “If you imagine a diagram of a spine then the spinous processes are the little bony bits. I’ve got a picture of an MRI scan where you can see how mine snapped off. So with that operation it was a case of pulling out the loose bone, putting in the metalwork and bone graft because some of my discs had been completely destroyed. They’d already cut out the muscle in the flank – because all my oblique muscle had died after it had been exposed.” All I remember is lining up against the fence before I raced. The next thing I was in and out of consciousness \nWilliamson lifts her top to show me her back. The once raw and purple scar lines are fading. “It’s looking OK isn’t it?” she says. “But Ellie Richardson [who raced in the Netherlands with Williamson] got a shock. When they flipped me over on the track she saw my bare spine. This flap of skin had just torn away so it was a pretty horrendous sight.” \nShe shudders for the first time. “I can’t imagine seeing it from an outside view. When it’s you lying there, you don’t feel it’s as bad.” \nWilliamson laughs when I mention a photograph of her, attached to wires and monitors, and she’s giving a goofy grin and a thumbs-up from her hospital bed. “That was a few days after the crash. I had lots of people coming to hospital because they thought I had died. Everyone looked so serious and I’m quite easy-going. But I was also high on fentanyl and morphine.” \nShe replicates her spacey grin and thumbs-up – but shrugs when asked to describe her accident. “I can’t remember. All I remember is lining up against the fence before I raced [the Dutch cyclist] Elis Ligtlee. The next thing I was in and out of consciousness.” \nIt seems that Williamson’s handlebars locked as she and Ligtlee got down to serious racing. But, with the typical grit of a competitor, Williamson remains more interested in the fact that Ligtlee went on to reach the Olympic sprint semi-finals and win gold in the keirin in Rio seven months later. The success of her rival underlines Williamson’s belief that she could also have done well in Rio. \n“I would have gone for the second GB sprint place behind Becky James . I was making serious ground and that was why it came as such a blow. I’ve not seen the video yet but our team doctor said I was coming round Elis at speed when it happened. I’m not saying that I would have won an Olympic medal – but Elis actually won gold. So if I was going faster than her last January that proves how my form was progressing.” Victoria Williamson in action at the 2015 Track Cycling World Championships in Paris.

They didn’t know if I could feel my feet and the initial operation in Rotterdam was to put the pin in and secure the flank wound. When I was in the UK the back operation lasted eight hours. Each operation was a risk of potentially causing paralysis as well. It was daunting when a disclaimer form I had to sign said: ‘Risks – paralysis.’ My dad said: ‘Don’t think about that – there’s danger with any back operation.’ Obviously mine was a bit different with the broken neck as well. \n“They found out about the 2mm then – and I was lucky enough not to have another pin in my neck. The surgeon gave me the option. He said: ‘If you have the neck brace it has to be on solid for four months. If you have a pin in the neck you can crack on straight away. But if you have the pin your range of movement will be limited forever.’ So it’s a no-brainer really. If I was to match sprint, how could I race like this?” \nWilliamson turns her neck stiffly to the side, barely moving more than a few centimetres. “I’d need a wing mirror, which I’m sure would be illegal. But look at my neck movement now. You wouldn’t even know.” How David Millar’s farewell film became a rage against the fading light | Richard Williams Read more \nShe looks far to the left and then back to the right to prove her movement is back to normal. But did she ever contemplate the bleakest alternative – and paralysis? “I blocked that out. If I had paid too much attention to it I would have been in utter meltdown. It was just a case of thinking differently. Everyone is like: ‘Flipping heck! You’ve been out for a year.’ But to me it’s gone quickly. I’ve been so busy and always had a goal. I know it’s not been a competition, but I’ve always had a target to chase. I’ve stayed motivated – even though I’ve had a few ups and downs.” \nBefore she could walk again it was a mighty battle for Williamson even to sit up in her hospital bed. “The initial sitting-up process took five or six days. On the first day they inclined me a little and I fainted. The same thing happened the next day. It seems like such a basic thing but I’d been so excited that, after laying like that for four weeks, I was actually going to be upright. But when it came to it I was like: ‘Actually, this isn’t that fun. Can I lie down again?’” \nWilliamson laughs in her jangly way. “By day four I managed to sit up and then it just went from there. Each day got better and eventually I was comfortable just being upright. But, yeah, it was a bizarre mixture of pain, dizziness and nausea at first.” \nWhen was the darkest time for Williamson? “Six months later – when the Olympics were on. No matter how much you prepare yourself for missing out, I was just miserable for two weeks. You train for four years to make the Olympics and it’s a big smack in the face when you can’t go. I watched them and I wanted my team-mates to do well. I was loving all the sprint stuff, especially when Jason Kenny won that keirin . I went absolutely wild. I’m not an envious person and I was behind the team 100%. But I did think: ‘God, I wish that was me.’” Victoria Williamson: ‘I had lots of people coming to hospital because they thought I had died. I was high on fentanyl and morphine.’ Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian \nWilliamson has won a far more significant battle and she hopes to return to full training in the next few months. “It’s definitely about willpower. Ruth Anderson, our psychologist, has said from day one that everyone can’t believe how well I handled it. But I guess I’ve just got that athlete’s mindset of not looking at the broader picture. I take it day-by-day, ticking off little goals all the time. \n“We’re now in that takeover zone where my care will go from the hospital to British Cycling . So it’s just trying to get everyone on the same page and understanding exactly what I can and can’t do. I’ve got time on my side because 2020 is the long-term goal. The Tokyo Olympics would be amazing. Six months from now they’ll assess where I’m at but it is hard not to look ahead. I do really want to get to the Commonwealth Games next year – but you’ve got to be like a racehorse and put the blinkers on. It’s no good me worrying: ‘Am I going to make the England team?’ If it had been picked before I crashed I’m in the top two Brits with Becky James [from Wales]. But I need to take one step at a time.” \nShe also has a huge occasion to look forward to in her personal life. She is getting married to Oliver Barnes, a professional golfer, and she breaks into a smile. “The wedding will be in Norfolk where I’m from. It’s going to be a country wedding, on 1 July. I’m writing for the UK’s biggest wedding blog – Rock My Wedding – and I felt quite honoured that they asked me to write as a real bride for them. I’ve got to write two blogs a month but I’ve always been passionate about writing. I should have done it for A-level really and that was one thing I regretted. I would definitely love to get into writing one day.” \nWilliamson grins when I say that writing is much easier than recovering from a broken neck, back and pelvis. “Yeah, my surgeon still can’t believe I’m ready to get back on the bike. I think everyone is saying the same thing: ‘How did you do it?’ But I’ve not let it take over me. You hear of injured athletes falling into depression and it’s easy to slip down that road and lose hope. I’ve stayed positive even when my injury was so severe. Now there’s so much light at the end of the tunnel. I feel full of hope.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:58:50.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
