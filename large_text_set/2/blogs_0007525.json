In a historic move, Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote to confirm DeVos after the Senate was evenly divided over the controversial nominee. \nThe confirmation is bad news for the United States. The conservative b illionaire is a religious extremist who wants to destroy public education and use taxpayer money to fund Christian schools. \nDeVos is an anti-secular theocrat with no experience working in public education. However, she has used her immense wealth and influence to try and destroy public education in America. \nIf confirmed as Secretary of Education, she can be expected to continue her mission to destroy secular, public education in the United States. \nCommenting on DeVos’ nomination, Freedom From Religion Foundation Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor said: \nThe decision to appoint DeVos to this post signifies a serious attack on public education. As the top education official in the United States, she can be expected to do everything in her power to take taxpayer money from public schools and send it to private religious schools. \nGaylor has good reason to be concerned. Politico reports that in a 2001 interview DeVos declared that education in America should “advance God’s Kingdom.” \nWhen asked about spending taxpayer dollars on private and religious schools, DeVos declared : \nThere are not enough philanthropic dollars in America to fund what is currently the need in education…[versus] what is currently being spent every year on education in this country…Our desire is to confront the culture in ways that will continue to advance God’s Kingdom. \nFor DeVos, “what is currently the need in education” is more Jesus, more Christianity, more religious superstition. And she is willing to destroy public education and use tax dollars to support private religious schools in order to promote her dreams of theocracy. \nIn an extensive report detailing the next Secretary of Education’s theocratic tendencies, Mother Jones notes: \nBetsy and Dick DeVos have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to organizations seeking to privatize education and blur the separation of church and state in public schools. \nIn addition, on the way to destroying public education, the new Secretary of Education will make life Hell for LGBT youth. Politico reports: \n… the DeVos family has a long history of supporting anti-gay causes — including donating hundreds of thousands to groups that push “conversion therapy” — raising questions about how, if at all, she would address discrimination against gay and transgender students. \nChad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for LGBT rights, opines : \nThe DeVos family has a long, well-documented history of funding organizations dedicated to undermining and restricting the rights of LGBTQ people. \nHuffington Post simply calls DeVos a “dangerous threat to LGBT equality.” \nDeVos has never attended public school. She did not send her kids to public school. She has never worked in public schools. She does not have an education degree, and she has never been a teacher. In fact, she has demonstrated an open hostility to public education, and a desire to destroy public education by using taxpayer money to subsidize private, religious schools. \nBottom line: Betsy DeVos is a dangerous theocrat, and she is now the new Secretary of Education. Weep for the children. \n( Large portions of this article were previously published here: Betsy DeVos: American Schools Should Advance ‘God’s Kingdom’ ) Betsy DeVos (Image via YouTube) Stay in touch with Progressive Secular Humanist on Facebook:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T20:59:04.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
