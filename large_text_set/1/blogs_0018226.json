ADVERTISEMENT \nCrucial clash \nThat would make the Ginebra-Phoenix clash at 6:45 p.m. at PhilSports Arena crucial for both, with the Gin Kings trying to win three straight games for the first time this season, which could equate to the huge quarterfinal incentive. \nGinebra, though, might be forced to play the Fuel Masters without the high-flying Japeth Aguilar, who hyper-extended his right elbow after a bad fall following a breakaway dunk in the first half of a 99-90 win over Blackwater on Friday night. \nThe 6-foot-9 Aguilar missed practice Saturday and team trainers are doing everything to make him available for the Phoenix match. \nAnother side also still in the mix for No. 2 is Alaska, which battles Mahindra in the 4:30 p.m. game. \nAfter San Miguel, the other teams are bunched up in the standings with idle Star also moving in contention with a 4-4 record like Alaska. \nShould the Aces win, they will be clashing with Phoenix and Rain or Shine to close out their elimination round schedule in matches that will be the KO type for them as far as the race for No. 2 is concerned. \nGinebra battles NLEX on Jan. 29 at Cuneta Astrodome in Pasay. \nSantos finished with 31 points and 10 rebounds and fellow former MVP June Mar Fajardo had 19 and 15 in front of his provincemates. \nMarcio Lassiter had 22 points and Chris Ross had nine assists and three steals, the last of which led to the first of those Santos baskets. Ross picked a pass by KG Canaleta intended for Stanley Pringle, which set Santos up for a basket that made it 100-95. \nPringle went on to finish with 21 points and lead the Batang Pier, who are trying to better a franchise-best Final Four appearance here last season. Terrence Romeo scored 16 and Canaleta 14 for GlobalPort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:19:19.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
