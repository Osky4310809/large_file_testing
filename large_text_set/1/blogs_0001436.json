Here I am at Mashable HQ in rainy New York City, while many of my colleagues are soaking up the sun and hanging out at the conference in Las Vegas. \nSEE ALSO: 10 tech trends that will rule CES 2017 \nIt's not quite the same, but we can at least keep up with CES remotely through a few different methods. Here's how.\nStay social Like just about every other event in the world, CES will be shared with the outside world 140 characters at a time. \nThere's the official handle of the show, @CES . You'll get announcements, news and a quick connection if you have any questions about the event itself or any of the major presentations. To gauge the general conversation from Vegas, check out #CES2017 , the event's official hashtag. \nThat can get a bit muddled though with so many voices chiming in, so for the absolute best coverage, follow us on @MashableTech for up-to-the-minute tweets about everything CES. For a bit more flavor, make sure to search #MashCES â€” that's our hashtag of choice. \nWe'll also be going live on Facebook , Instagram and Snapchat throughout the show, so follow along to stay in the know.\nLargest VR headset ever? #MashCES #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/SN2JJujmf7 \nâ€” Raymond Wong ðŸ“±ðŸ’¾ðŸ“¼ (@raywongy) January 3, 2017 \nStream everything To keep up with the biggest events in real time with your own two eyes, you'll want to take note of livestreams scheduled to take place throughout the week. The CES site itself will host live video of some major notable events. Don't miss out on the SuperSessions or the Innovation Policy Summit events on Thursday and Friday. \nAdditionally some of the showcased companies will provide the public with access to the presentations independently. Major players like Faraday Future (Tuesday; 6 p.m. PST), LG (Wednesday; 8 a.m. PST), Samsung (Wednesday; 2 p.m. PST), Sony (Wednesday; 5 p.m. PST) and NVIDIA (Wednesday; 6:30 p.m. PST) shouldn't be missed.\nWhether you're watching from the show floor or your bedroom, the trends that kick off the year at CES will be major factors for the tech world for the rest of the year â€” and beyond. So tune in, follow those hashtags and get stoked for another year of innovation... and washing machines .\nBONUS: This revolutionary printer doesn't use any ink to print", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:59:51.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
