Russell for his work on “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.” The decision, announced Saturday, was due to Russell’s violation of Academy campaign regulations.\nThe statement says Russell violated strict rules applied to telephone lobbying.\nAcademy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in a statement that they take “very seriously the Oscars voting process.”\n“13 Hours” is still eligible for the award, but only for mixers Gary Summers, Jeffrey J. Haboush and Mac Ruth. At the Oscars on Sunday, the “13 Hours” crew is competing against the sound mixing team from “Arrival,” ”Hacksaw Ridge,” ”La La Land” and “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.”\n  WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Fox News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:39:45.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
