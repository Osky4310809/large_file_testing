Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJose Mourinho believes Paul Pogba’s growing influence on Manchester United will soon make his £89million world-record transfer fee appear a steal. \nAnd the Old Trafford boss has revealed he is hoping the France midfielder quickly loses his tag as the game’s most expensive star this summer – so he can develop without the intense 24/7 scrutiny of the football world. \nAs he heads to Blackburn in the FA Cup today with United still fighting for trophies on four fronts, powerhouse Pogba is ­emerging as the driving heartbeat of the new Mourinho era. And although he has been slow to stamp his unquestioned quality on the Premier League, there are growing signs that his ability is beginning to impact on United’s campaign. \nThat is no surprise to Mourinho, who is ­convinced United’s big outlay on the 23-year-old will eventually be viewed as ­bargain business.

You are paying as if the can doesn’t exist and as if the player is already a big player. \n“So next ­summer can bring a few surprises at this level, and probably Paul will lose this status as the world’s most ­expensive player which will be a good thing. \n“I think he has phenomenal conditions, but I think the scrutiny on him is very difficult. When he plays very, very well, which he does many, many times, people think it is normal. \n“Yet, when he has a game when he is not so happy and he doesn’t perform so well, ­pundits and even supporters go strong on him.

I am pretty sure this ­summer that some players with only half of his quality ­probably will cost the same money or more. \n“And I am waiting for that moment to ­release him from the scrutiny. But I am really happy with his football and his happiness to play football.” \nMourinho would be happier still if Pogba had not set the unwelcome record of hitting the woodwork eight times already – the most by any Premier League player this season. \nHe has scored only seven times for United in 35 appearances – a goal every five games – and Mourinho knows that will improve. \nHe said: “Imagine if they were goals ­instead of eight posts and it would be an amazing record so step by step he is going in the right direction and is still very young so he can be fantastic.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:43:49.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
