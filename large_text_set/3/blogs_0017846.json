Compared to New York, it’s a village.” \nThe 25-year-old also admitted having cosmetic procedures on her cheeks and eyes . \nFaryal Makhdoom , 25, had the procedures under the guidance of Simon Ourian, who is Kim Kardashian’s doctor. \n“Because of lack of sleep, genes, dehydration, I get bags under my eyes and I wanted to get them lightened” said Faryal. \nShe has also had fillers in her cheeks. “I like high cheekbones” she said.

Fillers and plastic surgery are two different things and I want people to understand that. \n“If other women had this money and if they had a husband who was famous, they would do it, too. \n“If I wasn’t married to Amir Khan, I’d probably be a regular girl and I might not do it. But I’m in the limelight, I go to events, so it’s part of my life now.” Read More Faryal has fallen out with Amir's family (Photo: PA) The couple are apparently planning more children (Photo: Getty Images North America) \nShe and Amir, 30, married in 2013 and their daughter Lamaisah arrived a year later. \nThe couple are currently living in San Francisco as Amir trains for a fight later this year. \nBut Faryal, an American, says they will return to live in the UK and are planning more children. \n“My husband wants another child so badly” she said. \nAnd she added: “I love the UK, it’s home for me now. \n“After Trump became president, my heart kind of drifted away from America. I’m so glad I don’t live in the US permanently. The amount of love I get in the UK is amazing.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T19:41:54.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
