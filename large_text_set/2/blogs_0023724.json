Malware hiding behind traffic violation threats By Mark Jones, Komando.com \nThere is no limit to the depths cybercriminals will sink to rip us off. They use skimmers to steal credit and debit card data and ransomware to lock up our gadgets or encrypt sensitive files so they can charge us a fee to access our own information. \nJust ruthless! Now, some shady criminals behind a phishing scam are pretending to be the police in hopes of reeling in more victims. How the \"negligent driving\" malware scam works \nPeople are receiving fraudulent emails claiming to be from the police. The email claims that the recipient was caught via traffic camera while driving negligently. \nThe email is supposedly serving as a traffic violation notice. The victim is told to click on a link within the email to read the full notification. \nWarning! Do NOT click on the link, it is a phishing scam! \nIf you do click on the link in the email, a .zip file that contains a malicious JavaScript (.js) file will be downloaded. If you then click on the .js file, your gadget will be infected with malware. \nThe scammer usually includes an obligatory traffic photo trying to make the email look official. Here is an example of what that looks like: Image: Example of police traffic cam photo. (Source: Automotive.com) \nNote : If you are reading this article using the Komando.com App, click here to see the traffic cam photo. \nThere are a couple of things in this email that should tip-off the fact that it's a scam. \nFirst, since the photo is a generic image, you won't see your vehicle in it. If this actually was an official photo showing your traffic violation, shouldn't your car be seen in the image? Of course. \nSecondly, if you were caught on traffic cam violating the law, how would officials know your email address? They can get your home address from your license plate, and maybe they have an email address on file but those can frequently change, which is one reason police never send violations via email. \nThose are just a couple of easily spotted mistakes made by the scammers in this instance. Read on for more suggestions on spotting phishing scams. How to spot phishing scams Be cautious with links - If you get an email or notification that you find suspicious, don't click on its links. It's better to type the website's address directly into a browser than clicking on a link. Before you ever click on a link, hover over it with your mouse to see where it is going to take you. If the destination isn't what the link claims, do not click on it. Do an online search - If you get a notification like this one, you should do an online search on the topic. If it's a scam, there are probably people online complaining about it and you can find more information. Search for something like \"negligent driving email scam\" and see what comes up as a result.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:52:59.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
