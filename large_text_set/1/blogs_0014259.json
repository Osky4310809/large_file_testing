The brand, which was once known for its odd watches made of moon rocks and metal from the Titanic, his created a series of nostalgic video game watches that are wildly overpriced but also wildly desirable. Their latest? A Donkey Kong watch that features the monkey and the plumber in all of their pixelated glory. \nThe watch is hand-made and hand-enabled and it runs a custom Romain Jerome movement. It has a 46mm case and 3D face with the tiny figures on one plane above a dark background for legibility. \nThe watch will be shown at the SIHH show in Switzerland this week. It joins RJ’s Mario Brothers, Pokemon, and Space Invaders watches, all aimed at a certain demographic of gaming nerd with a lot of money and a lot of Weltschmerz. \nHow much does it cost to save Pauline? $16,500, friends, so make sure you have a liquidity event before hitting the watch shop. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T18:56:53.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
