The couple is standing in front of a mirrored wall, which shows Kushner's hand resting on Trump's posterior.\n\nThe photograph generated swift reaction on social media, with some comments highlighting the inappropriateness of the post in the midst of the humanitarian chaos that ensued Saturday in the U.S., after dozens of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other banned countries were detained at airports, American Civil Liberties Union lawyers rushed to offer aid, and protesters clogged terminals and streets in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Seattle and San Francisco.\nIvanka has faced criticism on several fronts in recent weeks, most notably when her namesake fashion label promoted a $10,000 bracelet she wore during a 60 Minutes interview the Trump family gave after Election Night.\nIn early January, to comply with ethic guidelines, she officially stepped away from her brand. But she has continued to play the role of a fashion plate in her new home in Washington, D.C., documenting on her social media channels her outfits in a style similar to a fashion magazine.\n\nAt the inauguration, Ivanka received attention for wearing designers Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera. And interest in an Aspinal of London bag she carried to the National Prayer Service spiked, suggesting she may have the power to move fashion merchandise in her new role in the Washington spotlight adjacent to, for now, the Trump administration.\nNo word yet on who designed the metallic silver gown she wore Saturday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T14:23:26.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
