(ANI) \nMaharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis a press conference reflecting on the brilliant show by BJP in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections 2017. Speaking to the media, Fadnavis said that the BJP had tied with the Shiv Sena for the first spot after gaining the support of 4 independent candidates. Fadnavis further said that the people voted in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s “note bandi” drive. He added that the BMC polls were a huge victory for the BJP on the agenda of transparency. Fadnavis thanked the people of Maharashtra for the unprecedented victory. Fadnavis was of the opinion that the Bhartiya Janata Party had created trust in the people of Mumbai. Fadnavis thanked the people again for supporting their agenda of development. \nSpeaking about the close margin of victory in the state, the Chief Minister said that they had lost 20 seats by a very close margin. There was a lot at stake for both Shiv Sena and the BJP, two saffron allies for over 20 years, who have been going through a fallout. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had openly criticised the BJP government in the state under Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation scheme. For the most part of the day, it looked as if the Shiv Sena would run away with an absolute majority for more time but BJP changed gears towards the end of the day and raced to 81 seats. Although, since none of the parties gained the required 114 seats to reach an absolute majority, the picture still remains unclear as to who will take over the reigns of the richest Municipal corporation in the world. \nAlso watch: \nIn the weeks leading to the BMC polls, Shiv Sena had launched a series of attacks directed towards the Bhartiya Janata Party. Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray had spoken against the demonetisation drive citing the problems faced by the common man. Later, after weeks of silence on the part of BJP, the party had released a cartoon video, calling Shiv Sena as the “Khau Sena” and criticised it for its corrupt activities. Earlier today, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari is happy with BJP’s performance and congratulated party workers. “For the first time, BJP has got such unprecedented success. I congratulate Maharashtra CM &BJP workers,” he said.
