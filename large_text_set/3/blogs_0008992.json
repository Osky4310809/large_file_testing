It’s the third injury to his left knee in three seasons, and it seems certain Parsons will miss at least the rest of the season.\nParsons had struggled this season as he slowly worked back into shape, averaging 20 minutes in 34 games while averaging only six points on 34 percent shooting. Memphis coaches and teammates preached patience after signing Parsons to a four-year, $95 million contract, but the 6’9 forward’s recovery has now suffered another setback.\n“To suffer a setback like this after working so diligently to rebound from the injury to his right knee is obviously tough. That said, we know he will continue to work tirelessly to return to the court with his teammates and contribute,” Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said in the team’s statement. “Chandler has the full support of myself, Coach Fizz and the entire team and we are all focused on getting him healthy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:04:17.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
