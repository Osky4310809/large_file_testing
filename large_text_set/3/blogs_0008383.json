Relive Wigan's victory as it happened \nThe victory was Wigan's 10th in a row, a run stretching back to the tail end of last season, and their fourth straight win this campaign which left them top of the formative table. \nWhile October's Grand Final, which Wigan won 12-6, was a cagey and close affair, Warriors outclassed Warrington from the outset, running in seven tries in total. \nMarshall, who made his Super League debut against Leigh six days earlier, was given his chance once again in a Warriors side further depleted by injuries to Joe Burgess, Ryan Sutton and Lewis Tierney. \nThe 20-year-old ran Wolves ragged in the first half, latching onto George Williams' grubber kick for his first before finishing from close range past a static Warrington defence. \nHis third demonstrated the outstanding pace which helped him score 20 tries in 22 matches on loan at Championship side Swinton in 2016, racing from near his own try-line to dot down beneath the posts. \nWarrington managed three tries of their own through Ryan Atkins, Rhys Evans and Tom Lineham, but they mattered little in a below-par performance. \nWarrington Wolves: Gidley; Russell, Blythe, Atkins, Lineham; Brown, Livett; Cooper, Clark, Sims, Hughes, Westwood, Westerman. \nReplacements: Dwyer, Philbin, Savelio, Evans. \nWigan Warriors: Escare; Forsyth, Gelling, Isa, Marshall; Williams, Leuluai; Nuuausala, Powell, Flower, Tomkins, Farrell, O'Loughlin. \nReplacements: Clubb, Tautai, Navarrete, Wells. \nReferee: Ben Thaler.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:34:20.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
