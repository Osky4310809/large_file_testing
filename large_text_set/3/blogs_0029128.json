And by this, he is a graduate of the university.” \nMembers of the panel asked the vice-chancellor to repeat what he said, reminding him that he was on oath. \nHe said, “On my honour, I reaffirm that Senator Dino Melaye graduated as Daniel Jonah Melaye during the third semester of the 1998/1999 academic session with a Third Class degree in Geography; that is Bachelors of Arts in Geography.” \nEarlier, Melaye was asked if he was a student of ABU and graduated from the institution. \nHe replied, “I have a few documents I would also want to tender to the committee and before I do that, I also want to state with every sense of responsibility, that I am a graduate of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. \n“I gained admission with an offer of admission on September 6, 1994, and the admission is to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree (in) Geography and a copy of that admission letter will be tendered. \n“I also have a second document to tender; my acceptance offer by the university. I also have the third document to tender, which is my result from the Ahmadu Bello University, certifying me a graduate of the school. \n“I also have here a document for my registration that I tendered, where I have C5 in CRS, A3 in Agric, C6 in Economics, C6 in Geography, C6 in Biology and a Credit in English. I will also tender that as evidence.” \nThe lawmaker explained that after his graduation from ABU, the school mobilised him for the National Youth Service Corps between 2000 and 2001. \nHe said, “I served in Police College, Kaduna, and by the grace of God, that year, I won the National Prize of the Director General (of the NYSC) and it is on record and verifiable. I beg to tender my discharge certificate from the NYSC.” \nWhen asked of the irregularities in the names on his certificate, Melaye said he had sworn to an affidavit to regularise the names and inform all relevant institutions. \nHe said, “My name as an undergraduate was Daniel Jonah Melaye. Jonah is actually my father’s name; so, that is what I have on my university certificate. But because I am now popularly known as Dino, I applied to the court and asked that I needed an affidavit for a change of name before my admission and I submitted it to ABU.” \nCopyright PUNCH.
