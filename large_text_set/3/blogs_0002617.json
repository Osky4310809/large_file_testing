In the UK, Suzuki is moving strongly into the market, with 13 new models this year, chief among which is the 2017 Suzuki GSX-250R, at 4,299 pounds sterling (RM23,514), with the GP edition in Suzuki race livery for one hundred pounds more, at 4,399 pounds sterling (RM24,061) \nCarrying a liquid-cooled, 248 cc parallel-twin that puts out 24.6 hp at 8,000 rpm and 23.4 Nm of torque at 6500rpm, the GSX-250R is positioned as a stylish commuter in the UK market. The SOHC engine is fed by EFI and power gets to the ground via a six-speed gearbox. \nSuspension, as can be expected at this price point, is basic, with a telescopic non-adjustable KYB fork in front and single mono shock at the rear adjustable for pre-load. Braking is done by single disc brakes front and rear, using house-brand components, with Bosch ABS as standard. \nAlso standard is a back-lit LCD instrument panel that displays speed, engine RPM, gear position and RPM indicator, odometer, dual trip meters, fuel gauge, average fuel consumption and oil change timing indicators, and a clock. Clip-on handlebars and 10-spoke alloy wheels round out the specifications package. \nSuzuki claims a wet weight of 181 kg for the 2017 GSX-250R, and seat height is listed at a rider-friendly 790 mm, making the small Gixxer suitable for almost any rider. Two colour schemes are available for the 2017 Suzuki GSX-250R in the UK – Pearl Nebular Black for the base model and Metallic Triton Blue for the GP edition in Suzuki racing colours. Coming with diverse and extensive experience in heavy engineering, Mohan enjoys making anything with wheels go fast, especially motorcycles. His weapon of choice is the Desmoquattro engine, and he has a penchant for anything with a dash of Italian design. Strangely enough, he insists he's a slow rider.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:02:45.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
