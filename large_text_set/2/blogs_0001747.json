He hits the first one to get us to 69 and the place goes nuts because he’s playing into it. On his next free throw, he purposely chucks the ball off the backboard and misses so the score would stay at 69 and then runs back on defense pointing at the scoreboard.” \nThat’s right. He purposely missed the free throw to keep the score at 69. 2 GIF \n“This is absolutely juvenile.”— some of you, probably. \nOooh look at you, Mr. High Brow. I bet you read books and eat dinner that isn’t microwaveable, too. Sitting on your throne of sophistication, looking down on us simpletons as we scratch our cracks and change the channel to Family Guy . I don’t want to associate with anyone who doesn’t at least half-smile at a well-done 69 joke. The “69” joke is like the “send nudes” joke — it will always be funny as long as people keep coming up with new and inventive means of execution. And purposely chucking a brick against the backboard in a basketball game to keep the score at 69 is one for the highlight reel. \nNever change, fellow troglodytes. Never change, Gronk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:57:22.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
