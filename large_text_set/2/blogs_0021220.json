When he actually gets elected, he surprises everyone (including himself) when he has a natural knack for the job and slowly transforms city hall,” according to THR .\nLea ‘s character was reportedly originally planned to be Courtney’s chief of staff, but the role is being modified to fit her.\nRyan Murphy has reportedly released Lea from her deal to star in the potential third season of Scream Queens . The show has not yet been renewed and is still on the bubble as pilot season heads into full swing. If the show does return, it will come back without Hester Ulrich.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:40:01.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
