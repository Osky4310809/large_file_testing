Photo by Drew Angerer/AFP \nNEW YORK, USA – Samsung on Wednesday, March 29 unveiled its new Galaxy S8 smartphones, incorporating the virtual assistant Bixby, as the market leader seeks to rebound from a chaotic handset recall and a corruption scandal . \nThe South Korean giant's mobile chief DJ Koh told a New York event the Galaxy S8 and S8+ handsets marked \"a new era of smartphone design.\" \nFitted with screens of 5.8 and 6.2 inches, the two handsets include Samsung's upgraded digital assistant Bixby, competing in a crowded field that includes Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. \nThe most striking feature of the new phones is what Samsung dubs an \"infinity display\" – an expanded glass screen that covers the entire front of the device and appears to curve seamlessly around its edges. The home button has been replaced with a pressure-sensitive section embedded under the screen. \nBoth phones are water resistant and allow for biometric authentication with fingerprint and iris scanners.

Photo by Jason Kempin/AFP \nAs Samsung's top-line handsets, the Galaxy S8 models will challenge the latest Apple iPhones. \nThe new phones will be available starting April 21, Samsung said. In the US market, they will be sold through major carriers and retailers, with unlocked devices priced from $725. \nIn the Philippines, the S8 and S8+ will be available on May 5 for P39,990 and P45,990. \nAfter the debacle \nThe Galaxy S8 release comes after Samsung was forced to recall its Note 7 phones for catching fire due to overheating batteries . \nThe debacle cost the South Korean company billions of dollars in lost profit and hammered its global reputation and credibility, during a torrid period that has also seen it embroiled in a corruption scandal. \nIts vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong, heir to the parent Samsung group, has been arrested and indicted for bribery, along with four other senior executives, in connection with a graft scandal that saw ex-president Park Geun-Hye impeached. \nSamsung apologized to consumers for the recall and was forced to postpone the S8 launch. Its investigation blamed the problems on faulty batteries. \nThe firm later embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, placing full-page advertisements in US newspapers that admitted it \"fell short\" on its promises. \nThe tech giant says it has also come up with elaborate step-by-step safety verification procedures for future products to prevent similar disasters. \nAs part of its launch, Samsung will be including its Gear virtual reality (VR) headset to customers pre-ordering the handsets. The VR headset now includes motion controllers, a new way to interface with virtual worlds on a mobile device. \nSamsung also introduced its Dex adapter which allows the smartphones to be transformed into desktop computers, and the new Gear 360 which can be used for livestreaming of 360-degree videos on Facebook and other platforms. The Dex will be available in the Philippines for P7,599 at a yet undisclosed date. MOBILE POWERED.

Photo by Brad Barket/AFP \nJan Dawson of Jackdaw Research was impressed by the new devices but also noted they would be priced higher than competitors from Apple and others. \n\"The Samsung approach is particularly clever, with its curved screen now less sharp on the edges, offering a more symmetrical and therefore more comfortable device,\" he said in a blog post. \n\"The price of the new phones is up to $100 higher than their predecessors and almost all of the premium smartphones they'll be competing with, which feels like a big risk.\" \nDawson said Samsung is betting \"that its phones will justify a higher price, whereas it could have used these new phones as a way to drive higher sales after a couple of years of stagnation.\" – Rappler.com/With reports by Gelo Gonzales HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
