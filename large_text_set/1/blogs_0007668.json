No one was injured but the man remained inside for about four hours before peacefully surrendering to police, Baltimore County Police spokesman Shawn Vinson told local station WBALTV-11 .\n“Apparently, the man had made a grilled cheese sandwich and either the wife or the daughter, we’re not exactly sure who, but somebody, one of the females in the house, took a bite of his sandwich, and apparently, that enraged him to the point that he fired shots in the house,” Vinson said.\nThe man was taken into custody. It’s unclear whether he faces any charges, the AP reports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T18:41:07.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
