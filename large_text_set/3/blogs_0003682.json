Now in following in its footsteps, a new trailer for Dark has just dropped, and it has got us all spooked and riled up.\nUpon first glance at the show’s trailer, you might deduce that the show is essentially just “Stranger Things V2,” but the plotl of a missing child is essentially where all the similarities end. Outfitted with a much more sinister vibe, Dark takes that very same concept and gives it a very German spin (it was literally filmed and produced in Germany), while flirting with elements of horror and mystery.\nAccording to Netflix, the series will debut Winter 2017; we still don’t have an official release date but be sure to stay tuned for further updates concerning Dark .\nFor more on Stranger Things, check out the latest updates on the hit show’s upcoming season .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:38:16.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
