Those kids are usually raised by their grandparents or other family members. \n\"I always want to take pictures of the left-behind kids,\" Li said. \"I want to know their true feelings and the differences between them and city children.\" \nIn China, migrant workers can rarely send their children to schools in cities because of the household registration system, or hukou. \nIt is estimated that there are about 270 million migrant workers and over nine million left-behind children in China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:52:22.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
