And as long as being a lazy girl is not taking over your life, or holding you back from something, we don't see a problem with being one (#LazyGirlAndProud). Lazy girls set their own rules for everything, and when it comes to beauty, that's another story. Here are 5 beauty habits that lazy girls know far too well. Multipurpose products make up the majority of your vanity bag A post shared by Tarte Cosmetics (@tartecosmetics) on Nov 15, 2016 at 8:57pm PST \nMoisturisers or BB creams with SPF, lip and cheek tints, contour-bronzer-highlighter trios - one product that takes care of more than one of your beauty needs, is a must-have. Keeping make-up wipes on your bedside table \nYou may be lazy, but you're cautious enough to make sure you take off your make-up before passing out in your bed... without having to leave your bed. You use dry shampoo like it's going out of style A post shared by 써늬 (@sssuny1212) on Feb 14, 2017 at 11:43pm PST \nWhile this might not be the healthiest practice, we're trusting in the fact that you know when you need to legit wash your hair. Any variation of the bun is your go-to hairstyle \nSince we have established that you don't wash your hair much, the half bun, full bun, top knot etc., all make daily appearances in your look. A vial of Vaseline is a mainstay in your bag A post shared by MALANG PAID PROMOTE 10K OS (@vaselinebeautyshop) on Feb 15, 2017 at 2:33am PST \nWhether it is to make your eyelids pop and shine, wipe out make-up mistakes, moisturise chapped lips and dry skin, or even help to get your brows in shape, Vaseline is your everything.
