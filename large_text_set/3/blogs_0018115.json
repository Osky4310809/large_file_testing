It's nothing I ain't heard before,\" he said. \"It sounds like an old blues jam that BB [King] and Muddy [Waters] would carry on backstage at the old amphitheatre in Chicago. The instruments may be different but the experiment's the same.\" \nHe added: \"I don't listen to all of them because (winking) we all know who does them best, don't we?\" \nBerry's short takes reveal a musician open to the most extreme expressions of rock 'n' roll, even though he was already well into his 50s at the time. Chuck Berry performs in Minneapolis in July 1984. Jim Steinfeldt / Getty Images \nThe Father of Rock 'n' Roll found a lot to like in some of the punk he heard â€” at least in the music, which many punk bands consciously based on the original three-chord blues licks that Berry midwifed into rock 'n' roll. \nThe lyrics? Not so much. \nOf The Sex Pistols' revolutionary \"God Save the Queen,\" Berry complains: \"Can't understand most of the vocals. If you're going to be mad at least let the people know what you're mad about.\" \nOther reviews from the zine: \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\", by the Ramones: \"A good little jump number. These guys remind me of myself when I first started, I only knew three chords too.\" \"What I Like About You\", by The Romantics: Finally something you can dance to. Sounds a lot like the sixties with some of my riffs thrown in for good measure. You say this is new? I've heard this stuff plenty of times. I can't understand the big fuss. \"Psycho Killer,\" by Talking Heads: A funky little number, that's for sure. I like the bass a lot. Good mixture and a real good flow. The singer sounds like he has a bad case of stage fright. (To be fair, a lot of listeners have said the same thing about David Byrne's quirky, yelped style.) \"Complete Control,\" by The Clash: \"The rhythms and the chording work well together. Did this guy have a sore throat when he sang the vocals?\" \nThe punk ethos was to confront the listener with the anxiety and rage of the rising generation. But \"music should be made to make people forget their problems, if only for a short while,\" Berry insisted. \n\"If you want to release your aggression get up and dance. That's what rock and roll is all about.\" Alex Johnson", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T02:11:18.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
