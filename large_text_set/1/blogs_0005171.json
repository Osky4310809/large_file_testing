F*ck White People!’: 4 in Custody for Torturing Young Man Live on Facebook by Justin Baragona | 7:36 pm, January 4th, 2017 Video \nChicago police currently have four people in custody over a Facebook Live video that showed a group of young black adults holding a mentally disabled young white man hostage and torturing him. \nPolice were made aware of the video on Tuesday afternoon. The video, shot by a young black woman, shows multiple people kicking and hitting the victim while he was tied up. They also cut his scalp and burn him with cigarettes. Police say the young man has special-needs and had been reported missing from a nearby suburb. \nAccording to Chicago police, the young man was held captive for at least 24 hours and perhaps as long as 48. He also knew one of the assailants but it doesn’t appear to be a situation involving buying drugs. The four involved are considered adults but still in their teens. \nWatch the video of the story above, via CBS Chicago. \nDuring the beating, you could hear the attackers yelling “f*** Donald Trump! F*** white people!” along with other racial slurs. \nThe victim is now being treated at the hospital for his injuries. Meanwhile, no charges have yet been filed but police anticipate charges within next 24-48 hours. They’ll also investigate on whether this is defined as a hate crime. \nBelow is a copy of the unedited video. \nWARNING: Video is extremely disturbing. \nThe Chicago PD released a statement on the situation: \nWhile on patrol Officers observes a disoriented male walking 3400 W. Lexington on January 3, 2017 who was then transported to an area hospital for treatment. At 5:26 p.m. officers then responded to a battery at a residence on the 3300 block of W. Lexington where they discovered signs of a struggle and damage to the property and where able to link this evidence to the disoriented male. Officers later became aware of a social media video depicting a battery of an adult male which is believed to be the same individual. At this point CPD believes the video is credible and detectives are questioning persons of interest in the case. The victim, whom CPD believes is from a neighboring suburb, was transported to an area hospital in stable condition. The investigation is ongoing.
