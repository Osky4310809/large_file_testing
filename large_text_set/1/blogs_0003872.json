Netflix plans to stream it in the spring and it will also have a limited theatrical release. Netflix acquired the worldwide rights to the documentary. \nThe documentary is described as \"a sly and stylized exploration of the world's most sensational child-murder case.\" Directed by Kitty Green, it was shot over 15 months. She and her team traveled to Boulder, CO, the Ramsey's hometown, to speak with people there to gain insight on the crime and how its aftermath has affected the community. \nIt's the latest in a string of projects that have addressed the murder, including Lifetime's Who Killed JonBenét? and CBS' The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey . The latter has elicited two lawsuits following the docuseries' September airing, which culminated in experts from the show theorizing that Ramsey's older brother Burke may have accidentally killed his sister. Last week, Burke Ramsey filed a lawsuit against CBS, the show's producers and the experts that appeared in the series for $750 million. Earlier he filed a $150 million lawsuit against one of the experts, Dr. Werner Spitz, who is also named in the CBS suit.
