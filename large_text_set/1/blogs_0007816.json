Update: While presenting the award for best actress, Michael Keaton also misnamed Hidden Figures by calling if \"Hidden Fences.\" This is getting out of hand. Pharrell Williams was just interviewed by Jenna Bush on the Golden Globes red carpet. He’s nominated for his part in producing Hidden Figures and its soundtrack. But when Bush asked him about his party plans after the show, she carelessly called the film \"Hidden Fences.\" Obviously, she mixed up Pharrell’s project with Fences , the other 2017 movie nominee with a predominantly Black cast. The rapper/producer’s blank stare is being gif’d as we speak.Pharrell’s facial reaction would be hilarious if it weren’t so sad. The look of disappointment is unmistakable and totally warranted. Hidden Figures has so much historical significance for women and people of color. I can only image what it must feel like for Pharrell to have worked so hard to bring the story to life, only for it to be lumped in with “other” Black movie of the night. — Karen Civil (@KarenCivil) January 9, 2017 Advertisement Bush might have made an honest mistake, but she had one job and ruined it. With so few Black films acknowledged on platforms like the Golden Globes, it’s quite offensive that Bush clearly thinks of them interchangeably. Black Twitter didn’t let the moment slide. The dragging has already commenced. That moment #JennaBush congratulates #Pharrell on his Best Original Score nomination for \"Hidden Fences\".. pic.twitter.com/3wFj8ydzUB", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T04:30:08.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
