The startup had raised a very modest £200,000 to date. \n“After evaluating over 20 companies globally in this space, the Meltwater team determined that Wrapidity is the strongest technology of its kind, complemented by an experienced engineering team led by co-founders Dr. Tim Furche, Dr. Giorgio Orsi and Dr. Giovanni Grasso,” says Meltwater in a statement. \nIn a call, I asked Dr. Tim Furche, Wrapidity’s CTO, why the startup had decided to sell so early. He told me that, in some ways, it doesn’t actually feel like that since the technology has been almost a decade in the making through its academic beginnings. \nHe also talked up the two companies’ shared vision, sounding genuinely excited, and cited both Meltwater’s customer reach and huge historical content data sets that can be used to improve and further develop Wrapidity’s hybrid AI technology.

At the time, founder and CEO Jorn Lyseggen talked up the potential to beef up the company’s data science, machine learning, and natural language processing capabilities by acquiring startups in the space that have “proven technology”. \n“We see acquisitions as an integral part of our growth strategy,” he said in a statement. “We believe the next 24 months will see a high M&A activity in our space and we raised this capital to give us the firepower to take an active role in these processes”. \nMeanwhile, I’m told that since 2009 and not including today’s acquisition, Meltwater has acquired nine companies. Most recent was Encore Alert , a 500 Startup alumni that’s built social media alert technology powered by data science. We can now add Wrapidity to the list. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:07:35.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
