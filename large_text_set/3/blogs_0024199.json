The Knicks have gone 76-159 (.323) over that span. Only the Sixers and Lakers have been substantially worse since 2014. Both of those teams’ front offices have been shaken up in the past year.\nThe state of the Knicks is not all Jackson’s fault. Trades made deep in the past continue to hobble the franchise. The Knicks were bad enough to earn a top-10 pick last season, but had to convey that choice to the Raptors because of the Andrea Bargnani trade that predates Jackson. That hurts.\nBut it doesn’t absolve Jackson, who has made a series of blunders speckled with a few positive achievements. One of those positive achievements — drafting Kristaps Porzingis in 2015 — was brilliant enough to blind us from seeing all the failure. Just put on your sunglasses and you’ll see all the grimy detail of Jackson’s New York tenure.\nAdam Hunger-USA TODAY Sports He hired Derek Fisher , who he then had to fire in his second season because of the Matt Barnes saga and a general lack of success. He seriously auditioned Kurt Rambis , who has proven before that he is not an NBA head coach. In 2016, he hired Jeff Hornacek , who has a strong reputation among young head coaches with limited actual success. But he has spent the season kneecapping Hornacek’s authority by grousing about Carmelo Anthony’s style of play and that damn Triangle offense .\nYes, the cold war with Carmelo matters here too. Don’t forget that one of Jackson’s first acts in New York was to re-sign Anthony to a five-year max deal with a no-trade clause, something that has ruined the Knicks’ options in terms of moving on from Melo in the years since.\nMelo takes flack for re-signing in New York when he had opportunities to join better clubs. That’s fair. Anthony knew what the Knicks were.\nBut Jackson deserves similar flack for paying a player who didn’t fit whatever grand design he has. We all knew who Melo was. It’s not like Jackson arrived from outer space. He coached against Melo for darn near a decade in the Western Conference.\nJackson’s lack of vision is most troubling. Does anyone know where the Knicks are headed at any given moment? After Porzingis’ heart-swelling rookie season, it appeared New York would build organically around the Latvian, even if it meant losing more games and slowly transitioning out of the Melo-centric era. Instead, Jackson spent his summer signing Joakim Noah to the worst contract in the NBA (four years, $72 million), trading for a ball-dominant basket of troubles named Derrick Rose, and signing veteran Courtney Lee .\nInstead of focusing on the future, Jackson bet on the now. The Knicks are 27-44. Melo is miserable, Porzingis is confused , and the fans are still suffering.\nSubscribe to Good Morning It’s Basketball NBA news and links delivered to your inbox each weekday, so you never miss out.\nYour email address Subscribe By signing up you agree to our terms of use . No team president has a spotless record. Plenty of Jackson’s decisions fall into the category of rational moves that didn’t work out. The Tyson Chandler trade — one that really did not work as Chandler thrived in Dallas while the Knicks bottomed out — is such a move.\nLee’s contract is actually fine. Arron Afflalo’s deal was not, but it didn’t really cost the Knicks anything long-term. You can fault Jackson for letting Langston Galloway walk, but then you have to credit Jackson’s crew for bringing Galloway to the NBA in the first place. The trade sending J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert brought essentially no tangible long-term benefit to the Knicks, but keeping Smith and Shump around would have similarly had no tangible long-term benefit.\nThis all adds up to create the portrait of a middling team making middling moves. In this transaction sense, Jackson is not spectacular in any real way. He’s not spectacularly awful or anywhere near good. His record with the Knicks is rather mediocre.\nIt’s the lack of vision that stings. It’s the alienation of Melo. It’s the anachronistic, almost unbelievable bet on Rose and especially Noah. Most importantly, it’s the stunting of Porzingis’s growth.\nIf drafting Porzingis is the best reason to keep Jackson, especially as the Knicks look forward to another lottery pick, then what the Knicks have done to Porzingis in Year 2 is the biggest reason to fire Jackson.\nThe Zen Master, long considered a savant who could coax the most out of his charges with book lists and psychology, has completely lost the team. Maybe he never had them?\nJackson once had incredible credibility among NBA players, but he’s a suit now, not a coach. He isn’t traveling with the team and grinding through practices. He’s not in the proverbial trenches with them. So the challenges he could issue as motivational techniques as a coach just don’t work when he’s the team president.\nTake Jackson’s absurd personality war with his veteran star . Melo doesn’t exactly have the best rep for working with coaches and being pliable, but Porzingis looks up to Anthony in some fashion and it’s only natural that Porzingis would empathize with Melo . You can’t do that with a 21-year-old superstar-in-waiting.\nYet, Jackson has persisted in sniping at Melo, both on the record and probably through his pal Charley Rosen . He valued his own gratification over Porzingis’ development. That’s unforgivable in Jackson’s position. And so, he must go.\nThe main argument against releasing Jackson is that more turnover for a turnstile franchise destroys any semblance of stability. But Jackson has already destroyed that anyway. The other rationale for keeping him is that lottery pick coming just three months away. It’s an important pick, for sure. But do you want the guy who gave Joakim Noah $72 million in the year 2016 anywhere near July 1?\nPhil Jackson knows better than most that success in one aspect of pro basketball does not necessarily translate to success in all aspects. He was a fringe basketball player who became one of the greatest coaches ever. That success as a coach doesn’t guarantee success as a team executive. Perhaps he’ll see reality and make the Knicks’ decision easy by quitting.\nIf not, New York needs to be decisive. Good thing they have an engaged, smart franchise owner — oh wait.
