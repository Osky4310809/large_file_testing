He says the TV character is just like the protagonist in his story -- black, homeless, and named Jesus.\nIn his lawsuit, Solomon says his story ends with his Jesus being kicked out of the house to go live on the streets, and he believes episode 1 of \"Black Jesus\" picks up the tale 15 years later.\nAccording to the docs ... there are other similarities, like the fact TV Black Jesus has a friend who is always trying to get rich quick, just like in the short story. And both Black Jesuses dress the same, curse a lot and drink booze.\nCan we get an Amen?\nSolomon's suing Adult Swim for ripping off his idea ... and wants more than $75 million to make it right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:29:02.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
