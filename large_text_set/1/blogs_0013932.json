It’s not Sanchez’s first public display of frustration in recent weeks, after showing his discontent during their draw with Bournemouth. \nWenger played down the incident: “Looking at the game tonight, that is really minor, minor, minor. media_camera Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez shows his frustration at being substituted for Danny Welbeck. \n“Honestly I didn’t even look. I look at the players coming on. Danny Welbeck has not played for two years, that for me is much more important than an individual response. \n“You have a player, 25 years of age, a regular in the national team and you have an opportunity to bring him on – that is something that is vital. Sanchez doesn't look like a man who is seeing his team leading 0-4 while having scored himself as well. pic.twitter.com/OZqmd8iFgm — Michiel Jongsma (@JongsmaJongsma) January 14, 2017 Alexis Sanchez dejected after getting subbed off at 4-0 up. #AFC pic.twitter.com/5dSv0CWgYR — Premier League Zone (@ThePLZone) January 14, 2017 \n“All players are frustrated when they come off – some show it, some don’t. \n“I just made the decision I feel is right. He’s a good guy, he wants to do well for the team. There is no problem. \n“Some south Americans are different to Europeans. You have to respect that.” \nClearly, the superstar has the competitive edge Arsenal crave, and he wasn’t satisfied with the four goals scored against hapless Swansea, and wanted more. Love how enraged @Alexis_Sanchez always looks when he's subbed. Absolutely spitting blood at Wenger then as he trudged off. #passion #afc — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 14, 2017 Winning 0-4 & @Alexis_Sanchez is THIS angry at being taken off. Love this guy - he's a winner. #afc pic.twitter.com/1LeVXSTyq3 — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 14, 2017 \nBut, while it might reflect his ‘winning mentality’, his public displays of frustration are cause for concern for Arsenal fans, given it has come during the narrative over the contract talks the club is having with him and Mesut Ozil. Despite the distraction, Sanchez, who has 21 goals and 10 assists in his last 32 games for the club, remains indispensible and, even if frustrated at times, clearly still emotionally invested.

The Englishman -- lured from being Carlo Ancelotti’s assistant at Bayern Munich to replace Bob Bradley -- saw his side capitulate in a second half that was totally one-sided. media_camera Alex Iwobi of Arsenal (L) celebrates his sides third goal with Mesut Ozil \nThey put up more of a fight in the first-half and could have gone in front in the 10th minute when Petr Cech was called upon to push aside a firm strike from Naughton. \nThree minutes later, Gylfi Sigurdsson was inches over with a shot from 20 yards after Wayne Routledge had opened up the Arsenal defence. \nIt took Arsenal 27 minutes to muster any kind of chance. Even then, it was a shot from distance from Sanchez that Lukasz Fabianski saved comfortably at the foot of his near post. \nSwansea, who responded well to the continual prompting of Clement from the touchline, got numbers around the ball and made life increasingly difficult for the visitors. \nBut then, just as Arsenal appeared to be heading towards an interval dressing down, they struck through Giroud, in the 37th minute. \nThe most sublime of moves involving Mesut Ozil, Giroud and Aaron Ramsey created the platform and when Ozil was denied with a tame header, from a Sanchez cross, Giroud pounced to convert from four yards. \nTwo minutes before the break, Swansea thought they had earned themselves a penalty when Ki Sung-yueng appeared to be tripped by Laurent Koscielny after Fernando Llorente’s delightful touch had opened up the Arsenal defence. \nReferee Mike Jones marched up to Ki, booked the South Korean for what he felt was a dive and duly awarded Arsenal a free kick. \nArsenal began the second half at a decent pace and both Sanchez and Alex Iwobi had opportunities to score before Ramsey was denied by a desperate save, with his feet, by Fabianski. \nThe goal did come, however, when Iwobi’s shot looped off Cork and into the back of Fabianski’s net. \nWithout any genuine threat at the opposite end, Swansea were never likely to find a way back into the game. \nRoutledge did have a shot saved by Cech, on the hour, but there was precious little else over which to enthuse as Arsenal strolled to victory. \nA third followed 13 minutes later -- Naughton turning in Iwobi’s cross -- and soon afterwards it was four. \nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain nipped in behind, in the 74th minute, and though Routledge got his foot on the winger’s cross, the ball popped up to Sanchez who scored from eight yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:50:34.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
