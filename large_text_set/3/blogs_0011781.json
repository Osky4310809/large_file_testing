According to Mama June's estranged daughter, Anna \"Chickadee\" Cardwell , the former Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star's weight loss was motivated by fame. \"I think she did it just to be more famous,\" Anna told E! News . \"I don't think she did it just for her because she never mentioned anything ever before about getting plastic surgery.\" WATCH: Mama June Flaunts Slim 'Hourglass Figure' as She Continues Intense Weight Loss Transformation Mama June, however, has said she was planning to undergo plastic surgery whether it was part of a reality series or not. \"With or without cameras, I was going to do this journey no matter what,\" the 37-year-old mother of four recently told iHeartRadio's The Domenick Nati Show. And she had to pay the hefty price \"just like everybody else.\" For gastric sleeve surgery, a breast lift, a tummy tuck, and skin removal surgery on the arms and neck, it's estimated that Mama June could have paid upwards of $50,000.
