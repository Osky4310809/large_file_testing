A mother gives her toddler three homeopathic pills to relieve her teething pain.

Agency records show eight cases in which babies were reported to have died after taking Hyland’s products, though the FDA says the question of whether those products caused the deaths is still under review.\n(The agency is also investigating two other deaths tied to teething remedies but declined to confirm the manufacturer of the products or provide the case reports.)\nFollowing Read More … \nSource:: Future of You \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T16:17:20.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
