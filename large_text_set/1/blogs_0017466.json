Last year, Suicide Squad was released, and we could not stop talking about Jared Leto’s turn as the weird, creepy Joker. Now, Jared Leto announced his possible return as The Joker with some very cryptic Snapchats. While Suicide Squad made a total of almost $750 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo , we haven’t heard much official news about the cast of quirky, violent characters returning. Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn will be getting her own movie, because she’s awesome. However, other than that, no real details have been finalized. But we all assumed we’d be seeing Jared’s Joker again, and now it seems like he has confirmed that.\nJared Leto released these two cryptic images on Snapchat that might just confirm The Joker’s return. Jared Leto just shared these photos on Snapchat. What does it all mean?! pic.twitter.com/BkZUmpFqZQ \n— Batman-News.com (@BatmanNewsCom) January 18, 2017 The first image shows an illustration from Batman: The Killing Joke graphic novel, featuring The Joker looking through a camera. The second picture features a super creepy tooth necklace. Some speculate that The Joker might appear in the upcoming Gotham City Sirens movie. But with the big expansion of the DC movie universe, there are lots of options for a Joker cameo. But it’s clear Jared didn’t want to give away too many secrets.\nWe guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Knowing The Joker, his return will definitely be something pretty memorable. And pretty awesomely creepy.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T03:03:54.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
