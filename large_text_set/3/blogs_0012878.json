He’s a loser,” Bisping said. “We know that.” \nAs far as any real matchups for Romero while he’s waiting on the sidelines as Bisping prepares for a showdown with Georges St-Pierre later this year, the champion actually suggested a fight with Luke Rockhold as a possibility. \nRockhold has been rather vocal lately about his desire to earn a rematch with Bisping one day, but the champion likes the idea of him taking on Romero in the mean time. \n“They can fight each other. Luke versus Yoel. Do it,” Bisping said. \nJust to be even against his adversaries, Bisping did manage to also pull out a Rockhold impersonation during the same segment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T05:11:52.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
