-- at a time like this, and it is fortunate that the Proteas are playing a limited, increasingly demoralised Sri Lankan outfit: frankly, there’s a case for saying they might be able to wrap up the series spoils even if they fielded only 10 men from here to the finish of the five-match roster. \nNational coach Russell Domingo was animated a few weeks ago in his anger and regret over Rossouw’s decision to quite suddenly pull the plug, saying that he was being groomed as some sort of left-handed equivalent to AB de Villiers for pure explosiveness at the crease. \nIt so happens that Rossouw had a menacingly swelling reputation for relishing limited-overs combat at the Wanderers, too. \nIn two ODIs at the venue thus far, the unusually crisp striker had amassed 203 runs at an average of 101.50, and as “Pink Day” is revisited at the Wanderers on Saturday, it is worth recalling that the first knock came in the equivalent, charity-driven fixture of January 2015. \nOn that occasion, South Africa lashed the second highest ODI total of all time – that mark still stands – as they posted 439 for two, Rossouw reaching his maiden century in the format (128 off 115 deliveries). \nHe was remarkably eclipsed in weight-of-runs terms by both Hashim Amla (153 not out) and De Villiers, who played the innings of his international life to this point with 149 off a dazzling, almost ridiculous 44 balls. \nBut Rossouw was back in commanding mode in the Bullring in what turned out to be his last Johannesburg ODI earlier this season, scoring 75 against the visiting, slaughtered Australians. \nThe one thing you have to acknowledge about Behardien is that he is a different cricketing beast to Rossouw, so a direct comparison is just a little unfair. \nThe former is much more of a “nudger” and strike-rotator; a good enough man to have towards the finish of an ODI innings by the Proteas if an established, more senior stroke-player is still at the crease. \nHe is also capable, as evidenced from certain Twenty20 knocks, of accelerating spiritedly himself and finding the boundary a lot during “death” overs, and is a committed and nippy fielder to add to his occasional bowling possibilities. \nYet the question undoubtedly remains: does Behardien really justify a place in an ODI top six? \nStatistically, measuring him up against someone like Rossouw is something of a no-contest: Behardien has 948 runs at 30.58 from his 51 games, and Rossouw 1,239 runs at 38.71 from considerably fewer appearances (36). \nWhereas Rossouw has achieved three centuries – including in his last ODI against the Aussies at Newlands – Behardien sports a top score of 70. \nAdmittedly, the man from Bloemfontein has tended to have better opportunities to get properly stuck in, having been employed in most berths within the top six, including opener. \nBehardien also doesn’t stand back to Rossouw for strike rate: his is actually a fraction superior at 95.46, to 94.36. \nBut the 33-year-old is effectively “on trial” once again if he is recalled to the middle order on Saturday, and then a bit beyond. \nAt least he is well used to that phenomenon... \n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T13:21:09.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
