Yet the media’s framing of events eschews basic facts – the actual content of the leaks - in favor of screaming “thief” at the top of its lungs.\nAnd so the following 200-word summary is presented as an antidote to the establishment’s clumsy post-election messaging ...\n\nSomeone delivers exact copies of emails written by Democratic Party mandarins into the public record. These messages are subsequently posted online . Thank you WikiLeaks!\n\nSeveral email threads demonstrate that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) secretly ganged up on Bernie Sanders to undermine his campaign.\n\nHillary Clinton, who made over a hundred million in speaking fees with her husband, furtively reassures American oligarchs that her “ private position ” on economic issues won’t threaten their bottom line . In one related email which highlights big money in politics, a wealthy donor jokes “I guess it takes a study to point out the obvious.”\n\nVoters learn that the DNC leveraged its extensive contacts with the media to manipulate coverage in an effort to elevate Trump . The DNC’s strategy document includes a list of Republican “Pied Pipers” which the media was told to “take seriously.”\n\nThe Democratic elites become desperate. Rather than accept their party’s role in Trump’s victory and their betrayal of the working class , they decide to blame Russian Hackers .\n\nThe Washington Post hyperventilates about Russian Hackers “penetrating” a utility in Vermont. The headline is exposed as a shameless distortion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T02:06:23.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
