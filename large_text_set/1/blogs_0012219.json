The first of which being the release of a music video for his song “Acid Test,” which was premiered through Zane Lowe World Record’s in 2016.\nIn keeping with the spirit of the song’s complex soundscape and Tiber’s richly emotive voice, the music video is a riot of color and texture. Tiber also got quite the vacation out of the deal – everything was shot on location in Morocco. The artist made it a point to find colorful tile work, ancient architecture and the occasional sunny scenes of life which he juxtaposed against contemplative shots of himself lounging poolside and against the backdrop of the city.\nTiber also announced that he will be the opening act for D.R.A.M. whose single “Broccoli” made huge waves in 2016.
