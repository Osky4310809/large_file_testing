Women get their nails done at the Whitechapel Mission in east London \nMs Mohammadian-Molinasaid said it was “priceless” to watch the women “forget about their individual issues for a few hours and just enjoy themselves” and “to see them smile and feel happy.” \nShe told the Standard: “Some of the ladies I did a skin cleansing on said to me they’d never had their face cleansed before. \n“One lady couldn’t believe we were using good brands such as Yves Saint Laurent on her. She clearly recognised the brand but it says a lot about her self-worth that she almost thought the brand was too good for her.” A lady gets her makeup done at Whitechapel Mission \nMs Mohammadian-Molina said personal experience had convinced her of the power of makeup and looking good. \nShe said: “I grew up in Iran in the eighties and nineties when women could not wear a hint of makeup. \n“Then I moved to Britain and started working for an investment bank which was a very male-dominated environment. \n“I quickly realised I felt empowered and capable when I looked good. Makeup made me feel like I could get up and achieve.” A woman has her hair straightened \nShe added: “I hope for these women feeling good about their appearance could be the first step towards believing in themselves and their ability to change their lives, to get back into society.” \nTony Miller, director of Whitechapel Mission, welcomed the initiative and said he hoped it could become a regular event. \nHe told the Standard: “We need to raise these women’s self-esteem to try and get them to understand their true value. Roxana Mohammadiam-Molina poses with one of the women after her makeover \n“We want to say ‘girls you’re worth more than this and we want you to understand that.’ \n“Something as daft as sitting and talking while someone does someone’s nails can make the biggest difference to somebody who has never had that experience before. It’s an intimate thing. \n“As a charity we're often asked about positive results but sometimes it’s just about acknowledging that someone is a person and has value.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T11:58:21.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
