While LaVine declined his invitation, Aaron Gordon will be returning after last year’s spectacular performance, along with Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, Spurs guard Jonathon Simmons , Pacers guard Glenn Robinson III , and Phoenix Suns rookie Derrick Jones. \nThe Slam Dunk Contest is the showcase event of All-Star Saturday night, which begins on Feb. 18 at 8 p.m. on TNT. The Slam Dunk Contest usually begins around 10 p.m. LaVine is the two-time defending champion after also emerging victorious in Brooklyn in 2015, so we are guaranteed to have a new dunk king. Gordon returns for the second time, while the other participants will all be making their debuts in the event.\nLet’s meet them.\nAaron Gordon Gordon will return to avenge his second-place finish last year in one of the best contests of all time. Gordon will be sure to provide plenty of entertainment for fans after what we saw last year and will easily be the favorite heading into the contest. \nHe’s in-game dunks this year give us high hopes for a repeat performance.\nDeAndre Jordan We’ve been watching DeAndre Jordan throw down ridiculous in-game dunks for years but we’ve never seen him in the actual Dunk Contest. It’s not clear what he’ll be able to pull off in the contest but we’re excited to see him give it a try.\nIt’s turning out to be a big weekend for Jordan as he’s also making his first All-Star Game appearance ever in New Orleans as well. He had to cancel a trip to Hawaii as he was not planning on quite a weekend but we’re excited to see more of this.\nJonathon Simmons Simmons will make his first debut in the Dunk Contest this year. Simmons went undrafted, but played with the Spurs’ Summer League team for two years, which led him to his two-year contract with the team. The dunk that put Simmons on the map was this monster over Javale McGee on the opening night of this season.\nGlenn Robinson III “Lil Dog” as they call him, son of “Big Dog” Glenn Robinson, will make his first appearance this year in the Dunk Contest. Robinson has started 24 games this season for the Indiana Pacers, and while he’s only averaging 7.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, he has no problem throwing one down.\nDerrick Jones Jones may be the least well known name of bunch. He’s only played eight total minutes for the Phoenix Suns this year as a rookie but has had no problem showing off in the D-League with the Northern Arizona Suns. Jones may be the underdog in the competition going in, but he could really do some special things.\nLaVine might not be in the dunk contest, but he’s not the only one who can pull off foul line theatrics.\nThe Dunk Contest will take place during All-Star Saturday night on February 18th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:47:57.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
