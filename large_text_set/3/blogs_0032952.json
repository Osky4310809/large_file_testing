President Trump wants to give his friends — and himself — a big tax cut, and force working New Yorkers to pay for it.\" \nIf Trump's tax reform were to move forward, taxes would increase for the 300,000 residents who make $50,000 to $250,000 a year thanks to the plan's higher marginal tax rates and elimination of personal exemptions, Stringer found in a report released Thursday. \nSingle parents would be at the greatest risk. \n\"A single mother raising two kids on less than $50,000 a year would face a tax increase of $464,\" the report states. \nMillionaires' tax bills on the other hand would decrease by $113,000, not including savings they could realize by the president's corporate tax reform, the Comptroller's findings show. \nThose making less than $50,000 would only save only a couple of hundred dollars and still face the loss of New York City Services. \nTo make the tax proposal work, at least $400 million in city programs would be cut — including funding to support code enforcement activities, family homeless shelter operations, adult literacy programs, low-income heating programs, grants for hiring more effective teachers and principals in public schools, rental assistance programs. \nMore than $2 trillion in federal funds would need to be slashed, which would affect Homeland Security Grants that support NYPD counter-terrorism, funding to public housing and Section 8 rental vouchers, and public housing capital funding, the report states. \nStringer said that if President Trump moves forward with the plan it will take New York \"backwards.\" \n“Embracing ‘trickle-down’ has never helped working families move up the economic ladder — it’s a sleight-of-hand that helps America’s wealthiest,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:01:48.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
