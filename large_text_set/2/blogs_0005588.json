Nicola Sturgeon refused to rule out a second independence referendum at First Minister's Questions Credit: PA \nS enior Nationalists have suggested that Scotland could negotiate a deal with Brussels to remain inside the EU if it voted for independence before the UK leaves in 2019. \nBut Ms Minor, the Head of Representation of the European Commission in the UK, said Mr Juncker had made clear there would be no further EU “enlargements” during his term in office “so that takes you to 2020”. \n“There are a number of official candidate countries – Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, Herzegovina – they are still quite some way away from meeting the criteria for membership. And obviously were Scotland to become independent they would join that list,” she said. \nShe acknowledged that Scotland “might” be able to gain membership quicker than the others as its laws already comply with EU rules but rejected Nationalist claims that it could seamlessly stay inside the European Union. \nMs Minor said that was not the European Commission’s opinion during the 2014 independence referendum and nothing had changed since. She said Scotland would instead have to apply from scratch under Article 49 of the Lisbon Treaty, a process that can take many years. \n“Normal practice” is for new member states is to commit to joining the euro, she said, although she noted there could be “quite a lengthy period of transition to that status”. \nThe most recent Scottish Government figures showed Scotland has a public spending deficit of 9.5 per cent of its GDP, compared to four per cent for the UK a whole and 7.2 per cent for Greece, which has been forced by the EU to impose extreme austerity. \nMs Minor, who is stepping down from her post in the next few weeks, said Scotland would be forced to “come forward with plans” on how it intended to reduce this huge financial black hole.

For all its moaning about Brexit, it knows fine well an independent Scotland would not simply step into the European Union. \n“It's time for the nationalists to be honest about Brexit, and stop using it as a tool to agitate for separation.” \nLewis Macdonald, Scottish Labour’s Europe spokesman, said: “This is a hugely significant intervention from an experienced and respected official. \n“Now it's time for the SNP to be honest with voters - an independent Scotland would have to join the queue. Independence would mean leaving our biggest trading partner, committing to the euro, and even deeper austerity.” \nBut an SNP spokesman said Ms Minor had “demolished many of the bogus arguments used by the No campaign in 2014 around EU membership.” \nHe added: “We are focussed on protecting Scotland from the catastrophic effects of a hard Tory Brexit which would cost 80,000 jobs in Scotland over the next decade.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:06:51.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
