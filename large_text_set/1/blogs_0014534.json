In the late ’90s, the professional boxer jumped on board Team Canibus in the rapper’s feud against LL Cool J. \nTyson even appeared on Canibus’“Second Round K.O.” record for a little trash-talking. \nDespite the release of Mike Tyson’s “If You Show Up,” added details on the match between Soulja Boy and Chris Brown have not been revealed.
