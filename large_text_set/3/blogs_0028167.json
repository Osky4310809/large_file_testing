Buga (crew chief Mike Bugarewicz) and all these guys mean business.” \nMore than anything, though, it’s another indicator that after two years in NASCAR’s equivalent of purgatory, Bowyer is a contender to win and compete for a title again. \n“It’s a confidence thing right now, a momentum-builder and we’re getting closer,” said Bowyer of his finish. “Obviously, this is a good track for me. I wanted to win that damn thing, but to come home with the wild finish and everything that it was, we’ll take it.” \nAsked if he saw this coming, Bowyer affirmed that he did. \n“Hell, yeah. It better be coming,” he said. “When you’ve got a team like this that’s organized and as good as they are, it better be.” \nAnd when you run well, no question, life looks better. \n“I’m just having fun again,” Bowyer said, as if there was any doubt about it. “That’s what it’s about.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:28:11.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
