He has beaten Tennessee five times in a row as a head coach, with his fifth win coming in October of this past season. He has also coached three different schools in three years to Birmingham Bowls with Florida in 2014, Auburn in 2015, and most recently South Carolina, in December.\nNow, we’ve got another weird, but true coincidence regarding Muschamp in his last three stops — in all three of his last coaching gigs, his team’s rival has won the national title while he’s been there. No, really! It’s true:\nFlorida: Head coach, 2011-14: During the 2013 season, Florida was coming off its worst season since its 0-10-1 year in 1979 in Muschamp’s third year. That year, Florida State beat Auburn in the BCS National Championship to win the national title.\nAuburn: Defensive coordinator, 2015: No, Muschamp wasn’t a head coach in his season-long stint with the Tigers, but this still counts! In 2015, the Alabama Crimson Tide won the national title by beating the Clemson Tigers, 45-40.\nSouth Carolina: Head coach, 2015-Present: South Carolina named Muschamp its next head coach last December, and he led the Gamecocks to a 6-7 mark in his first season in Columbia. Clemson, South Carolina’s biggest rival, just won the national championship with a win over No. 1 Alabama on Monday night.\nBless you, Coach Boom. Keep on keepin’ on with these ridiculously ironic and pretty funny streaks you’ve compiled for yourself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T05:08:48.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
