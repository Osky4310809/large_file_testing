Love, love, love, until your heart explodes from passion and happiness.\nNo one tells you that you will choose your travels over that person; and that days, weeks, and maybe years after, you’ll still ache from their absence.\nNo one says anything about that feeling of misery and emptiness that takes hold of your heart, and doesn’t leave you for a long time.\nNo one tells you that you’ll be waking up thinking about them, that you’ll be dreaming about them in your sleep. No one says anything about how you’ll be at work, and then suddenly, your mind would wander away, and start imagining what could have happened if you gave that tiny spark the chance to turn into something deeper.\nNo one tells you that one day, you’ll be having a late night conversation with that person on the rooftop of a hostel, talking and laughing together, but still not saying the important things. Your eyes will be having their own secret conversation, and you’ll be talking about everything, anything, just to have a few more moments with them before going to sleep.\nNo one says how much it hurts every time their name pops up in your head, or you see something they posted on Facebook.\nNo one tells you how sad you will be, thinking about the thousands and thousands of miles between the two of you; and maybe they forgot about you, and maybe they found someone new, and maybe it was all in your head, and all that chemistry you felt, and that banter you had, was just them being friendly.\nAnd maybe now you’re just a fleeting memory in their mind, maybe they don’t even remember your name, or the color of your eyes.\nMaybe for them, you’re that girl or that boy that they met back when they were traveling an unknown country, that exotic distraction they were looking for during those days.\nYour head is full of “maybes” and “what ifs”, because you never had the guts to hold that hand, or give that kiss, or say those words, the ones that would have changed everything.\nAnd maybe now, after all this happened, you’ll go to a new city, and meet a new person that makes your heart flutter.\nAnd maybe that time, you’ll be braver. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:01:59.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
