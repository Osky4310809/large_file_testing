That’s what happened. The NFL admitted they had no evidence on him.”\nEarlier this week, Goodell went on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” radio show and said potentially handing Brady a fifth Lombardi trophy would be “an honor.”\nBrady Sr. agreed and added a shot at the commissioner while doing so.\n“It should be an honor because somebody that has Roger Goodell’s ethics doesn’t belong on any stage that Tom Brady is on,” Brady Sr. said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T03:39:30.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
