Despite only playing 45 minutes, Ozyakup still managed to complete the second highest number of passes (61) after Atiba Hutchinson (69). \nArsenal scout Jurgen Kost confirmed that the Gunners are monitoring Ozyakup and could consider making a move for him in the future. \n\"Ozyakup is a player of the highest standard, we have been closely tracking his progress and when we do our next search for players in his position he could return to Arsenal,\" Kost was quoted as saying by Turkish-Football . Oguzhan Ozyakup came through the youth ranks at Arsenal. \nOzyakup left Arsenal for Besiktas in 2012 for €500,000 in search of first-team football and is currently a key player for the Turkish side, playing an important role in their Super Lig title win last season. \nOzyakup has amassed 25 goals and 37 assists for Besiktas over the course of 169 appearances in all competitions. \nLa Liga outfit Sevilla have also been linked with Ozyakup recently and were reported to have made an offer last summer. \nThe central midfielder has just over a year left on his contract and Besiktas reportedly value him at €15 million. \nBesiktas are currently first in the Super Lig, two points ahead of second-placed Basaksehir. They take on Olympiakos on Thursday in the return leg of their Europa League tie. \nEren Sarigul covers Turkish football for ESPN and Turkish-football.com.
