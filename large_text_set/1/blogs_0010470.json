Those documents couldn’t be verified by any major media outlet, The U.K. Guardian reported. \nHowever, that didn’t stop listicle kings BuzzFeed News from publishing the unredacted documents on Tuesday, “so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the U.S. government.” \nKeep in mind that BuzzFeed also admitted that the documents were “unverified and potentially unverifiable” and also contained glaring errors. And the documents also weren’t just minor things, either. I absolutely refuse to reprint the accusations made against Trump in the documents, except to say that they go beyond disgusting.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 \nIt’s worth pointing out that for a news outlet that talked so much about “fake news” during the aftermath of Trump’s election, CNN seems entirely willing to air it themselves.
