Private investors welcome secure and long term investments in energy infrastructure but only if, and it's a big if, government changes its approach and really thinks long term.” \nDr Simon Harrison, chair of the Institution of Engineering and Technology’s energy panel, said: “Although it may seem relatively expensive at first, it’s important to remember that this is a pathfinder project which, when applied at greater scale in other locations, promises long term cost competitive and predictable renewable energy, and a potentially exportable technology. \n“This has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the electricity system as we move more to a smart system where consumers will be able to respond to price signals by adjusting the timing of some of their demand, such as when they charge their electric car. \n“Tidal lagoons are large and complex construction projects, but if Swansea Bay performs well we might expect to see large scale contributions to the UK’s electricity from tidal sources by the late 2020s or 2030s.” \nAnd Dr Athanasios Angeloudis, also of Imperial College London, said the UK was \"blessed with some of the largest tidal energy resources in the world\". \n\"This outcome should be seen as a landmark step towards making the first significant contribution to the national electricity mix from this sustainable energy source,\" he said. \nA recent study by Aurora Energy Research found that tidal power schemes could provide more than 10 per cent of UK’s total power generation by 2030, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. 10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn't believe in climate change 10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn't believe in climate change 1/11 \nA group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, Antarctica Kira Morris 2/11 \nAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable places in the world to sea level rise, which is expected to make tens of millions of people homeless by 2050. Probal Rashid 3/11 \nHanna Petursdottir examines a cave inside the Svinafellsjokull glacier in Iceland, which she said had been growing rapidly. Since 2000, the size of glaciers on Iceland has reduced by 12 per cent. Tom Schifanella 4/11 \nFloods destroyed eight bridges and ruined crops such as wheat, maize and peas in the Karimabad valley in northern Pakistan, a mountainous region with many glaciers. In many parts of the world, glaciers have been in retreat, creating dangerously large lakes that can cause devastating flooding when the banks break. Climate change can also increase rainfall in some areas, while bringing drought to others.

Abrar Hossain 7/11 \nSindh province in Pakistan has experienced a grim mix of two consequences of climate change. “Because of climate change either we have floods or not enough water to irrigate our crop and feed our animals,” says the photographer. “Picture clearly indicates that the extreme drought makes wide cracks in clay. Crops are very difficult to grow.” Rizwan Dharejo 8/11 \nA shepherd moves his herd as he looks for green pasture near the village of Sirohi in Rajasthan, northern India.

The World Health Organisation has warned such pollution, much of which is from the fossil fuels that cause climate change, is a “public health emergency”. Leung Ka Wa 10/11 \nWater levels in reservoirs, like this one in Gers, France, have been getting perilously low in areas across the world affected by drought, forcing authorities to introduce water restrictions.

Majed Noumi \nGreenpeace UK's chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, urged the UK Government to \"get on with it\". \nThe Swansea Bay project was a chance to \"lead the world in providing a new, renewable innovation to meet our clean energy needs\", he said. \n\"If Swansea is successful it could prove the investment case for further major projects that could potentially generate a significant chunk of the UK's electricity needs, and help towards meeting our carbon targets, whilst creating thousands of new infrastructure jobs too,\" Dr Parr added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T13:02:54.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
