An innocent birdwatching segment took a turn for the worse (Photo: ITV) Ben couldn't stop giggling (Photo: ITV) \nPhotos of various bird varieties to watch out for then flashed up on screen, prompting Ben to say: “That’s a little Blue tit, isn’t it?” \nWhen corrected that it was actually a Great tit, he said: “That’s the Great tit? They all look like Great tits to me. I don’t know them very well…” \nHis quip was enough to set viewers off and they took to social media in droves to thank Ben for the chuckle and assure him they would indeed be looking out for Great tits this weekend. Viewers said Ben had made them chuckle with his joke (Photo: ITV) \nOne joked: “I will also be \"bird\" watching this weekend! And like you said, looking for \"great tits\" as well!” \nAnother said: “What's wrong with you this morning lol. I know what you are thinking lol. You naughty boy.” \nA third said: “Ben your such a cheeky chap & you make me laugh on this cold morning (sic).\" \nAnother viewer simply said: \"Naughty Ben...funny though.\" Kate Garraway says Ben gets naughtier as the week goes on (Photo: ITV) \nBen broke down in giggles after the comment, leaving co-hosts Charlotte Hawkins and Kate Garraway smiling. \nKate told Charlotte: “You don’t normally experience this. basically Ben’s mischievous goes up exponentially during the week. He’s about 60 per cent sensible on Monday, and now it’s 110 per cent naughty.” \n*GMB returns to ITV on Monday at 6am Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T10:36:26.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
