On Sunday, during the Oscar Awards ceremony, a special mention of Om Puri was madeas an ode to his remarkable contribution to cinema. He was featured in its special segment ‘In Memoriam', among the other gems that the world lost in the last one year. This was a moment of great pride forevery Indian, and many people, even Bollywood celebs, expressed their happy feelings on Twitter. \nThere was someone, however, who did not feel so good about the incident. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, the Gangs of Wasseypur star, really appreciated what happened at the Oscars but at the same time felt sorry for the fact that none of our own award ceremonies even made a mention of the late actor. @TheAcademy #Oscars paid homage 2 late #OmPuri , But in #bollywood award functions nobody converse single word for his contribution... SHAME — Nawazuddin Siddiqui (@Nawazuddin_S) February 27, 2017 \nMr. Puri, who died on January at the age of 66, was popular internationally because he was a part of movies like East Is East, Gandhi, City of Joy , and Wolf , which were also some of his great performances. His family too came forward, and expressed their gratitude for the Academy's gesture. In a statement, they said, \"The only Indian actor to have worked consistently in Hollywood and British cinema for the last 25 years without a fuss, and letting his work speak for itself, today the Academy of Motion Pictures acknowledged his contribution at its 89th Awards. The first and only Indian actor to be acknowledged thus. Thank you Academy. Thank you everyone. We miss you Om. We miss you lots. Ishaan and Nandita Puri.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:29:59.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
