The statement today (10 days into Trump’s presidency) makes it clear Obama rejects religious discrimination and supports the nationwide protests going on. \nFox’s Neil Cavuto questioned how quickly Obama got into the fray, wondering if whether this is more about his passion for the issues or about being opportunistic. \nPresidential historian Doug Wead said you would have to go back over 80 years to find precedent for the quickness of Obama’s criticism. George W. Bush avoided weighing in on politics while Obama was in office, and Bill Clinton was not very vocal during Bush’s first term. \nWead told Cavuto it would have been more dignified for Obama not to say anything. \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:36:14.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
