A matte black OnePlus 3T.\nThe startup phone maker announced on Wednesday plans to sell a \"Midnight Black\" version of its flagship OnePlus 3T. \nSEE ALSO: OnePlus 3T is a better version of the best sleeper Android phone of the year \nAs part of a limited run, the Midnight Black version of the OnePlus 3T will only be available with 128GB storage for the standard $480 price tag. OnePlus hasn't announced a firm release date, but says it'll be revealed at a later date. \nAesthetic-wise, it's identical to the special Colette edition — sans logo, of course — that was announced last week.\nInternally, the phone's still the same great, affordable, premium Android phone we reviewed last year. Heck, we'd argue it's even better since the phone got updated to Android 7.0 Nougat earlier this year.\nThe OnePlus 3T's still got a large and crisp 5.5-inch full HD display, Snapdragon 821 processor, 6GB of RAM, 3400 mAh battery, and great 16-megapixel front and back cameras. The fingerprint sensor's still excellent, and locking up apps with the App Locker is still super useful.\nBut enough with the yapping.
