The couple purchased the property in 2012 for a reported $26.5 million .\nThe stunning 10,000-square-foot home, known as the “The Villla,” was built in 1930 and sits on just under 17 acres with breathtaking views over the Pacific and surrounding mountains. DeGeneres, who’s developed a reputation as a real estate mogul, buying, renovating and selling numerous houses in Southern California over the last 25 years, spoke to Sotheby’s about what charmed her about the historical estate.\n“The house is always surprising. It reveals itself to you in new ways every day,” she says. “It’s not overly manicured or tidy. It’s not overly precious or perfect. And it’s a home that manages to be both spacious and cozy at once.”\nThe main house includes six bedrooms, nine fireplaces, and an 800-square-foot living room. Outside, the grounds feature a swimming pool, sunken tennis court, classic fountains, and a stately guest house called Jordan Hall — a new addition to the property built by DeGeneres.\n“The surrounding gardens and olive trees are almost as wonderful as the interior,” the comedian tells Sotheby’s. “The house truly feels like it was built out of the landscape, rather than plopped on a plot. It feels ancient, like it’s been there forever. Like that hill was never without the house. This is a home that honors nature, and I love that.” \nLike all her homes, DeGeneres was deeply involved in the restoration and decoration of the stately 1930 property. “If you think of your home as a canvas – regardless of its style of architecture – you can put anything on it,” she says, adding, “I tend to keep painting the painting until it’s so done, there’s nothing left to do. That’s when I sell the canvas and buy a new one.”\nRELATED: There’s Nothing Funny About How Much We Love Ellen DeGeneres’ New Home Decor Lines \nDeGeneres released a book, Home, in 2015, which highlights several of her real estate conquests including the Villa. She’s also hosted an HGTV show, Ellen’s Design Challenge, and released several decor collections, including her own ED range, and new lines of rugs, furniture and dinnerware with collaborators.
