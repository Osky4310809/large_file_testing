The hand-drawn mode slims down jawlines, enlarges eyes, and adds a little bit of sparkle to the whole package. \nBasically, it makes you look like a cartoon — and it's these images that are rapidly spreading on social media. \nThe company behind the app IPOed in Hong Kong in December with a roughly $4.6 billion valuation — which may increase as investors learn that Western audiences like the app too. \nHere's what using the app is like: This is what a fully doctored Meitu photo looks like. I added a \"hand-drawn\" filter, increased the blur, and added stickers. Kif Leswing Here's how to get there. First, boot up the app. First impression: although this app is available in English, it's really targeted towards Asian consumers — specifically, women. But don't worry, all kinds of people can enjoy it. Meitu After taking a photo with your front-facing camera, you can add Instagram-style filters. These won't transform your photo, but will change a few things. Here's the \"youthful\" filter. BI You can adjust the amount of airbrushing or effects for any filter. BI But the real fun starts when you start applying hand-drawn filters. Here's \"Angelic.\" BI \nThat's not what I look like! I liked the Chinese New Year option! BI People have already started to use the app to transform Donald Trump. \nAnother fun game is to run your photo through the hand-drawn filter until it no longer looks like a person. \nIt's available for both iPhones and Android devices. \nDownload from the iTunes App Store here . Download from Google Play here . But I eventually settled on Baroness, which gives your selfies kind of a goth look.
