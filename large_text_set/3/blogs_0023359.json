By Wesley Yin-Poole Published 22/03/2017 \nWarhammer Quest 2 launches on iOS and Android devices autumn 2017. \nThe turn-based strategy sequel is developed by Perchang, the new company founded by Ben Murch. Murch used to work at Warhammer Quest 1 developer Rodeo before it stopped making games. \nWarhammer Quest 2: The End Times features Chaos. Here's the official blurb: A cataclysm was prophesied to bring about the end of the Old World. Now the forces of Chaos have begun their final assault and the last stand is coming. Characters from all races and lands are venturing forth. Sworn enemies standing shoulder to shoulder fighting the daemons of the apocalypse. Proud warriors search for powerful artefacts to aid their lords in the coming war. Sorcerers toil for untold power, while Witch Hunters seek to settle long held scores. Dark Elf Assassins fill ledgers in blood and berserk Dwarf Slayers topple the mightiest of foes. These are the days of action and adventure. These are The End Times. \nI quite liked Warhammer Quest, and must have pumped around 20 hours into it on my phone, so I'm pretty excited for the sequel. Based on the screenshots, it looks like Warhammer Quest 2 will continue the grim dark aesthetic started by its predecessor. Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.
