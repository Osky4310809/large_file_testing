She is (expletive) amazing at her job and she deserves credit.\" \nShe wondered, do Fox News pundits have a point when they argue that if Conway had pulled that off for a Democratic candidate, we'd \"be seeing her on the cover of Vogue ?\" \n\"Oh my god, you guys, it's so unfair: A woman pulls off the historic feat of electing a sexual predator who thinks women should be punished for abortions and feminists don't celebrate her with a Vogue cover?!?\" \nBee also saluted Conway's performance on TV (\"We haven't seen a blonde do this much spinning and lying since Tonya Harding\"), deflect questions \"like Wonder Woman dodging bullets\" and her powers of verbal \"jujitsu\" that allow her to redefine the now ubiquitous term \"fake news\" to mean any news that is unfavorable to her boss. \nIn fact, Bee affirms Conway is so good at those things that after his refusal to take a question from CNN at his press conference last week, she wondered why Donald Trump hasn't learned anything about deflecting inquiries from his mistress of spin. \n\"Smile, take the question, don't answer it, complain about Hillary Clinton,\" Bee exclaimed. \"It's not a difficult formula!\" \nAnd that prompted the comedian to ask a larger question: \"Why is he president instead of her? Kellyanne is the soulless, Machiavellian despot America deserves!\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jDb9sb Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T20:45:22.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
