She has experienced the harsh reality of the conflict in the Middle East and she is not afraid to tell the truth, without all the political doublespeak and nonsense that so many world leaders and so-called experts pour out to the media. Adina is concerned about the survival of Israel as vile Jew hatred raises its despicable voice throughout the world and the calls for another Holocaust grow louder every day. \nThe Jewish people have maintained a continuous presence in Israel for more than 3200 years and they have been the majority population in Jerusalem since the first recorded census in 1852 CE. Despite thousands of years of Jewish civilization, there are those who would spread the lie that the Jews are European invaders who have no right to live in Israel. They have created a false narrative that claims European Jews exploited the Holocaust to pressure the world into creating Israel; ignoring the fact that Israel existed more than a thousand years before the birth of Mohammad and Jews have been praying “Next Year In Jerusalem” since the Romans burned the Second Temple in 70 CE. They ignore the endless cycle of terrorism and violence against Jews throughout the world and they ignore the refusal of the 56 Islamic nations to recognize Israel as the one Jewish nation. \nSadly, there are Jews in Israel, Europe and the United States who are among the most vocal critics of Israel and they constantly advocate for suicidal, unilateral concessions to the Arab world in the name of peace. The post-Zionist, peace camp in Israel has used millions of dollars donated by hostile foreign governments to fund a destructive media campaign and delegitimize their own nation . Israel is being reduced to pariah status, denied the right to self defense and pressured to make endless concessions to an implacable foe who refuses to even sit down and negotiate. \nAdina Kutnicki wages a daily struggle to make sense of the relentless assault on the legitimacy of Israel. We invited her here today to answer our questions and speak her mind about the nation she loves. So let us begin our interview with a proud Zionist and a daughter of Israel, Adina Kutnicki: \nWolff Bachner: Adina, you were born in the United States and then decided to make Aliyah to Israel and become an Israeli citizen. What inspired you to move to Israel and embrace the Zionist dream of rebuilding the ancient Jewish homeland? \nAdina Kutnicki: Wolff, thank you for inviting me to The Inquisitr . Hopefully, I will be able to shed some desperately needed light on what it means to be a Zionist, and an outspoken, non-apologetic one at that. To be sure, one does not wake up one morning and decide to uproot oneself – especially from a very comfortable life in the U.S. – and live in Israel. \nThat being said, having been raised in a home where the rebirth of Zion was seen as a miracle and a continuation of our Jewish legacy, initiated a lifelong love for the land of Israel, particularly Judea and Samaria; the heartland of our Jewish fore-bearers Upon getting married, it was natural to raise children who would develop the same sense of identity and outright pride. \nIn this regard, it was understood that at some point we, as a family, would make our home in Israel, but not before our sons finished their schooling in the U.S. They both made aliyah at different times during 2007. While the plan was to “follow” them, and in the interim to wind down a thriving corporate tax practice, my beloved husband Frank, z”l (of blessed memory) passed away very suddenly in the beginning of 2008. This meant that I would be making aliyah under much more trying circumstances, to say the least. \nNevertheless, I could think of no better way to honor his memory than to continue with the robust activism I was involved in while living in the U.S. – via op-eds and other measures – now that I have come “home”. He took much pride in every aspect of my efforts, even when it became apparent that “poking the bear” was generating some non-admirers. My work is ongoing, as well as multi-faceted, irrespective of other factors. \nWolff Bachner: How dangerous is life in Israel and how serious is the threat to Israel’s survival from her Arab Neighbors? \nAdina Kutnicki: This is a loaded question, simply because on a daily basis life in Israel is just as normal (and routine) as in any other democratic nation, although the constant presence of IDF soldiers throughout its cities (and thankfully so), in tandem with the inspection of ones bags/cars at various venues, is not exactly “normal”. But the U.S. will surely have to adopt some of these measures, particularly in the aftermath of Boston’s urban jihad. \nBe that as it may, there is no other democracy as imperiled as Israel, simply by dint of the fact that many world actors (in unison with civil society elitists) continually call for its elimination, albeit some are more circumspect than others. As a matter of record, aside from incessant exhortations from the Iranian Hilter – as he calls for Israel’s total obliteration and he means every word of it – as well as non-stop terror attacks from the PA/Fatah/Hamas junta (Israel’s erstwhile “peace” partners), the fact of the matter is that the region is fully primed for a MEGA explosion, even in juxtaposition to its usual upheavals. \nAlas, the current chaos can be traced directly back to Barack HUSSEIN Obama’s indecorous unseating of Hosni Mubarak , Egypt’s strong arm dictator for decades. While hardly a democrat, he understood very well which actors would become unleashed, if the status quo was tampered with. As a result, the much ballyhooed “Arab Spring” turned into an Arab Nightmare, untethering jihadist forces in warp speed. So if blame is to be assigned to the current catastrophe – and it is one – it must start at the Commander-in-Chief’s door, as he shrilly dictated to Mubarak – GO NOW! Concomitantly, as this is being written, Israel’s northern front with Syria , as well as its border with Lebanon, is a tinderbox. Hezbollah’s terror brigades, in concert with Iranian militia forces, are poised to strike at Israel’s Golan. And with Israel barely the size of some counties in the U.S., let alone relative to its states, the notion that “only” one part of Israel is in the cross hairs is patently and dangerously misguided. Absurd too. Extrapolating therein, it is essential to understand the following: the Golan has been quiet for over forty years, but this is no longer the case. Most significantly, now that Al-Qaeda has entered the fray via Libya’s Benghazigate, the fear which deterred Assad from starting another war with Israel is no longer a factor. Desperate to save his regime, he has openly welcomed Russian and Iranian proxies to fight on his behalf. This has tipped the “balance of regional terror”, and its effects will soon play out on Israel’s borders. The readers should internalize, in the middle of all this chaos the Iranian centrifuges keep spinning, as such, the ensuing conflagration suits them well. \nWolff Bachner: In the West, reality is being re-written and the facts of history are being left in the dust. We are now told that the Middle East Conflict is a war over land that began in 1948 when the UN voted to accept Israel as a member nation and the fighting intensified only after Israel reunited Jerusalem during the 1967 war. \nYet, according to an important Islamic Hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari written in 846 CE and considered second in authenticity only to the Qur’an, Mohammed proclaimed, “The Day of Resurrection will not arrive until the Muslims make war against the Jews and kill them, and until a Jew is hiding behind a rock and tree, and the rock and tree will say: ‘Oh Muslim, oh servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him!” This Hadith has been used since the day it was written more than 1150 years ago as permission from Allah and his Prophet Mohammad to enslave and murder Jews with impunity. \nIs the conflict between Israel and the Arab / Muslim world about land or the result of a 1400 year old religious war being waged by Islam against the Jewish people based on the teachings of the Qur’an and the relentless Jew Hate of Islamic doctrine ? \nAdina Kutnicki: You raise the most significant question of all, and tragically the most misunderstood and misconstrued. But it must first be recognized, from the onset, the answers herein are not merely applicable to Israel, but to the entire west. \nThe relentless war waged against Israel has absolutely nothing to do with land per se, and this is precisely why every insane concession, gesture and withdrawal offered by Israel’s (peace-obsessed) leaders has not elicited an expected reciprocal peace gesture, but paradoxically incites to additional jihadist behavior. And in a tangible realm it makes sense for Arabs/Muslims to become hyper-aggressive, particularly after each Israeli capitulation counter intuitively whets their insatiable appetites for more of the same. So as a result of the leadership’s desperate attempt to allay international pressure, thus abating another dangling sword, they have become wedded to peace delusions. A double whammy. Never mind the fact that murderous jihad hasn’t ceased within Israel from time immemorial. But logic escapes many of Israel’s “leading lights”, except for a handful. At the top of the list heralding Israel’s “intellectual warriors” stand Dr. Martin Sherman and Professor Paul Eidelberg . \nIn furtherance to the above question, a core component can be found within a groundbreaking policy paper written by Professor Paul Eidelberg. I had the honor and distinct privilege to participate in its review. Therefore, due to its efficacy, I am providing a link , and it will no doubt answer the heretofore inexplicable: Where is the relentless Jew hatred emanating from?. \nYet the saying, “First the Saturday People, then the Sunday People”, has never been more relevant nor acute, as global jihad swathes across every corner of the world. Essentially, the same religious “holy” war raging against Israel (and by extension to the Jewish people) is meting out against Christians. Their slaughter will continue apace, as long as Islamic overlords hold sway. To wit, it is no longer a question of whether or not there is a clash between civilizations. That ship has sailed. The west is drowning in “infidel” blood, as mandated by Islamic doctrinal Sharia Law. \nWolff Bachner: Who exactly are the Palestinians ? Are they native inhabitants of the region, or as many historians have claimed, are they descendants of invading Muslim armies and the families of guest workers brought into the area as cheap labor in the early 20th century by the British to undermine the rebirth of Israel? \nAdina Kutnicki: If one truly seeks the historical truth, one should keenly listen to what the Arab leadership enjoin when speaking before their own brothers and sisters, as opposed to the taqiyya (Sharia-derived dissimulation) spewed for western ears. Thus, the following is a sampling, but by no means exhaustive: Fathi Hammad, Hamas’s Minister of the Interior and National Security, had this to say, ” Brothers, half of the Palestinians are Egyptians and the other half are Saudis.” Likewise, Zuheir Muhsin, late member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization’s Executive Council, intoned: ” The existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons. The establishment of a Palestinian State is a new tool to continue the fight against Israel.” Similarly, Hussein bin Talal, late King of Jordan, opined,” The appearance of the Palestinian personality comes as an answer to Israel’s claim that Palestine is Jewish.” To be exact, the late, non-lamented Chairman Arafat – the Palestinian godfather of suicide terror, schooled by the KGB, but I digress – was Egyptian-born! Thereby, isn’t it appropriate to posit: Shouldn’t “straight out of the horse’s mouth” proofs be more than enough evidence, to finally put to bed the lies spun on behalf of the Palestinian narrative? Consequently, shouldn’t Israel’s leaders be the first to hammer these historical truths into the world’s consciousness? \nWolff Bachner: Zionism was once the proud hope and dream of millions of exiled Jews. Now, in the revisionist 21st century, people are starting to use the word “Zionist” as a derogatory term and a UN Committee even declared Zionism to be racism. \nWhat exactly is Zionism and why has the world come to look upon Zionism with such contempt? \nAdina Kutnicki: Zionism embodies the authentic longing of Jews to return home to Zion. In its essence, it is the Jewish national movement of rebirth and renewal in the historical birthplace of the Jewish people. And as you pointed out at the onset with the ringing words “Next Year In Jerusalem”, Jerusalem is indeed the epicenter of Zion, as is Judea and Samaria. It is for this reason why wresting these Jewish holy areas away from Israel is a central component to Arab/Muslim jihad. To be sure, once this goal is accomplished, the rest of Israel is completely in their sights. Moreover, when a Jewish couple marries under the chuppah, a core emotion is evinced within these glorious words from Psalm 137: ” If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy…” \nIn conjunction, Israel stands between globalists who prefer to erase all borders, and it is a state which is indeed nationalist at its root. Adding to the cauldron, tiny Israel is perceived as a festering boil to the billion plus Arabs/Muslims who seek her destruction. So it makes perfect sense, under the above template, for the UN (an irredeemably hostile host for anti-Israel bashing) to equate Zionism to racism. It was designed to evoke apartheid-like images, and tragically it has been wildly successful in its bludgeoning. \nWolff Bachner: As I mentioned in my introduction, there is a terrible conflict between the majority of Jews who support Israel and a well funded, highly organized minority of Jews who have worked over time to delegitimize the state of Israel. \nWhy would Jews turn against the one safe haven on earth for the Jewish people and stand with her enemies who have sworn to wipe Israel off the face of the earth? \nJust how serious of a problem is the Post-Zionist movement in Israel and how are they able to get away with behavior that many Jews feel is simply treasonous? \nAdina Kutnicki: First and foremost, the Post-Zionist movement in Israel is replete within every sector where civil society elitists permeate. They burrow deeply inside the political and military hierarchies and their tentacles reach within academia, media, legal, cultural and public diplomacy arenas. Many are leftist ideologues, but some are simply well paid whores, handsomely provided for by various foreign-funded NGO’s, all in order to ply their wares. The New Israel Fund (among others) is a major umbrella front for those who seek to delegitimize Israel as the Jewish national homeland. On the other hand, it is estimated that a very small fraction (approximately 3%) of the Jewish majority public veers to the left. Nevertheless, the majority’s wishes are continually marginalized, and herein lies much of the rancor and push back from nationalist Jews, of which I am immeasurably aligned with. \nAdding to the morass, the fact that Israel has yet to adopt a Constitution (Professor Paul Eidelberg, a renowned American-Israeli political scientist cited above – a PhD from the University of Chicago – has drafted/shaped many of Israel’s future Constitutional components, and they are held within the Knesset as place markers) muddies the waters. In word and deed, this is a fatal flaw which allows many offenses – which would otherwise be deemed treasonous – to fly under the radar, despite Israel’s Basic Laws. \nAs to the mental aberration, why Jews (hailing chiefly from the left) side with sworn enemies, well, this is a question which Dr. Kenneth Levin, a Harvard psychiatrist, as well as a PhD historian from Princeton, answered in his masterpiece; a monumental, epoch feat of scholarship “ The Oslo Syndrome: Delusions of a People Under Siege .” To make a long story short (and to save myself from a throbbing headache…this subject irks to no end), a chronically besieged people – and the Jewish people qualify like none other – often end up internalizing the hatred and delude themselves about the malevolent intent of their enemies. The visceral, non-quenching hatred is too onerous to bear, therefore, fantasy becomes blurred with reality. Feeling totally out of control, they invent a fairy tale, not unlike chronically abused children. But this is just its tip, the rest must be gleaned through the book itself. It is an eye opener and jaw dropper. \nWolff Bachner: Are the Ultra Orthodox exerting an improper influence on Israeli politics and do they need to make a greater effort to assimilate to a modern Jewish state? \nDo you feel the Ultra Orthodox should be required by law to participate in National service? Should the subsidies that allow some religious Jews to spend a lifetime studying the Torah without working or serving in the military be cut back or eliminated? \nAdina Kutnicki: Once again, you expose another red hot button issue, one which I cover in various op-eds and commentaries. Briefly, the issue of improper influence is dependent upon how many arms are twisted (in a metaphorical sense) in order to garner the results desired by a particular party. There are various Ultra Orthodox parties (and don’t get me started on the Arab/leftist parties and their undue influence), but suffice it to say, Shas has been known to “break” a few bones. What is less known is that its top leadership (and Rabbi Ovadia Yosef is really the titular head) veer to the left and are ready to forfeit much of the Jewish patrimony – the so called “settlements” in Judea and Samaria – to gain “peace”. Now, not being a cynical sort, it occurs to me that by hewing to said leftist tilt they are better situated to play ball with those who often hold sway over Israel’s financial handouts. \nAs to National Service , there are two components to it; IDF trained and general national/community service. Now there shouldn’t be a one size fits all for fulfilling ones national obligations, however, there should be some core guidelines. In other words, those who are physically capable of recruitment into the combat forces must be drafted into one branch or another. But just because my sons are IDF Reservists doesn’t mean that this should be the case across the board. Basically, if one is unable to meet set combat or support service standards, there is an infinite list of national projects which require many helping hands, particularly in a country where war is always around the corner. \nAs such, it is unthinkable and unseemly (and this goes doubly for the Arab population, one which benefits from all of Israel’s social/educational/medical/welfare services, yet is not mandated to perform National Service…their free ride has to stop too, but IDF recruitment for the Arab sector should be limited to those few who have proven to be loyal citizens) that the Ultra Orthodox continues to receive massive welfare benefits and stipends without contributing to the country in a defined way. This goes for males and females alike. \nNevertheless, the concept of lifetime, subsidized study of Torah is fraught with minefields. In the main, while Israel is unique unto itself in that its basis is derived from its Jewish patrimony, this does not give a mandate to able-bodied citizens to sit and learn all day, while others support their lifestyle. But it is important to differentiate between those who are bench warmers, juxtaposed against men who are true scholars. Because let’s face it, sitting and “learning” all day is often the path of least resistance. Yet individuals whose invaluable scholarship will eventually become the inspiration and knowledge base for future generations must be allowed to continue doing so, and in an honorable way, free of castigation and contempt. And there are qualified ways to test who belongs in this exceptional track. But only students who meet said intellectual rigors should be allowed to receive government stipends. The rest must serve and then head towards (via academic or technical/vocational tracks) gainful employment. Most inherently, Orthodox Judaism encourages a meaningful balance between Torah study and work, and it is termed “Torah V’madah.” Simple as that. \nWolff Bachner: In your own writing, you have been quite outspoken about the Israeli government’s abusive treatment of the Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria (Gaza and the West Bank). They were encouraged by Israel’s leaders to move into the territories after 1967 and build entire communities, but since 2005 they have been uprooted time and time again by the order of the Israeli government. \nWhat is the legal status of Judea and Samaria ? Wasn’t the land promised to Israel in 1924 under the San Remo doctrine, which is considered irrevocable international law under the UN’s founding charter? Isn’t Judea and Samaria actually Jewish land and don’t Israelis have the right to settle in these areas? \nWhy are Israeli leaders treating their own citizens which such brutality and contempt, as we have seen over and over in the gruesome videos of Israeli soldiers and police viciously assaulting Jewish settlers and destroying their homes with tanks and bulldozers? \nAdina Kutnicki: Wolff, you keep hitting them out of the ballpark. Herein lies another lightning rod question which requires much needed edification (and disinfectant) for the general public. \nThe legal status of Judea and Samaria is currently “disputed” territories, even after Israel recaptured its (San Remo codified) heartland from an annihilatory waged war in 1967. Besides, whatever happened to “the victor goes the spoils”? Regardless,”occupied” territories has become the accepted lexicon and tragically Israel’s left keeps trotting out the “occupation”, as if it is a truth derived from Sinai. Adding to the crux of the matter, it is absolutely, irrefutably the legal case that San Remo bestowed Palestine to the Jewish people. San Remo bases itself on Article 22 of the League of Nations, as such, ” a sacred trust of civilization” was declared and this Mandate created a Jewish national home in Palestine (incidentally, Palestine is the pejorative name given to Judea by the Roman Emperor Hadrian, over 2,000 years ago, as a reminder of the Philistines, an ancient enemy of the Jewish people). Even more so, the following clause was significantly added: “Whereas recognition has thereby been given to the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine and to the grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country.” The legal case is closed, or so it would seem. But when it comes to Jewish title to their historical, legal, biblical birthright, nothing is as it should be. Up is down and wrong is right. Is it any wonder that evil is now reconstituted as good? For a complete education on the subject I refer the readers to Howard Grief’s (an eminent international legal expert) tour de force ” The Legal Foundation and Borders of Israel Under International Law .” What a fountain of (legal) truth. \nAs to Israel’s leaders…where to begin? A good place to commence is through a basic understanding of Israel’s political system – an (un)holy mess. In this vein, I penned an op-ed at American Thinker (reprinted at The Jewish Press) entitled ” The Paradox of Israeli Politics: Vote Right, Get Left .” To be precise, due to this glaring paradox, whereby the majority public elects a generally right wing leadership, citizens find themselves governed from the left. The reasons are manifestly beyond the scope of this forum, but a simple google search will direct interested readers to the aforementioned article. \nIn any case, this dysfunction explains how PM Sharon (and others have followed suit) was able to defy the will of the majority electorate who carried him to victory. Hence, he ordered the unilateral “disengagement” from Gush Katif (aka Gaza) and the northern Shomron, as he directed Israel’s citizen soldiers to bulldoze thriving Jewish communities, all the while over 8,600 lawful, taxpaying citizens were expelled – almost as if by fiat – even defying a referendum in the process. Orwellian. If any other western leadership behaved in such a brutish, non-democratic manner towards its Jewish citizens, well, all hell would have broken loose. Not to be lost in the discussion, had PM Sharon executed the same wholesale destruction towards its Arab citizens, then let’s just say that hell on earth would be more than an apt description. And in memory of the 6th year of said expulsion, another op-ed (“ The Bitter Fruits of Disengagement “, August 19, 2011) was penned. It was featured at the Jewish Press and several other media outlets. \nThe above political pitfalls covers the “how” part of the question, and the “why” segment falls under the general purview of appeasement syndromes, not unlike Stockholm Syndrome. But as related above, its genesis lies in the Oslo “peace” process, thus, the “Oslo Syndrome” is highly applicable. \nWolff Bachner: The Netanyahu government seems dedicated to persecuting Israeli Jews who are Nationalists and believe in a strong Israel. Zionist patriots are prosecuted for hate speech if they say a word that is critical of Palestinians or Israeli officials and Rabbis are arrested for quoting Torah. Jewish homes in Israel proper are being destroyed by the Israeli authorities while Arabs squat and build with impunity on Jewish owned land. Israeli NGO’s accept millions of dollars of foreign money from nations and organizations that are openly hostile to Israel and use the money to defame Israel in the eyes of the world and endanger the lives of Israelis. \nNo other nation on the planet would tolerate hostile foreign governments undermining their national sovereignty and allow their citizens to accept money from those governments to attack the policies of their own country. Has the government of Israel lost its mind and its Jewish soul? \nIs it now a crime in Israel to stand up for your country in the face of endless Muslim / Arab aggression and demand the government stop compromising with people who want to commit genocide against the Jewish people? \nAdina Kutnicki: The Netanyahu government is emblematic of the disparate treatment meted out towards nationalist Jews , in contrast to kid glove treatment reserved for leftists and Arabists. It is entirely befuddling to those who are convinced that Israel has a nationalist leadership. While there are nationalists within, the overall policy is far from “right wing”. The left has a stranglehold on the justice/court system (Tzipi Livni, the current AG, is an avowed leftist), and its state prosecutors are beyond the pale. They haven’t met a Jewish nationalist who is not “guilty” and in need of “re-education”. Again, much of this lies within the scope of Israel’s broken parliamentary system of governance, whereby MK’s are not held accountable, hence, the lack of responsibility to a particular constituency. \nAs a matter of record, on behalf of my work with HONENU Legal Defense Organization – an Israeli non-profit designated to defend Israeli soldiers and citizens, free of charge, from legal traps which ensnare “settlers” and those who support their efforts – a series of investigations ensued. A centerpiece expose’ detailed a stunning indictment of Israel’s General Security Service (GSS), and as a reference point, its equivalent arm in the U.S. is the FBI. Instead of utilizing its frontal assault against a dangerous Arab fifth column, both inside the “green line” and in Judea and Samaria, it expends huge resources to entrap “settlers’, in the expectation that they will give up their defense of the heartland and just go “home” within Israel proper. Good luck with that. “ Administrative Detention Orders Against Jewish Nationalists ” (October 2011) delineates said internal struggle. Aside from its posting at HONENU, it can be found at the Freeman Center For Strategic Studies/The Freeman Blog . It is not easily digestible, so I apologize in advance for any ensuing heartburn. \nI will leave it up to the readers to make their own determination, as to whether the leadership has lost its mind, its Jewish soul or both. It’s not a hard calculus to discern. \nWolff Bachner: On the matter of Jerusalem , I can not imagine a more terrible fate for the Jewish people, other than another Holocaust, than to see Jerusalem divided again. Not only would it cut the heart out of the Jewish spirit, but it would divide the tiny nation of Israel across the middle into two smaller, indefensible sections. Is it truly possible that Israel would actually give up half of Jerusalem to become the capital of Palestine? \nAdina Kutnicki: As to Jerusalem, the heart and soul of Zion (in the same realm as Judea and Samaria), whither it goes, so too does the fate of Israel, as well as the Jewish people. It is inconceivable that Israel would survive without Jerusalem intact, and dare I suggest, there would be little reason left for its existence, sans an intact eternal capital. It is one tragedy if enemies capture it from Jewish hands, but it is a wholly different paradigm if Israel’s leaders surrender it on their own. So the question still hangs: Are Israel’s leaders capable of dividing holy Zion? One would hope and pray this is not the case, but the jury is still out. Personally, I would put nothing past some of the leadership and they bear close scrutiny. Very close. \nWolff Bachner: From a Washington Post editorial, (May 8, 2001) –“Syrian President Bashar Assad on Saturday [May 5, 2001] offered a vivid, if vile, demonstration of why he and his government are unworthy of respect or good relations with the United States or any other democratic country. Greeting Pope John Paul II in Damascus, Mr. Assad launched an attack on Jews that may rank as the most ignorant and crude speech delivered before the pope in his two decades of travel around the world. Comparing the suffering of the Palestinians to that of Jesus Christ, Mr. Assad said that the Jews ‘tried to kill the principles of all religions with the same mentality in which they betrayed Jesus Christ and the same way they tried to betray and kill the Prophet Muhammad.’ With that libel, the Syrian president stained both his country and the pope….” \nRespected political columnist Richard Cohen wrote more than a decade ago, “The Arab world is the last bastion of unbridled, unashamed, unhidden and unbelievable anti-Semitism . Hitlerian myths get published in the popular press as incontrovertible truths. The Holocaust either gets minimized or denied….How the Arab world will ever come to terms with Israel when Israelis are portrayed as the devil incarnate is hard to figure out.” \nAdina Kutnicki: In a nutshell – and this short answer is hardly meant to minimize the grave import and impact of Arab/Muslim anti-semitism – unless Islam undergoes a complete and total reformation, its adherents will never (until time immemorial) accept Jews as other than pigs, apes and monkeys, let alone the historical, legal and biblical heirs to Zion. This is the G-d’s honest truth. As is said, and that is that. \nBiography Of Adina Kutnicki: \nAdina Kutnicki is an independent op-ed contributor to various Zionist and Conservative media outlets.
