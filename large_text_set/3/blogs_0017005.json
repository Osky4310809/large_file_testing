(ANI) \nWith the Hindu hardliner, Yogi Adityanath been appointed the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh looks like the Muslims have accepted the new chief minister well. In fact, in Gorakhpur, Muslims and Hindus are celebrating the victory of BJP and by proxy of Yogi Adityanath. While all BJP leaders are assuring that there is no threat to the minorities with Yogi at the helm, even the Muslim populace is giving out those signals. \nPrime Minister, Narendra Modi ’s Triple Talaq issue during the election trail could have won the Muslim women votes, but overall, the Muslim political voice is not being heard. \nThere are many instances to show that. Even though Muslim representation in UP’s assembly has fallen from 17.1% in 2012 to 5.9% in 2017. And according to the exit polls only 2% of Muslims voted for BJP, there have been no communal incidents reported as yet. \nWatch this also: \nEven during his campaign trail, the Prime Minister’s remarks on shamshan-kabristan statement and Amit Shah ’s Kasab comment showed a certain aggression that could have been retaliated by the Muslims But there was no backlash on the other hand the message that got across was that it was a Hindu Rashtra. \nEven Muslims were not given a single ticket to the Muslims. The Muslims were excluded, yet there was not an outpouring from their side. Please Wait while comments are loading...
