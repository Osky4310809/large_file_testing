Starting later this year, Samsung Pay users will be able to shop online at hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where Visa Checkout is accepted. \n\nSamsung is committed to making the online payment experience simpler, faster and more secure. Samsung Pay’s simple, secure checkout experience using fingerprint authentication gives users a more streamlined online shopping experience, eliminating the lengthy process of adding their payment card data, billing or shipping details each time they shop. Users with fingerprint authentication-enabled Samsung devices will be able to click the Visa Checkout/Samsung Pay co-branded button and touch the fingerprint sensor and the payment will proceed instantly, without needing to enter a user name and password for each purchase. \n\nSamsung is committed to helping merchants improve their checkout conversion rates. Today, there is still more friction than necessary in the online checkout process. Working with Visa, Samsung Pay will change the game for online merchants by giving eCommerce the same streamlined checkout experience it brought to mobile devices. \n\n“We are very excited to be working with Visa to offer simple, fast and secure checkout experiences to millions of Samsung Pay users on their mobile devices or desktop,” said Injong Rhee, CTO of the Mobile Communications Business at Samsung Electronics.” Our partnership benefits not only Samsung Pay users but also hundreds of thousands of online merchants who are looking for effective ways to increase their checkout conversion rates.” \n\n“The days of filling out long forms or remembering usernames to make online purchases are continuing to wind down, as options like Visa Checkout’s open platform become accessible on hundreds of thousands of merchant sites and companies like Samsung see the value in simplifying the process for both consumers and merchants,” said Jim McCarthy, executive vice president, innovation and strategic partnerships, Visa Inc. “We are excited to extend the benefits of Samsung Pay from the mobile world to now also include online merchants, ensuring customers can pay everywhere Visa Checkout is accepted, on any device and in app.” \n\n\nAbout Visa Visa Inc.
