However, this time the actress referred to the new book in the vampire-human romance series. \nKristen Stewart has always dogged the questions of her featuring as Bella Swan in future Twilight movies. Most recently, she did admit that she would be the first person to pick up a book if Stephenie Meyer will come up with another story based on the same characters. \n“We kind of finished the series. We made five movies. I think we kind of did it justice,” she said when it was asked to the 26-year-old about the possibility of a new Twilight saga .

During her earlier interview with Variety , Meyer stated that she would only consider returning to the world of human-vampire romantic saga only when Edward Cullen, Jacob Black or Bella Swan Cullen will die. \n“Three paragraphs on my blog saying which of the characters died. I’m interested in spending time in other worlds, like Middle-earth. I get further away [from Twilight ] every day,” added Meyer. “For me, it’s not a happy place to be.” \nThat being said, this is not the first time when Kristen Stewart has revealed her true feelings for a Twilight movie reunion with her ex-boyfriend Robert Pattinson. During the promotional event of her earlier release American Ultra , the actress seemed to be open to all the idea and the said possibilities of rebooting the multi-billion saga. During her interview with Uproxx , Stella Maxwell’s current girlfriend revealed that she would be interested in the new film but the reunion with the rest of the cast and crew should not “emotionally affect” her. \n“Even though after the first one, which stood alone, it lasted a long time. It’s hard to speak to a five-year period in a few sentences, but I loved doing it. But that doesn’t mean I want to keep doing it. But if other people wanted to? Yeah, sure. To be honest with you, I would be interested. I’d be kind of fascinated, but it wouldn’t emotionally affect me one way or the other.” \nEven if Stephenie Meyer will come up with a story for the previously written character and Lionsgate takes the film’s rights then also the chances of Robert Pattinson featuring in it as Edward Cullen are pretty slim.

I hope to awake their curiosity and show them a different vision of cinema. Don’t forget that they grow up too. And they didn’t want to see all their lives Robert Pattinson playing a vampire. We tend to devalue the fans. It’s a mistake. The fan is an audience member like the others,” he added. \nAs of now, there is no official confirmation on the future of Twilight novels and films, but fans really wish to see Kristen Stewart sharing screen space with Robert Pattinson in future. Do you think there will be a film in making that may feature former couple?
