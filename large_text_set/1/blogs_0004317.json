As many remember, Trolls dolls were a popular toy then, and resurfaced last year with a movie release that inspired beauty brands like MAC to join in on all the neon fun. Even if the borderline creepy-cute toys weren't a staple in your childhood favorites, the new Pur Cosmetics palette just might be enough to win you over now. \nInspired by colorful characters like Princess Poppy and Branch, this palette offers 16 pigmented matte and shimmer shadows, ranging from soft neutrals to bold blues and trending shades of red . Even the most bright and daring shades are still wearable, making this a palette to suit all your glam needs and easily transition between looks. \nTo sweeten the deal even more, the wait for this $29 palette is short: it drops online at Pur Cosmetics on Jan. 8 and will also hit Kohl's stores on Jan. 19. Thanks to the Trolls, we can keep living (and wearing) our '90s obsession through 2017 and beyond. Read on to see more shots of the palette, including swatches.
