AFP PHOTO \nThousands of residents of Surigao City in Mindanao huddled on the streets Sunday, two days after a deadly quake, as aftershocks continued to hit the region. \nThe 6.7-magnitude quake struck Surigao and nearby areas late Friday, killing six people and injuring more than 200 others, with more than a thousand homes destroyed or damaged, according to officials. \nPeople who fled their damaged homes wrapped themselves in blankets and sacks for a second night as they slept side by side on the pavement on Saturday, an AFP photographer at the scene said.

The people are suffering,” provincial information officer Mary Escalante told ABS-CBN television in an interview. \n“Buildings that suffered structural damage have been closed,” she said, adding some schools and gyms that were meant to serve as evacuation centres were among those damaged by the quake. \nThe quake also damaged bridges and roads and knocked out the power supply, though electricity was restored in most of Surigao on Saturday. \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte was scheduled to visit the city on Sunday to inspect the damage and lead the relief effort, officials said. \nAn average of five earthquakes, most of them undetectable except through instruments, hit daily across the Philippines, which lies on the so-called Ring of Fire, a vast Pacific Ocean region where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. \nThe last lethal quake that hit the country measured 7.1-magnitude. It left over 220 people dead and destroyed historic churches when it struck the central islands in October 2013.
