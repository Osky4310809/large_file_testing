The most popular celebrities with their own Caribbean island are a small colony of adorable swimming pigs. \nNo one seems to know for certain how the cute oinkers first arrived in the Bahamas more than a decade ago, but they’ve since become celebrities. Pull up in a boat and you'll see them lazing around in the sun, frolicking on the sand, and then paddling out into the waves to meet you. \nWhere to find swimming pigs \nYou'll find the friendly swine on Pig Beach, the southernmost beach on Big Major Cay in the Exuma Cays , a 120-mile archipelago located southeast of Nassau in the Bahamas. With 365 islets, there is indeed a cay for every day of the year. The Exuma Cays are among the most pristine Bahamian islands and it’s easy to see why movie stars like to retreat here. \nHow to swim with pigs \nYou can take a boat excursion to Big Major Cay from resorts and island outfitters. When the pigs hear the motors they come running out of the forest, across the beach, and into the turquoise waters. They piggy-paddle out, snouts upturned, to the boats to get their scraps. The pigs will hang around the boats as long as there is food to be had. \nYou can get into the shallow water to swim with the pigs. You can pet them and hand-feed them scraps, but be careful to keep your fingers out of their mouths. \nExcursions and packages", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:14:27.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
