Bachelor Nation's Chase McNary and Wells Adams were guests on Vinny Ventiera 's Wrong Reasons podcast on Thursday, February 2, and the three Bachelorette season 12 alums discussed which of Nick Viall 's Bachelor season 21 ladies might get picked, including such standouts as Rachel Lindsay and Corinne Olympios . PHOTOS: The Most Ridiculous ‘Bachelor’ and ‘Bachelorette’ Job Titles Ever \nMcNary said that while he thinks Lindsay could be the next Bachelorette, given that viewers have been calling for a more diverse choice as the show's lead, he's not sure if producers will go through with it. \"[Producers] want everyone to think, 'Oh, this black girl is finishing pretty late on,' and they've never had a black Bachelorette — that might be the direction they're going to go,\" the medical sales rep said. \"It's the direction they have to go. But then, 'Holy s--t, Donald Trump 's the president, and Corinne's the Bachelorette? What's the world going to do?'\" PHOTOS: 'The Bachelor' Season 21: See Which Former Contestants Are Lookalikes With Nick Viall’s New Ladies? \nMcNary pointed out that the show's producers had picked Caila Quinn as the season 12 Bachelorette before switching to JoJo Fletcher at the last minute. He said he could see something similar happening this season, with producers potentially trying to \"trick us again with, 'It's going to be Rachel, and then have somebody lead on that it's going to be Vanessa — I don't know — and then surprise, it's actually crazy-ass Corinne.\" Wells Adams on January 2, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. Allen Berezovsky/WireImage \nAdams agreed that Olympios, the polarizing season 21 villain, might ultimately be the choice. \"Remember, we all thought it was Caila, and that was exactly what they were trying to do — that was diversity being the forefront,\" the Bachelor in Paradise alum said. \"And then they kind of took stock of how America felt about it, they kind of leaked that information, and they realized America wasn't super pumped about that choice. Regardless of the diversity issue, it might've just been they didn't really love her personality or persona. But when they found out it was JoJo, people were very excited about that.\" You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:42:51.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
