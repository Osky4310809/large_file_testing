From reported financial woes , fleeing executives , and legal troubles , to onstage technical issues during the live reveal, a little skepticism is only natural. On paper, though, the car is quite impressive, and the amount of technology built into the FF91 could make it a benchmark for the future of connected luxury EVs (assuming it does one day come to market). Faraday Future has even begun taking \"priority\" reservations for the FF91, at $5,000 a pop, signaling self-confidence in a car they can deliver. The company has withheld one tiny detail from the public, though: the price.\nTo that end, Electrek points us to a Chinese interview with Jia Yueting, CEO of Faraday Future's financial backer LeEco , who does drop a price figure for the FF91 of \"less than 2 million Chinese yuan.\" In American dollars, that translates to \"less than $292,645,\" as of this writing.\nWhen we brought you news of the debut, we postulated that the FF91 would be \"priced like a premium vehicle.\" From what Jia suggests, it could be a bit more, depending on your definition of premium.\nOne thing to keep in mind, however, that whatever \"less than $292,645\" means for the Chinese market, it will almost certainly mean a lower price here in the US. Import taxes and other fees mean many cars cost a pretty penny more in China. Here, a Tesla Model X 90D starts at $98,800. That same car in China costs about $141,000 based on today's exchange rate.\nBy that math, you can look at it as though Jia Yueting said that the Faraday Future FF91 will cost \"less than $205,000.\" Considering it will be super fast , equipped with a 130-kWh battery pack (but also take into account the falling cost of batteries), and be chock full of cutting edge technology...\nYeah, that's still kind of insane.", "external_links": ["http://tech.163.com/17/0112/10/CAIRB0BD00097U7T.html", "https://electrek.co/2017/01/13/faraday-future-ff91-electric-vehicle-cost-300000-ceo-jia-yueting/"], "published": "2017-01-19T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:45:54.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
