Getty/Justin Sullivan \nIn an email sent by Apple CEO Tim Cook to employees, and obtained by Business Insider, Cook said President Donald Trump's executive action on immigration \"is not a policy we support.\" \nThe email is reproduced below. \nTrump on Friday signed an executive order that blocked citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, from entering the US for at least 90 days, including people who already have visas and legal permits to live in the US. \nThe countries affected are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. \nThe technology industry, including Apple, has scores of employees and participants who have been affected by the ban. Apple joins other tech giants including Microsoft , Facebook , and Google who have had executives privately and publicly react to the executive order. \nCook has spoken with Trump at least twice — first in a congratulatory call shortly after Trump was elected, and more recently at Trump Tower along with several other tech leaders . \nApple was founded by Steve Jobs, the son of a Syrian immigrant. \"Apple would not exist without immigration,\" Cook wrote. \nThis is the email Cook sent to all Apple employees worldwide: Team, In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I've made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration -- both to our company and to our nation's future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support. There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday's immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them. We’re providing resources on AppleWeb for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company. As I've said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there’s one thing I know about the people at Apple, it’s the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It’s as important now as it’s ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued. Apple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, \"We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.\" Tim", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T05:30:50.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
