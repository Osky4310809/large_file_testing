As a member of a Chilean team, he journeyed to Patagonia in early January under the Obama administration. He returned after Donald Trump took office and issued a sweeping executive order on travel into the United States. \nWhen Bikkannavar arrived at the Houston, Texas airport from Santiago, Chile, he says U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents pressured him to turn over his phone and give them his PIN to unlock it. Because the phone was NASA-issued, he worried that it contained sensitive material that was supposed to remain confidential.

In addition, he has never visited the countries on the immigration ban, and he’s 10-year employee of a major U.S. federal agency. \n“I don’t know what to think about this,” Bikkannavar told The Verge in a phone call. “I was caught a little off guard by the whole thing.” \nBikkannavar detailed his experience on Facebook, explaining his absence to friends and coworkers.
