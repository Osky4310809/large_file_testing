Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nOne of the best iOS 9 features has finally landed on the the Mac. \nAfter months of beta testing, Apple released macOS 10.12.4 to the public this morning, bringing a host of performance improvements and new features, including Night Shift. \nThe new update can be downloaded to your Mac for free by visiting the Updates tab in the Mac App Store. Whatâ€™s new in macOS 10.12.4 \nNight Shift debuted on iOS devices in iOS 9.3. The feature automatically adjusts the brightness of displays to a warmer color at night, a practice that some studies suggest might help users fall asleep easier at night. Other major additions in macOS 10.12.4 includes Siri support for cricket scores and stats and dictation support for Shanghainese. Issues rendering PDFs in Preview have been fixed along with some problems with the Mail app. \nmacOS 10.12.4 is the first major software update for the Mac this year. It could be the last big release for macOS Sierra before Apple unveils macOS 10.13 at the Worldwide Developers Conference this June in San Jose. \nApple released new updates this morning as well for iOS 10.3, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2, all of which can be downloaded to devices over-the-air.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:10:52.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
