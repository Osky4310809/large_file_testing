For my first video on YouTube, I talk about my favorite BlackBerry of ALL TIME. What's yours?\nIf you haven't noticed, I've having a too much fun celebrating 10 Years of CrackBerry . Today I took it next level with CBK 2.0 getting back in front of the camera to shoot some video. I'll be honest, I wasn't sure how this was going to go. But one take and a little editing, I think it turned into a fun video that will likely have you feeling all nostalgic for BlackBerrys of years gone by.\nFor my first video back, I wanted to pick a fun topic that fit with our 10 Years of CrackBerry theme. So I decided to talk about MY FAVORITE BLACKBERRY OF ALL TIME . You'll have to watch the video to find out what it is and why.\nOnce you watch it, be sure to drop a comment and let me know your favorite BlackBerry of all time!\nI hope you enjoy it! The CrackBerry YouTube channel has been a little stale, so really do appreciate any Thumbs Ups you can give to the video (that'll help re-kickstart it a bit), and if you're not subscribed then PLEASE SUBSCRIBE and share the videos! The more people who watch them the more we'll make! We're going to be doing a little revamping of the channel so you'll want to subscribe and turn on notifications so you don't miss any!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:41:13.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
