Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAs the festive food and drink binge dries up, football fans will have to feast themselves on transfer rumours as the Premier League's latest spending spree gets under way in January. \nIt is hard to find a better market for England's cash-rich clubs than Spain. \nRunaway leaders Chelsea have regularly fielded five Spaniards this season, whilst there have been Spanish invasions across the country from Man City to Middlesbrough thanks to the value for money on offer in La Liga, particularly from the more cash-strapped sides outwit Real Madrid and Barcelona. \nHere are five names that won't break the bank to turn around your club's fortunes in the new year.

Far from a stereotypical Spanish passing metronome in the middle of the park, Camacho speciality is in destructing the opposition's progress in front of the back four. \nNo one in La Liga has made more interceptions this season and he also poses a serious aerial threat from set-pieces with three goals in just 15 appearances. Sergi Enrich (Eibar) \nAge: 26 Sergi Enrich has been on form for minnows Eibar again (Photo: 2015 Getty Images) \nSwansea have realised to their cost what many who have watched Eibar's remarkable sustained success in La Liga knew last year that Enrich is better suited to English football than the struggling Welsh side's record signing Borja Baston, who Swansea splurged £15.5 million on from Atletico Madrid in August. \nThe two formed a deadly partnership when Baston was on loan at Eibar last season, but it was Enrich's work rate and link-up play that provided his strike partner the platform to shine with 18 goals. \nEnrich has continued to fire with five goals in just 12 starts this season, despite the distraction of an off-field scandal as a sex-tape involving he and teammate Antonio Luna was released on social media to unusually throw the Basque minnows into the spotlight of the mainstream media. \nThe reality of life means that Eibar with just a 6,000 capacity ground are unable to resist any serious offer from the Premier League and it will take far less than it to prize the misfiring Baston from Atletico. \nEnrich's adaptability to lead the line on his own or combine in a two up front would make him the ideal bargain pick-up for sides struggling for goals at the bottom of the table.

Dani Parejo (Valencia) \nAge: 27 Suddenly things have all gone wrong for the ex-Real Madrid playmaker (Photo: Manuel Queimadelos Alonso) \nOnly Samir Nasri has had a worse Christmas in Spain's top flight than Dani Parejo, who couldn't have chosen a worse moment to be filmed over-indulging in the giant bowls of spirits served up in the nightclubs of Valencia with the once Spanish giants off to their worse ever start to a league season. \nValencia only ended the year outside the bottom three on goal difference and Parejo's behaviour confirmed many fans' belief that their under-performing stars couldn't care less as long as they are picking up their huge pay packets. \nParejo began his career at Real Madrid and even had a brief loan spell at QPR in 2008 before being recalled to the Bernabeu. \nWhilst respected in his homeland, there is the widespread feeling Parejo should have made even more of his immense talent that has seen him develop an eye for a defence-splitting pass and as a deadly free-kick specialist. \nAt 27, and the Valencia fans baying for his blood, January may be the right time for a fresh start and to allow Valencia to raise much-needed funds to strengthen a relegation threatened squad. Cedric Bakambu (Villarreal) \nPosition: Striker \nAge: 25 Bakambu has been somewhat out of favour under a new manager at El Madrigal (Photo: 2016 Getty Images) \nAfter a dream debut campaign in Spain, a lack of fitness and form has seen the goals dry up at Villarreal for Cedric Bakambu. \nThe Congolese put the likes of Barcelona, Sevilla and Bayer Leverkusen to the sword last season amongst an impressive 22-goal haul that fired Villarreal to fourth and the semi-finals of the Europa League. \nHowever, now is the time for Premier League clubs to swoop for a cut-price deal with Bakambu clearly unhappy with the marginalised role he has played since Fran Escriba took charge at the start of the season. \nBakambu wasn't even on the bench for Villarreal's La Liga wins over Atletico Madrid and Sporting Gijon to end the year with new arrivals Nicola Sansone and Alexandre Pato enjoying more minutes.
