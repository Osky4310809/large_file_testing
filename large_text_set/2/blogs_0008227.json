What do they even tell us? Mostly, they confirm that a terrifying number of people know nothing and don’t care about truth , but also that they love Melissa McCarthy, so it’s not all bad. Advertisement \nTwo different polls from Public Polling Policy on Friday have shown that Trump’s credibility is generally in the toilet, at least if you think it’s ridiculous to believe in a sketch TV show more than an American president. Voters are now going to Saturday Night Live (and the New York Times , bless) instead of Trump’s Twitter account to see what’s up: \nThe New York Times has repeatedly been a target of Trump’s attacks, but voters say they think the Times had more credibility than them 52/37.

So, for like another year, maybe? \nDespite this negativity , Trump is here for polls, like this one he got from Morning Consult . The article is actually making a point about Trump’s declining approval rate, but whatever, here’s the chart: \nPolls: they’ll prove and disprove anything.
