But as Kyle Busch made an aggressive move to get past Keselowski, the No. 22 Team Penske Ford of Joey Logano clipped Busch and sent him spinning. \nThat led to Busch confronting Logano on pit road after the race, and the two ended up being engaged in a brawl along with some team members before it could be broken up. \n“I just had three-quarter speed – and when everybody is charging behind you, that’s going to cause a wreck,” Keselowski said. “I got out of the way as best I could and I don’t know if it was enough, but I saw they wrecked. Maybe that was related and maybe it wasn’t.” \nKeselowski ended up holding on for a fifth-place finish. After leading 89 laps, he insisted there was a whole lot to be positive about despite the disappointing end to the day. \n“We had a great day,” he said. “We ran up front and led a lot of laps. We were the fastest car at the end and it just didn’t come together. That’s part of how racing works.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T17:54:26.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
