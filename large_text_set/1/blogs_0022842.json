The beloved shonen series has been around for more than a decade, but fans still aren’t tired of Masashi Kishimoto’s ninja-filled franchise. In 2017, the creator plans to bid farewell to the anime ’s long-running Naruto Shippuden series, but the show will not mark an end for the Uzumaki clan. No, the franchise will continue on in April when a Naruto spin-off hits televisions. And, now, fans have gotten their first taste of what the sequel will be about. UP NEXT: Anime Spin-Off Series Announced \nIn the latest issue of Shueisha’s W eekly Shonen Jump, an article about Boruto: The Next Generations was printed. It was there that fans learned that the spin-off anime would begin with an original story. Of course, the direction of the show could change greatly after its initial arc is complete. There is a canon-compliant Boruto manga in publication that has Kishimoto’s approval, so fans can look forward to its stories being adapted in the future. But, for now, it looks like the Boruto anime will make its mark with an entirely new story. \nIf you are not familiar with Boruto or his relationship to Naruto, then there’s no need to fret. Their relationship is direct with a few complex knots tying it up along the way. Boruto is the eldest child of Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuuga, and he has become quite a star in Japan. The boy was introduced at the end of Kishimoto’s Naruto manga, and he recently received his own tie-in film alongside his father. These days, Boruto is making his debut in games like Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, and his popularity will surely climax once TV Tokyo unveils Boruto’s spin-off anime.

It was there that Kishimoto confirmed his work on the series and told fans that he plans “to make it even better than Naruto .” The creator also confirmed that he was working on a live-action Naruto adaptation with Lionsgate, and fans were quick to voice their opinions about the Hollywood film shortly after news broke about its development.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T01:41:09.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
