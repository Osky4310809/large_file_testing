In the end someone has to walk off the set. And so far it has not been Hazard. \nAs kick-off approached there was genuine burnish of event-glamour about this FA Cup quarter-final, with waves of noise crackling around the Bridge’s steeply-tiered noise-funnel stands. In the event the opening 40 minutes of this slightly wild tie were gripping, bruising theatre; the game shrunk into a miniature drama played out around a clear defensive plan from the visitors: Get Eden. N’Golo Kanté sends Chelsea past 10-man Manchester United in FA Cup Read more \nThis was the strategy from the start as Mourinho set out to shackle, restrict and generally thwart Hazard’s creative influence at the heart of Chelsea’s attack. So, not really that much of a change from last season you might say. \nUnited’s aggression made for an impossibly absorbing passage of play during which Hazard was hunted relentlessly, but to his credit kept on coming back for more. It felt like a point of tension that would decide the match. And so it was, a match won not by just N’Golo Kanté’s clinching goal just after the break, or by the red card shown to Ander Herrera in the first half, but above all by the fear of Hazard that dominated United’s game plan. \nIn fairness to Mourinho his own attack was seriously depleted here. Marcus Rashford made a sudden recovery from illness to fill the vacant striker’s role but even with him United were missing the combined source of 25 of their 39 league goals this season. \nChelsea on the other hand have been a brutal attacking force at this tight, noisy, fun, slightly ageing stadium. Before tonight seven straight victories at Stamford Bridge since Christmas had brought 21 goals from nine different Chelsea players. Key to all of this has been Hazard’s sublime creative industry. \nIt is hard to say Hazard has improved dramatically under Conte given the statistical brilliance of his form under Mourinho two years ago. But he is at least playing slightly differently, playing now like a genuine star player. The defensive structure has been an ideal liberating platform for those fine-honed attacking talents, allowing Hazard to drift and look for space, to become more expressive, more obviously, flashily complete. \nIt was clear immediately how Mourinho would attempt to impede this freedom of movement. At the start Phil Jones simply followed Hazard about, his brief to prevent him finding those in-out spaces where he picks the ball up and turns with such instant spring. \nJust one problem with this. Knowing what Hazard is going to do is one thing. Doing anything about it is another. With 14 minutes gone there was the first little trap and spin on the halfway line, the clutching Herrera burnt off with a thrum of the throttle and that amazing sideways spring, an athletic gift it is simply impossible to match one on one. \nMoments later Chris Smalling was sent not just the wrong way but down the tunnel, out of the stadium, past the hot dog stand and all the way to the automatic doors of the late night Boots at Fulham Broadway with a deliciously crisp Cruyff turn in the centre circle. Hazard spurted off into space, cutting past another defender and then drawing a fine save from David De Gea with a low shot at full speed.

With 20 minutes gone Hazard took the ball on the left again and jinked at frightening speed past Jones, Herrera leaving the imprint of his shoulder on Hazard’s cheek as he drifted past and drawing his first booking. \nWith 35 minutes gone Jones hacked him down once again near the halfway line, a horribly cynical piece of work. And 30 seconds later the inevitable happened. A United player was sent off for a second foul on Hazard. In the event the tombola yielded up the name of Herrera, who produced perhaps the dumbest trip of the night, a weedy, pointless little thing that was barely a foul in isolation. \nThe referee, Michael Oliver, had just spoken to Smalling. It was obvious what he was saying. Team-fouling went out in the 1970s. Quite possibly, given Oliver’s instant shake of the head the warning was explicit: next one’s to be a booking. Herrera had seen it all unfold. He can only really blame himself. \nStill the players continued to thud into one another. There was a risible and demeaning exchange between the two managers, Conte and Mourinho baying and preening at one another like ageing silverbacks while a posse of officials held them at bay. \nAnd six minutes into the second half Chelsea scored a goal that came, oddly enough, from a rare lapse in intensity. As Chelsea prodded away at United’s deep defensive block Willian played the ball inside to Kanté. He looked up, saw no red shirt in front of him and fired an instant low shot that bobbled into the corner. United missed Herrera in that moment, a casualty of their own bruising game plan, and above all of Hazard’s first half brilliance.
