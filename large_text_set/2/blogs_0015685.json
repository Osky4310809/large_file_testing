Zlatan Ibrahimovic is flying on all cylinders at United, but for just how much longer can he maintain this high level? Former Man United captain Bryan Robson sings the praises of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his Man United impact. \nZlatan Ibrahimovic was always going to make \"massive contribution\" to Manchester United, according to manager Jose Mourinho. \nDespite question marks over his age -- he turns 36 in October -- the Swedish striker has consistently delivered for United. \nHe came off the bench to score a 75th-minute winner as the Red Devils prevailed over second-tier Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup to earn a quarterfinal tie at Chelsea. \n\"I don't know the number of goals [Ibrahimovic has scored], I don't know,\" Mourinho told a media conference. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored five goals in his last four games in all competitions. \n\"I knew that he would be a very important player for us. I knew that for sure. \n\"One more goal, one less goal, but I knew that the contribution would be massive for us.\" \nIbrahimovic's heroics at Ewood Park came after Marcus Rashford had cancelled out Danny Graham's opener for Blackburn. \nThe ex-Barcelona and Inter Milan forward has now scored five goals in his past four games, with a total of 24 in all competitions this season. \nMan United will travel to France later this week ahead of their UEFA Europa League Round of 32 tie against St. Etienne on Thursday. They hold a 3-0 lead from the first leg. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:00:43.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
