One of those, against Manchester United at the weekend, came from the penalty spot, while Lucas's goal against Plymouth was a header from a corner. \nThe loss of Sadio Mane to African Nations Cup duty is clearly hurting Liverpool, who miss the forward's pace and ability to stretch teams. He could yet be away for another month, so Liverpool need to find a way to rediscover the cutting edge that tore opponents apart early in the season. Lucas' goal was his first since Sept. 16, 2010. \n2. Lucas earns his night in the spotlight \nLucas has always divided opinion among Liverpool supporters during his 10 years at Anfield, but the Brazilian's commitment and endeavour has never been questioned. \nHis detractors claim that the 30-year-old lacks the class to be a Liverpool player, regarding him merely as a stop-gap when more celebrated teammates are unavailable. Something of a nearly man, Lucas missed Liverpool's League Cup win in 2012 through injury and has been an runner-up with the club in every major competition. \nBy contrast, those prepared to highlight his qualities will point to Lucas' readiness to play anywhere and do any job while wearing the red shirt and his loyalty and reliability was rewarded with the captain's armband at Plymouth. \nBut the sight of him celebrating his first goal in over six years -- 2,316 days in fact since his last strike against Steaua Bucharest in September 2010 -- was a special one for a player whose commitment to the Anfield cause saw him reject a move to Inter Milan earlier this month. \nOn a night when Klopp rested several senior players ahead of Saturday's Premier League game against Swansea City, the experience of Lucas at the heart of Liverpool's defence was crucial. He is not the best player ever to play for the club but the likes of Lucas are needed in every squad pushing for honours and he showed that on Wednesday. \n3. Plymouth show what they have to offer \nVying for promotion from the fourth tier of English football, Plymouth defied the odds to claim the 0-0 draw at Anfield 10 days ago that secured this sell-out replay in Devon. \nBut despite the resolute defensive display on Merseyside, manager Derek Adams and his players were criticised for being too negative against Liverpool and adopting safety-first tactics, aimed solely at earning another shot at Klopp's team. \nFormer Liverpool and England midfielder Steve McManaman was one of the more vocal critics in his role as a TV pundit and the Plymouth supporters subjected him to good-natured terrace tormenting as the home side attempted to fight back from Lucas' goal. \nAnd Plymouth deserve credit for their readiness to take Liverpool on with a more attack-minded approach on home turf. The likes of Graham Carey, Oscar Threlkeld and substitute Louis Rooney caught the eye, while Jake Jervis saw a volley hit the post. \nAn FA Cup shock proved beyond them on this occasion but, currently sitting second in League Two, Plymouth are well-placed to claim the real prize of promotion this season. \nMark Ogden is a senior football writer for ESPN FC.
