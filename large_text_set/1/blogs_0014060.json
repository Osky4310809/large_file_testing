She believes a healthy lifestyle is the key to happiness.\n“I feel that a healthy lifestyle can cure all manner of physical and mental ailments,” King said.\n\nPhotos of Jennifer King Caters \n\nCaters \n\nCaters \n\nCaters \n\nCaters \n\nCaters \nAd Up Next \nArrest made in connection to deadly T.I. concert shooting :0 A online hip-hop personality was busted Monday in connection with... 6 View Slideshow\nBack Continue Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Advertisement This 50-year-old farmer is ripped January 16, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T12:35:05.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
