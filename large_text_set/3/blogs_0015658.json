It’s to mark the spring equinox.\nThe spring equinox, also called the vernal equinox, is today (Monday, March 20, 2017).\nBut did you know that spring technically begins twice?\nOn the meteorological calendar it always starts on March 1 every year, while on the astronomical calendar it changes each year.\nHere’s all you need to know.\nTell me more about the spring equinox (Picture: Met Office) The spring, or vernal, equinox is today.\nAstronomical seasons begin on a different dates each year and totally vary in length, depending on the Earth’s 23.5 degree tilt on its rotational axis as well as its orbit around the Sun.\nSpring and autumn equinoxes (equal day and night) and the summer (longest day) and winter (longest night) solstices mark the start of the astronomical seasons each year. The word ‘equinox’ itselfactually mean ‘equal’ (equi) and ‘night’ (nox).\nThe dates of these change each year as they are dependent on the Earth’s position. The Earth is closest to the Sun, known as perihelion, in early January and furthest away, aphelion, in early July.\nWhen is the start of meteorological spring? Hot air ballooning in spring (Picture: Flickr) The meteorological calendar splits the seasons into four equal periods, with spring, summer, autumn and winter all lasting exactly three months of the Gregorian calendar.\nThis means spring on the meteorological calendar falls on the same date every year – March 1 – lasting through March, April and May and ending on May 31.\nMeanwhile, summer starts on June 1 each year (June, July, August), autumn starts on September 1 (September, October, November) and winter starts on December 1 (December, January, February).\nSo we start spring twice? Spring blooms (Picture: Flickr) Yes, our Gregorian calendar is based on lunar movements and doesn’t take into account the Earth’s rotational axis in relation to its orbit around the sun.\nThis means we need both a meteorological spring based on the calendar months and an astronomical spring based on the Earth’s orbit and proximity to the Sun.\nMeteorological spring helps us compare seasonal and monthly statistics as well as forecasting while astronomical spring is perfect for determining when temperatures are going to start getting milder.\nHow does the spring equinox tie in with Easter? Lamb walking in field of flowers (Picture: Flickr) The date of Easter is linked to the astronomical calendar, which is why it changes each year.\nThe date is always the first Sunday after the first full moon (Paschal fullmoon) after the Spring equinox.\nThis is because this is close to the date of Jesus’s Last Supper, crucifixion and resurrection.\nSo which spring definition is the better measure? Low Angle View Of Pink Cherry Blossoms (Picture: Flickr) While the astronomical seasons might give a better idea of when temperatures will get milder, the meteorological calendar is a lot easier to use when comparing one season to the last.\nThis is due to the seasons being equal length each year compared to the wildly varying season lengths with the astronomical calendar.\nThe Met Office, for example, and other forecasters around the world use the meteorological definition of seasons as this ‘determines a clear transition between the seasons’.\nMORE: It’s the Spring Equinox: How well do you know your spring flowers? \nMORE: When do the clocks go forward in 2017?
