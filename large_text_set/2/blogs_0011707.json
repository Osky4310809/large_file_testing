But later on in the show, Adele did the tribute to George Michael.\nAdele did a slowed-down version of one of my favorite George Michael songs, Fast Love . I nearly broke my jaw while cringing when I heard that Adele was going to do that song, because it is a great slut anthem and makes you want to give a stranger a lap dance, or troll for some dick in the park, or put up a Craigslist Casual Encounters ad with your real phone number hidden in it. Fast Love is not meant to be some sappy, melancholy, elevator song. So I was all ready to say three words that would’ve opened up a trap door to hell under my couch. The three words being: DAMN YOU, ADELE!\nBut I changed my mind when she stopped after her first verse, blew out the fuck word (which was bleeped, BOO!) and said, “ I’m sorry, I can’t mess this up for him, I’m sorry, I can’t. ” Adele then turned away from the mic and said “ Fuck .” I like to think that George Michael was in the afterworld, loving every damn minute of this extra dramatic moment.\nWatch Adele's tribute to George Michael in full here: pic.twitter.com/LmsfYFKMaG\n— Adele Daily (@AdeleDailyInfo) February 13, 2017\nAm I still here for Adele’s version of one of my favorite ho shit anthems? Not totally, but I appreciate her starting over for George Michael and dropping the fuck word. And yes, next year, she will get the Grammy for the Best F Bomb Dropped During The Grammys.\nPics : Getty, Wenn.com , Splash", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "https://t.co/LmsfYFKMaG", "http://pitchfork.com/news/71424-grammys-2017-watch-adele-perform-hello/", "https://twitter.com/AdeleDailyInfo/status/830978698060894208"], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:42:57.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
