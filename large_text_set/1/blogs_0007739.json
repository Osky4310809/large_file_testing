If the prognosis here is to be believed, then Ryan Reynolds and Emma Stone best get practicing their winners’ speeches as La La Land looks set to wipe the floor with all competition.\nWith Jimmy Fallon assuming host duties for this year’s edition, the serious business of “who won what” was offset by a barrel-load of humor and nonsense.

After taking the stage for his opening monologue, Jimmy Fallon’s teleprompter somehow crashed, meaning the comedian had to rely on ad libs and self-depreciating humor to untangle himself from a sticky situation. Twitter, it seems, was not impressed:\nJimmy Fallon is lame and incredibly unfunny\n— Shawn Collins (@mouthofsouth) January 9, 2017 \n\nJimmy Fallon is like the vanilla ice cream of late night hosts, if vanilla ice cream was bad and unfunny\n— Bad Boy Billy Hoyle (@BadBoyHoyle) January 9, 2017 \n\nI'm amazed that it has taken this long for Hollywood to wake up to the fact that Jimmy Fallon is seriously unfunny. Then again, Hollywood…\n— Justin Pyvis (@JustinPyvis) January 9, 2017 \n\nThank You Donald Glover! #Culture 01.27.17 pic.twitter.com/BzSwDZdEPi \n— MIGOS™ (@Migos) January 9, 2017 \n\nRaindrop, drop top… As Migos and Lil Uzi Vert’s “Bad and Boujee” continues to kill both the charts and meme game, Donald Glover managed to fit in a co-sign to the trap troupe while accepting his award for TV smash Atlanta. “I really wanna thank the Migos — not for being in the show — but for making “Bad and Boujee,” like that’s the best song ever,” said an effusive Glover. We can’t say we disagree.\nMeryl Streep's #GoldenGlobes speech on Donald Trump has everyone talking https://t.co/4h17inAJWU pic.twitter.com/0UHXUnL9pg \n— BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) January 9, 2017 \n\nThese awards were never going to pass off without some kind of diss aimed President-elect Donald Trump, who Jimmy Fallon earlier compared to Game of Thrones villain King Joffrey. It was during Meryl Streep’s lifetime achievement speech where the damage was really done, however, as the actress — seemingly born badass — delivered a powerful speech criticizing Trump on a wide range of topics. Described by some as career-defining, as of writing, Streep is currently the top trend on Twitter with 759,000 mentions.\n \nCongratulations to Tom Hiddleston ( @twhiddleston ) – Best Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries – The Night Manager – #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/6Hzj9OTsAA \n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 9, 2017 \n\nIn categories where they weren’t expected to do particularly well, series led by British actors swept up. Starring Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Lawrie, and Olivia Coleman, AMC’s The Night Manager beat out competition from mammoth hits like The People v. O.J. Simpson in the section of “actor, mini-series or television movie,” while The Crown won “best drama series,” eclipsing favorites such as Westworld and Stranger Things. Rule Britannia…\nBahahaha loser pic.twitter.com/bYNgxOFM8z \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 9, 2017 \n\nSeriously, you had one job. Having been nominated for his role as producer and supporting actor in hit musical La La Land , poor John Legend looked understandably disappointed when it turned out those in charge of the name cards had misspelled “Legend” by adding in a superfluous “d”. Ledgend’s* supermodel wife Christine Teigen was low on sympathy for the R&B veteran, taking to Twitter where she branded him a loser.
