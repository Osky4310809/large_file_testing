I think Bell Biv DeVoe are gonna wear that on our sleeve. We've got that type of pulse between mainstream America and the streets.\" \nThree Stripes also arrives alongside The New Edition Story , an extensive three-night biopic about the Boston R&B outfit, which featured all three members of Bell Biv DeVoe, plus Johnny Gill, Ralph Tresvant and Bobby Brown.
