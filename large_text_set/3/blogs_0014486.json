Even just this year, wages have gone up 2.5 percent year-over-year and Glassdoor data show that median U.S. pay for full-time workers has grown by 3.2 percent from just a year ago.\nWhile employment and pay are on the rise, the BLS reports that there are two buckets that occupations fall into these days: occupations projected to grow, and occupations projected to decline.\nTrends have shown that healthcare and technical occupations are on the rise, and Glassdoor has worked hard to show job seekers a variety of companies hiring for those roles. However, BLS says there are about 200 occupations that are projected to see decreased rates of employment . Yes, sadly, there are jobs that are going extinct much like the black rhino, thus we’ve put them on an endangered list.\n“Two major occupational groups are projected to see employment decline: production occupations and farming, fishing, and forestry occupations. Together, these two groups are projected to shed 339,300 jobs during [2014-2024],” according to the BLS site .\nSo why are we telling you this? Are we trying to throw a wrench in your week?\nNot at all. We want to equip you with information so that you have everything you need to endure rough waters or to make a career change.\nIn that vein, we are highlighting 15 jobs that the BLS has deemed as “fast declining” and have seen significant job losses. Plus, we suggest roles that employees may want to consider transitioning into and that are on the rise. We recognize and respect that many of the roles that are being phased out have required certification and years of practice.\nHowever, these alternative jobs — even if not obviously translating your current skills and may require a bit of training and a pivot — can lead you to start a new chapter in your life. For example, employment of phlebotomists is projected to grow 25 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations and the median annual wage for phlebotomists was $31,630 in May 2015.\nView As: One Page Slides Andreas Rentz/Getty Images 1.
