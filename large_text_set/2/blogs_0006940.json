A data-informed view of the obsession with GPA and GRE scores Posted Feb 08, 2017 MORE \nThis is Year 13 of flipping through dozens of applications to determine the small number of people to be interviewed for a slot in the Clinical Psychology Ph.D. program at George Mason University . At this moment, faculty all over the United States are doing the same thing for social, developmental, industrial/organizational, counseling psychology and human factors programs (among others). \nA few notable trends over the past few years. \nFirst, applicants are spending multiple years in multiple research laboratories to gain research experience. Fantastic. I have been advocating for this for years . \nSecond, there has been an explosion of publications and presentations at scientific conferences. This year, I had one student with 9 publications (insane) and three students with over 15 conference presentations (holy bejeezus!). \nThird, there has been a rise in the number of applicants who developed their own research project from the development of questions to dissemination via paper or manuscript. There has been a rise in the number of applicants who served as project coordinator for a grant-funded project by a faculty mentor. This is huge. Applicants know the nuances of how to conduct research and deal with the anal warts of no-shows, video recording malfunctions, careless survey data responses, and participants reporting suicidal ideations. An apprenticeship ensures that an applicant knows what they are getting into as a scientist. Source: Howard Kalin, used with permission \nDespite these trends, I have found that faculty - who I refuse to name - rely on decades-old strategies to sift out applicants. Namely, does someone have a sufficient GPA and GRE score? My own students are regularly rejected by graduate programs despite serving as my project coordinator on sophisticated grant-funded studies, presenting first-author talks and posters at scientific conferences ( that they earned ), and being a co-author on manuscripts submitted to top-tier journals - studies that involved experience-sampling and hierarchical linear modeling (skills that they learned over months of training). \nI write this blog post to point out 20-year old forgotten research. \nDo you know what GRE scores predict? First-year grades in required courses in a Ph.D. program. Do you know what nobody training independent researchers, teachers, and clinicians care about? First-year grades; that are inflated with almost no variability. And if you want to explore meta-analytic findings, know that GRE scores predict an average of 6.3% of the variance in graduate level grades in courses. GRE scores do not predict anything that is useful for graduate school. \nThe rules switch from undergraduate to graduate school. Students move from convergent thinking and test taking to divergent thinking, where they must devise their own research interests and questions, and acquire the methodological, research design, program evaluation, and statistical skills to test these questions and interpret the data. The GRE scores do not predict any of these skills. \nNow, if you care about the GPA of graduate students in specific courses required for a Ph.D., and are less interested in their research skills, clinical acumen, and leadership capacity, by all means, continue to judge students by the quantitative scores on their transcript. But I am speaking to you - the faculty holding the fate of students lives in your hands. If you do not care about graduate school grades then do not be a hypocrite and use the data to guide you. \nBe brave. \nRead their CV. If they nabbed a GPA over 3.0, move on. What is the quality of their research experience? Do they know how to hit the ground running to contribute to your research lab? Will they be a good colleague with you and your other graduate students? Is there at least one persuasive letter attesting to character strengths that set them apart from the pack? \nBe a maverick. \nDo not rule out great potential psychologists because they do not know the antonym for bailiwick or the cosine of 30Â°. It just doesn't matter. Do not rule out students because their GPA sucked in their first year of college, before developing an interest in psychology. \nThere is unlikely to be a national march against the admissions process for Ph.D. programs. So this is it. Resist the temptation to let the arbitrary scores overly influence you. I suspect you will be rewarded with students who are more thoughtful, imaginative, and impactful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:53:58.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
