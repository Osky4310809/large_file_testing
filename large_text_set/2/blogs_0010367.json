Every time the NY brand previews its forthcoming collection, the internet is flooded with hatred, hysteria, memes and “RIP Supreme” comments.\nWhether you love it or hate it, everyone has an opinion on Supreme. and everyone goes to check out the brand’s lookbook and collection preview, even if it’s just to say that it’s all garbage and anyone who buys anything is a complete moron.\nSupreme dropped its SS17 lookbook and collection preview yesterday, and naturally the Highsnobiety editorial team was quick to check out what the biggest streetwear brand on Planet Earth has got up its sleeve this season, even though we all know it’s going to be nigh-on impossible to actually buy any of it, what with the huge lineups and bots plaguing the online store.\nWhether we’ll actually get our hands on them or not, here’s the Highsnobiety editorial team’s favorite pieces from Supreme SS17.\n“I’m obsessed with Supreme’s fruity summer shirts, and this cheeky pink number absolutely stinks of me. Bowling shirts are a vibe, pink is a vibe, Playboy not so much, but fuck it — I’d wear this with some obnoxious sunglasses, jeans and Gucci loafers. I’d look like an absolute arsehole in the best way.”\n— Alec Leach \n“The Obama shirt and trackie bottoms convo is my pick. Despite Obama’s many shortcomings and disappointments as a president, he’s a big finger in the eye of all the yokels that made Trump the Republican nominee and gave horribly ignorant people that never vote in the primaries or mid-terms the opportunity to make him president. The clothes themselves might be ugly, but the fact that his non-white presidential smile will piss off some really terrible human beings makes it worthy of my endorsement.”\n— Aleks Eror \n“Hands down the Sade tee because I ride ’round listening to Sade and it’s about the only thing I could wear without feeling like I was trying too hard.”\n— Maddie Holden \n“Given the bleak forecast for our political future right now, I really wouldn’t be mad about resurrecting Emiliano Zapata and watching the anarchist horseman do some damage. After all, Zapata was all about expelling corruption. Given the fact that there’s a not-so-subtle nod to former President Obama elsewhere in the SS17 drop, this quilted jacket emblazoned with a portrait of Zapata, a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, makes a lot of sense. I’m sure there’ll be another protest on the horizon to wear this to.”\n— Kam Dhillon \n“If I buy something from Supreme, there has to be some kind of personal connection. The brand has a lot of clever designs, but some stick with me more than others, and it’s interesting to see this Pulitzer-winning image used with new meaning. Although Supreme isn’t the first to reference the flaming monk Thích Quảng Đức, who was also used by Rage Against the Machine, this T-shirt perfectly embodies the brand’s edgy approach to graphics. The monk burned himself to death, as a response to Vietnam’s oppressive government at the time, so maybe Supreme is trying to say something about the current political climate in the US?”\n— Chris Danforth \n“The Metrocard is the kind of wasteful flex that’s so ludicrous it’s lowkey brilliant. Pragmatic from an everyday commuter standpoint, but by all means superfluous, it’s more useful than last season’s brick, while also demonstrating Supreme’s continued power to make literally anything seem cool. Wonder when they’ll make an Oyster card for the lads across the pond.”\n— Jian DeLeon \n“With the Supreme x Coleman mini bike, the New York brand has hit a new level of ridiculousness. We’ve seen plenty of custom rides baring the red bogo, but this official step-up shows the brand’s ability to make any already novel product that much cooler. Of course it’s practically useless unless you live in the countryside, but if I lived on a ranch I’d 100% cop.”\n— Brock Cardiner \n“The Incense Matches are a strong example of Supreme taking an everyday item, slapping their logo on it and making me smile at the audacity. The GR green “rain” version of these matches have been a staple in my bathroom for years, yet I never once thought I needed a “fashion” edition. To be fair, I still don’t, but much respect to Supreme for co-signing the good good.”\n— Pete Williams \n“My favorite piece from Supreme SS17 is the black/teal bomber jacket. First of all, I love bomber jackets, they’re an item you cannot possibly have too much of — it’s never enough. The jacket has black cuffs, which is a big plus, cos that’s the part that gets dirty the quickest. Thirdly, I think that Aztec/Turkmen carpet print is wavy, and wavy is good. Last but not least, the Supreme logo is more subtle than on the rest of the clothes, simply because I don’t want to walk around looking like a walking lick.”\n— Sanzhar Toxanbayev \n“It’s Sade. #nuffsaid.”\n— Edward Chiu \n“I wasn’t immediately impressed by this drop, but after a quick scout of the preview I saw a thread come through that has me equally as excited for summer as it has for this collection. The candy colors and sketched flowers on the Been Hit longsleeve is vaguely reminiscent of De La Soul’s 3 Feet High and Rising artwork, and when placed among other standout items in the collection for me ( lavender terry small box tee , Elephant tee , leopard print nylon water short , purple striped logo windbreaker ) I’m high key feeling the late-80s summer-in-the-city vibe this drop is pushing.\nBlame it on my childhood but this hit of nostalgia just sold me on the upcoming season.”\n— Marta Sundac\nIn other Supreme news, here’s some new leaks of the brand’s forthcoming Nike collab. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:35:25.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
