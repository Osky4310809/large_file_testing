But neither the mayor and every member of the Vancouver City Council are expected to attend the event. \nMayor Gregor Robertson has moved politics in Canada’s third-largest city and Pacific Rim hub way to the left. Robertson is a former director of the George Soros-affiliated Tides Canada and several influential members at city hall were on the Tides payroll. \nTides Canada, though a charity, actively promotes a variety of environmental and global warming issues as well as other preferred uber-liberal causes. \nVancouver Councillor Geoff Meggs said by boycotting the event today he is “reinforcing my support for the mayor’s position that the name [of the tower] is at odds with the values of the city.” \nThe Trump Tower has been technically open for business since January and has already attracted protesters from Vancouver’s lively pool of left-wing agitators. But today’s grand opening is expected to attract some renewed interest. \nVancouver police are ready to maintain order outside the hotel when the expected protesters arrive and will be reacting to traffic flow interruptions as a result of protesters attempting to block streets. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police issued a statement that it will be responsible for “the safety and security of designated internationally protected persons.” \nThe Trump brothers will be protected by U.S. Secret Service personnel who are traveling with them. \nNot everyone in Vancouver is unhappy to have a Trump symbol on the Vancouver skyline. Billionaire developer Peter Wall says he will be on hand to meet the Trump sons and to celebrate a U.S. president who Wall says has brought a “breath of fresh air” to the White House and American politics. \n“I really, really like him. I predicted he’d win and I thought he should win,” Wall told The Globe and Mail . “There’s such a malaise in the world and … he’s paying attention to the people who are workers, I think. This is an amazing man, whether they like him or not, to stand up to so much duress. I like this guy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T17:06:31.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
