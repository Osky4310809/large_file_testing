According to Gallery Books , an imprint of Simon and Schuster, Raising Trump is a book about “motherhood, strength and resilience.” The book, which will include chapters on her childhood in Czechoslovakia and her “whirlwind romance” with Donald Trump, will focus primarily on raising the three eldest Trump children, Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka.

The Associated Press notes that the couple’s divorce included a nondisclosure agreement. Donald and Ivana have had legal tanglings over that nondisclosure agreement before; in 1992, Donald sued Ivana, claiming that her romance novel, For Love Alone, was a lightly fictionalized version of the marriage and violated the nondisclosure agreement (the novel includes a scene where Donald Adamleaves a “smear of semen on the dark silk” lining of a fur coat) . Ivana countersued but the two ultimately settled out of court. It’s worth noting, too, that Ivana endorsed her ex-husband’s candidacy, at one point describing him a “feminist,” and Raising Trump will include “memories” from the couple’s three children.

Even though you’re surely dying to read this book, you’ll have to wait a bit. Raising Trump is slated for release on September 12.
