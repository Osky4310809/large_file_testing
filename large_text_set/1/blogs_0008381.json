Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThis is unmistakably Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United now, after a ninth straight win put them on the brink of the EFL Cup final. \nBut it was goals from two men signed by the much-maligned David Moyes – who lasted just 10 months at Old Trafford – that saw the Reds plant one foot on the Wembley turf. \nJuan Mata and Marouane Fellaini scored the goals that will give Mourinho a shot at a fourth League Cup triumph – and a first trophy as United manager - next month, to stand alongside Sir Alex Ferguson and Brian Clough. \nDespite the 2-0 win over visitors Hull, however, Mourinho was in no mood to celebrate, berating his players for celebrating Mata’s goal with half-an-hour left, and the crowd for a perceived lack of enthusiasm.
