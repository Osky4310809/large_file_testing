Composure usually comes later in their career,’ Ferdinand told BT Sport.\n‘His movement is sensational, that’s not an 18-year-old’s movement mentally.’\nBENJAMIN MENDY (AFP/Getty Images) Mendy was a constant thorn on City’s right-hand side and with Pep Guardiola in the market for a new left-back, he could do a lot worse than bringing the Monaco defender to the Premier League.\nThe 22-year-old’s stamina and intent to get forward at every opportunity made him such a huge threat for Monaco, while his delivery into the area was often precise and dangerous, as shown with the low cross which set up Fabinho’s goal in the first half.\nNo defender in the Champions League has more assists than Mendy this season, and with Arsenal, Liverpool and City all on the lookout for a new left-back, the Frenchman could be in high demand this summer.\nBERNARDO SILVA (AFP/Getty Images) Monaco could be looking for a new jewel in their crown this summer following Silva’s sublime performances this season.\nGoing forward, the Portugal international was at his effervescent best in the first leg against City but in the return fixture, he showed that even the most creative players can pitch in with their defensive duties as he made as many successful tackles as Mendy, Monaco’s centre-back, Jemerson, and Fernandinho.\nSilva has been Monaco’s creative force this term, scoring six goals and registering seven assists in 28 Ligue 1 appearances so far.\nThe 22-year-old has been heavily linked with Chelsea and Manchester United, and admitted to The Times that he would be keen to play in the Premier League one day.\n‘Of course it’s nice to be associated with that kind of club but I haven’t thought a lot about it,’ he said.\n‘One day I would like to play in England or Spain, in one of the best leagues in the world, but for now I’m very happy here.’\nFABINHO (AFP/Getty Images) The 23-year-old began his career at right-back but off the back of his superb display in central midfield against City, you wouldn’t know it.\nFabinho had all the defensive qualities, as shown by his well-timed tackle on Leroy Sane in the second half to stop a City counter, but the Brazilian was excellent going forward, too.\nHis range and choice of pass was bettered only by Kevin De Bruyne at the Stade Louis II, and his goal was straight out of the handbook of an attacking midfielder as he found space inside the box and finished first time from Mendy’s low cross from the left.\nMORE: Jose Mourinho reveals his biggest ever fail in the dressing room \nMORE: Why Radamel Falcao missed Monaco’s Champions League clash with Manchester City ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:03:29.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
