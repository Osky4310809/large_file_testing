Well, liberals on Twitter apparently thought Miller was flashing a racist hand sign to his fellow White Power brethren. Trump: I don't know where anti-Semitism is coming from.RELATED: @POTUS aide flashes \"white power\" hand signs on TV pic.twitter.com/20KNHuOY8d \n— The Daily Edge (@TheDailyEdge) February 21, 2017 \nAnd they claimed to have the evidence to prove it: Tweeting until people listen! \nStephen Miller flashes a \"white power\" sign from the White House! \nRight hand = W \n— Susan Allor (@susan_allor) February 22, 2017 \nYep. As an article posted last night on Daily Kos highlighted , Miller was intentionally making his hands create a W and P: \nYou might think that’s an odd natural gesture to make. And it is. What Steve is doing is complete intentional: \nThe right hand, on top, is showing just three fingers: “W”. His left hand curls to make the “P” formation. WP. White Power. White nationalists know exactly what that sign means. According to the Anti-Defamation League, this is a common white supremacist hand sign “particularly” used in California. (Stephen Miller is from Santa Monica.) \nBut, there’s only one problem — this is all most likely completely and utter BS. \nBesides noticing that in that photo, Miller is in all likelihood just adjusting his tie and jacket before making an appearance on CBS’s Face the Nation , there are a couple of other reasons to easily dismiss this theory. \nOne, is he even really making a ‘W’ and a ‘P’ with his hands like all the racists apparently do in SoCal? Maybe one can make the case of a W, but I don’t see a P on the other hand. And it definitely isn’t being done in the specific manner the ADL shows as an example. You really have to stretch to make this case. \nTwo, Miller is Jewish. Even if he were to embrace white supremacy and reject his Jewish background, he wouldn’t be accepted by white supremacists. This is something that was noted by an ADL researcher when Snopes began investigating this claim earlier today. \nA photo of White House staffer Stephen Miller has been circulating on social media in which people claim that Miller is surreptitiously sending a “white power” hand sign to, one presumes, viewers. However, he seems merely to be adjusting his suit and tie, while his hand positioning does not actually resemble the “WP” hand sign that some California-based white supremacist street gang members use. More importantly, there is no reason why Miller would even know of such an obscure symbol, much less use it, and in any case, Miller is Jewish and would be rejected by white supremacists on that basis. There is simply no credibility to this claim. \nLook, I get it. Miller has pushed and embraced an extremely conservative and nationalistic political agenda, specifically when it comes to immigration. Recent profiles of him do not paint a rosy picture of the man when it comes to his formative years in high-school and college regarding his interactions with minorities and comments he made in the past. He worked for Jeff Sessions before coming aboard the Trump team and now reportedly works hand-in-hand with chief strategist Steven Bannon , who has been described by Democratic leadership as a white nationalist/supremacist. \nSo, yeah, I can see why some liberals may want to really, really, really believe there is something there. But there isn’t. At all. So stop sharing the photo. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:05:55.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
