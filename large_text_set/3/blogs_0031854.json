They haven’t said who they found — or even if they know — but said it appeared to be a murder. \nThey said Holt was a person of interest, and they were looking for him. The next day, authorities returned and pulled a second body from the water. It was Holt. \nAmid questions at the scene from mid-Missouri news reporters, Gasconade County Sheriff John Romanus said, “investigators are saying this is a unique situation.” \nIn a brief interview Tuesday, Romanus said there was a need to hold back information. Once the case is closed, he said, people will understand why he couldn’t be more candid. Did he know the name of the first victim? \n“I haven’t released anything regarding the earlier located remains,” he said. \nIs there a killer at large? \n“That’s a question I can’t answer.” \nIs public safety at risk? \n“At this point, none that I am aware of.” \nHolt was listed as having a Florissant address. But a family member who lives nearby said he had showed up at their home outside Owensville around Thanksgiving. “I come out of the shower buck naked, and there he was,” said Chris Yoder, who is married to Holt’s stepdaughter. \nHolt stayed for about a week with the Yoders and their children in a shack next to their home . \nThe couple arranged for Holt to move into a vacant house on Dragster, several feet from the pond where he was later found. Holt lived there rent-free, in exchange for caring for the place, Chris Yoder said. He lived alone with a parrot. \nAround the first week of March, Holt moved back in with the Yoders. His power had been cut off for nonpayment. He was cold. \nYoder said he last saw Holt on March 18. The conversation was mundane. Holt told him he was going to go to Save-A-Lot and was going to fix a mailbox. Yoder then went to Washington to pick up parts for a vehicle, he said. \nWhen Yoder got back, he passed Holt’s car at the house with no power. “I saw his car there and I thought he was chilling out with no electric.” \nYoder said Holt didn’t come home on Sunday, and didn’t show up for work on Monday. He and his wife called police on Tuesday. \nWhen police showed up, Holt’s car was still at the house. The groceries and mailbox were in the car. Authorities didn’t say how and when Holt entered the pond, if they knew. \nYoder had “no idea” how it happened, or who the other body could be. \nHolt had brushes with the law, but no extensive criminal record. Court records indicate he was on probation for five years after a burglary conviction in 2007. He had been living with a woman in a rented home in Florissant when they were evicted by court order in February 2016. \nThe landlord said in an interview that Holt had a series of health problems, including a heart attack. The couple fought a lot and did not pay rent. \nThe woman’s posts on Facebook indicated she and Holt had been married in mid-2015, but the marriage was breaking up around the time of the eviction. She told her friends that Holt had “put his hands on me.” There was no divorce on record. \nThe woman could not be reached for comment. Her Facebook posts ended just after the eviction. \nIt wasn’t just the Post-Dispatch who couldn’t find her. \nA friend and former neighbor said she had not seen or heard from the woman in more than a year. The friend said she was worried and was going to go looking for her. \nAnd a former social worker assigned to the woman’s case, reached by a reporter, said she too had been concerned that she “dropped off the map” after daily contact.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:25:21.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
