FX CEO John Landgraf broke the news at the Television Critics Association's Winter press tour on Thursday, saying, \" American Horror Story launched the modern limited series revolution and, as evidenced by the most recent installment Roanoke , it remains as vital today as when Murder House stunned audiences six years ago. Each new chapter is a cultural event, beloved for every new twist in imagery, style, cast, and plot. We are thrilled that Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and the entire creative team will continue to deliver the groundbreaking, celebrated American Horror Story for years to come.\" \nIf the show continues to debut each Fall, this means we'll be stocked with AHS until 2019! Then again, Ryan Murphy has talked about wanting to do two seasons in one year , so perhaps there will be a scheduling shakeup soon.
