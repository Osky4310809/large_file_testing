David Carson dcarson@post-dispatch.com \nST. LOUIS • Great Danes named Mabel Lou and Maggie Moo wore matching tutus and jumbo Carnival beads. Chewy was an alligator, Gus a crab. Tuco, sporting dark pinstripe and red tie, played a gangster. \nAnd little Bentley of Kimmich Manor, all of 2.4 pounds of Teacup Yorkie, strutted bravely in a Superman cape. \nSeveral thousand dog owners dressed up their pooches in Mardi Gras attire for the 24th annual Beggin' Pet Parade Sunday in the Soulard neighborhood, where excuses for a street party come easy. Lovers of dogs, sunshine and anything Mardi Gras lined the streets five to 10 deep to watch people stroll with dogs in zany costumes. \nNot all the dogs were dolled up, but there was no dress code. Plenty of of them happily trotted down the street in their birthday furs. \nOrganizers were thrilled by the turnout. They didn't have a firm count of parade pets, but 1,200 had been registered online. Volunteers at the headquarters booth stayed busy signing up parade-day entries. \nThis statistic might help: Paradegoers got to watch about 45 minutes of dogs and humans amble along the eight-block route in the zig-zag disorder that dogs like best. \n\"It's such a fun day to see all costumes,\" said Nicole Fink of Belleville, whose dog Isabelle was a black-and-orange spider. \"And it's great for the dogs to do all this socializing.\" \nJudging from all the sniffing going on, plenty of news was passed around Sunday in Soulard. \nThe weather couldn't have been more blessed. Morning fog burned away to a blue sky and a balmy 71 degrees, which is 25 above normal for late February. Soulard was filled with the sounds of outdoor blues bands and jams of people lining up at sidewalk bars outside neighborhood establishments. \nAnd in a warmup to next Saturday's big Mardi Gras parade, many of the people present Sunday showed up in their Carnival finest. Marchers tossed beads into the crowds of grasping onlookers. \nTracie Quackenbush, director of the Open Door Sanctuary in House Springs, said she was optimistic that Sunday's turnout would beat the record $20,000 raised by the pet parade two years ago. It has supported the sanctuary since 1994, when the event began with perhaps 300 dogs and was known as the Mystic Krewe of Barkus. As the parade caught on, Purina became sponsor to promote its Beggin' line of dog snacks. \nThe parade is open to all pets, but dogs rule overwhelmingly. There was hardly a cat in sight. A solitary rabbit rode in a cage on a children's wagon. Stella Palmer, 12, of Crestwood, brought her pet hen, Speckle, which perched calmly on a milk crate as Stella watched the parade go by on Russell Boulevard. Stella brought her for a simple reason: \"I don't have a dog.\" \nJudging from the crowds, almost as many dogs watched on leashes from the sidelines as took part in the event. Donna Meier of Ellisville cradled curly little Bentley from the sidewalk as she explained how they had been in the parade before, but didn't register in time. \n\"This is such a nice family event. Kids and dogs,\" said Meier. She rubbed Bentley and said, \"Let's do it again next year.\" Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:18:13.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
