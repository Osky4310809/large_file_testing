When quizzed on the same by reporters at an event, the Baar Baar Dekho actor said, “Even I was thinking why he (Varun) looked at Alia. Even I got puzzled!” While Sidharth and Alia have never opened up on their alleged relationship, the actors do drop hints like this at times, which add fuel to the gossip!
