Fayose if he attacks Mr President who is a public figure, peddling rumours against his family relations such as Alhaji Mammam Daura must be condemned. \nHauwa noted that it stands to reason to say that Fayose who obviously has become “a victim of an ingrained phobia of Mr President’s uncompromising integrity, must have lost it when, contrary to his wishes the man returned to his responsibilities hale and hearty. \nShe further pointed out that though people are entitled to right of speech and expression, such rights must not be abused by “venting nonsense and irritating imaginations out of plagued minds”. Judging by recent happenings in our governance circle, “it is clear that no cabal exists, and Daura heads none except in Fayose’s melodramatic mind”. \nPublic statements by Fayose in recent times have fallen short of the expectations of the virtues and grandeur of the office he holds. It is so shameful and immoral that a man occupying such a position should wish death on the President of his own country, or any other for that matter, when all the man live for is to ensure a better, sane Nigeria. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:54:36.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
