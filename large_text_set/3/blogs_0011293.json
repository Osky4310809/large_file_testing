A new clue has popped up to suggest that a sequel to The Evil Within  is in the works.\nA private Japanese job listing for Psycho Break 2  ( The Evil Within 's series name in Japan) was leaked and posted to NeoGAF . The listing is specifically for translation and quality assurance positions. Of course, this is a full-on rumor as nothing has been confirmed by either publisher Bethesda or developer Tango Gameworks.\nBut, this also feels like a particularly plausible rumor. The framework for a sequel is certainly there and it probably feels like a safer investment now that the property is somewhat established. Still, it should be noted that the first Evil Within  was an extremely divisive game. It's likely that Shinji Mikami, the master of survival horror, is getting a second chance to invite people to see his twisted intentions for The Evil Within .\nRUMOR: Evil Within 2 / Psycho Break 2 in production  [NeoGAF]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:31:16.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
