Their current playoff run as been described as something of a revenge tour.

Hopefully the second game of today’s double header, the AFC championship game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots , treats us a little better.\n\nBelieve or it not, this is only the third postseason game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots, and only the second meeting since Ben Roethlisberger was installed as quarterback. In 2001 the Patriots beat the Steelers 24-17 and be a them again in 2004, this time by the score of 41-27. Both times around, New England went on to win the Super Bowl.\nNeither team is coming out of what could be called a convincing win. The Patriots played one of their sloppiest games of the year, making mistakes that kept the Houston Texans in the game before they finally pulled ahead of them in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the Steelers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in their divisional game, but they did so without scoring a touchdown. To state the blatantly obvious, they won’t be able to win that way today.\nThe key for a Steelers win might will be Le’Veon Bell who is in the midst of revolutionizing the running back position with his ability to pause, read defenses and find the perfect vulnerability to exploit. Then there’s Ben Roethlisberger, the only quarterback in the NFL who is at his best when plays break down. They’re going to be a challenge.\nNot that the Patriots themselves will be an easy task for Pittsburgh. Although they will be without tight end Rob Gronkowski, the closest thing the league has to a cheat code, they still have Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, maybe the best coach/quarterback combination In NFL history. \nIn other words, this appears like a game between equal teams, which hopefully means it won’t be anything like the earlier game. As always we want to hear from you. Send us your emails (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com ) or twitter (to @HunterFelt ) throughout tonight’s game and we’ll make use of them here. It’s the Pittsburgh Steelers vs the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium. Opening kickoff is set for 6:40pm EST, but we’ll be back before then. \n\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.13pm GMT 19:13 \nHunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s how Paolo Bandini sees the game panning out:\nIt feels like a bizarre quirk of NFL history that Tom Brady and Ben Roethlisberger have not met in a postseason game for 12 years. The Patriots sealed their fifth conference title by beating Pittsburgh back in January 2005, and all but one of the AFC Championship Games played since then have featured one of those two teams - but somehow never both at the same time.\nIn his career, Brady has tended to get the better of Roethlisberger: winning six out of eight head-to-head matchups. Those numbers do not include New England’s 27-16 victory at Heinz Field in October, of course, since the Steelers quarterback missed that game with a knee injury.\nRoethlisberger’s availability this Sunday is not the only reason to believe his team can do better. Pittsburgh’s defense has improved dramatically since that first meeting - racking up 33 sacks and 19 turnovers over its past 10 games, compared with just 11 sacks and nine turnovers in the first eight. The reintroductions of James Harrison and Bud Dupree to the starting outside linebacker positions have helped to deliver significant improvements in the pass rush.\nThe Steelers have also shown greater commitment to the running game. After serving a three-week suspension, Le’Veon Bell only surpassed 100 yards rushing once in the first six games he played this season. He has done so in seven out of eight starts since. So far in the playoffs, he has shredded Miami and Kansas City for a combined 337 yards on the ground.\nNew England’s defense, which ranked third against the run during the regular season, ought to present a stiffer challenge. But if they focus their energies on slowing Bell down, might that leave opportunities for the Steelers elsewhere?\nRoethlisberger has had a deeply uneven season, posting a 20:5 touchdown-to-interception ratio at home, but just a 9:8 ratio on the road. He failed to steer his team into the end zone even once during last weekend’s victory in Kansas City. And yet, he is the probably the best quarterback New England have faced since their home defeat to Seattle in week 10.\nYou can only beat the teams placed in front of you, but it remains true that the Patriots have not seen many good ones in the past two months. Of their seven consecutive wins to end the regular season, only one came against an opponent bound for the playoffs (Miami). And it was not until Brock Osweiler began his second-half meltdown that they really pulled away from Houston on Saturday.\nThe Steelers faced several bad teams during their own nine-game winning streak, and there are plenty of reasons to doubt their ability of winning in Foxboro. New England’s defense is not only better equipped than most to slow down Bell, but in Malcolm Butler can also boast one of the few cornerbacks capable of matching up one-on-one with Antonio Brown.\nI’m well aware, then, that I’m making this pick on a gut feeling, rather than any unimpeachable logic. But I find myself leaning towards the upset. Steelers to win \nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:39:33.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
