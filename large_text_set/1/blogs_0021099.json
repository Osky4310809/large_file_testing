I’m going with my secretary,” he said. “Because I think Pompeo’s going to be phenomenal.

And if they don’t want to do, that’s fine. If they do want to do, then I will work toward that end. I want to do everything within the bounds of what you’re allowed to do legally.” \nMattis said in his confirmation hearing he opposed the use of torture. Pompeo made a similar comment, but noted in a later written response that he would be open to changes in the rules for interrogating suspects. He did not define what those changes might be. \nPresident Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2009 banning waterboarding — a form of simulated drowning — and other harsh interrogation techniques denounced as torture.
