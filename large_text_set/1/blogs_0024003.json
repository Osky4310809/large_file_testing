Bush 1,205 days to see over half the country disapprove of them. \nThe Republican managed to win November's US election by claiming certain key swing states in order to clinch the presidency, despite losing the popular vote by 2.9 million ballots . \nThis may go some of the way to explain why his approval rating is 24 points lower than Barack Obama's when he was just eight days into his presidency. How does Trump compare to other presidents before they took office? \nE ven before his inauguration his approval ratings were the lowest of any president in two decades. \nAccording to Gallup , the last three presidents had approval ratings of at least 65 per cent during their presidential transitions - significantly higher than Trump's. \nSome 75 percent of America's approved of the way Obama handled his transition, while 65 per cent approved of Bush and 67 per cent approved of Clinton. \nThis compares to Trump, whose transition was approved of by 48 per cent of Americans - while another 48 per cent disapprove. \nAccording to Gallup, one key reason Trump's transition approval lags behind his predecessors' is because the opposition is far more critical of him. \nBefore his inauguration, Gallup said: \"Trump still has time to turn the tide and avoid starting his presidency with the lowest public support in Gallup's polling history, but that would largely entail gaining the support of independents and, in particular, Democrats - most of whom appear reluctant to back him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T15:31:52.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
