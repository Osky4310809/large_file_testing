ICM is a team-based model of care serving individuals with severe substance use disorder, who may or may not have concurrent disorders and/or mental illness. These individuals face complex challenges related to health, housing and poverty, and face barriers in accessing existing health or social services. \nShelter spaces \nThe Province will provide funding for an additional 30 overnight shelter spaces at the Maple Ridge Salvation Army to ensure the most vulnerable members of the community have a place to sleep and the opportunity to connect with support services. The target population will be people transitioning out of the Rain City temporary shelter. The extra spaces will be open for six months. \nClosure of temporary shelter \nBC Housing has informed RainCity Housing that, as part of the closure plan for the temporary shelter at 22239 Lougheed Hwy., new intakes will end effective March 1, 2017. A curfew will also be implemented at that time. BC Housing will be meeting with RainCity, the RCMP and the City of Maple Ridge to discuss implementation of the closure plan. \nBC Housing will work with the Fraser Health Authority and non-profit partners to assist those currently in shelters in Maple Ridge with services provided through the ICM model and with rent supplements for more stable housing in the private market. \nThe Province remains committed to providing $15 million in capital funding towards a permanent shelter and/or supportive housing program, and will form a community committee to identify an appropriate location. \nHope for Freedom \nThe Province will provide $50,000 in funding to pay for a new kitchen for Hope for Freedom, an abstinence-based program in Maple Ridge that serves people with addictions, who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. \nInvestments in Affordable Housing \nThe Province has committed $11 million for a new development at 11907 228th St., to be operated by the Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows Community Services Housing Society. This building will provide 80 units of affordable housing for seniors and families. \nAn additional $1 million has been committed through the Provincial Investment in Affordable Housing Initiative to the Iron Horse, a safe house for vulnerable youth that will operate in Maple Ridge. \nIn terms of the long-term use of 21375 Lougheed Highway, discussions will take place between the Province and the City on the future uses for the site, such as affordable housing for seniors or families. \nThe Province has also announced that Coast Mental Health has taken over as the new operator for Alouette Heights, a supportive housing development that provides 46 units of supportive housing. \nRent subsidies \nThe Province will provide $252,000 for up to 40 rent subsidies for the ICM program to ensure access to affordable housing with dedicated supports. Fraser Health will work in close collaboration with the ICM team to provide comprehensive wrap-around services. The increased rent subsidies, and supports provided by ICM teams, will help at-risk individuals with obtaining longer-term housing solutions. \nQuotes: \nMarc Dalton, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission – \n“Today’s announcements are in response to community engagements that we have had over the past months. Public input has been vital to our efforts and focus. In collaboration with the Province and community partners we have developed a plan to provide the services for those most in need, while considering the valid concerns of residents.” \nDoug Bing, MLA for Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows – \n“We are confident that this approach will lead to positive outcomes for our most vulnerable citizens. We will continue to work with the community to find an appropriate location for permanent shelter and supportive housing development.” \nDr. Victoria Lee, chief medical health officer, Fraser Health – \n“Stabilizing people who use drugs is the first step in helping them recover to live a healthy, vibrant life. The Intensive Case Management team will be a support for these individuals who face complex challenges, ensuring that they receive health care services, housing and other needs to help them transition to more stable lives.” \nDarrell Burnham, CEO for Coast Mental Health – \n“Coast Mental Health has been successfully managing supported housing developments for 45 years. Today, we operate 14 different supported housing developments across the Lower Mainland. We ensure our tenants have the support they need to thrive as members of inclusive and safe neighborhoods. We look forward to working with the staff and residents of Alouette Heights and contributing to the broader Maple Ridge community.” \nDarrell Pilgrim, executive director, Salvation Army Ridge Meadows Ministries – \n“The Salvation Army is committed to serving the people and communities of Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows. We appreciate this opportunity to provide temporary emergency shelter to those who are experiencing the challenges of homelessness. In an atmosphere of dignity and respect, the Salvation Army will continue to provide vital support and transformational programming that assists individuals as they move toward independence and permanent, stable housing solutions.” \nQuick Facts: Since 2001, the B.C. government has invested $4.9 billion to provide affordable housing for low income individuals, seniors and families.
