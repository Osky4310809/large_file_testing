Metallica Confirms 3 More 'Hardwired' Songs Ready for Live Premiere Lars says it's very rare that fans demand new songs this much. UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 2 hours ago 2 \nLars Ulrich revealed that after premiering 6 songs off the new album \" Hardwired... To Self-Destruct \" live in concert, Metallica is gearing up to unleash three more fresh tunes upon the audience at upcoming gigs. \nIn case you're wondering, those 6 tracks are \" Hardwired ,\" \" Moth Into Flame ,\" \" Atlas, Rise! \", \" Now That We're Dead ,\" \" Halo on Fire ,\" and \" Confusion .\" Additionally, \" Lords of Summer \" - the album's bonus track - was also played live in concert. \nSince there are 12 songs on the album and 6 were already premiered live, this means there's a 3/6 chance, or 50%, that the band will finally perform \" Spit Out the Bone .\" Seeing that the thrashin' tune is among the more popular and requested tracks, one could argue the odds are even higher. James Hetfield Reveals the Street Punk Band He Took the Phrase 'Spit Out the Bone' From Anyhow, Lars told DR (via Google Translate): \"Our new album's been received much better than we had hoped for and expected. We've played six of the new songs the past few months and we love to play them. \n\"It is very rare throughout our 30-year history that people [request] we play more of the new numbers. We do not hear that often; often people say, 'Yes, they will play more of the old songs!'\" \nThe drummer concluded: \"But we have started practicing three other new [songs], so maybe we'll also play those.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:29:49.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
