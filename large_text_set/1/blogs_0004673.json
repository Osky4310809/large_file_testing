President Vladimir Putin himself direct the hacking of the computers of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign?\nWell, yeah, probably -- if we are to believe our (for the next two weeks) Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who regrettably is not able to show the actual evidence to the public for fear of \"compromising sources\" or some such.\nClapper, it will be remembered, blatantly lied to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on March 13, 2013, when he replied to Senator Ron Wyden's question \"Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?\" with a resounding \"no,\" which the DNI then doubled down on.\nPoor Clapper got a bit of egg on his face, several dozen actually, only three months later when Eric Snowden revealed to the world that the NSA was collecting just such data on those millions of Americans via our cellphones.\nBut no matter. Let's assume, arguendo, that James is telling the truth this time. After all, John McCain and Lindsey Graham assure us it's true. (If you're interested in more on Clapper, I recommend the wryly titled hasjamesclapperbeenindictedyet.com , now at day 1397.)\nLet's ignore too the well known fact that every country, friend or foe, with sufficient computer capability is cyberspying on as many allies and enemies as much as possible all the time. Let's also ignore the other well-known fact that the USA over the years has covertly monkeyed with the elections of other countries on several occasions, against friends and foes, most recently our supposed great ally Israel. It's no surprise Barack Obama would do just about anything in his power to upend someone he despised far more, until a few weeks ago, than Vladimir Putin -- Benjamin Netanyahu.\nHuckabee: If Obama's So Against Foreign Election Interference, Why Did He Interfere Against Netanyahu in Israel?!?\nIn fact, I'd be willing to bet that Obama spent more U.S. taxpayer money -- via his cut-out OneVoice -- to defeat Netanyahu than Putin ever did to defeat Hillary.\nYou know how I know? Hacking into the Podesta emails must have cost about five dollars -- okay, fifteen. Can you imagine this conversation?\nFSB AGENT: Comrade, er, President Putin. You will never believe this. We were able to obtain the emails of John Podesta, the campaign manager of Mrs. Clinton, with a simple \"phishing\" trick.\nPUTIN: Agent Shostakovich, do you want to go to Lubyanka? No one is that stupid. This is 2016.\nWhich leads me to the real question. What was learned by the American people, the Russians, or anybody else by the supposed Russian hack of the Hillary campaign and the DNC? Let's break it down to three basic areas that appeared via WikiLeaks.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/rogerlsimon/2017/01/07/what-we-learned-or-didnt-from-the-russian-hackers/\nload more View as single page", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubyanka_Building", "http://www.hasjamesclapperbeenindictedyet.com/"], "published": "2017-01-08T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T09:18:18.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
