Everything around it changed so there are so many things we can talk about but it has been very positive as you can see,\" he said. \n\"The manager can get a lot out of this group and everyone can feel that there is a positive vibe. Everyone is looking in the same direction which is important. \n\"I think for everyone you need a different kind of approach and there is a way to look at things and approach everyone to try and get the best out of them. I think he does it very well. Tottenham 4-0 Stoke \n\"The manager and staff explain all the time that they want a certain type of person at this club who you can trust and it's becoming a big family who want to strive for the same goal. \n\"He wants people who will fight for the club, who will fight for each other, have respect for each other, respect the rules and everything around it needs to be good before you touch a ball. For us, it gives us a good atmosphere at the club.\" \nTottenham endured mixed fortunes in February. They were knocked out of the Europa League by Gent and beaten by Liverpool in the league but returned to winning ways against Stoke last weekend and also cruised past Fulham to reach the last eight of the FA Cup. \nNext up is Everton - live on Nissan Super Sunday - who are unbeaten in nine Premier League outings and are also in touching distance of the European spots. \nDembele adamant that Tottenham are continuing to grow in confidence and thinks their home form will be crucial in determining their final league position as the season enters its final third. Dembele has praised manager Mauricio Pochettino for his impact at the club \n\"The last few weeks were difficult for us but the way we showed how we played against Gent was very important with that attitude. We showed not everything is finished with us and the way we played was very good,\" the Belgian said. \n\"I think there are moments when we play very well, where we controlled the game against these good teams so of course, when it's not your day and you're not playing well, it is frustrating. \n\"At home, we are favourites but in the Premier League, it doesn't exist. We know of cases when it goes wrong but for us, I think the way we played in the last week, we have confidence and we know that if we do our job in training, we don't have to fear anyone so I think we are ready for the game.\" \nTottenham will be celebrating the first year of its Official Charity Partnership with Noah's Ark Children's Hospice this week. \nNoah's Ark provides care and support to children and young people with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions.
