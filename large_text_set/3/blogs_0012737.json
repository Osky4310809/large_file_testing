The payout, which takes into account depreciation, might not even be enough to offset the hire purchase loan, which is extra bad news for the already grieving owner. \nThis is where Return To Invoice (RTI) insurance , now made available by Mercedes-Benz in Malaysia, comes in handy. RTI insurance – purchased on top of comprehensive motor insurance – essentially bridges the regular insurance settlement amount (current market value of the car) and the original purchase price of the car. RTI insurance covers total loss, theft and fire. \nWith RTI coverage, you will now have the same amount of money to spend on a replacement car as you originally spent on the car that was damaged/stolen. The above graphic by Mercedes-Benz explains it clearly. \nRTI insurance, also known as GAP (Guaranteed Asset Protection) insurance, is not a new concept and it has been offered in other markets. Lately, car brands have been working with insurers to offer this sort of protection in Malaysia – RTI-GAP Insurance by Nissan and Peugeot Protect are examples. Both Tan Chong and Naza are working with AXA Affin for their RTI insurance offerings. The Mercedes RTI plan is underwritten by Allianz and AXA Affin.
