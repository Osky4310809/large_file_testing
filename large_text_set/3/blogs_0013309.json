Saint Petersburg was called Petrograd at the time and was the capital of the empire. \n“ Announcement that Russia had overthrown the autocratic government and joined the ranks of progressive nations was received here with unmixed joy ,” the New-York Tribune reports from London. The New-York Tribune/ Library of Congress \nThe paper noted how swift the uprising was that overthrew the centuries-old Russian monarchy. “Until Sunday night, this pageant continued without serious interruption. Then in a flash, the whole scene lost its theatric quality; it became a genuine revolution, ” the Tribune reported. \nOn March 18, it runs a cartoon showing a mighty peasant, representing the Russian people, unchaining himself and setting free from the old regime and “plutocracy.” The New-York Tribune/ Library of Congress ‘Blow to Teutons’ \nAlthough Russia is part of the Allied Forces at war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, the Russian Tsar and his entourage face criticism from British and American media who accuse the Romanovs of pro-German sentiments. \n“The German influence appears now to be entirely eliminated from the government of Russia, ” declares the New-York Tribune. \n“ Czar’s downfall blow to Teutons, ” a headline in Evening Star, an American newspaper published in Washington, DC, screams.
