For instance, a believer may treat a highly idiosyncratic event as a “miracle,” while an unbeliever might call the same event a “coincidence.” In fact, there is no basis in reason for either judgement, so one side is just as irrational as the other. Hegel pointed out, contra Kant, that truth presented itself more as a continuum than an antinomy (Kant’s “either/or”), while Derrida rejected that the poles of the continuum can stand on their own in the first place (Derrida’s “neither/nor”). “Belief” and “Unbelief” both make a “leap of faith” to establish evidence for their respective points of view. Atheists assume their stance is more rational because they simply uncritically assume faith is baseless, even though Atheists adopt the mundane explanation without any justification (Atheists “already assume” cold materialism without demonstrating it, and so proceed to interpret nature from that groundless framework). Such is the nature of the postmodern epistemological deconstruction of faith issues. The “atheism/theism” debate proceeds with both sides pointing out the groundlessness of the assertions of their respective opponents, without realizing, to reference a children’s story, that their own emperor has no clothes. Perhaps one day debaters on both sides will awake from their dogmatic slumbers and realize that neither side can be rationally defended. jh \nWell, as an atheist, it isn’t cold materialism. It’s simply not adding pink unicorns to an explanation. It’s acknowledging the weakness of human ability in pattern matching. It’s looking at probabilities and avoiding confirmation bias. It’s applying the simplest explanation rather than some convoluted explanation that introduces elements that are not necessary. \nThis world cannot continue when a substantial portion of the population chooses to ignore evidence in preference to “revealed subjective knowledge”. To put it simply, we cannot survive on just words. We cannot survive when groups of people go “no gay marriage because of our god”. their reasoning is spurious and subjective. We cannot survive when groups of people go “no climate change because god promised no floods” nonsense. This self-deception is dangerous to the existence of every living creature on this planet. There must be some common reference points and facts that everyone can agree on without invoking some personal subjective, non-testable experience. \nAs an ex-christian, I cannot understand why I believed in a god, especially the christian god. The emperor has no clothes and now, I cannot un-see the flaws and the obvious human invention that went into creating christianity. \nbelieve what you want. Just apply it to yourself. Acknowledge that other people do not believe what you believe and they aren’t evil for rejecting your beliefs. Help create a society where secularism is the basis for our public square and reality is respected. You can believe in Santa Claus if you want. Just don’t make laws based on St. Nick’s bullshit. John MacDonald \nAs I said: (1) Phenomenologically, the theist, atheist, and agnostic perceive “a highly idiosyncratic event.” The agnostic stops here. 2) The atheist and the theist continue on to make the unjustified leap of faith that the event is a miracle (for the theist), or a coincidence (for the atheist). http://timebottle.weebly.com/ Beau Quilter \nI’ve never met an theist who calls all “highly idiosyncratic event” miracles. I’ve met some theists who call some “highly idiosyncratic events” miracles. The rest they call coincidences. John MacDonald \nYou are right, of course. I didn’t mean theists would call “all” highly idiosyncratic events “miracles.” Allow me to rephrase: (1) Phenomenologically, the theist, atheist, and agnostic perceive “a highly idiosyncratic event.” The agnostic stops here. 2) The atheist and the theist “may” continue on to make the unjustified leap of faith that the event is a miracle (for the theist), or a coincidence (for the atheist). http://timebottle.weebly.com/ Beau Quilter \nWhat leap of “faith”? Most atheists I know would reserve judgement on the cause of any particular event in the absence of enough evidence. For that matter, most theists I know would do the same. \nOf course, withholding judgement on the any given event does not preclude one from assessing the likelihood of any particular cause. Even when proof is not possible; probability can still be assessed. \nAgnostic is not an exclusive term. In philosophy, the term has long been used as a descriptor that can apply to both “agnostic atheism” and “agnostic theism”. John MacDonald \nAtheists make these unjustified leaps of faith all the time. For instance, if naturalism is true, then (A) Where did the material that made up the “Big Bang” come from in the first place? (B) How did living organic material originally arise in the universe out of purely inorganic materials and processes? Atheists simply assume a naturalistic solution to the “arche” problems all the time, without having a generally accepted solution to how these happened without God(s). I’m not religious. I’m just speaking about epistemology, not ontology where we would have to pick atheism or theism. http://timebottle.weebly.com/ Beau Quilter \nWhat solution to those questions are atheists “leaping” to in “faith”? \nPhysicists and biologists (both atheist and theist) are still researching abiogenesis and models for the universe prior to and at the moment of the Big Bang. As far as I know, no one is claiming to have proven, or to have declared “faith” in, any particular model at this time, though they might see balances of probabilty favoring some models over others. \nI still fail to see the “leap of faith” you keep claiming. Nick G \nThe important thing is that John MacDonald has found a way of feeling superior to both theists and atheists. Nick G \nYou should learn to distinguish between unjustified leaps of faith, and provisional, justifiable assumptions. Naturalism (what you call “cold materialism”) is a high-level hypothesis, which could have been refuted by empirical investigation of alleged “highly idiosyncratic events” such as communication with the dead, the efficacy of prayer, psychokinesis, etc., or by sufficiently strong evidence of a miracle (such as the instant regrowth of an amputated limb) – and still could be, at any time – but has not been. It is therefore a provisional, justifiable assumption, and not an unjustified leap of faith. John MacDonald \nMaybe you should google “paralogism,” lol \nAs I said: \n(1) Phenomenologically, the theist, atheist, and agnostic perceive “a highly idiosyncratic event.” The agnostic stops here. 2) The atheist and the theist “may” continue on to make the unjustified leap of faith that the event is a miracle (for the theist), or a coincidence (for the atheist). \nAtheists make these unjustified leaps of faith all the time. For instance, if naturalism is true, then (A) Where did the material that made up the “Big Bang” come from in the first place? (B) How did living organic material originally arise in the universe out of purely inorganic materials and processes? \nAtheism is just as thoughtless as theism. It just falsely dawns the mantle of “critical thinking by pretending its assumptions are examined (which, in fact, they are not). \nAgnosticism is the only true path. Nick G \nYou fail, of course, to identify any paralogism. As for your questions: \n(A) We don’t know. Why you think this is any sort of refutation of naturalism is a mystery, since the hypothesis of naturalism does not entail that we should know everything. (B) See (A). \nAtheism, of course, does not entail naturalism. It is quite possible to disbelieve in gods while also disbelieving in naturalism. However, the hypothesis of naturalism has been subject to both conceptual and empirical examination for centuries. You claim to the contrary merely shows your ignorance. Chase Miller \n“the unjustified leap of faith” ie human nature Brandon Roberts \nkind of a cute cartoon Ann \nSadly, I have seen a brother of mine gravitate toward and then fully enter the far-right evangelical world. Interestingly, he for many years had had a very unenlightened view of the “Other.” He then managed to locate a community that calls itself Christian that fully reinforces his prejudices. In fact, he now is worse than ever before, having been given what he seems to regard as religious sanction for his attitudes. He’d probably say he underwent a “conversion”–a highly ironic term in this case. http://sherylclyde7.wixsite.com/leastofhischildren Sheryl Clyde \nTrump and the religious right just helped make this passage come true: \n2 Timothy 3New International Version (NIV) \n3 But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people. \n6 They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires, 7 always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. 8 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these teachers oppose the truth. They are men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected. 9 But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone. Chase Miller \nThat would describe most of the left and a significant proportion of the right, but then again it would describe a large proportion of humans for much of history Chase Miller \nThat there are Christians that believe that we ought to make the government bigger and that government will help the poor and homeless more effectively than voluntary giving, or even that the government is anything but a bane to moral religions, is mind boggling. Both the mainstream left and right seek the same thing: to expand monopolistic powers of government. With the left, they seek to do so domestically, cracking down on both personal and economic liberty, while the right wants to do that somewhat but mostly are war hawkish. The right is obviously preferable and a better path to diminishing government and creating voluntary societies. If the so called religious left thinks they will have any power in the future of developed nations, they ignore not only the complete ineffectiveness of the policies they support (resorting to post hoc fallacies to take credit for existing trends), but their own demographics.
