Ilesanmi Alade said the annual seminar provided opportunities for discussion of topical issue on national security. \nAlade said the theme of the seminar was apt because having technically defeated Boko Haram, there was the need to build upon the gains and guide against relapse or outbreak of any other crisis. \nOn his part, the Minister of Defence, Mansur Dan-Ali commended the armed forces for winning the insurgency war in the North East within a short period into the administration of President Buhari. \nThe minister, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Danjuma Shedi, said that the isolated attacks being witnessed were expected but assured that there would be an end to them soon.
