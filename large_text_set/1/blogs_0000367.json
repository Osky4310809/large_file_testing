Atlanta won 114-112 in overtime. AP ATLANTA — Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer finally has his first win over Gregg Popovich, his longtime former boss in San Antonio. It took career and season-high points from Tim Hardaway Jr. and Paul Millsap, respectively, to make it happen. Hardaway matched his career high with 29 points, including a tying 3-pointer with 3.3 seconds remaining in regulation, and the Hawks beat the Spurs 114-112 in overtime on Sunday night.

Millsap scored a season-high 32 points and had 13 rebounds for the Hawks, who snapped a string of 11 straight losses to San Antonio since 2010. “It’s great to get this win against a really good team and it’s good to get it for Bud,” Millsap said. “He’s happy to have it under his belt.” Budenholzer spent 19 years with the Spurs, the last 17 as an assistant. He downplayed his personal motivation. “You know, I was there for a long time,” Budenholzer said. “A lot of things we’ve tried to bring here … but at the end of the day it’s a game for our players.” Popovich knew the win meant more than Budenholzer revealed. “If we’re going to lose, it’s good to feel somebody on the other end was made happy,” Popovich said. It was only San Antonio’s third loss in 19 road games. Hardaway scored nine points in overtime, including the go-ahead free throw with 10.8 seconds remaining. He missed the second free throw but Millsap grabbed the rebound. Dennis Schroder also made only one of two attempts with 3.9 seconds remaining.

STREAKING Millsap scored Atlanta’s last six points in the third and first 11 in the fourth period for 17 consecutive points. He and finished with 15 in the fourth period. “I was just being aggressive, trying to make something happen,” he said. “I felt like we were real sluggish offensively at that point so I just tried to get something going for us and then Tim came in and did a great job.” FEELING BETTER Leonard had 13 points in his return to the starting lineup after missing two games with a stomach virus. He made only 3 of 12 shots from the field.
