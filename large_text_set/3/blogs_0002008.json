Twitter Reacts to Remy Ma Dissing Nicki Minaj Published Updated 4:49 pm EST, February 28, 2017 1 Comment By Danilo Castro 13.1k \nRemy Ma has declared verbal war on Nicki Minaj . \nThe NYC rapper, who just released her joint album with Fat Joe, Plata O Plomo , has now dropped a new track called “Shether” where she aggressively attacks Minaj’s status as the queen of hip-hop. \nThe title and beat is a nod to “ Ether ,” the classic Nas song that dissed Jay-Z in 2001, and Remy Ma takes a similarly brutal approach here. “You stole that line about b*tches being your sons/How you take my ’09 jail tweet and run,” she raps, before going on to mock with the line, “Talkin’ ‘bout bringing knives to a fight with guns/When the only shot you ever took was in your buns.” Remy Ma also claims that Hot 97 radio host Ebro slept with Nicki Minaj, and proceeds to borrows a snippet from Beyoncé’s cover of “ Darling Nikki ,” where the pop star sings “I met a girl named Nicki/I guess you can say she was a rap queen.” \nMinaj response to the record has been erratic and angry, taking to social media to criticize Remy Ma’s album sales and her relevancy in rap (or lack thereof), before hopping on a live feed for a few seconds without directly addressing the diss: I was on for less than 15 seconds and 69K ppl watched. 😂😩😂😩 https://t.co/xq7LYiwWpA \n— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) February 25, 2017 \nNot surprisingly, Twitter fans flocked to the news, and offered their thoughts on Remy Ma’s scathing takedown of Minaj.
