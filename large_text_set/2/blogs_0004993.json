(Photo: Getty Images) More Now that New Year’s is a distant memory, we’ve passed through a gauntlet of awards shows , and the Super Bowl is a stomachache away, one of the next winter traditions many look forward to is the annual Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue . With each new edition, there typically comes a slate of newcomers. This year, one rookie in particular caught our eye: Bianca Balti, a 32-year-old mother of two. Speaking to Fox News of her new rookie status, Balti admits she thinks it’s “so hilarious that at 32, I’m a rookie … [but] we’re definitely seeing more changes in the fashion world. For example, plus sizes are being more than welcomed … and you still see supermodels who are working and they’re 30, 35. It’s a good message.” A native of Italy, Balti is no newcomer to modeling, having worked for Dolce & Gabbana, among other brands, and appeared on Vogue , Cosmopolitan , and Harper’s Bazaar , just to name a few covers. Yet she considers her children, daughters Mia and Matilde, to be her biggest accomplishment. Though you might not guess it from their striking physiques, Balti isn’t the only model-mom who has graced the pages of Sports Illustrated , walked the Victoria’s Secret runway, and earned millions in fashion in recent years. Jourdan Dunn The London-born Dunn, 26, had her son Riley when she was 19 years old and famously returned to modeling work just 10 weeks after giving birth. Not only does she juggle modeling with her motherhood, but Dunn also has to manage her son’s sickle cell anemia . She has served as an ambassador for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America since 2014. Lily Aldridge Both a Sports Illustrated and Victoria’s Secret model, among other accomplishments, Aldridge has one daughter with her husband, Caleb Followill of the band Kings of Leon. Aldridge was an SI rookie herself back in 2014. As for motherhood, she recently credited becoming a mom with giving her an even bigger boost in her career. “One of the more surprising things is that I have an even deeper appreciation for fashion,” she told The Hive magazine . “I think it stems from the confidence that becoming a mother imparts in you. ” Doutzen Kroes This 32-year-old Dutch model has two kids — son Phyllon Joy Gorré and daughter Mylenna Mae Gorré — with her DJ-producer husband, Sunnery James. Known for her work with Victoria’s Secret, where she became an official Angel in 2008, Croes also credits motherhood for her success in modeling. “I’ve also become more successful since I’ve become a mother,” she recounted back in 2014 . “To me, that’s like proof that if you’re happy, that’s good for you, and people see that.” Natalia Vodianova One of the world’s top Russian models, Vodianova recently ranked No. 11 on Forbes ‘ list of highest paid models . Vodianova has five children, ranging from age 16 down to her youngest son, Roman, born in June 2016 . Known beyond her modeling for her philanthropy, she’s also a dedicated mother. According to the Daily Mail , Vodianova recently admitted to Porter magazine that she proudly proclaims to be a “very hands-on mother.” Lara Stone The 32-year-old Dutch model was married to British actor and comedian David Williams for five years. In that time they had one child, Alfred Walliams, now 3 years old. While Stone discussed not enjoying her pregnancy very much, particularly after developing an “addiction” to fried food, she has since bounced back and is enjoying motherhood. “I’m happier than ever, and I love every minute of being a mum,” she wrote in the forward to author James Duigan’s book Clean & Lean Pregnancy Guide . “And I no longer feel the jealous need to unfollow friends who post bikini selfies 10 days after giving birth looking amazing. Because everything is just how it’s supposed to be.” Of course, there are plenty of other exemplary model moms worth mentioning, including Chrissy Teigen , Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, and Gisele Bündchen .
