That is because he could be in jail. TMZ is reporting that Soulja Boy is facing felony charges for guns found in his house by police during his December arrest.\nThe L.A. County D.A. charged Soulja Boy with two felonies: possession of an assault weapon and being a felon in possession of a firearm. He was also charged with a misdemeanor for receiving stolen property because authorities claim that one of the guns in Souljaâ€™s house was reportedly stolen from a cop car.\nThe assault weapon charge is for a Mini Draco AR-15, which is illegal for anyone to possess in California.\n\nIf you recall, Soulja Boy was visited by cops in December because he was threatening people online with guns . He did this while he was on probation. \nIf convicted, Soulja could face up to four years in prison. On the bright side, Soulja could bulk up in prison for his boxing match against Chris Brown. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:29:54.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
