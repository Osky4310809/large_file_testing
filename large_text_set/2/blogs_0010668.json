According to a report from TMZ, Lady Gaga is launching a wine brand appropriately named Grigio Girls . At least, the TMZ report revealed that her company filed paperwork to not only produce wine, but wine coolers and wine cocktails as well.\nThe brand name Grigio Girls is also the title of one of the tracks on Lady Gaga’s newest album Joanne , so the concept could promote both her music release and her upcoming wine release.\nThe song Grigio Girls also has a heartfelt origin. Written as a dedication to Lady Gaga’s friend Sonja dealing with stage IV cancer , the song itself details friends popping wine open and crying together as they mourn their friend’s sickness.\nSonja is a warrior Queen. @sonjad7777 fighting stage four cancer. We did infrared sauna together today. Friendship is giving eachother lymphatic drainage. #oldsouls day full of #girls \nA photo posted by xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) on Jul 21, 2015 at 5:25pm PDT \nSo, launching a whole wine brand under the name Grigio Girls name also serves as a huge expression of love towards her friend. One of best friends for almost 7 years also a member of the Haus of Gaga has been fighting stage 4 breast cancer that is also now in her lungs & brain. I ask all my fans, friends, & family who I love for a favor today. Please pray for her & people all over the world who are suffering & surviving through cancer. And if you don't pray, just think on it. #PrayForSonja #ThinkOfSonja \nA photo posted by xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) on Aug 2, 2016 at 1:03pm PDT \nWe sadly don’t have any details about launch dates or prices at this point, just passing whispers in the wind tunnel of the internet. In the meantime, we can get pumped and emotional.\nJust think, in the very near future, devoted fans can down Gaga wine cocktails while blasting her album.
