There is also a big, expensive coffee and tea section, offering drinks from hibiscus tea lemonade to Thai tea lattes to cappuccinos. \nBut the stars of the show are the breakfast and lunch sandwiches â€” an unnecessary distinction, given that the breakfast sandwiches are served all day. \nThe most popular is the B.A.E., with bacon, scrambled eggs, avocado, sriracha-yuzu mayo and a cheddar crisp, served on the \"Hokkaido-style milk bun\" that almost all the sandwiches are served on, save for the errant house-made focaccia sandwich. EXPAND Danny Liao \nBut if you're looking for a new flavor combination, get something with sausage. Like the Rogue, with homemade truffle-sage pork sausage, eggs two ways, and that cheese crisp and sriracha-yuzu mayo again. Or, the larb burger, with a mint salad both on the bun and in the mayo. Weirdly, the breakfast offerings are a little too sauced, while the lunch sandwiches could use another dollop or two. But they're very nearly perfection, all big savory messes with a hint of sweet and spice. \nChimney isn't so popular that you'll get stink-eye for camping out with your laptop (free wifi is another selling point). It might get there someday, though, so try to get there soon. Oh, but don't drink too much coffee. Chimney's is strong enough to keep you up for three days. \n1100 N Main St., Chinatown.
