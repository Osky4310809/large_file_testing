Drain out the water. Rinse the noodles with cold water, drain them well, and then set them aside. In a small bowl, mix the hoisin sauce, chicken broth, soy sauce, sesame oil, and cornstarch. Then set the sauce aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a large wok or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Stir-fry the ginger for 30 seconds. Then add the onion and stir-fry for 5 to 7 minutes, or until charred and caramelized. Add the mushrooms and carrots and stir-fry 2 minutes more. Finally, add the broccoli, pea pods, and corn. Stir-fry the vegetables for 2 more minutes, or until tender, then transfer them to a plate. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the pan. Add chicken and stir-fry it until it's no longer pink, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cooked noodles, vegetables, and sauce to the pan. Turn the heat down to medium. Using two spatulas or wooden spoons, lightly toss the mixture until heated through, about 3 minutes.
