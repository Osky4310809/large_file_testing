He created the Monarch Operation , a support program for Mexican migrants in the US and plans on sending American companies in Mexico letters highlighting the equal benefits of NAFTA for the two neighbors.\nIt’s not just Mexico that is concerned about a possible breakdown in trade: on Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stressed the deep ties between the US and Canada, which is also part of NAFTA, in a video address to the newly sworn-in US Congress.\nBut most Mexicans still waved Trump off during much of his campaign, certain that he was little more than temporary comedic relief. Even after President Enrique Pena Nieto invited Trump on an official visit few believed he stood at a chance at reaching the White House.\nAfter his unexpected victory, Mexican authorities and the business community began scrambling to generate protective measures. The foreign ministry announced an 11-point plan to help anxious migrants in the US two weeks after the election. Reversing his critical stance of Trump, Carlos Slim, Mexico’s richest man, traveled to the president-elect’s estate in Florida to “open a friendly line of communication,” according to the Washington Post .\nThe Ministry of Economy said in a release Tuesday that it “laments” Ford’s decision. “The jobs generated in Mexico have contributed to maintaining manufacturing jobs in the United States, which would have otherwise disappeared in the face of competition from Asia,” it continued.\nThe ministry did not respond to an interview request from BuzzFeed News.\nFears of Trump’s policies come at a time when Mexico is facing growing economic hardships. Roadblocks swept across the country Tuesday as people protested a 15% rise in gas prices. The peso deepened its continued loses after the Ford announcement. The IMF, Moody’s and S&P have all downgraded their outlook for Mexico in recent months.\nIf Trump continues to pressure companies to return jobs to the US and follows through with his promise to abandon or renegotiate the NAFTA, Mexico could face reduced exports, a weakened capacity to attract foreign investments and further pressure on its currency.\nTrump’s hostile talk aside, Mexico’s economic fortunes are closely tied to growth in the US, and numerous economic indicators show the US economy is strengthening, with wages rising and consumer confidence surging.\nIn any case, analysts warn that Mexico must start preparing for the long term effects of Trump’s other policies, such as mass deportations. A sharp decrease in remittances, which account for 2.3% of Mexico’s gross domestic product, could devastate hundreds of communities across the country.\nThe government, they say, must create a clear and comprehensive strategy in the face of growing uncertainty.\n“All of these scenarios correspond to a country that isn’t doing anything to counteract them,” said Rodolfo de la Torre, an economics expert at CIDE, a research institute in Mexico City.\nBut, he added, “Mexico does not have to passively accept these consequences.”", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-dines-with-carlos-slim-as-relations-warm-with-mexican-leaders/2016/12/19/652ccf7c-c60f-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html?utm_term=.206504b84961", "http://expansion.mx/nacional/2016/11/16/mexico-no-esta-preparado-para-la-politica-migratoria-de-trump-analistas", "https://www.facebook.com/riospiterjaguar/posts/10154687125770359:0"], "published": "2017-01-04T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:32:54.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
