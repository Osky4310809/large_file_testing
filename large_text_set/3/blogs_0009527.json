There's a cleanser, a lotion, a clarifying treatment and a moisturizer, all to help ensure its users don't end up with zits like the Lee's known for.\nHer unusual rise in fame, and subsequent skincare line, comes thanks to the pimple popping videos that earned Lee her nickname.\nBut these zits are not like the blemishes you picked at in the mirror all through high school. These are massive, puss-filled monster cysts waiting for a gentle dermatologist to banish them for good. A quick glance at her Instagram is enough to decide whether you're in or out. With 2.3 million followers, it's clear Lee is onto something.\nNot brave enough to navigate directly to Dr. Pimple Popper's Instagram page? We've got five horrifying examples cued up for you, if you dare.\nCream. #drpimplepopper SOUND ON 🔈🔉🔊\nA post shared by Sandra Lee, MD Dermatology (@drpimplepopper) on Mar 7, 2017 at 8:40pm PST\nYou don't like it?!
