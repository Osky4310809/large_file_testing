Actor Prabhas finished his work on the project after devoting 613 days of his life to the magnum opus. He finished his part for Baahubali 2 and filmmaker SS Rajamouli thanked him with an emotional tweet. Prabhas plays Mahendra Baahubali in the second film that holds the key to the No.1 question, why did Katappa kill Baahubali. The film stars Prabhas, Rana Daggubati , Anushka Shetty, Tamannaah Bhatia and Sathyaraj in main roles. Baahubali has set a yardstick for Indian cinema with its scale and amazing production values. It is produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devinini of ARKA Mediaworks. \nThe first film was made on a budget of Rs 250 crore and grossed over Rs 600 crore till date.

He also wrote about how Prabhas held a Gumadhkay to signify that the shoot was indeed over. Baahubali 2 will come to the theatres in April 2017 and we cannot contain our excitement. \nThere was a lot of speculation that the teaser of Baahubali 2 will be attached to Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees. However, producer Shobu Yarlagadda confirmed that it is not true. This has made the fans’ wait even more longer. While Rana Daggubati had told us that shooting for Baahubali 2 was easier as the team was more experienced, we feel that was not the case.
