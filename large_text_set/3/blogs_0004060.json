The success of 'Hybrid Theory' was so big and so quick and so unexpected, it was like, 'I think we should do that again.' It was almost a very naive perspective of what we could do creatively. \n\"But we knew, if you just listen to those first two records, there's hints of pop - there's ' Breaking the Habit ,' there's ' Somewhere I Belong ,' there's ' Pushing Me Away ,' ' In the End ' - all these songs are pop songs, we've had that element to the band.\" \nDuring a previous interview with Q104.3, Chester said: \"What's wrong with [writing a pop song]?! With us, it doesn't seem to matter what kind of song we write, whether it's a pop song or a mid-tempo alternative song or a hip-hop track or a screamer. We get the same polarizing response from our fanbase every single time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T17:25:36.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
