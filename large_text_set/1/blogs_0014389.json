To be fair, though, there was that motorcycle carelessly parked just behind hers, which made getting out slightly more tricky. But she could’ve just moved that one farther away to give herself more leeway to begin with. \nPerhaps it’s for the best that the identity of the driver is not known. However, based on her motorcycle’s K license plate, this might have taken place in any of several regencies like Pati, Kudus, Jepara, or Cepu in Central Java. \nThe original video was posted on Facebook yesterday, and have since been viewed 2.6 million times and shared over 56,000 times on Facebook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T07:24:11.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
