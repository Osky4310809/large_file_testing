The United States beat France, 106-94. Carter happens to be wearing Nike Shox gym shoes.

Half man. All amazing. Legend.RT to wish @mrvincecarter15 a Happy 40th Birthday! üéÇüéÅ pic.twitter.com/G1LDTLMK9r ‚Äî Memphis Grizzlies (@memgrizz) January 26, 2017 \nTo celebrate his birthday, it's time to relive Carter's greatest feat: The Dunk. \nNow, it's not called The Dunk, but it should be. Flash back to the 2000 Olympics - Carter and the U.S. team faced France in the opening rounds. The forward stole a pass and took aim at posterizing 7-foot-2 center Frederic Weis (a 1999 15th-overall pick of the New York Knicks who never played a single NBA game) ‚Ä¶ and then this happened: \nThat's right: He didn't just posterize Weis. He dunked over the center. \nSay what you will about Aaron Gordon's Slam Dunk entry last year or any of Carter's slams from his legendary 2000 Contest win. This is the greatest dunk in basketball history, mostly because it happened in-game, but also because, well, just watch the dunk again. He leaped over another human being who is 7-foot-2. \nHappy birthday to the guy who brought all of that Vinsanity with him.
