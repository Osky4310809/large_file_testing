From the moment she was powered on and linked to various devices around our house, the voice-activated A.I. has had my son Henry’s attention.\n“Alexa, what’s the weather supposed to be tomorrow?”\n“Alexa, play Twenty One Pilots.”\n“Alexa, set an alarm for 7 a.m.”\nPretty simple stuff for a kid who already counts Siri as an acquaintance, knows his way around iPhones and Kindles and huffs at me when I can’t figure out the Xbox controller or TV remote.\nBut what’s he talking to Alexa about when I’m not in the room? And does her arrival in my house signal the end of an era, where I spend most of my time pretending to know stuff and Googling what I don’t?\nThanks to the Alexa app, a running list of everything Henry and his A.I. talk about can be accessed by me. I justify this invasion of my 10-year-old’s privacy on the simple fact that I pay for the Amazon Prime membership. And the mortgage.\nLet’s talk about movies, and the weather. (Amazon screen grab) In just under a week of boy-meets-artificial-girl bonding, the question-and-answer sessions range from misunderstood to enlightening to super cute. There’s stuff in there that I’m glad he’s asking Alexa. There’s stuff in there that I wish he had asked me. And there’s just a lot of music that I’d prefer he listen to in his own room.\n“Alexa, what does the fox say?” he asked.\n“What is this, 2013 ?” is what I probably would have replied sarcastically. Alexa was more game, joking, “Everyone asks what the fox says, but no one ever asks how the fox feels.”\n“Alexa, who stars in ‘Rogue One: A Star Wars Story’?” Henry asked, and she provided a nice photo of actress Felicity Jones along with a list of other stars in the film.\nI asked Henry what he liked about having Alexa around, and he said that she makes playing music fun. He also said that her answers to his questions come with more “details” than mine do.\nFor instance, when he asked me which building is the tallest in the world, I said, “I think it’s that tower in Dubai?”\nAlexa said, “The tallest building or building complex is Burj Khalifa.” She added that it’s a skyscraper in Dubai, The United Arab Emirates, and that its height is 2,722 feet (829.67 meters). Whatever. Showoff.\nHenry also said the cool thing about Alexa is that “she is one of those kind of electronics that gets smarter and smarter the more you use her.”\nI asked how he knew that and he said, “I read it on the back of the box.”\nThere’s no box that says anything about me getting smarter through repeated use.\nA sampling of music being requested on one kid’s brand new Echo Dot. (Amazon screen grab) Further along in the scroll of the app, there are a bunch of attempts by Henry to get Alexa to play “Simon says” and Henry clearly wanted to test her math skills, asking her repeatedly to multiply huge numbers. He followed this by asking who Greek mathematician Archimedes was.\n“Alexa, will my son embrace STEM?” is what I want to ask!\nA 10-year-old falls for Alexa. (Amazon screen grab) His 4th-grade homework this week involved looking up state capitals, which I would have preferred he did on a map, but there they are in a string of questions … “What’s the capital of Pennsylvania?” … “What’s the capital of North Carolina?” Oh, well. The three of us better have a conversation.\nA running list of more music I’ve barely heard of is oddly interrupted by a request to hear some Dean Martin. No idea what prompted that.\nAs for the weather, Seattle in March doesn’t give a kid a very exciting range of reports, but he keeps asking. Alexa dutifully replies with a lot of rain clouds and mid-40s temperatures.\nIn the end, my kid, who I generally regard as sweet and polite, didn’t surprise me with how he’s talking to his new personal assistant.\nShe’s mostly been a DJ so far, albeit one who is also a meteorologist, mathematician, geography whiz, historian, comedian and more. And she can be sweet and polite, too.\n“Alexa, I love you,” Henry said at bedtime one night.\n“Thanks, it’s good to be appreciated,” she replied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:01:16.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
