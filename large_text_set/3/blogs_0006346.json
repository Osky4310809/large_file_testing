The news should effectively end Inter Milan 's interest in the Italian. The deal could even be completed before Chelsea's FA Cup quarter-final tie against Manchester United on Mar. 13, after Sky sources reported it will be a \"matter of days\" before the 47-year-old puts pen to paper, per Sky Sports . There is no indication yet whether Conte — who agreed a £5 million a year , three-season deal with Chelsea last April —will be expecting a pay rise or any other significant changes to his current contract. Chelsea have enjoyed a phenomenal first campaign under Conte. They hold a seemingly unassailable 10-point lead at the top of the Premier League table and, with United visiting Stamford Bridge on Monday night, could even end the season winning the double. Conte would be the first manager to achieve this feat in his first year of English management since Kenny Dalglish in 1986 . Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images However, Conte's recent admission of homesickness —his family still live in Italy —has sparked rumours that he will not be in England for long. \"For sure, to arrive here is not easy,\" he said, per Sean Kearns for Metro . \"If you ask me if my family is missing me, honestly, I have to say yes, they are. It’s not easy to stay alone and live this experience with my family still in Italy. I hope to live this experience with my family next season.\" It is easy to see why Inter might be keen to capitalise on this development and snatch him away from London, although Chelsea correspondent for ESPN FC, Liam Twomey, doesn't think the story has legs: Liam Twomey @liam_twomey Don't think many have, but I wouldn't read anything into the Conte homesick reports. Chelsea not at all worried about his future #cfc 2/28/2017, 11:23:13 AM Inter are sixth in Serie A, six points shy of the UEFA Champions League qualification places and with little chance of finishing above Napoli , AS Roma or Juventus this season. A terrible start to the campaign saw Frank de Boer sacked on Nov. 1 , just 85 days after taking the job, and since then Stefano Pioli has steadied the ship. The club have won 10 of their last 12 Serie A games to put them within sight of UEFA Europa League qualification, although this does not appear to be enough to give Pioli any job security. The Nerazzurri have reportedly been in contact with Conte's agent, per Sky Sports . \"Rumours of other coaches are just part of football,\" Pioli said when asked about his position at the club, per Sky Sports . \"However, I do not lose the belief that I can do well for this club.\" Conte's new contract should fend off interest from Inter, who will have to look elsewhere for a new head coach, and reassure those Chelsea fans who were worried Conte's homesickness might cut his Stamford Bridge tenure short.
