Oh, just everyone ever. \nImage: MARK LYONS/EPA/REX/Shutterstock/mashable composite 2017-03-22 02:39:38 UTC Did you know Abraham Lincoln was a Republican? Donald Trump assumes you don’t! \n“Great president,” he said of Lincoln on Tuesday night. “Most people don’t even know he was a Republican. Does anyone know? Lot of people don’t know that.” \nTrump won the presidency as the candidate from the Republican Party, which has long called itself “the party of Lincoln.” \n“We have to build that up a little bit more,” Trump said. “Let’s take an ad. Let’s use one of those PACs.” Here’s that moment— Trump: “Most people don’t even know” Lincoln was a Republican, says PACs should take out an ad to promote that. pic.twitter.com/Hw9LrWqUFB \n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 22, 2017 \nPlease, someone start a PAC for the sole purpose of telling people Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. \nTrump was speaking at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee at the time, where he drained the swamp by helping members of Congress raise $30 million. \nJust as in the early days of our country, citizens took to their electronic tweeting devices to make their voices heard. “Great president. Most people don’t even know he was a Republican,” Trump says about ABRAHAM LINCOLN \n— Claudia Koerner (@ClaudiaKoerner) March 22, 2017 Trump asked an audience of Republicans if they knew Lincoln was a Republican. It’s hard to even comprehend what that says about him. \n— Schooley (@Rschooley) March 22, 2017 Also, did anyone check to make sure Trump knows that Abraham Lincoln is dead? \n— Lily Herman (@lkherman) March 22, 2017 \nAside from informing the world Abraham Lincoln was indeed a Republican, Trump also talked about his giant border wall, increasing the defense budget, and repealing Obamacare. \nAt one point, he uttered a phrase that will surely take its place in the history books next to “Four score and seven years ago.” \n“We have a lot of haters out there,” Trump said. \nLincoln, looking on from heaven, surely side-eyed America’s haters and proclaimed, “Cash me outside, howbow da?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:18:28.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
