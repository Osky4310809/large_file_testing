I will not gamble with American lives.” \nKelly closed by calling the orders “a matter of national security.” \nHe nails it. \nThe priority of the President and the DHS Secretary is the protection of American lives. \nEvaluation of the process for thee months, given the failure of the prior administration, seems an intelligent thing. \nIt isn’t a sacrifice of idealism, you can still help refugees without having to sacrifice safety and defense. \nThe best defense is not to create a problem to begin with, as Kelly realizes. \nThank God, we now have someone who gets it… LIKE this article? I hated this article. I'm a liberal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:11:07.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
