While he broke all records with AR Murugadoss' revenge drama Ghajini in 2008, he has come a long way since then as Dangal races towards the exceptional Rs 300 crore mark. Aamir Khan in Dangal. \nA year after Ghajini raked in Rs 114.75 crore at the box office, Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots garnered almost double the collections when it earned Rs 202.50, thus, surpassing the Rs 200 crore milestone in the process. After a dry spell of four years, during which he focused on his production house and acted in a couple of above average films, Khan struck back with the unparalleled success of Vijay Krishna Acharya's action drama Dhoom 3. \nThe third installment of the Dhoom franchise, that saw Khan in a double role, broke all box-office records when it earned Rs 272.20 crore. However, it was 2014 that saw Khan at his commercial best as he reunited with Hirani for the sci-fi satire PK . It stands as his biggest hit yet since it earned Rs 340 crore at the box office and emerged successful across borders, even in unlike territories like China. \nNow, Dangal has surpassed the Rs 250 crore mark and is expected to enjoy a smooth run for at least 10 days before Shaad Ali's romantic comedy Ok Jaanu releases on 13 January. If it manages to stick to the same trajectory at the box office, it is sure to be Khan's biggest hit yet. \nGiven the myriad range of roles he portrays on screen, his success at the box office is not formulaic but is based on a reliable instinct of the actor. While the instinct has faltered on a few occasions, the majority of his films in the last eight years have been blockbusters. \nMuch to our surprise, he has barely repeated his directors in this time period except in the case of Hirani who enjoys a 100% success rate at the box office, of which a large share of credit goes to Khan. With PK and 3 Idiots , they not only made some fine cinema but also minted a lot of money. \nThe only director-actor pairing of Khan that comes close to this one is his collaboration with Inder Kumar. The two churned out a couple of memorable, and successful, romantic comedies in Dil and Ishq. But the third one, Mann , turned out to be a disaster at the box office and in turn, put an end to their creative partnership that lasted for almost a decade. \nKhan's next film, excluding an extended cameo in his production Secret Superstar , will be Thugs of Hindostan in which he will share the screen space with Amitabh Bachchan for the first time. The film will be directed by Acharya which makes us wonder whether his partnership with Khan will click yet again after they made the immensely successful Dhoom 3 . If it does, the Hirani-Khan pairing will have a formidable contender to watch out for. \nFirst Published On : Jan 3, 2017 11:09 IST Related News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:46:55.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
