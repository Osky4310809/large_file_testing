Now, McKay has chatted with Shanlian on Batman podcast (via ScreenRant ) about why he thinks it’s a good idea. \n“Bruce Wayne in my mind came from privilege and I think that’s why he’s more dour and angry. He’s self-made as far as his becoming all of these cool things we like him for… Dick Grayson didn’t come from that. Dick Grayson came from a circus family. Essentially people who aren’t rich and they are self-made. They’re entertainers. They’re gymnasts. They’re people who live hand-to-mouth and that’s something that informs him and his attitude… he’s a fascinating guy to me, because he had all the same things happen to him. He’s got some of the same negatives as Bruce Wayne and then from a society standpoint — obviously he was adopted into Bruce Wayne’s life… but he didn’t start that way. He’s this guy who has all these negatives and then even more negatives and yet he remains… Those are things why I like Dick Grayson, why I like the idea of Nightwing as a movie.” \nIn the pages of DC Comics , Dick Grayson spent many years as Batman’s protege and sidekick, Robin, but eventually went off on his own and assumed the mantle of the hero Nightwing. The character spent some time in the streets of Gotham City but primarily called the neighboring town of Bludhaven his base of operations. \nThis isn’t the first time that McKay has toyed with the character either, as Dick Grayson appeared in The LEGO Batman Movie . Dick was also previously played by Chris O’Donnell in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin . \nThe Nightwing movie joins a growing roster of films in the DCEU, including this year’s Wonder Woman and Justice League , the soon-to-be-in-production Aquaman , and the in-development Suicide Squad sequel, Gotham City Sirens , Cyborg , Green Lantern Corps. , The Flash , and Shazam .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T20:18:24.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
