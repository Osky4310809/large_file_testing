The co-head of DC Films tweeted out last night, \"One of my favorite meetings ever...\" along with a lightning bolt and tagging The Rock and Black Adam, the character the larger-than life actor is signed on to play. \nJohns started as a comic book writer for DC Comics , with a knack for revivals. Whether it was reinvigorating the Teen Titans, or literally resurrecting Green Lantern and The Flash, Johns demonstrated that he knew how to breathe life into these characters. \nThen he became CCO of DC Entertainment, and started working more directly with video game designers, TV producers, and film producers to bring these characters he loved into other mediums. That dovetailed into more TV work, specifically producing and writing, helping develop the Arrow universe (especially The Flash , a character that remains near and dear to him). Once again Johns had great success, helping alongside creative minds like Greg Berlanti and many others, to build an entire universe on television of DC characters that culminated this fall in a four-night event. When it came time to course correct the DC Films group and get them under a more unified creative vision, naturally, they called Johns. He was also promoted to President of DC Entertainment (a title also held by Diane Nelson, for the record), and having successfully renewing the lives of individual characters in DC Comics, personally wrote the DC Comics Rebirth, bringing the whole universe into a new era. (Photo: The Rock / DC Entertainment) \nWhile Johns' exact role - and when his influence will truly be felt - has been a bit nebulous, he had a dedicated office on the set of Wonder Woman and reportedly had an even stronger hand in Justice League , so it looks like 2017 will be the year Johns comes into his own with DC Films. Meeting with a personality, actor, producer, self-made man like Dwayne Johnson certainly has him on the right track. \nJohnson even echoed Johns' mantra, one he told ComicBook.com about last year : hope and optimism. \n\"The compass of hope and optimism is in DC Comics' DNA, and it's important to get those [back] out there,\" Johns told Comicbook.com. As for Legacy, it's about \"moving forward\" and allowing \"things to evolve.\" \nIt sounds like he's still preaching that, as The Rock's post included those same words, when he said, \"Something we, as DC fans have all been waiting for for a long time. Hope, optimism, & FUN.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T21:46:05.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
