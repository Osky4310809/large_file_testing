ADVERTISEMENT \nArum said the “insane” sum turned Pacquiao’s head. \nFor the record, Team Pacquiao readily decried the $5 million offered by Australia to the Filipino boxing superhero, calling it peanuts. \nThere next came the report that there was an offer of as much as $38 million for Pacquiao to take his act to the UAE. \nMeanwhile, Amir Khan proceeded to loom as Pacquiao’s most likely foe, following a poll personally conducted by the fighting Filipino senator among his fans on Twitter. \nKhan topped that poll, with Horn taking the tail-end. \nOf course, there are more compelling fights, such as the one against the sensational undefeated world light welterweight champion Terence Crawford, which fans have continued to ask for. \nTeam Pacquiao had dodged Crawford at least three times, while the eight-division world titlist proceeded to face very convenient opponents. \nDo remember that trainer Freddie Roach had openly warned Pacquiao against Crawford, described as young, strong, talented and dangerous. \nAs for Khan, whose two recent KO defeats to Danny Garcia and Canelo Alvarez remained the most memorable en route to his negotiations with Pacquiao, the big question now is if there would be enough revenues to offset the huge purse involved. \nKhan, so far, has loomed not a truly dangerous foe, and therefore not wholly saleable. \nAn unbelieving Bob Arum said he would readily come in and help his treasured ward put up a Pacquiao-Khan title bout, but only if the reported $38 million purse is readily available, not a figment of the imagination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:01:43.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
