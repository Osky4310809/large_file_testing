The plan was that he would meet a colleague of the employee named Bill in a hotel lobby and pick up a blue duffle bag with the money. \nThe morning of the rendezvous, Wertkin allegedly texted \"Bill\" instructions right out of a spy thriller: \"When you walk into the lobby, there is a water station on your left. Just past the water is a chair with a newspaper on it. Please sit in the chair and I will come meet you.\" \nWhen Wertkin, wearing a wig, approached \"Bill,\" who was really FBI agent William Scanlon, he was arrested. Investigators then learned that Wertkin was a former Justice Department lawyer who, according to his biography, had led more than 20 major fraud investigations. \nThe complaint did not say how Wertkin allegedly obtained the sealed complaint or if he took it while he was working for the government. \nAkin Gump said he doesn't work there any longer. \n\"We are shocked and deeply troubled by the conduct alleged in the charges filed against Mr. Wertkin,\" it said in a statement. \n\"Honesty and integrity are at the core of our values and our client relationships. Immediately upon learning of these charges, we took swift action and Mr. Wertkin is no longer with the firm.\" Andrew Blankstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:58:43.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
