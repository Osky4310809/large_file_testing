Last weekend, Cassidy struggled to remember lyrics to songs he has been performing for decades and staggered off the stage during a concert in Agoura Hills, California. \nIn recent years, Cassidy has also made news for several personal struggles, including three DUIs from 2010-14, a divorce, and a 2015 bankruptcy.

Soon after achieving stardom, Cassidy quickly fell to substance abuse and attempted to distance himself from the clean image “The Partridge Family” bestowed upon him by posing nude for the cover of Rolling Stone in 1972. \nCassidy told People that he is looking forward to making the best out of life despite his diagnosis: “I want to focus on what I am, who I am and how I’ve been without any distractions. I want to love. I want to enjoy life.” 28 Movies That Have Grossed $1 Billion Worldwide (Photos) \nBillion-dollar movies aren't as rare as they used to be. Still, there aren't that many of them.
