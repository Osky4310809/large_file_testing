There is a reason the founders put freedom of the press in the very first amendment to the Constitution. As long as American democracy remains healthy, there will be reporters willing to pursue the truth, even if it means incurring the wrath of the most powerful person in the world. A free press isn’t the enemy of America; it’s a big part of what makes America great.” \nWatch above, via ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T19:16:58.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
