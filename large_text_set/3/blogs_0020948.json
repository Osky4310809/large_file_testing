While at the 2017 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards this weekend, we were so impressed with Gwen’s super-cool, slime-inspired hair that we nearly missed her ultra-sleek ponytail on the red carpet.\nWith a sly tuck and wrap-over, this ponytail is more than bold. It’s down-right statement-making in the chicest, most elegant way. From a pop princess who’s sported pink hair, black tips, and many, many other hair transformations over the years , this is one hairstyle we might not have expected. And that’s why we love it ~all~ the more.\nJeffrey Mayer/Getty Images Crafted by celebrity hair guru Danilo , who’s worked his hair magic on Cindy Crawford, Gigi Hadid and Amanda Seyfried among many other A-listers, this understated style isn’t totally dissimilar from a classic pony in which you wrap a piece of hair over to disguise an unsightly holder. Except with the extra thick section of hair and the ( near ) invisible fastening, it looks like this slicked ponytail was secured by the wave of a magic wand instead of ample amounts of hair gel and bobby pins.\nhoto by Steve Granitz/WireImage If you look closely at the slime-green hair Gwen sported after her slime-inspired outfit change, you’ll note she didn’t actually take out her ponytail before applying the temporary shade. Which basically means that this rock-hard pony is made of steel.\nPhoto by Kevin Mazur/KCA2017/WireImage Hand’s down, this is probably the coolest ponytail we’ve seen to date. But from cool girl Gwen, we’d expect nothing less.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T04:31:07.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
