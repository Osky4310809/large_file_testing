Char Dham \nLocated high up in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, the Char Dham (four temples) mark the spiritual source of four holy rivers: the Yamuna (at Yamunotri), the Ganges (at Gangotri), the Mandakini (at Kedarnath), and the Alaknanda (at Badrinath). Hindus consider a pilgrimage to the Char Dham to be very auspicious. Not only is it believed to wash away all sins, it will also ensure release from the cycle of birth and death. More Â» Auli. Mandeep Thander/Wikipedia 9. Auli \nUttarakhand even has a skiing destination! Auli lies on the way to Badrinath and has a 3 kilometer long slope, gondola, chair lift, and poma ski lift. For skiing, conditions are best from the last week of January to the first week of March. However, it's dependent on good snowfall, which is variable. If you're into trekking, the Kuari Pass trailhead is at Auli. This trek, which passes through Nanda Devi National Park, is one of the state's best and most accessible. Thrillophilia offers six-day guided trips from Haridwar . There are many other hiking trails around too. Accommodation options in Auli are scarce but Devi Darshan Lodge is recommended if you don't stay at the popular government-run Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Hotel (which offers ski programs ). Alternatively, the Himalayan Abode Homestay near Joshimath is excellent, and the host is a skiing and snowboarding champion and coach. Another good option is Himalayan Eco Lodge. Location: About 13 hours drive northeast of Delhi, near Joshimath. Indranil Dutta\\Getty Images. 10. Munsiyari \nMagical Munsiyari, a small town surrounded by towering mountains in the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand, is paradise for mountaineers and trekkers. Blazing sunsets create a stunning backdrop of color-stained peaks there. However, the hiking and trekking routes are the biggest draws. Munsiyari is the base for the challenging eight-day Milam Glacier Trek, and the much easier 2-3 hour trek to Khalia Top is another attraction. The Tribal Heritage Museum, filled with artifacts from Munsiyari's trade with Tibet on the ancient salt route, is also worth seeing. Milam Inn , albeit basic, is the best place to stay in Munsiyari and it offers fabulous mountain views from the guest rooms. Location: About 16 hours drive northeast of Delhi. Tungnath Temple, Chopta. Amit Kumar\\Getty Images. 11. Chopta \nNot to be confused with the Chopta Valley in Sikkim, Chopta lies between Kedarnath and Badrinath in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, at the entry to Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary. It attracts travelers who want to enjoy the great outdoors away from the crowds and development. Chopta is the starting point for treks to Tungnath temple (open from June to September) and Chandrashila summit. It's a short, yet scenic, moderate trek that can be completed in a day. Thrillophilia offers four-day guided trips from Haridwar. Location: About 10 hours drive northeast of Delhi, via Rishikesh. Kalap village. Anand Sankar. 12. Kalap \nIt's likely that you've never heard of Kalap, a tiny remote village that's only accessible by foot, 7,500 feet above sea level in the upper Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. That's because it's totally off the tourist map. A responsible tourism project was established there in 2013 to help improve the livelihoods of the villagers. Kalap is an outstanding place to get away from it all and experience the simplicity of village life, or go trekking along trails followed by nomadic shepherds. Location: About 5 hours north of Dehradun in Uttarakhand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:47.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
