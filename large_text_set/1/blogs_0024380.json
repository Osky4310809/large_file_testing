Published 1:05  05   Photos from the stars' Twitter accounts/file photo by Rappler (Vice Ganda) \n  After a solid top 6 finish for the Philippines, local celebrities took to social media to cheer on the local bet Maxine Medina, while also congratulating the newly crowned Miss Universe, France's Iris Mittenaere, on her victory . \nSome also posted nods to 2015 queen, Filipino Pia Wurtzbach, who took the crown in a stunning win last year. \nLet's take a look at some of the tweets on social media: \nSolenn Heussaff and Erwan Heussaff \nSiblings and celebrities Solenn Heussaff and Erwan Heussaff both said on social media that one of Miss France's answers in the original French differed from the interpreter's version. Nevertheless, Solenn congratulated Miss France Iris Mittenaere on her win. Mas maganda sagot ni miss France without the interpreter. So she won on her own. Not because of the translation. — Solenn Heussaff (@solennheussaff) January 30, 2017 Congrats miss France! And all the women . Winner silang lahat — Solenn Heussaff (@solennheussaff) January 30, 2017 \nErwan also posted his own translation of Iris' answer, which was about thinking she failed in her schooling, and not about a casting. Iris later said at a press conference that her answer was about school, but that she thought her interpreter was good. Since everyone is asking for the translation. #missfrance #MissUniverse pic.twitter.com/co45BEBGT9 — Erwan Heussaff (@erwanheussaff) January 30, 2017 \nVice Ganda \nVice tweeted continuously throughout the show. Check out some of them: Thanks so much Maxine Medina!!!
