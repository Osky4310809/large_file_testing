Both were hospitalized but Ukrainian media cited hospital doctors later in the day as saying the gunman had died.\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Voronenkov’s killing “clearly shows the handwriting of Russian special services shown repeatedly in various European capitals in the past.”\nIn a statement released by his spokesman, Svyatoslav Tsegolko, Poroshenko described the victim as a key witness who gave testimony about “Russian aggression” to the Ukrainian authorities.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed the claim of Russian involvement in the killing as “absurd” in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova went further, saying the “killer regime” in Kiev “will do its best to make sure that no one will ever know the truth about what happened.”\nShe added that Russia was shocked to hear Poroshenko’s accusations without offering any evidence and as Ukrainian police were inspecting the crime scene.\nSeveral hours after Voronenkov was killed, a team of investigators and police were seen working at the front door of the Premier Palace hotel, which is frequented by Kiev’s rich and powerful. The patch of the pavement by the door where he died was wet from water that utility workers had used.\nPoroshenko said it wasn’t accidental that Voronenkov’s killing came on the same day as the fire that erupted at a Ukrainian military arsenal in the Kharkiv region, which Ukrainian officials said was caused by sabotage.\nDenis Voronenkov AP Voronenkov, 45, a former member of the communist faction in the lower house of Russian parliament who had obediently toed the Kremlin line, moved to Ukraine with his wife, singer Maria Maksakova, who was also a lawmaker. He said he had to leave Russia because of persecution by Russian security agencies and had renounced Russian citizenship. He had been granted Ukrainian citizenship.\nHe testified to Ukrainian investigators as part of their probe into the activities of the nation’s former Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted by massive protests in February 2014.\nAfter his move to Ukraine, Russian investigators filed fraud charges against Voronenkov in connection with his business activities. A Moscow court earlier this month sanctioned his arrest in absentia.\nUkraine’s chief prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, said Voronenkov was shot in the head, neck and stomach and died on the spot.\nLutsenko said the gunman carried a Ukrainian passport and had been sought by the authorities on fraud and money laundering charges.\nLutsenko said investigators were looking into Voronenkov’s role in exposing a contraband ring in Russia which cost several senior security officers their jobs, and also his testimony on Yanukovych as possible motives behind his killing.\nNikolai Kovalyov, the former Russian security chief who is a lawmaker, told Russian state television that the killing could have been rooted in a business dispute.\nPeskov said that Putin was informed about Voronenkov’s killing and voiced hope that Ukrainian authorities would solve the crime. He added that Voronenkov’s widow was welcome to return to Russia.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:34:14.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
