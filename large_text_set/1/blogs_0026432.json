She went on to reveal that her father, who is “VERY REPUBLICAN,” is in the ER, her dog is in surgery and “intense rehab,” and that three of her friends died this year, as well as her boss. “Does this seem like ‘CELEBRITY PROBLEMS’?” she said. “I live in a s—- old house. Use my paycheck to help other however I can. I don’t anything of value (except my rescue dogs, who are priceless).” “You have been fooled by an illusion of excess. Trumps, Kardashians,” she continued. “Yes, some celebrities, that money means more than your soul, but don’t blame me. I don’t believe in that s—. I believe in living simply, working hard, fighting injustice and GOD.” Without naming him, Perrette went on to slam Trump, 70, as a “power hungry, flawed, narcissist human who does not feel that we are all human.” “I’m totally flawed. But I admit it,” she said. “Watching what human beings are going through with this ‘administration’? This is NOT my country. NOT my constitution. This is NOT about the election, BTW. It’s about what’s happening right now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:10:17.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
