Trump supplied a non-answer, instead casting doubt as to whether or not he and Putin would become bosom buddies.\nAdvertisement \n\n“Well, I respect a lot of people, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to get along with him,” Trump responded. “He’s a leader of his country. I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not.” \nO’Reilly returned, “He’s a killer, though. Putin’s a killer.”\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:23:17.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
