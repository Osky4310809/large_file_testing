He is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated,” Kelner added. \n“No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:31:35.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
