She emerged top after winning the head of house contest. Bisola replaces Efe, who was the immediate past ultimate head of House and was unfortunately nominated for eviction but was saved by Bisola, the new queen of the house. \nMeanwhile, today’s nomination jolted some of the housemates as they all sober with the eviction fever making them sit back and re-think their strategies. For embattled Debie-Rise and TBoss, synergy appears to be the working strategy as both openly canvassed for voters’ support. \nRecall that both of them have been up for eviction back to back in the last two weeks. Meanwhile, Bisola remains the only housemate that is yet to be formally nominated for eviction. \nThe ninth eviction show holds on Sunday, April 1, 2017. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T17:01:12.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
