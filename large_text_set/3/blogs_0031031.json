However, some online posts claimed that other valuables, including swords and fans, were stolen by locals when the tomb was unearthed on March 19. \nA local official denied that any valuables were stolen, saying the tomb was unlikely to have them since most officials in the Ming dynasty lived frugally because of a crackdown on corruption during the era. \nPart of Ming dynasty city wall collapses in ancient Chinese capital of Nanjing \nAccording to mainland laws protecting cultural relics, approval is needed before any infrastructure construction starts, but the crew in question had not sought permission and it remained unclear how badly the tomb had been damaged, the report said. \nThe local culture department said security guards had been deployed 24 hours a day to protect the scene. \nLast year, a man and his nephew in northeastern China’s Shaanxi province were detained after they tried to build a cellar in their courtyard and uncovered an ancient Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) tomb. They were accused of stealing and selling 13 relics from the tomb.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:12:47.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
