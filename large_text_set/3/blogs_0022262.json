Getty By Emma Dibdin Mar 22, 2017 Just when you thought everybody was over La La Land , Ansel Elgort casually shows up to breathe new life into its Oscar-winning song 'City Of Stars'. On Tuesday, the Fault In Our Stars actor posted an Instagram video in which he gives a pretty strong rendition of the ballad to Los Angeles, which was originally sung by Ryan Gosling's prickly jazz purist Sebastian. In fact, not unlike John Legend's performance at the Oscars ... this might actually be better than the original version?   A post shared by Ansel Elgort (@ansel) on Mar 21, 2017 at 11:33am PDT Most Popular Elgort's singing chops are already pretty well established â€“ he's released a few singles in the past, most recently last month's 'Thief'. In Edgar Wright's upcoming movie Baby Driver , Elgort plays a getaway driver who relies heavily on his personal soundtrack to get him through heists... a description which recalls Drive , in which Gosling also played a getaway driver with a great soundtrack. Time is a flat circle, everything is connected, all roads lead to Ryan Gosling.
