The Teen Mom OG star was slammed for throwing the blowout on a school night.\n“Slumber party on a school night,” Abraham captioned an Instagram photo of her daughter with friends. “8 years old I can’t believe it.”\nAlthough the friends seemed to be having a blast, fans weren’t impressed by Abraham’s sleepover .\nPHOTOS: ‘Teen Mom’ Star Farrah Abraham Takes Photos With Times Square Characters With Boyfriend & Daughter Sophia In Tow \n“Are you proud in saying slumber party on a school night? Not much to be proud of,” a hater commented on the photo. “Any normal mom would wait until the weekend.”\nA second user fired, “What idiot parent throws a birthday party (and a sleepover at that) on a school night ? The parents that let their kid go are even worse.”\nBut that wasn’t the only reason fans were outraged, as people trashed Abraham for spoiling her daughter with a red carpet, pony and wedding-like birthday cake.\n“Looks more like a wedding cake,” a follower wrote. “More is not always better… She thinks material things will fulfill her.” Another hater commented, “That cake is a bit over the top. Don’t you think?”\nThis isn’t the first time Abraham has been slammed for her parenting choices. In November, she came under fire for allowing her daughter to drink weight loss tea .\nPHOTOS: Evolution Of Farrah Abraham — How She Went From Teen Mom To XXX Star \n“Why are you giving Sophia that tea?” a user asked over Instagram. “It’s not for a child to drink. What is wrong with you?” Another user fired, “Your daughter doesn’t need flat tummy tea. Poor kid is going to be so insecure about her looks just like her mother.”\nIn August, Abraham allowed her daughter to Snapchat with strangers at night. Fans were so worried for Sophia’s safety that they reported her account. It was later taken down by the social media app.\nDo you think the bash was too lavish?
