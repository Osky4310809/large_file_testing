How sophisticated were the Russians in terms of what states they looked at.” \n“And obviously this also could implicate the issue of whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians,” he added. “That is certainly an area that we need to investigate. “ Schiff says the intel committee is investigating how Russia used paid media trolls and bots to spread fake news https://t.co/Jgm36N2Xd9 \n— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) March 29, 2017 \nSchiff has been in an escalating rhetorical battle with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Ca.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, over his controversial act of presenting evidence to President Trump of his wiretapping claims before telling the committee. Some have called for his recusal and others even say he should step down altogether from the committee. \nTrump has denied all allegations of Russian collusion, and some, like Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) have defended the administration against what they consider to be baseless accusations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T11:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:25:59.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
