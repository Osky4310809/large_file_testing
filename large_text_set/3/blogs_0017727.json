This move is a novel palliative that would give a new lease of life to thousands of inmates in the three prisons in Enugu state. \nAnnouncing the good news on the promotion of the teachers after the state Executive Council meeting at the Government House, Enugu, the commissioner for information, Dr. Godwin Udeuhele, explained that EXCO approved the release of the 2013 promotion arrears for teachers employed by the Post Primary School Management Board with financial effect from April 2017. Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State \nAlso announced by the commissioner during a briefing were two other release of promotion of other teachers who have been due for elevation since 2014 and 2015 respectively. These set of high school teachers are to expect their respective promotions by August and December this year respectively. \nSpeaking on the development, the chairman of the State Post-Primary School Board, Mr. Nestor Ezeme, a lawyer, said it was heart warming that at last, his board would now get relief from the teachers who have been agitating for their legitimate elevations for quite sometime now even when they knew the problem was inherited by the administration of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi. \nOn the move to decongest the three prisons in the state located in Enugu metropolis, Nsukka and Oji River, Udeuhele said “the executive council has directed that the NBA, NGOs and private legal practitioners willing to accept honorarium be engaged to handle cases of bail of those awaiting trials. The attorney-general and commissioner of justice has also further been directed to liaise with the state’s chief judge to conduct periodic jail deliveries”. \nThe state attorney-general and commissioner for Justice, Chief Miletus Eze, who was also at the briefing after the EXCO meeting through more light on the new strategy for prisons decongestion: “Let me start by saying that the N10 million approved by the state government for prison decongestion is just a palliative in the sense that we have three prisons in Enugu State and beyond that, there are still some prisoners from Enugu State who are in other prisons in Nigeria. \n“For example in Kaduna State we have condemned prisoners from Enugu State who are there. So the approval of N10 million is palliative in the sense that just to reduce the pressures on the prisons. \n“The major effect of our present efforts will come from jail deliveries. I want to say that in 2016, we conducted jail deliveries and reduced up to 300 inmates of the prisons in Enugu State: prisons in Nsukka, Enugu and Oji River. \n“Also at the tail end of the year we recommended that the governor approve granting of amnesty to some prisoners and this has gone a very long way to decongest the prison but because crime wave is not static, it rather sometimes increases and because of that as you are removing them new ones are coming in. in fact, sometimes those you release today within a week they will be back there having committed fresh crimes”, he posited. \nHe lamented the situation in the prisons in the country, pointing out that one of the main causes is that the “Federal Government has said that they are the sole owner of prisons but they did not anticipate the number of prisoners that would throng the various prisons in the country as the case is today. \n“So there is great need to expand the capacity of prisons; the problems that give rise to prison congestion is basically that there is an interplay between the states and the Federal Government in managing the prisons. The prisons are owned by the Federal Government but the prison inmates, most of them, come from the states. So the Federal Government is not feeling the same way the state is feeling about the prison congestion”, he also lamented just as he rued the dearth of facilities available to the prison authorities.
