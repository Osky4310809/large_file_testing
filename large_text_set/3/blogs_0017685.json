I like the fact that he’s trying to reduce bureaucracy. I like the fact that at least he put in an executive order that he wants to minimize lobbyists – there are a lot of positives in that,” Cuban said during an event hosted by the new media company Axios. “But on the flip side, he’s got to produce.”\nCuban, who endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, kept the door open to running for president in 2020.\n“I don’t have an aspiration to be a politician. I don’t have the government service gene,” he said. “It would have to be something where I thought I could fix something in a manner that nobody else could if it’s broken. If it’s not broken and things are going well, like I said, I’m not a politician and have no aspirations to be a politician so I’ll be like, you know what? I’ll just get out of the way, and not run for president just to make a point.”\n“You’re clearly thinking about it?” asked the event moderator.\n“Yeah, because I’m an American citizen and I care about this country,” Cuban replied. “I want to do right by it. Look, no one has been more blessed by the opportunities this country creates than me and so I feel an obligation that if I can contribute I will.”\nCuban said his decision to run depends, in part, on President Trump’s job performance. He told the audience “there’s no rush” for him to decide and that he wants Trump to succeed in office.\n“Again, it’s only 60 days in and there’s still the opportunity that he’ll [Trump] do a great job. Again, sometimes being oblivious – sometimes the best deals are the ones you don’t do and being oblivious allows other people to do their jobs, and maybe it will turn out great. I want him to succeed,” he said. “I want to be very clear on that. I want him to succeed. If he succeeds, if his programs succeed, we all succeed and do I agree with a lot of them? Fiscally – a bunch I do. Socially – no, not even close.”\nCuban said most of Trump’s supporters are going to think he’s doing a good job in office regardless of how much his critics pick on him.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2017/03/15/mark-cuban-on-trumps-tax-return-for-all-we-know-hes-the-one-who-leaked-it/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLuVbmkHs9g", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Hv6kQS8EKQ"], "published": "2017-03-16T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T04:49:01.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
