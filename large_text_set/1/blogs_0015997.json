Here’s a thought, though: what if you could fuck them?\n\nAdvertisement \n\n(Warning: this post is very NSFW.) \nThe original Doom has been modded to hell and back. It’s been turned into everything from a ninja girl anime to a dang Mario game . But sex? On its face, that seems pretty incompatible with a game about reducing demons to piles of quivering mush. But here we are. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nHDoom is a mod where, instead of shooting monsters until they die, you blast them with “sex lasers” until they collapse into sweaty, spent heaps that you can sleep with. The mod has become pretty well-known in the Doom modding community, beloved to some and infamous to others. Enemies are technically “monster girls,” a popular fixture in anime porn (hentai) that inspired HDoomGuy, the mod’s creator. According to HDoomGuy, the monster girl set-up gives him a way to “blend erotic human elements with monstrous elements and end up with cool, exotic designs.”\n\nHDoomGuy wants the mod to be a giant, absurd orgy that the entirety of hell is in on. HDoomGuy wants the mod to be a giant, absurd orgy that the entirety of hell is in on. The mod is full of outlandish character designs, hilariously gratuitous sex, and dicks nearly as large as the people they’re attached to. Weapons include a fluffy pillow (a replacement for Doom ’s fist attack), a high-powered vibrator (standing in for the chainsaw), a TV that gets Hell’s denizens hot and bothered with “lewd content” (taking the place of the plasma gun), and a poetry book whose sticky pages are rife with “high-class literature” (the BFG, of course).\n\n\nVideo courtesy of Shadow Freddy . \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:27:11.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
