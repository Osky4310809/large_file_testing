Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) told two reporters on Friday that her \"greatest desire is to lead [President Donald Trump] right into impeachment.\" Waters was asked by one the reporters what the American people can really expect from the administration over the next four years.\n\"Well, I hope he's not there for four years,\" she started.\nShe said she hopes \"this man, who he is, what he has done\" is shown and that can help people get him out of office.\nThat is when she said that she was going to show no willingness to work with the new president, by having her \"greatest desire\" being to impeach him before his term has ended.\nAnother reporter pointed out that Waters skipped the inauguration and told NPR that she did not want to give Trump \"a chance.\"\n\"Some critics might say that by doing so, by skipping the inauguration, by having this type of attitude that you are not respecting or accepting the results of the election,\" she said. \"What do you say to those critics?\"\nShe first justified skipping the inauguration because it is a purely \"ceremonial event.\"\n\"It certainly does not mean much of anything except you're going to this event to welcome in the new president and to rejoice in the fact that he won and as I have said I am not welcoming him, I won't rejoice in him being the president, I don't honor him, and so I did not go to that inauguration,\" she said. \"Never intended to go to it.\"\nShe then changed the topic to \"this business about working with him\"\nWaters pointed out that the Republican Pary has control of the House, Senate, and White House so it is up to them if they want to work with other people or force their policies on the public.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:28:17.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
