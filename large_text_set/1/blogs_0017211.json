But that’s not really a spoiler, because, as the game show’s slogan goes, “the wall gives, and the wall takes away.” In other words, Jean’s time as a millionaire could be short-lived, depending on where the dreaded red glowing balls in her gameplay land. NBC’s latest primetime game show — hosted by Talking Dead and @midnight host Chris Hardwick and featuring a simple, pachinko-like game — has helped the network start off the new year with a solid hit. Last week’s episode drew seven million viewers, who witnessed the first contestant to accept the guaranteed contract money — which meant Shantell and her husband, Jarrod, left with $135,001 … instead of the $950,111 they amassed with the green glowing balls. The wall gives, the risk-adverse contestant takes away. The Wall airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on NBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:57:51.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
