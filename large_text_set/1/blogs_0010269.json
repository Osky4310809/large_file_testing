He is currently in custody being questioned. \n“Our investigation is still ongoing however, so anyone who may have witnessed the incident or may have seen anything suspicious is asked to get in touch. \n“There will still be an increased police presence in the community whilst the investigation continues to encourage those who have information to come and speak to us and reassure anyone with any concerns.” \nPolice offered to issue rape alarms and promised a permanent police presence to keep women safe following a spate of sex attacks in Manchester last year. \nThe attacks included the rape of another 12-year-old girl in Crowcroft Park, Levenshulme, on September 1.
