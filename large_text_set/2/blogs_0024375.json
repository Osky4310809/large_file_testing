Then they crunched how much it would cost for a single person to rent a 420-square-foot room at that price, or for a family of four to rent just under 800 square feet. (Those are the minimum living space requirements endorsed by the civic government of London. )\nThe startup ferreted out an average San Francisco of $4.95/square foot, which then factors to $2,077/month for 420 feet and $3,942/month for 800 or so.\nThat beats second place New York’s $4.75/foot. Third place Honk Kong is $3.83/foot. Famously expensive London’s cost is $2.86/foot, for 11th place. Beijing is $1.83/foot and ranks 29th on the list.\nAlthough this is not a big enough data set from which to draw a conclusion, note that this figure is still bigger than every average on the Nested list except New York.\nTorbak Hopper Rent Index [Nested] Most Expensive Cities [CNN] Most Expensive Cities For Renters [Business Insider] Housing Standards [City Of London] \n\n\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:52:29.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
