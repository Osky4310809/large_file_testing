It’s completely voice-activated, and its “gelatinous” translucent housing is specifically designed to fit inside the palm of your hand.\nALO \nA photo posted by info@jeromeolivet.com (@jeromeolivet) on Jan 22, 2017 at 4:19am PST \n\n“Alo provides a fully vocalized interface in all phone functions, reads SMS and emails, and even allows them to dictate their messages rather than typing them,” Olivet, who specializes in product design for new technologies, told Dezeen . “The phone’s camera acts as an ‘eye.’ Among other things, it allows the reader to read the texts he detects or to identify the faces. It also allows you to project a 3D hologram to view a movie or message.”\nThe crescent shaped device would be made from a “self-healing” material that provides haptic feedback (heat and vibration) to its user — quite a change from the usual aluminum. It’s made for a future in which voice-activation is so good that things like buttons and touchscreens are no longer necessary. FastCo.Design calls it “the iPhone for a post-iPhone world.”\nOlivet and Starck plan to develop Alo into a prototype for Thomson later this year.
