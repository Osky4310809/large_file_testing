His friends bugged him because he was jumping off waves before they ended to paddle by me. And when I left the ocean, he followed. He never followed, he surfed until the waves ran out. But he followed me. He told his friends that I was his girlfriend the first moment he saw me. He told me he was going to marry me 5 days after we met. We’re now married, we just drove from California to Ecuador with our dog on our honeymoon and that was my dream. \nShe laughs and speaks and walks and moves and loves with the love she gives herself–it falls like fireflies from each letter that drops from her full heart.\nHer words vibrate into the ventricles of my heart so deeply the world goes still.\nThis is an unconditional love I have not felt since a man sat at a coffee shop in Roberts Creek, captivated by me. I was working away writing like a mad woman downing americanos. He called his friend and said, “There’s a beautiful woman and I’m afraid to talk to her.” “Beautiful women always like to be talked to.”\nAnd then you found me the next day, with the intensity of a relentless thunderstorm that drowns the roads with a sneeze. I walked out of the ocean and you went right for me. You went for me like you had a spotlight attached to your heart and blinded me. I was not available for the taking, but you told me I was going to be yours anyway.\nAnd then I was, and when I wasn’t you told me, “I am not jealous of any man who may try and love you for I will love you better than anyone.”\nAnd you did, and then you left–you stopped your life.\nAnd then I learned that some soul mates are not here for a lifetime, they are here for a season or a reason.\nAnd I have felt the breeze of that unconditional love once in the sweaty nights of Austin, Texas but not yet again until this morning.\nWatching her eyes gleam.\n“Ah, that’s how I want to be loved.” Part of me says.\nAnd then everything inside clicks.\nThe ones that are there but not loving are less sparkly.\nThe space is held without a choice.\nUnconditional love is a lesson that comes in different packages and containers and the strongest container we may have is ourselves.\nThank you to the two men who have loved me with the might I did not understand, and thank you to this woman who today taught me the same lesson again.\nMaybe I’ll listen today. Or maybe I’ll need to hear it again through the heart of a man who kisses the feet of my heart consistently without instruction.\nWe show up in this world how we are loving ourselves and how we are able to love.\nThe rain falls through the green and onto my face as the taxi rips on to the next moment of contentment and my heart sighs in relief. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:02:03.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
