Posted 15 hours ago 13 The Guardian reports that Metal Hammer has been saved from closure after Team Rock - the parent company that owned MH, along with Classic Rock Magazine and Prog Magazine - was bought by Future Publishing for £800,000.Future Publishing is the same company that sold the magazines to Team Rock back in 2013, for £10,200,000.As reported , the entire team of over 70 members of the Team Rock staff was fired just before the Christmas holidays, prompting Orange Goblin to launch a fundraiser that ultimately fetched over £70,000 for the fired staff.Zillah Byng-Thorne, chief executive of Future Publishing, stated the following: \"The acquisition of these classic rock brands with their associated magazines, events and websites marks a further step in our buy and build strategy.\"It further reinforces our creation of a leading global specialist media platform with data at its heart, which we are monetizing through diversified revenue streams. We look forward to developing further these iconic and much-loved brands and to continuing to serve their communities of dedicated enthusiasts around the world.\"The Guardian report further reads: \"Only a handful of staff have been guaranteed jobs in the transition of the TeamRock business, handled by administrators FRP Advisory, although ongoing negotiations could allow more move to Future.\"In recent years, Future shed almost 500 staff to reverse losses running to £35m and implement a new strategy focussed on its biggest magazine brands, digital and events.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T12:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T18:13:51.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
