She said online harassment forced her to transfer to another school with the conclusion of the fall semester. \nThere have even been reports of liberal students posting pictures of their conservative peers with the caption, “remember their faces.” \nThe College Republicans did not even endorse Trump nor make get-out-the-vote phone calls during the election. \nThe professors at St. Olaf get into the act too. According to one political science student, her instructor “started every class with basically just ridiculing Trump for about 20 minutes,” while another student says his professor’s constant anti-Trump tirades ensures that conservatives keep their mouths shut in order to preserve their academic standing. \nBut at least one St. Olaf conservative doesn’t have any time for right-of-center snowflakes, discouraging his peers from responding like “some oppressed minority group.” \nOtherwise, St. Olaf is a most tolerant and inclusive college. The administration recently invited former Communist Party candidate Angela Davis to speak and has renamed an arts building after the man it first honored was suspected of engaging in sexual harassment. \nFollow David on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:05:53.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
