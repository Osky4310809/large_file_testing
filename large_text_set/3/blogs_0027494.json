Chris Sgro of EqualityNC says the state could have done much better if HB2 had been repealed.\n“It is a universally agreed-upon fact at this point that HB2 is hurting the state of North Carolina economically,” Sgro told the Washington Times reporters.\nWhile “what might have been” is difficult to quantify, it’s clear that the boycott, which was aimed at punishing hardworking North Carolinians because they value the privacy and security of women, wasn’t as effective as opponents of the law hoped.\nHB2 came about in reaction to a Charlotte city ordinance in which all businesses — not just public institutions, but privately owned businesses as well — were required to permit men who claimed to be women (and vice versa) to use the bathroom of their choice. This would have allowed men free access to a previously private space reserved for women, and it would have involved government intrusion into the private sphere by telling business owners what they can and can’t do with their bathrooms.\nLGBT Bathroom Hysteria Threatens North Carolina's Economy\nThis violation of the private property rights is often ignored in this debate, but it is an important point. Leftists seek to expand government in the name of “social justice,” exposing their statist agenda, which reduces freedom for all Americans.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/22/this-just-in-boycott-of-n-c-over-bathroom-bill-dies-with-a-whimper/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/20/with-bathroom-bill-north-carolina-economy-expandin/"], "published": "2017-03-22T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:57:14.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
