I end up with cuts and bruises,\" Ms Hvass, 19, said. \nBut her life is now changing through good medical help leading to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], and an introduction to a chocolate labradoodle named Sophie. \n\"When you bond with a dog they can really feel emotions and they can really help you through everything,\" Ms Hvass said. \nMs Hvass is now on the path back to better health, life and learning as she pursues her dream of becoming a rural nurse, undertaking studies at Newcastle University with her service dog by her side. Anxiety spiralling into PTSD \nThings worsened for Ms Hvass a few years ago when she started living out of home with a friend at Rylstone in central-west New South Wales. \nThe friend was involved in a car accident in which another friend died, and she tried to protect him \"from the hate and anger the town was giving him\". \nMs Hvass said she increasingly cut herself off from people, found it harder to eat and sleep, became unfocused in her school work and lost her part-time job. \nDuring this period, a young man with whom she had just broken up with committed suicide, and her mental illness worsened further. \n\"Mentally I couldn't function. I was on this couch just sleeping, watching movies … I was just frozen,\" Ms Hvass said. \nMs Hvass and her family entered what they describe as a \"lockdown\" and she found it \"hard to differentiate between the dream and reality\".

(ABC Central West: Melanie Pearce) A diagnosis and a dog \nMs Hvass's mother, Kerryn Burns, said she felt helpless seeing her daughter in such a condition, until a local GP recognised that her daughter was \"not just a teenager being a teenager\". \n\"It wasn't for 12 months when someone stepped back and said hang on, this young person has more problems than just grieving for a lost boyfriend. There is more to this,\" Ms Burns said. \nThat started a path of finding appropriate mental health specialists, and Ms Hvass also started to pursue her dream of re-starting the education that had been stalled by her crippling condition. \nThrough Newcastle University's Newstep program that helps 18-20 year olds who did not complete their HSC due to adverse circumstances, Ms Hvass enrolled to do foundation studies towards becoming a nurse. \nAfter she was diagnosed with PTSD, a university friend suggested a service dog could help her. Breaking new ground with service animal \nMs Burns said it had been difficult to get a service dog for her daughter because she did not fit the usual category of PTSD sufferers who were able to get them, such as armed forces veterans and former emergency services personnel. \nThat meant the dog's purchase and training had to be funded privately, and Ms Hvass needed documentation to prove she had mental health issues \n\"It's not a matter of anyone getting a dog and saying it's a service dog,\" Ms Burns said. \n\"The psychologist had to recommend it, which meant she had to do her own research because she hadn't dealt or heard about it before.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:58:31.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
