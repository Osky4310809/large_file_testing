(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Will Bunch Daily News Columnist Will Bunch has worked at the Daily News for 20-plus years and is now senior writer. Since 2005, he’s written the uber-opinionated, fair-but-dangerously unbalanced opinion blog \"Attytood,\" covering a range of topics (but mostly politics and the media these days); it’s been named best blog in the state by the Associated Press Managing Editors and best blog in the city by Philadelphia Magazine. He’s also authored three full-length books and three Amazon Kindle Single e-books, including 2015’s The Bern Identity: A Search for Bernie Sanders and the New American Dream. Prior to coming to Philadelphia, he worked at New York Newsday, where he was part of a team that won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for spot news reporting. More by Will Bunch Arrow icon \nIt's impossible to turn on your TV these days without hearing about Russian spies, and I'm not just talking about the return of \"The Americans\" on FX. Especially one alleged Russian spy -- the country's U.S. ambassador Sergei Kislyak, who apparently had so many meetings with Trump campaign officials that he must have been cloned several times. As I wrote earlier this week (in a post that somehow went viral...go figure), the possibility of collusion between our president's campaign and illegal Russian activities such as computer hacking holds the potential of a Watergate-style scandal that could bring down the administration -- and yet it's also something of a distraction. \nI've noted that Russiagate, and the president's insane tweets about bugging at Trump Tower, etc., have helped the media lose focus on the administration surgically gutting the rules that protect the environment and public health and welfare . But it's not just the wrong policies that are wrecking the notion of the government as a public watchdog. \nIt's also the wrong people. \nThe great, Pulitzer Prize-winning news site ProPublica is out today with the first deep dive into who's working so far in the Trump administration -- not just the Cabinet members who caused such a big uproar, but the second- and third-tier folks who actually do a lot of the work. And their work, generally, is undoing the stuff that their agencies did before they got there -- i.e., the destruction of \"the administrative state.\" There are lobbyists now \"regulating\" the industries they just left, and right-wing zealots who generally want government shrunk to the size where it could fit inside a Russian nesting doll. \nHeh. \nThe article notes: \nThe list we obtained includes obscure campaign staffers, contributors to Breitbart and others who have embraced conspiracy theories, as well as dozens of Washington insiders who could be reasonably characterized as part of the “swamp” Trump pledged to drain. \nThe list is striking for how many former lobbyists it contains: We found at least 36, spanning industries from health insurance and pharmaceuticals to construction, energy and finance. Many of them lobbied in the same areas that are regulated by the agencies they have now joined. \nThat figure is almost certainly an undercount since we only included those who formally registered as lobbyists, a process increasingly avoided by many in Washington. \nI'd have to say the most interesting hire is this one: \nJon Perdue, a self-described guerrilla warfare expert and fellow at a little-known security think tank , wrote a book called “The War of All the People: The Nexus of Latin American Radicalism and Middle Eastern Terrorism.” He is also a onetime contributor to Breitbart. \nPerdue was featured on CNBC’s reality series “Make Me a Millionaire Inventor” for his invention, the Packbow, which Perdue came up with while studying “collapsed societies, and what people who lived in those societies came up with to either defend themselves or to survive.” It’s a bow and arrow that doubles as a compass, tent pole, walking stick, spearfishing rig, and water purification tablet receptacle. \nThis guy is now a special assistant at the, wait for it...Treasury Department, because nothing screams out U.S. monetary policy like a crackpot survivalist inventor. It also seems like a conflict of interest -- in the heart of the Treasury Department, Perdue is well-placed to help crash the American economy back to the Stone Ages -- thus creating massive demand for his Packbow! Somebody contact the Office of Government Ethics. \nAnyway, read the entire ProPublica report , which is pretty remarkable. Although it's been obvious for some time now, the idea was never to \"drain the swamp.\" To the contrary, the idea all along was to have the foxes guarding the henhouse. And they're getting away with it.
