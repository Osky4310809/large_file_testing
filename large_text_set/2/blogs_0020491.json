Here are a few of Garner's favorites: Pistol squat progression: This is a great way to modify this very challenging lower-body exercise for those who may not yet be ready to do it in free space. Offset pushup and offset rolling pushup: These will force you to stabilize an offset load on an unstable platform, says Garner. These exercises are similar in that the offset positioning of the hands forces one arm to work harder than the other. Rolling the foam roller away from the body during the rolling pushup increases the level of difficulty as the core and pushing arm have to work harder to keep the body square. Single-leg deadlift progression: Think of the roller as a training wheel. You can use a foam roller to help with balance as you progress to doing the move in free space. Apply less and less pressure to the roller until you no longer need it. Rollout plank: The rollout plank is a twist on a core classic. Rolling the roller away from your body and back forces your abs, back, and shoulders to work overtime to prevent yourself from collapsing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:31:49.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
