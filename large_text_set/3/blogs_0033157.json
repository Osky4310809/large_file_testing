This can result in a cracked cylinder head, causing a pressurised oil leak – if the oil comes into contact with a hot engine surface, it increases the risk of a fire in the engine compartment. \nSo far, the issue has resulted in 29 reports of fire in the United States and Canada. Owners are still allowed to drive their vehicles, but are advised to see their dealer if the vehicle has a coolant leak, is overheating or needs to be topped up with coolant frequently. \nThey will also receive instructions from the owner’s manual in the mail, on how to check and refill coolant. Once service kits are available, dealers will install a coolant level sensor with supporting hardware and software changes, free of charge. \nOver in Australia, the company is also recalling 4,450 units of the 2013-2014 Kuga as well as 400 units of the Fiesta ST over the same issue, according to CarAdvice . Ford Australia’s communication head Martin Günsberg told the publication that there have been seven reports of fire associated with the issue, although no injuries have been reported so far. \nThe American and Australian recalls come some two months after Ford South Africa recalled 4,500 units of the Kuga, again over a fire risk due to a lack of coolant circulation. Seeing as South African and Australian-market Kuga models come from the same Valencia plant in Spain as ours, we could see a recall being announced in Malaysia as well. Local distributor Sime Darby AutoConnexion is now investigating the matter to see if Malaysian-market models are affected.
