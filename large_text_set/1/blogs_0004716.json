Eleven of their 19 in fact. \nYes, some of them have been penalties but as we’ve seen with Christian Benteke at Crystal Palace, some strikers don’t even have the cojones to stick them away from the spot under pressure. \nDefoe doesn’t drink, doesn’t smoke and keeps himself in fantastic physical condition. At the London Stadium he would have filled his boots. \nEspecially when you consider that Dimitri Payet has created more chances than any other player in the Premier League this season. \nThe reason why the Irons have struggled this season is because they haven’t had a marksman to convert those opportunities. Simone Zaza - overrated (Photo: Arfa Griffiths) \nAndy Carroll isn’t fit enough often enough. Simone Zaza was obsessed with overhead kicks, massively overrated and on the way out. Jonathan Calleri was a specialist in missing sitters and Diafra Sakho has had a nightmare with injuries. \nSunderland boss David Moyes pulled Defoe aside two days before Christmas and made it clear to the marksman that he would not be selling him. \nSo West Ham’s decision to finally take no for an answer is not a surprise. They’d been prepared to wait until the end of the window had the Black Cats shown even a scintilla of interest in doing business. \nDavid Moyes is well aware, however, that if Defoe goes Sunderland are finished. To paraphrase Samuel L. Jackson’s Jules Winfield in Pulp Fiction, they'd be as dead as fried chicken.
