The rapper channeled Lil' Kim's infamous 1999 MTV VMAs outfit by sporting a low-cut black top that featured an exposed breast covered up by a diamond-shaped pasty. Nicki took in the show from the front row next to models Caroline de Maigret and Lou Doillon, and she later uploaded photos from the event on Instagram , writing, \"#NickiInPARIS hit the wheel so hard make it rotate ü¶Ñ all my btchs get it, they make money all alone üëÖ #HaiderAckermann show was flawless.\" \nNicki's outfit choice is also sparking conversation given the fact that she and Lil' Kim have been feuding for years . After firing a few shots in her own version of Beyonc√©'s \"Flawless\" remix back in 2014, Lil' Kim released a song called \"Identity Theft,\" in which she blatantly accuses Nicki of trying to steal her image. While Lil' Kim has yet to comment on the matter, Nicki is currently in the middle of another feud with rapper Remy Ma .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T00:16:48.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
