This is a trend that has been in the My Little Pony television shows/direct-to-DVD films ever since Generation 1. The songs' lyrics on this wiki were transcribed by ear or from closed captions and their titles are taken from Daniel Ingram 's Facebook page when available; otherwise, they are guesses or general descriptions. As of season three , the song titles are taken from their appearance in the episode's ending credits . All songs were composed by Daniel Ingram, with the exception of the songs: \" Hop Skip and Jump \", \" Evil Enchantress \", \" I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala \", \" Pony Pokey \" and \" The rappin' Hist'ry of the Wonderbolts \", which were given a backing track by score composer William Anderson . \nSince season three, each season has included one musical episode with at least six songs.
