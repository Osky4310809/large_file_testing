Right now I’m not on Cloud 9; I’m already starting to think about Notre Dame. The experience of having been there, you’re just hungrier to go further and finish it off.” \nThe Pioneers, who lost to eventual national champion North Dakota in the Frozen Four semifinals a year ago in Tampa, Fla., scored on its first two shots Sunday but quickly blew a 2-0 lead. They found themselves in a dogfight early in the second period when Penn State’s Denis Smirnov scored with a shot off DU defenseman Michael Davies to tie it 2-2. \n“We didn’t get down on our bench. When they made it 2-2, we had a great response there,” DU senior center Matt Marcinew said. “We just kept to the process, and that’s won us games all year.” \nTerry scored a power-play goal 6:30 into the period, assisted on Jarid Lukosevicius’ goal at 15:40 and then scored again at 18:52 to give the Pioneers a commanding 5-2 lead after two periods. \nDenver went unscathed after junior defenseman Tariq Hammond was assessed a five-minute minor and game misconduct for checking from behind just 26 seconds into the final frame. The Pioneers’ penalty killers were perfect against the country’s No. 2-rated offense. \n“Our penalty kill was amazing tonight, in all three zones,” Marcinew said. “Killing that major was a huge turning point. That gave us momentum for the rest of the game.” \nTerry wasn’t the only offensive star. Lukosevicius had two goals — both off Terry passes — and freshman Henrik Borgstrom had three assists in his best career postseason game. Borgstrom got the primary assist on two of Terry’s goals, the latter on a 2-on-1 rush to complete Denver’s 3-0 run. \nPenn State freshman defenseman James Gobetz scored late in the third period for his first career point, but DU shut the door the rest of the way and Terry scored an empty-net goal. Junior goalie Tanner Jaillet improved to 26-5-4 on the season for DU. \n“We have a resilient group, a close group, and the guys just stuck with the process and kept at it,” DU captain Will Butcher said. \n“We just believe in our team and what’s given us success all year,” Terry said. \nPenn State coach Guy Gadowsky is a former Colorado College Tigers forward who was hired to lead the Lions into Division I. \n“Denver played an excellent game. I don’t think we were necessarily us, but you have to give them a lot of credit for making us not us,” Gadowsky said. “I thought they were a very quick team and won a lot of races. It’s easy to see why they’re the number one ranked team in the nation. \n“I know it’s tough now, but I’m sure (our) team, and eventually the seniors will look back with a lot of fondness because they accomplished a great deal.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:44:58.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
