Tastes bad. \nImage: mashable/adam rosenberg By Johnny Lieu 2017-03-02 06:31:00 UTC There’s plenty of intrigue and excitement when it comes to the imminent launch of the Nintendo Switch. But please, don’t put the cartridges in your mouth.\nAccording to reports, the game cartridges themselves taste goddamn awful. While the question of why people started putting them in their mouths to begin with remains, it turns out Nintendo’s made them taste bad intentionally. \nIt’s to dissuade children from trying to eat them. Makes sense considering the cartridges are pretty small, and well, children eat everything in their sight. \nBut that hasn’t stopped reporters from having a little taste. I put that Switch cart in my mouth and I’m not sure what those things are made of but I can still taste it. Do not try this at home. \n— Jeff Gerstmann (@jeffgerstmann) February 25, 2017 Okay, so, turns out Nintendo Switch cartridges taste awful so kids won’t eat them. I, uh, just licked one and can confirm: TASTES BAD MAN. \n— Alanah Pearce (@Charalanahzard) March 1, 2017 \n“Oh my god. It really tastes, oh geez. It’s not good at all,” a horrified Mike Fahey from Kotaku said in a video. “It’s spreading. It was on my tongue, now it’s spreading to the back of my mouth.” \nIn a statement provided to The Verge , Nintendo said a non-toxic bittering agent called Denatonium Benzoate has been added to the card in order to prevent young children from ingesting it. \nIn fact, it’s the bitterest substance known to science. It was accidentally discovered in 1958 by Scottish pharmaceutical manufacturer T & H Smith (now Macfarlan Smith,) according to Chemistry World . Only an incredibly small amount of the substance is enough to be distasteful to humans. \nBut hey. You can’t stop humans from eating things that are not meant to be eaten. Do… do gamers know that Nintendo Switch games aren’t food? I’m sure toilet seats taste bad, too. \n— Jess McDonell (@JessMcDonell) March 2, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T06:21:47.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
