Hall of Fame Awards looking uber-stylish in this fringed sari by designer duo Abu Jani & Sandeep Khosla . Abu Jani & Sandeep Khosla for #VogueHeartsSari at AIFW AW’17 \nIt was the same sari as showcased in the #VogueHeartsSari show at Amazon Fashion Week this year. Twinkle Khanna \nWhile Twinkle opted for this sari in a dark creme hue, Sonam Kapoor was spotted wearing this exact same sari in a mint green in January this year at the Kalyan Jeweller launch in Dubai. While Sonam tied her hair in a sleek bun, Twinkle left her tresses open for this look. \nWe loved both cause they both looked effin’ good.
