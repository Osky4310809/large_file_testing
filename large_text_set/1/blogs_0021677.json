Christian Hoffer Tweet This \nThe episode opens right where the last one left off, with Laurel in the New Arrow Cave. Oliver points out that she died in front of her, but Laurel claimed that Sarah pulled her out of time and used the Waverider's technology to save her. Felicity walks in and immediately hugs Laurel, and both of them agree that it's a miracle. \nAs Laurel explains how the Legends brought her back, Felicity openly wishes that the Legends could bring everyone from the dead. Oliver also mentions that Laurel's father is in rehab. When Felicity says they'll throw Laurel a \"welcome back\" party, Felicity suddenly remembers that she came to the Arrow Cave to tell Oliver that Diggle was arrested once again. \nOliver visits Diggle in prison and says that it's time to fight these trumped up charges head on. Oliver says he might know a good attorney and also says that he and Felicity are working on finding Prometheus's mother. \nIn a flashback, Gregor chews Oliver out for going rogue and trying to kill Kovar without his permission. Gregor then asks Oliver if he's trying to kill Kovar as a promise to a girl, specifically Laurel (since Oliver is carrying her picture around this season). \nLaurel talks to Thea on the phone at the welcome back party, while Rory asks Felicity if its weird that they're celebrating when Detective Malone is still dead. Curtis is also brooding, mainly because he blames Prometheus for his recent breakup. Oliver toasts Laurel's miracle return, but Felicity still seems weirded out and suspicious. \nBack at the Arrow Cave, Felicity tells Rory that the party was a ruse to get Laurel's DNA. The DNA is a match, so Rory jokes that it must be Laurel's evil twin. That's when it hits Felicity: Laurel does have an \"evil twin\", her Earth-2 counterpart that was supposedly locked up at Star Labs. Before Laurel can call Star Labs to check, Laurel unleashes a Sonic Scream and says that she's glad she doesn't have to pretend to be weak anymore. After knocking our Rory, Laurel goes after Felicity, but Oliver shows up just in time. Laurel runs away as Oliver realizes that it's not their Laurel. \nCurtis explains to Rene that Laurel is from Earth-2, while Oliver explains that Prometheus freed Black Siren (Earth-2 Laurel) to get at him. \nBack in a flashback, Gregor wonders why Oliver hasn't contacted Laurel and instead went to Russia to avenge another woman's death. Oliver says it's because he's a monster, but then says that it's better to be a monster than a sellout like Gregor. \nPrometheus confronts Black Siren for her failure and says that her life is contingent on his success. \nOliver calls Chase into his office and asks him to take up Diggle's case. Chase agrees, but then says they'll need to cover up Detective Malone's death. After all, it would look bad if Prometheus was revealed to be a member of the city's anti-crime unit and it would look even worse if it was revealed that Green Arrow killed a member of the city's anti-crime unit. Laurel then calls Oliver and says that she was forced to attack them and asks to meet. \nOliver meets Laurel at the Black Canary statue while the rest of the team hides and waits. Felicity tells the rest of the team (unbeknownst to Oliver) to take down Black Siren if she tries a double cross. Black Siren offers to help Oliver track Prometheus and reaches for something, but Felicity orders the team to attack. During the fight, Black Siren destroys the Black Canary statue before Oliver sedates her. \nBack at the Arrow Cave, Felicity admits that she ordered the hit. Felicity is worried that Laurel is playing Oliver, but Oliver says that they were still following a lead. Oliver then interrogates Laurel about what led her down the path to becoming Black Siren. On Earth-2, Laurel fled to Central City to get a fresh start after Oliver's death, but then she kept making one decision after another. Oliver encourages her to stop running and that she can choose who and what she is. \nRene tries to get Curtis to open up, but Curtis is upset that he keeps getting his butt kicked and that it cost him Paul. \nFelicity gets upset at Oliver for trying to reach out to this Laurel, in part because she joined up with Prometheus. \nChase meets up with Diggle about his upcoming trial, but Diggle warns Chase that the general won't let him to get to a trial. \nFelicity confronts Laurel and says that she won't be fooled like Oliver. However, the power goes out, which paves the way for Laurel to escape from her cave. \nIt turns out that the power outage was another ruse by Felicity. She let Laurel go and put tracking nanites in her water so they could track her back to Prometheus. Felicity then plays the tape of her conversation with Laurel to remind Oliver that he's not their Laurel. \nBack in a flashback, we find out that Gregor was the one who told Oliver that circumstances can be poison or nectar (a phrase Oliver has repeated all episode). Gregor says that he can give Oliver a family in exchange for obedience and then puts a gun to his head. \nRene apologizes to Curtis for teasing him and tells Curtis that he needs to start focusing on what he can do instead of what he can't. \nChase tries to stop the general from taking Diggle, but the general says that Chase has 24 hours to give Diggle willingly. \nFelicity tracks Laurel, but her thermal imaging isn't strong enough to tell if she's with Prometheus. Oliver says they're bringing in Laurel anyways and tells Curtis to bring the portable dampener he's been working on. \nWhen Team Arrow arrives at the warehouse, Prometheus gets the drop on Ragman, while Black Siren takes out Wild Dog. Black Siren then knocks out Curtis while Prometheus and Green Arrow start to fight. Oliver tries knocking Prometheus out with diazipan, but Prometheus has an immunity. Prometheus then says he's ordered Black Siren to kill Felicity, but Oliver tries to talk her down. Black Siren doesn't listen and tries to kill both Oliver and Felicity, but Curtis wakes up and uses his dampener to shut down Black Siren's powers. Felicity then punches Black Siren out. \nChase figures out how to stop Diggle's transfer: by having Diggle punch him. Chase cites a Star City statute that allows a city official to stop a prisoner transfer if that prisoner commits a secondary crime within Star City. Chase says he'll have to prosecute Diggle for assault...which could take a while. The general vows to come back with a signed writ from the president. \nBack at the Arrow Cave, Rene rejoices in saying \"I told you so\" to Curtis while Felicity ices her hand. Oliver promises they'll capture Prometheus and says that he had Argus keep Laurel in Star City. If there's any chance to save Laurel, Oliver wants to take it. \nIn the final flashback of the night, TALIA AL GHUL suddenly shoots up Constantin's base and says that she's been looking for Oliver. \nWhile watching some city workers pick up the remains of the Black Canary statue, Oliver tells Felicity he wants to find someone worthy to become the next Black Canary. The episode ends with a cut scene in Hub City where an unknown woman uses a Sonic Scream to take out two dudes in a bar who were harassing a woman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T07:01:14.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
