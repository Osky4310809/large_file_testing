This takes a lot of practice,\" the site says. \n\"Also, unlike the vagina, the anus provides no lubrication. So in addition to teaching the sphincters to relax, and in addition to getting the angle right so you don’t poke the receiver in the wall of the rectum, you need to use lots of lube.\" It advises using plenty of lube (Photo: Reuters) \nSo far, so useful. \n\"Do not use numbing lube, and do not have anal sex while drunk or stoned,\" the website continued. \n\"Pain is an important indicator that damage can occur if you don’t make the necessary adjustments, including stopping. If there is pain, perhaps try replacing a penis with a well lubed and gloved finger. \n\"The glove will help your finger glide more easily, and might be more pleasurable for the person on the receiving end. Also, this allows a woman to do anal play on a male partner.\" \nThe guide to anal sex is part of Goop's latest newsletter The Sex Issue that also covers casual sex and orgasm equality.
