Building In Strip District March 22, 2017 1:12 PM By Dave Crawley Filed Under: Dave Crawley , Jim Coen , Mike Feinberg Company , Strip District , Yinzers , Yinzers In The Burgh \nPITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The Strip District is the center of the universe when it comes to black and gold. And the Mike Feinberg Co. has been the center of the Strip, ever since its namesake opened up shop nearly 60 years past. \nMarcia Feinberg has kept things rolling since her dad passed away 10 years ago. \n“You could find anything and everything here,” the daughter/owner says. “Everything you had to have but didn’t need. We had things from ‘infinity mirrors’ where you could look in the mirror and find Jesus, to Steeler merchandise. Paper plates. Just a little bit of everything.” \nBonnie Renton says she’s been shopping at Feinberg’s for 30 years. \n“This is the reason I come to the Strip. I come here first, and then go buy cheese and some food. That can wait, right?” she says. \nJan Shipp has been coming to Feinberg’s for 45 years. \n“I love the Steelers. So I think I have everything now!” she said. \nThat’s good, because Feinberg’s will close at the end of April. Ever since the closing announcement was made, the shelves have begun to empty. \nSo, what happens when it’s all gone? Will Feinberg’s be gone, too? Well, not exactly. \nJust down the street, the owner of Yinzers, Jim Coen, plans to buy the legendary landmark. \nYinzers manager Tim Piett says they’ll do some renovating. \nHowever, he says, “We’re going to carry a large selection of the local teams, the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Pirates, and the Penguins. But, also, we’re going to carry on a theme that Feinberg’s has that’s a lot of Pittsburgh merchandise.” \nHe says the spirit of Feinberg’s will remain. \n“I hope it makes all the Pittsburgh people happy that we’re going to carry on the tradition,” he said. \nMarcia agrees. \n“It’s still going to have a little bit of the Mike Feinberg flair to it. It’s better than it becoming an apartment building,” she says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T07:07:40.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
