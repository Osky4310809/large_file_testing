The national press cited the pressure of competing against Hamilton as a reason behind world champion Rosberg's shock retirement at the end of last season . \nRicciardo and Verstappen are widely considered the strongest driver line-up on the grid and the Australian believes they will be close to achieving their goals if tension develops between them. \n\"We're not Lewis and Nico yet but I hope we can be in that position, because we would both absolutely love to get to a point like that, where we're fighting,\" Ricciardo told F1 Racing magazine. Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton's relationship deteriorated while they were battling for the title \n\"When we are, that basically means we're doing what we want to and reaching what we want to achieve in the sport, so it's hard to predict or anticipate what will happen, but I think that would be a nice position to be in. \n\"Anything else… I think that's a bridge we'll cross when we get there.\" \nVerstappen replaced Daniil Kvyat at Red Bull from last year's Spanish Grand Prix and his relationship with Ricciardo remained largely harmonious, with the pair saying they were pushing each other to new heights. Lights out for the 2017 season curtain-raiser at 6am on Sunday March 26 \nTheir fierce battle in Malaysia last October gave a glimpse of what may come this season but Verstappen does not foresee any problems emerging. \n\"The most important thing is that you need to respect each other, on and off track,\" Verstappen said. \n\"So far we have been doing that pretty well. Even that fight in Malaysia - fighting for a victory - if we can race like that, it would be amazing. For sure, if you fight for a world championship, you can be a bit more nervous, but I think that's pretty normal. \n\"When you are in a fight, you know pretty well when you are about to crash or not, so it shouldn't cause any problems.\" \nRicciardo is also hopeful that the battle for the world championships will be tighter with the greater shift towards aerodynamics in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:59:38.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
