Like you’re advertising.\" Mar 29, 2017 \nA recent sketch from Tracey Ullman's Show is no laughing matter. \nThe British comedian and women's rights activist tackled the topic of victim-blaming often associated with women reporting violent crimes and harassment. But instead of grilling a woman about her clothing, appearance and alcohol consumption, Ullman puts a man in the hot seat. \n\"You look quite provocatively wealthy,\" said Ullman, who played the character of a detective interviewing the man who's reporting being robbed. \"Just a bit of an invitation, isn't it?
