Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com \nHe’s one of the best at making chicken salad out of chicken hits. \nHe’ll pluck a pitch that sputters into the infield, and before you can spell Aledmys, Aledmys has an infield single. \nThey say a puny hit will look like a line drive in the box score. But let’s take a moment to appreciate the puniest of these sputters, because they encapsulate what makes Aledmys Diaz great — this hustle and hunger to just get on base, somehow, someway. \n“You watch him run to first base on groundballs, how many did he beat out last year?” Cardinals teammate Stephen Piscotty said. “It was incredible. He just goes 100 percent all the time — and you love having those types of guys on your team.” \nWe’ve seen the Diaz pizazz — the laser-show line drives and the firework home runs — but last season he finished 11th in the National League with 24 infield hits. \nThen consider that he had only 460 plate appearances — and the average total of the 10 players ahead of him was 568.5 plate appearances. \nAnd then consider that Diaz only had two bunt singles — five of the 10 guys ahead of him had six or more. \nSo, yeah, pretty impressive for the rookie. And this mindset of just cobbling together an on-base percentage led to one that was pretty nice: .369. Heading into his second year, I love the idea of Diaz batting second, the middle of an OBP “pancake stack,” with Dexter Fowler (.393 OBP last season) and Matt Carpenter (.380). \nAs long as Diaz keeps his walk total high (third on the team in 2016) and tallies a quality walk-to-strikeout rate (14th in NL), we can expect a desired OBP, bolstered by, in part, the wimpiest of hits. \n“Mr. Diaz had an exciting year last year, certainly a breakthrough year,” Cards general manager John Mozeliak said, “and he’s had a very good offseason from the sense of being able to prepare — I think now he understands expectations. Your real hope is that as he looks into this year, he realizes he doesn’t have to put too much pressure on himself.” \nThat was part of the fear last year. What was going on in his head last spring? By May 18, the shortstop had committed 10 errors (he made six more the rest of the season); he’d also swatted 14 doubles by that point and was hitting .376, so it wasn’t all bad. Everything kind of evened out — he came back to earth as a hitter, and ascended as a fielder. This made for an All-Star season. \nDiaz finished as the 20th-best fielding shortstop by FanGraphs — numbers, of course, skewed by the first couple months. And Diaz said during the Winter Warm-Up that he will go to Jupiter two weeks early to get workouts in with Jose Oquendo (The legend of Oquendo has grown quite a bit, has it not, following the Cardinals’ slapdash fielding season). \nAs for Diaz’s throwing, the shortstop explained, “I think last season my shoulder was strong the whole last season — the problem was when I broke my thumb I had to put a lot of stress in my shoulder when I came back, because my forearm was weak. So this year, I just feel 100 percent right now, and the last couple months I’ve been healthy, working my legs and shoulder and my body. Nothing concerned with my arm right now.” \nAnother aspect that excites me about Aledmys, one that might go overlooked? The right-handed hitter hits righties well. \nInterestingly, he hit .317 with a .387 OBP against righthanders, along with 14 of his 17 homers. \nAgainst lefties, Diaz hit .256 with a .323 OBP. \nNow, the previous year in the minors, his splits were essentially the opposite. But if Aledmys can continue to rake against righties, that will complicate things for opposing skippers late in games. You’ll have Fowler, a switch-hitter … then Diaz, a righty who can also hit righties … then the lefty Carpenter … and then a bunch a swatting righties (Piscotty, Randal Grichuk, Jhonny Peralta and Yadi). \nIt’s fair to wonder if he’s a one-season wonder. This wasn’t like some of the other shortstop prospects in the majors, who were earmarked and groomed for greatness. \nBut Diaz should continue to get on base, even if he’s not hitting the baseball well, and that’s the most important thing for the 2017 Cardinals — guys on base. \n“I loved watching Aledmys play last year, and I don’t mind saying he was such a surprise to us in a great way,” pitcher Adam Wainwright said. “We had no idea the kind of caliber player he was. We knew he could hit a little bit, we didn’t know he could hit like that. We just never saw him. We knew he could run a little bit, we didn’t know he could run like he can run. I think when you saw him slow the game down at the end of the year and sort of be more comfortable in the field, he started making the plays too. He’s just a great player. He is a really tough out. I mean that guy can hit. He just adds a lot to our lineup. \n“He is very mature. And he’s funny, man! I don’t know if you all picked that up in the Baseball Writers’ Dinner, but he’s very smart. He’s a great chess player. He’s a very smart guy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T10:08:03.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
