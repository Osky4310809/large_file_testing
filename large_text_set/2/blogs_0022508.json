The report did not differentiate between illegal and legal immigration. \nKirsanow’s statements echoed the report’s findings, though, indicating that the two groups would be in competition for the same positions because many black men would not have access to entry-level jobs. Illegal immigrants would have an unfair advantage because they could be paid lower wages than those paid to citizens or illegal aliens. \n“What happens is you eliminate the rungs on the ladder because a sizable number of black men don’t have access to entry-level jobs,” Kirsanow told Fox News . “It is not just the competition and the unemployment of blacks. It also depresses the wage levels.”   \nKirsanow is not the only black leader to have come out in opposition to the liberal agenda behind illegal immigration. One black writer, Vice contributor Jay Stephens, reportedly argued that illegal immigration hurts the “economic stability” of the black community. \nThere is a myth that the liberals use when combating the very real argument that illegals take our jobs . They say illegals take the jobs that we Americans do not want. However, that is untrue because they are actively displacing hardworking African-American citizens and taking away their employment opportunities. \n“In 2008, the United States Commission on Civil Rights found black men to be disproportionately employed in low-skilled labor jobs and in direct competition with undocumented immigrants,” Stephens said. \nThis is sure to anger a lot of Democrats. However, we agree 100 percent with these viewpoints. It’s about time someone said it.
