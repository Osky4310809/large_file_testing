PA:Press Association Claudio Ranieri was sacked by Leicester less than a year after topping the table \nIt was a bit crazy. But nothing is as crazy as football when it comes to loyalty. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Leicester City news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nThere just isn’t any, as we learned last week with the dismissal of Claudio Ranieri from Leicester only nine months after lifting the title. \nI have been asked to put myself in the position of Leicester’s owners. \nThat’s to say, if I was running my club Newcastle, would I not have done the same with the team on a downward spiral? No, I would not. \nIf my manager had delivered Newcastle the Premier League trophy I would not have sacked him, even if we had gone down the following season.

The majority of Leicester fans might have another view. \nIndeed, there seems to have been greater outrage from outside the King Power Stadium than in and around the club and city. \nIt is their team and the fans are the ones who have had to witness defeats on a regular basis — and the prospect of the Championship looming larger each weekend. \nSo why is there such outrage in a sport where managers regularly get the sack having done a great job? \nFor example, how Chelsea treated Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti. Leicester City fans sing and dance with granny before Champions League tie at Sevilla \nLikewise, Manchester City with both Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini. \nIn this case, however, I think the real anger comes from disappointment that the fairytale is well and truly over. \nLast season, if your team was not going to win the Premier League you wanted Leicester to. \nIf you were lower down the leagues you were rooting for the underdog, they were like one of your own. \nWe all bought into the story. We listened to people who told us it could not be done — and with each win we began to believe, along with the Leicester fans, that they were wrong. AP:Associated Press The 2-1 defeat against Sevilla in the Champions League ended Ranieri's dream at the King Power Stadium PA:Press Association Italian boss Ranieri is a hugely popular figure in Leicester after everything he did for the club Leicester City's caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare says he is saddened by the sacking of Claudio Ranieri \nWe were delighted by the Jamie Vardy story and the other sub-plots around the team. \nThe way the bookies were defied. \nThe geniality of their manager, his funny sayings and amazing passion on the sidelines. In an age when the same teams with the big money were challenging at the top, this was something very different. \nIt was a game-changer that would inspire other clubs who thought it was not possible. \nBut what has happened now is that normal order has been resumed. Leicester have become Leicester again. \nWhat we all wanted was for them to not only prove the underdog could win a title — but could continue to rewrite the script by staying up there. \nNot by winning it again, by continuing to finish high up the league to convince all other owners it could be done.

Leicester instead went for it and dared to dream. But the result was that nobody could quite handle things at the club anymore. \nThe repercussions had left everyone’s heads spinning.
