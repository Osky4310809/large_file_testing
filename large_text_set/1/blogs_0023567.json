Our brave beautiful Hannah lost her fight with cancer yesterday. She passed away peacefully at home with her family. \nREAD MORE: * Blushing pales with age \n\"Hannah fought so hard to get well but it wasn't to be. We are all so proud of her & we will continue her work to raise awareness that you're never too young. Thank you to everyone who has followed Hannahs journey & supported her in her fight.\" \n\nLyson was diagnosed with an unusual case of bowel cancer in May 2016, three weeks before she was due to leave for Camp America. \nShe made the blog to document her three month travel experience in America, but upon being diagnosed decided she'd use it to raise awareness of bowel cancer in young patients, chronicling her \"unwavering determination\" to beat the disease. \nDoctors initially believed the teenager was suffering from irritable bowel syndrome when she complained of back ache and constipation. Ad Feedback \nHowever tests later revealed she had five tumours on her bowel and liver. Lyson had part of her bowel removed and a colostomy bag fitted. \nIn October, Lyson wrote that she had received \"wonderful results\" that the tumours in her liver had shrunk, meaning chemotherapy was working and she \"was on the path to recovery\". \nBut her celebrations were short lived when the following day doctors told her that surgery to remove a tumour in her liver was unsuccessful because cancer cells had been left behind. \n\"This means I still have cancer in my bowel and as yet, it is unknown if the current chemo will get rid of it.\" \nOn January 13, she broke the news to her followers that she was losing the battle. \n\"I'm not writing a blog post as I don't have the effort or ability right now, but sadly today we've been given the worst news imaginable. Sadly, the doctors have decided there's no more chemo for me and the liver is winning this fight and I am losing. \n\"I've tried so hard and me and my family are absolutely distraught so please respect our privacy during this time. Maybe at some point I will write a blog post but right not I'm now feeling up to it.\" \nLyson had five half-sisters, two of which also had cancer: thyroid cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Both women survived. \nLyson's blog has had more than 110,000 hits. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T04:53:29.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
