On the restaurant’s report card , inspectors noted 14 (!!!) violations, including a “red and black mold-like substance” inside the ice machine, raw hamburgers being stored above the collard greens, lobster thawing in sitting water in the sink, and expired milk in the fridge. The inspector also noticed that the kitchen’s handwashing sink didn’t have any soap and that the “person in charge” seemed to have no idea about “several foodborne illness risk factors.” Delicious! \nEscobar opened last December and serves a seafood-heavy menu that includes shrimp tacos, smoked salmon chips and twin lobster tails. (It also serves something called a Tity Boy Turkey Burger, an unfortunate name for both a brunch entree and for 2 Chainz, who’s still trying to make Tity Boy happen.)

Escobar is co-owned by 2 Chainz-slash-Tity Boy (whose real name is Tauheed Epps) and Mychel “Snoop” Dillard, whose website describes her as a “serial entrepreneur.” \n2 Chainz is not the first rapper-turned-restauranteur in Atlanta. Ludacris currently has his signature Chicken and Beer restaurant in the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, and was previously the owner of Straits, a now-closed Singaporean restaurant whose recipes were praised in an issue of Food + Wine . Rapper T.I. also had to close his restaurant, Scales 925, after being sued for non-payment by some of his employees. (And the AJC’s food critic once gave Scales a memorable 0-star review ). \nEscobar’s next inspection is scheduled for March 3. That gives 2 Chainz more than a week to get everything fresh as hell. And also more sanitary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:32:50.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
