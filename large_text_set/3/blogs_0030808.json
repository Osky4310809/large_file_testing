Even the youths had planned a reprisal attack, but we see it as attracting a serious problem that might escalate.” \nAccording to him, it was only the state government that could handle the matter perfectly . He called for Governor Willie Obiano’s urgent attention to their complaints. \nSenior Special Assistant to Governor Obiano on Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), Mr. Uchenna Okafor, who led the officials assured the communities that their demands and complaints would receive the express attention of the governor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:41:51.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
