He said he and Democratic Oversight Leader Elijah Cummings are writing a letter to the office and he will also write to President Donald Trump about the matter. \n“It needs to be dealt with,” he told The Associated Press. “There’s no ifs, ands or buts about it.” \nChaffetz was referring to Conway’s Thursday interview with Fox News in which she boasted she was giving the president’s daughter “a free commercial here” and urged viewers to “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff.” \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Conway has been “counseled.” Chaffetz said that isn’t enough. \nWhile Trump himself is not subject to the standards of ethical conduct for federal employees, Conway is. Among the rules: An employee shall not use his or her office “for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise.” \n(Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
