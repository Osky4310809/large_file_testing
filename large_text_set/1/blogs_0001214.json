REUTERS/Danny Moloshok 5401713 \nChairman of Viacom Sumner Redstone allegedly paid corporate flight attendants to service his most bizarre desires, and for sexual favors, according to one long-time Viacom stewardess. \nFormer corporate flight attendant Betsy Dwyer Loomis flew around the world serving billionaires during her career, but she says that nothing could have prepared her for her encounters with Redstone, the New York Post reports . \nThe 93-year-old business mogul reportedly had the habit of making some odd, even disturbing, requests of those serving him during his corporate travels. He allegedly routinely asked attendants to unbuckle his seatbelt and unzip his fly when he had to use the restroom, and even offered them cash tips of up to $1,000 to comply with his requests, the New York Post reports. \nArguably the most upsetting desire of Sumner’s was his toe-clipping fetish. Sumner would “offer me money to clip his toenails,” Loomis told reporters. “He told me how he wanted to have it done and it wasn’t your typical pedicure.” The mogul would say, “You have to straddle me and sit on my legs facing my feet,” Loomis explains. Sumner would even offer them extra cash if they removed their undergarments while performing the off-putting pedicure. While Loomis says she never accepted Sumner’s toe-clipping advances, she did say that, “the [toenails] were like ancient sea-scrolls. You’d need a sandblaster to get them down to something.” \nRumors about Redstone’s escapades came into the public limelight when reports surfaced that the magnate paid out $24 million to a former flight attendant and her sister in order to keep them quiet about his sexual encounters with the flight attendant. Redstone accidentally blew the whistle on himself, as the payment was only discovered after he filed a lawsuit against two former girlfriends in early December. He claimed they emotionally manipulated and abused him to skirt him out of $150 million over the course of their respective relationships. The women claim that Redstone had full use of his mental faculties and knowingly made the gifts. \nRedstone announced he was stepping down from the board of Viacom in February this December, but he will continue to manage his $40 billion empire through his National Amusements holding company. He will also remain on the board of CBS. Bob Bakish will take over as president and chief executive office of Viacom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T18:33:14.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
