At least the only one of these in existence sold for nearly double the price of a working console. \nThe machinists at Waterjet Channel decided to commemorate the launch of the Nintendo Switch by destroying one in the name of art. More specifically, they made a video showing what it looks like when you use a 60,000 psi waterjet cutter to slice three symbolic triangles out of the new hardware. From the eBay description: This item doesn't work as a video game console but is a terrific piece of art. \nAmazingly, the console holds up for a comically long time as it literally gets a significant-sized hole cut out of it (the Triforce of strength, obviously). And that's what happens when you try to destroy a Switch. This bodes well for them bonking about in the wild. One of the machinists called the Switch \"possibly the most durable console you can buy right now.\" \nThis non-functional piece of art ended up selling for $565 on eBay . Comparatively, a new Switch goes for $300 (granted this ruined one still comes with functional peripherals, like the Joy-Con controllers and dock), meaning the machinists turned quite the profit with this audacious experiment.
