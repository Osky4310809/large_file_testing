Read More 'Karen Matthews was guilty of faking Shannon's kidnap but we've all paid the price' \nBut McKay, who also worked on the drama Appropriate Adult about serial killer Fred West , said: “We don’t tell it from Matthews’ point of view, we don’t defend her or condemn her, we just call it as we saw it. \n“We don’t make any apology for Karen’s crime. She’s frequently described as evil in the Press, which, to put her in the same category as Rose West and Myra Hindley , is just daft.

We just want to be left alone.” \nThey said they hadn’t been contacted by anyone from the makers. \nThe family is worried that their name will once again be dragged through the mud when the programme is screened. \nThey have talked about contacting a solicitor to try to stop the show, which starts on Tuesday night. \nMembers of the family don’t know if they will feature in the programme or how they will be portrayed. \nThe show is called The Moorside after the housing estate in Dewsbury, West Yorks, where the real-life drama unfolded in February 2008. \nA huge police operation was launched when nine-year-old Shannon failed to return home from a school swimming trip. \nMatthews, now 41, made emotional TV appeals for the return of her daughter which led to a £50,000 reward being put up. \nThe local community pulled together to raise publicity in the desperate search for the youngster.

Read More \nBoth Sheridan and Sian, 37, spent time with their characters’ real-life counterparts to prepare for their roles. \nSian said: “When I spoke to Natalie, she gave this impression of community. They were so close. \n“Mothers along their road would have their doors open all the time, they would look after each other’s kids. \n“Natalie and Karen had been friends for many years and so, for her, it was a huge sense of betrayal.” Karen Matthews (Photo: West Yorkshire Police/PA) \nSheridan revealed she has become friends with the woman she portrays and said: “Julie never wanted to see bad of Karen. She never wanted to give up hope. \n“Me and Julie are still friends. I’ve got such admiration for everyone on that estate, but especially Julie. \n“She’s stronger that I am. She helped me with the whole journey all along.” \nBut despite Matthews’ former pals helping with the production, her family say they have had no contact from the makers but fear they will be back in the national spotlight. \nA family member said: “We’ve had no contact, no. And we won’t be watching it.” The search for Shannon cost the taxpayer £3 million (Photo: PA) \nThey said they felt they had been hounded over the years because of Matthews’ actions. \nOne family friend said: “They didn’t know about the show until they read it was going to be on TV.

They’re furious about it. \n“They feel their name has been dragged through the mud for years. \n“They just want to forget about it, but they’re not being allowed.” \nMatthews and Donovan were released from prison after serving half their sentences. \nLast month it emerged Matthews has turned to God as she tries to turn her life around. \nShe has joined a Bible group to meet new friends, has become a teetotaller and prays every day in an effort to lift her spirits. \nMatthews claims her notoriety has left her unable to get a job and is trying to survive on £25 a week in benefits. \nShe has moved hundreds of miles away from her former home in Dewsbury and adopted a new name.
