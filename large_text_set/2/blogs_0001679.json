Durkin | 11:45 am, February 1st, 2017 video \nPastor Darrell Scott , who has long been a fervent supporter of Donald Trump , met with the President at the White House Wednesday as part of a meeting for Black History Month, and used his opportunity at the table to reveal a piece of curious news to the Commander in Chief . \n“I was contacted,” he said to the President, “by some of the top gang thugs in Chicago for a sit down. They reached out to me because they associated me with you. They respect you.” \n“They believe in what you’re doing,” Scott continued, “and they want to have a sit down about lowering that body count.” \nWednesday’s meeting was spearheaded by executive Assistant Omarosa Manigault ; Dr. Ben Carson was also in attendance, sitting to the left of President Trump. \n“That’s a great idea, because Chicago is totally out of control,” Trump offered in response. \n“They agreed that the principles that can do it — these are guys from the streets, no politicians, straight street guys — but they’re gonna commit that if they lower that body count, we’ll come in and we’ll do some social programs,” Pastor Scott continued Wednesday. \nBut Trump cautioned that while Scott’s efforts are “the right thing,” he has stood firm that his administration is prepared to take direct action. Last week, POTUS threatened federal intervention ; following a segment on The O’Reilly Factor that touted the violent crimes statistics in the Windy City, Trump took to Twitter moments later: If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible “carnage” going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 \n“We’re gonna solve the problem for them,” Trump said in response Wednesday if the ‘top gang thugs,’ can’t do it themselves. “What’s happening in Chicago should not be happening in this country,” he continued. \nWatch above via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:33:13.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
