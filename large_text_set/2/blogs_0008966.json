The country is a global leader in adapting to the needs of an aging citizenry, with racks of reading glasses at bank counters and walking-cane holders in city offices. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story With its expanding efforts to accommodate the growing population of the elderly, Japan offers a foretaste of the kinds of societal changes that are beginning to shake a number of wealthy places with rapidly aging populations, including many countries in Western Europe as well as South Korea and Hong Kong. In Japan, companies are developing special thickening products that can be added to meals during preparation to alter the texture of various foods and ease swallowing. In a culture where meals are prepared with great care and artistry, the thickening gels make it possible for chefs to reshape the food into visually pleasing dishes.

Credit Kentaro Takahashi for The New York Times At the Mutuai nursing home in Yokohama, nutritionists and chefs experiment regularly so that they can offer residents a variety of meals. On a recent afternoon, the lunch menu was Japanese sea bass and sweet-and-sour marinated carrots and radishes, with a side dish of spinach and mushrooms. To adapt the meal to those with slight swallowing problems, the kitchen staff substituted flounder, a more tender fish, and removed the mushrooms and stems from the spinach. For the residents who have more severe swallowing issues, the staff sent the meal through a food processor, adding a gel powder before cooking the puréed versions in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. Then the resulting gelatinous blocks were poured into molds so that the chefs could create meals that looked like a piece of fish accented with slices of carrots and radish. “We want them to enjoy different textures, flavors and looks,” said Fumie Egashira, a dietary consultant who works with the nursing home. “This is one of the greatest joys for them. We are not satisfied just because they feel full or can eat safely. We also have to give them pleasure and let them share a meal together.” In a sun-filled dining alcove, eight women ages 70 to 99 gathered for lunch as three servers circulated among them, delivering different meals depending on the residents’ swallowing capabilities. As the women deftly ate with chopsticks, Natsuko Suzuki, a staff dietitian, noted that a few years ago, the kitchen staff had simply chopped or puréed meals, which was not particularly enticing for residents. Now, Ms. Suzuki said, “they clearly understand what they are eating.” As people age and are increasingly restricted in their activities, eating is one of the few daily gratifications they have left, said Eiichi Saitoh, a professor at Fujita Health University. \nAdvertisement “Solving the eating problem is not just about averting pneumonia or suffocation, dehydration or malnutrition,” Mr. Saitoh said. “It is also a quality-of-life issue because it is the most important activity for our pleasure.” Photo A worker pouring stir-fried and stewed lotus root into molds at a nursing home in Atsugi.

Others that tailor meals to the needs of older eaters include luxury hotels like the New Otani in Osaka or the Nikko Kanaya in Tochigi, about 85 miles north of Tokyo, which honor special requests to chop or purée courses. Yoshinoya, a casual restaurant chain that serves a variety of beef and rice bowls, now sells special packages of softened beef stew to nursing homes and hospitals. While puréeing and chopping make food easier to swallow, doctors say some people still have trouble: The purée may go down too fast, and chopped pieces can accidentally slip into the lungs.
