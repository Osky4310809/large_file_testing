Check them out in the gallery and read on for the sets' contents and analysis. \nThe Milano vs. the Abilisk set includes updates to all minifigures as well as the Guardians chosen mode of transportation. The Milano itself is slightly smaller than the last film’s LEGO set, but it comes with the tentacled space monster seen in the trailer in a style similar to the Dr. Strange set from last year. \nStar Lord’s design is updated, as he’s not wearing the Ravager gear from the first series, and Gamora and Drax appear to be in similar garb. Drax now sports arm printing, his tattoos extending across his body. Nebula makes an appearance in handcuffs and in the Milano, maybe an indication that the Guardians may get a reluctant new member in the film. And of course, the Baby Groot figure we’ve seen is included in this set, so this one will probably be a popular for its inclusion of a majority of the Guardians themselves. \nAyesha’s Revenge includes the films villain and the namesake of the set in a design similar to Funko’s Dorbz rendition previously seen. Star Lord and Baby Groot appear in this set as well, with Star Lord’s design looking like the design from previous sets. Yondo makes his LEGO debut with a unique mohawk hairpiece and his trademark golden arrow. The set includes a single-person shuttle adorned with Ravager imagery, an accompanying drone with stud shooters, and the explosive control panel that Baby Groot runs off with in the trailer. There appears to be an item in Ayesha’s possession, as well as the explosive controls, on the box art which is then shown to be placed in the Ravager ship. Could Yondu and Star Lord be forming a temporary alliance to retrieve a powerful artifact, just as in the first one? It’s a rehash, but should make for some entertaining moments should it be true. \nAnd Rocket returns in the final set, Ravager Attack, which also includes incoming Guardians member Mantis in her minifigure debut. A rival Ravager dubbed Taserface acts as the villain in this set, with the box art depicting Rocket and Mantis fighting against him. \nThe set also includes a Warbird-esque ship, so those fans who missed out on Rocket’s SDCC exclusive all those years ago might find solace in a similar build. \nThe sets should be released sometime before the movie hits theaters, so wait for LEGO to give the official word on when they’ll finally hit shelves. \nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos. The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill’s true parentage. Old foes become new allies and fan-favorite characters from the classic comics will come to our heroes’ aid as the Marvel cinematic universe continues to expand. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is written and directed by James Gunn (Slither). The film marks the return of the original Guardians, including Chris Pratt (Jurassic World) as Peter Quill/Star-Lord; Zoe Saldana (Star Trek Into Darkness) as Gamora; Dave Bautista (Spectre) as Drax; Vin Diesel (Furious 7) as the voice of Groot; Bradley Cooper (American Sniper) as the voice of Rocket; Michael Rooker (Jumper) as Yondu; Karen Gillan (The Big Short) as Nebula; and Sean Gunn (Gilmore Girls) as Kraglin. New cast members include Pom Klementieff (Oldboy), Elizabeth Debicki (The Great Gatsby, Everest), Chris Sullivan (The Knick, The Drop) and Kurt Russell (The Hateful Eight, The Thing). \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is scheduled to hit theaters on May 5, 2017.
