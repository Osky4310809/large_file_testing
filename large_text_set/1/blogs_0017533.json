Looking to change world w humor. lizadonnelly.com 10 mins ago Women’s March In Washington, DC A sea of pink hats on January 21, 2017 It was an amazing day. While we did not make history on January 20th by electing the first woman president, history may was made on January 21 by the sheer size of the Women’s March in DC. Along with the fact that many other marches were being held simultaneously around the globe. The crowds were friendly and happy, and they seemed enthused to be there to express their views in a demonstration. It was multi-generational, and there were families of all sizes. The crowd was diverse, and while the majority of participants were women, there were many men there as well. There were pink pussy hats on a wide variety of bodies. They speakers were many and also diverse, from Gloria Steinem to Ashley Judd, Scarlett Johansson, Michael Moore, Van Johnson, Angela Davis and more. Many speakers were not familiar names, but people who work hard on the ground as activists trying to make the world a better place. Speakers urged the crowd to take action, don’t lose hope. My favorite part was when many women from Congress took the stage together, it was a powerful image. They urged the crowd to run for office. Or at least support a sister running for office. I wish I could have drawn more. There was so much to see, so much hope and enthusiasm, so many great pink vistas. But it got cold, and very crowded, so it became hard to draw after a while. Here are some of the drawings I did of the crowds, and some of the speakers. I was so happy to be there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:51:41.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
