Through pushing creative boundaries and challenging “dress codes” and the norm, the result is a selection filled with conventional silhouettes, created in unconventional ways.\nKey pieces to watch out for are the flight jacket, sherpa coat, and angular-cut corduroys, to name a few. Set to be split up into three deliveries between Spring/Summer 2017, Fall/Winter 2017 and the holiday season, be sure to be on the lookout for further news on specific drop dates.\nIn further celebration of the collection, Bristol will be hosting a special cocktail party at their showroom during Paris Fashion Week: Men’s on January 18 from 8 p.m. to midnight. \nBristol Showroom at Paris Fashion Week \n40 Rue de la Tour d’Auvergne\n75009, Paris \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:44:39.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
