When contacted, Netflix declined to comment on the matter.\nSEE ALSO: Netflix partners with India's leading carriers as it faces the heat from Amazon Prime Video \nThe partnership, when finalized, will include exclusive digital rights for Aamir Khan's upcoming movie \"Thugs of Hindostan,\" said one source. The company wants to market \"Thugs of Hindostan\" as a Netflix original.\nAs part of the partnership, Netflix is also seeking \"pre-television\" rights (rights to stream the movie before it is premiered on cable TV) for the movies, said the other source. Aamir Khan Productions is resisting the idea of a \"simultaneous worldwide availability\" of its upcoming movies, however. \nLaunched in 1999, Aamir Khan Productions has some of the biggest blockbuster titles including Academy Award-nominated Lagaan , Taare Zameen Par , Dangal and Dhobi Ghat . \nAt his recent trip to India, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings met Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan and furthered discussions, said both the sources. \"The meeting didn't close everything we wanted, but we're getting there,\" the sources added. \nNetflixed & Chilled.

Sequel to Tamil film Enthiran , the sci-fi movie is expected to release later this year. \nOne source said that India's entertainment conglomerate Zee has acquired TV rights for 2.0 , however digital rights are still up for grabs. We've heard that the price for 2.0 is \"ridiculously high\", and Amazon is more likely to score it.\nIndia is a big market for both Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, especially since neither of the companies have been able to make a dent in China's market due to the country's tight regulatory regime.\nSo far, Netflix appears to be trailing behind its global rival Amazon Prime Video in India. Launched in India (and 241 other regions) in December , Amazon Prime Video offers a much wider catalog of Indian content. The entertainment arm of the ecommerce giant has struck deals with several major Indian movie studios and distributors to score major libraries , as opposed to Netflix's rather modest approach of picking a handful of titles. \nOn top of this, Amazon Prime Video is much more affordable in the country . Amazon Prime Video costs about the same for a yearly-subscription as Netflix charges for one month access. \nBut Netflix is making some moves. Last week Mashable exclusively reported about Netflix's plan to add Paytm as a payment option to Indian subscribers . The company is also exploring deals with local TV manufacturers to have Netflix app pre-installed on their smart TV lineups. \nWATCH: The hidden clues lurking in the 'Stranger Things' Season 2 trailer", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T12:55:15.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
