Both stars have begun the publicity circuit for the film, with distinctly different approaches on questions about their former relationship. \nEvans r ecently gave an interview to Esquire , where he talked about his opposition to President Trump and literally jumped out of a plane alongside the reporter. But when it came to questions about Slate, he wouldn't go into any kind of detail. “Yeah, but I'm steering clear of those questions,” he said.“You can almost feel his heart pinch,” Esquire writer Maximillian Potter added after the quote. \nSlate, by contrast, has been profiled by Vulture and talked extensively about their relationship: How they met, the pressures of fame and how they \"threw down pretty hard\" in the breakup. \n“I don’t mind talking about him at all. He’s a lovely person,” she said. “I don’t know. It feels like such a huge thing. Last year was a giant, big year for my heart. I’ve never, ever thought to keep anything private because that’s not really what I’m like, and now I’m learning those things, and they’re weird, kind of demented lessons to learn.” \nAt first, she thought they were too different. \"At first I was like, ‘What a (expletive) nightmare,'\" she explained. “Chris is a different speed than me — I think he really did just jump out of a plane for an interview . ... This guy’s like a sports guy. He’s the kid that likes P.E.'\" Eventually she took a chance and their romance blossomed. But it didn't last forever. Part of the problem was the intensity of the spotlight on them. \n“Chris is a very, very famous person,” she said. “For him to go to a restaurant is totally different than for me to go. I sit in my window and I say ‘Hi’ to people on the street. I have more freedom because I’m not Captain America. I’m mostly a cartoon.” \nSlate also noted how she and Evans got together as she was going through a divorce with editor-director Dean Fleischer-Camp, and which made things difficult. \n“Even though we had an amicable divorce, I think that’s still something that you need to mourn. When you get separated from somebody that you actually care about, it is the destruction of a belief system. That is really, really sad,” she said. “I just didn’t have the tools. And I didn’t think very hard about that, to be honest.” \nShe also added that she and Evans are not on bad terms, but they haven't seen each other very much -- something that will change as the press tour for Gifted heats up. \n“I think it’s probably best. I’d love to be his friend one day, but we threw down pretty hard. No regrets, though. Ever.” \nRead the full interview at Vulture .
