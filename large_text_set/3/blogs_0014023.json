A scrappy opening goal was topped off with a classy finish by Vargas to leave the MLS side without an away goal and with the odds stacked against it for the second leg on April 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T09:03:14.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
