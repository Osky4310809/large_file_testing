What I've done in the past is change people's opinions of me and force my way into a very good Liverpool team. \n\"I've shown that I can perform at the highest level. I am more than confident of doing the same again. I still feel like I've got a lot to offer. I am really excited and looking forward to the challenge. \n\"There's a lot of competition but that was the case before when I was playing regularly for Liverpool. I want to get back to that. \n\"I still believe I've got a future at Liverpool. I'm not thinking about moving on. You have to be confident in your own ability and I'm ready for the fight.\" \nPremier League rules dictate that loan players are not permitted to play against their parent club, which means Flanagan is unavailable for selection when Burnley travel to Liverpool on Sunday. \nThe one-time capped England international will be in the stands at Anfield and believes both clubs will achieve their main aims this season. \n\"I'm looking forward to it,\" Flanagan added. \"It's a difficult one for me. I want Burnley to stay in the Premier League but I've been a Liverpool fan all my life and they're still my club. \n\"After what happened at Leicester, Liverpool got their form back against Arsenal last weekend. It was a really dominant performance. The front three really clicked and Adam Lallana had a great game just behind them. When Liverpool perform like that going forward they are difficult to stop. \n\"They had a great start to the season and they were right up there in terms of the title race. But that blip in January and February cost them. Now it's about getting in the top four which would still be a good achievement. It's tight between second and sixth but I fancy Liverpool to finish in that top four. \n\"Burnley have shocked a lot of people with where we are in the table. People expected us to be in a real battle to stay up but Sean Dyche has done a great job. He's getting the best out of the players. \n\"It's been a great season up until now but there's still work to be done to ensure we stay up. We want to get beyond that 40-point mark. The two lads up front, Andre Gray and Ashley Barnes, have done great for us. They will pose a danger on Sunday.\" \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
