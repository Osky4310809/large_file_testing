They make it tough for college coaches to evaluate prospects. The following things are limited by the NCAA at various times of the year: prospects visiting a college campus (officially or unofficially), coaches visiting a prospect's school, coaches visiting a prospect's home, written communication, and electronic communication.\nContact period \nThe most wide-open time. During this time, coaches can visit with prospects and families regardless of location. In-person contact is permitted once per week. Note that a coach cannot visit a school multiple times in one week if it has more than one prospect.  Electronic and written communications are also permitted.\nThis is when tales of coaches praising Mama's cooking are born, during in-home visits.\nEvaluation period \nConsiderably more restrictive than the contact period in one key way: off campus face-to-face contact is not permitted. That means no home visits. Coaches can still visit a prospect's school. Visits to schools are ostensibly for the purpose of evaluation. Prospects can visit colleges and receive written and electronic communication. Many scholarship offers go out in this period.\nQuiet period \nThe quiet period tightens things a bit more, preventing any off-campus contact or viewing. Visits to the college's campus and written or electronic communications are still permitted.\nCoaches often try to have prospects visit campus unofficially during this time in the spring and early summer, so that they can become familiar with campus.\nDead period \nThe dead period is the most restrictive. No in-person contact is allowed, even if a prospect makes a visit to the college campus. Written and electronic communications are still permitted.\nAnd yet, prospects still do decide to commit to schools in late December and early January, often because they've considered all their options, taken all their visits, and are ready to pull the trigger.\nRecruiting calendar The NCAA's recruiting calendar is confusing and written for compliance offices. Using 2015-2016 as an example, here's a simplified version, though it obviously changes slightly from year to year:\nDate and period Visit prospect's school Visit prospect outside of school Prospect can visit university & meet w/ coaches 8/1/16 - 11/26/16 Quiet ✓ 9/1/16 - 11/30/16 Evaluation (42 select days) ✓ ✓ 11/27/16 - 12/12/16 Contact ✓ ✓ ✓ 12/12/16 - 1/11/17 Dead 1/12/17 - 1/29/17 Contact ✓ ✓ ✓ 1/30/17 Quiet ✓ 1/31/17 - 2/2/17 Dead 2/3/17 - 4/14/17 Quiet ✓ 4/15/17 - 5/31/17 Evaluation ✓ ✓ 6/1/17 - 6/26/17 Quiet ✓ 6/27/17 - 7/9/17 Dead 7/10/17 - 7/31/17 Quiet ✓ Note that between 12/12/16 and 1/11/17, admitted mid-year enrollees who have signed financial aid paperwork with the college are governed by contact period rules.
