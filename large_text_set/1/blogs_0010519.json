Lesley Stahl speaks to a counterterrorism adviser who admits U.S. failures in dealing with hostages, and to the parents of Steven Sotloff, a journalist who was kidnapped and killed by ISIS 2017 Jan 08 Facebook Comments \nThe following script is from “The Hostage Policy,” which aired on Jan. 8, 2017. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Rich Bonin and Ayesha Siddiqi, producers. \nIn the long, bloody history of terrorism, few acts of violence have been more savage or shocking than those carried out by ISIS, including the beheadings of young American hostages in 2014. The videos went viral and catapulted ISIS onto the world stage. \nFor the parents of one of those Americans, Art And Shirley Sotloff, the murder of their 31-year-old son Steven was shattering, because of the brutality of his execution, and because they think he could’ve been saved if not for what even the White House now admits was its own ineffectiveness in dealing with the crisis. But what really sealed their son’s fate, the Sotloffs believe, is the government’s policy against paying ransom. \nSteven Sotloff Personal photo \n[Video: I am Steven Joel Sotloff. I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before you.] \nSteven Joel Sotloff was beheaded by ISIS. His execution, on September 2, 2014, was seen around the world on a video. \nLesley Stahl: Did you ever watch it? \nArt Sotloff: I have viewed Steven’s body with his head on his chest. \nShirley Sotloff: I had to see that ‘cause I needed to be sure that that was him. \nSteven was born and raised in Miami, attended college in Israel, and became a freelance journalist, reporting from war zones where information was scarce, like Yemen, Benghazi, Libya and Syria where he went in the summer of 2013. \nJust before he crossed into Aleppo, he called his dad. \nArt Sotloff: He contacted me and told me not to worry, and, but if I don’t hear from him within four days, that I should get in touch with one of his colleagues. \nLesley Stahl: Oh, that’s ominous. \nHe didn’t hear from his son. Not just for four days. It was four excruciating months. Then, finally they got a ransom letter with demands for the government to free all the Muslims in U.S. custody. \nLuke Somers in Sanaa, Yemen, July 2013. AP \nNote to readers: In reporting our story on Steven Sotloff, we spoke with, among others, the family of American photojournalist Luke Somers. Just a month after Sotloff was captured by ISIS in Syria in 2013, Somers was seized in Yemen by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Like Sotloff, Somers tragically died in late 2014 while in captivity . Along with a South African teacher, Somers was shot by his captors during a Navy SEAL rescue attempt. \nShirley Sotloff: “Then there is a last option. €100 million will secure Steven’s release.” \nLesley Stahl: --which is something like 100-- \nArt Sotloff: $137 million. \nLesley Stahl: What was your reaction? \nShirley Sotloff: Reaction was how the hell are we going to get this money together? \nThey thought the U.S. government would help them, but they were bewildered and then infuriated when they say they met a stone wall, the U.S. policy forbidding the paying of ransom. \nLisa Monaco: It’s some of the hardest work that I’ve done. \nLisa Monaco, assistant to President Obama for counterterrorism, oversaw the hostage crisis. \nLisa Monaco: These are horrible choices. On the one hand, if you don’t pay a ransom, you are putting an innocent life at risk. On the other hand, if you do, you’re fueling the very activity that’s put them at risk in the first place. \nLesley Stahl: Did you feel ever that the policy might be wrong? \nLisa Monaco: The policy that’s been a decades-old policy of not paying ransom, I think is the right policy. \nLesley Stahl: So you didn’t question that. \nLisa Monaco: We didn’t. We believed that that was important to maintain. \nBut with the exception of the UK, most European countries do pay ransom -- without publicly admitting it. Steven was held with 22 other hostages, including the three Americans James Foley, Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller, who were all killed. Once the European governments paid ransom, ISIS released their citizens, one of whom smuggled out this letter from Steven. \nSteven Sotloff’s letter to his family CBS News \nArt Sotloff: He was speaking how he can’t stand seeing all the captives leave from all different countries. How could the United States just stand by and not do anything? \nAs the European hostages came out and spoke of mock executions and waterboardings, the Sotloffs decided they would try to raise at least some of the money themselves. But then they and the other U.S. families attended a meeting in Washington with officials on the National Security Council. \nTo learn about where to receive support for hostage victims and their families, visit Hostage US , an independent nonprofit that offers guidance during and after a kidnapping. \nArt Sotloff: All of us were saying, “Well, why can’t we try to save our kids? And they said, “Because it’s against the law. We do not negotiate with terrorists.” \nLesley Stahl: Did they say you would be prosecuted? \nArt Sotloff: They said, “You could be prosecuted, and also your donors could be prosecuted.” \nLesley Stahl: So if I gave you money, I could be prosecuted? \nShirley Sotloff: Yes-- \nLesley Stahl: Did anybody say, “Are you kidding me?” \nArt Sotloff: Yes, they did. Yes, they did. \nLesley Stahl: So it was a little bit contentious. \nArt Sotloff: Oh yeah. We kind of verbally fought back. \nLesley Stahl: They were threatened that they could be prosecuted. Is that true? \nLisa Monaco: So what’s true is that some families felt threatened. And that was unacceptable. And that should never have happened. \nLesley Stahl: Are you suggesting they may not have been threatened? \nLisa Monaco: No. What I’m suggesting is, I wasn’t present when any threats were made, but what matters, Lesley, is that these families felt that way as they were going through the most horrific time they will ever encounter. \nLesley Stahl: But was that the policy? Was that true? Could they have actually been prosecuted? Could someone who contributed to pay ransom also be prosecuted? \nLisa Monaco: So what’s true is that the Justice Department has never prosecuted a family or friends of a family that has paid a ransom. \nLesley Stahl: But was it the policy? \nLisa Monaco: Well, what’s, the, the policy is the United States Government will not pay ransoms or make concessions to terrorist hostage takers. \nThat policy is based in part on a presumption that paying ransom invites more hostage taking. But that is refuted by a new study that examined the case of every known Western hostage taken since 911. It was co-authored by Peter Bergen, a counterterrorism expert, for the non-partisan New America Foundation. \nPeter Bergen: They don’t know necessarily you’re American when they take you. It’s sort of a target of opportunity. So some countries are known to pay ransom – the French, the Germans, the Spanish. \nLesley Stahl: Even though, they don’t admit it. \nPeter Bergen: They don’t admit it, but they do. Their citizens have much better outcomes than Americans. Americans are huge outliers here. You’re twice as likely to have a negative outcome compared to every other Western hostage. \nLesley Stahl: You say negative outcome. You mean murdered. \nPeter Bergen: Murdered, die in captivity or just remain in captivity. \nFourteen of the European hostages held with Steven made it home. Those from countries that don’t pay ransom didn’t: four Americans and two Brits died. \nLesley Stahl: I keep playing in my own head this horrible situation where the American hostages watched the other ones be set free. And I wonder if it wouldn’t have been better if, if our government did what the European governments did, which was pay ransom but then deny it in order to save their citizens. Why couldn’t we have done that? \nLisa Monaco: We’d still be fueling their terror activity. Whether it’s hostage taking or whether it’s terrorist plots, to kill Americans here in the homeland or elsewhere, is not activity that the United States government should be in the business of funding. \nLesley Stahl: What do you say to critics of the policy of not paying ransom? That the beheadings of the Americans ended up having more value to ISIS than any money would have been. That’s really what put them on the international map. These beheading videos were a gold mine for ISIS. Do you, do you see it that way? \nLisa Monaco: I don’t. And-- I think it’s giving brutal, murderous thugs too much credit. \nLesley Stahl: What about the argument that if you pay ransom you’re just encouraging them to kidnap more? But also that the money is going to go toward terrorism. And so what’s the come back to that? It’s a hard thing. \nArt Sotloff: Going back to what President Obama said to us in person that he would do anything in his power to save his children if he was in the same situation. And I say that he should put himself in the same situation. And I think that the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens in whatever way that they can. \nLesley Stahl: What do you say when you hear people argue that Steven knew he was putting his life at risk by going into Syria at that point and, you know, kinda the burden’s on him? \nArt Sotloff: Steven was driven by truth. That he had to report the truth. He saw that there wasn’t information coming out of these areas. And that’s really what drove him. \nIn the summer of 2014, nearly a year after Steven was abducted, President Obama ordered a military operation to rescue the hostages. \nLisa Monaco: This involved a number of, a large number of military service members and special operators who— \nLesley Stahl: Putting their lives on the line. \nLisa Monaco: Putting their lives on the line. Going into the heart of ISIL territory in Syria. And as we were monitoring the operation, word came back, some very devastating words: “It’s a dry hole,” which meant that they weren’t there. \n[Jihadi John: This is James Wright Foley.] \nAbout seven weeks later, James Foley became the first of three American hostages beheaded. Steven appears at the end of the video. \n[Jihadi John points knife at camera: The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.] \nThe Sotloffs then received an audio message that sounds like Steven was forced to record, designed to pressure the U.S. government. It was given to them by the FBI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:40:34.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
