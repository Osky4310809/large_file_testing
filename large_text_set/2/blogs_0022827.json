And a true leader knows that we must use every tool in our arsenal to stare down those threats and take advantages of the opportunities this century offers us.” \nFureigh has a long history of Democratic political activism and advocacy. After he first made the decision to enter politics, he began as a community organizer for Organization for America , a project of the Democratic National Committee to bolster grass roots support for then-President Barack Obama’s legislative proposals. \nHe also worked as a field organizer for Tommy Sowers, a Democratic candidate who attempted to unseat incumbent Democratic Rep. Jo Ann Emerson in 2010. \nMore recently, he worked at the Truman National Security Project. The goal of the organization is to train “progressives to deepen their understanding of national security issues and master the communications skills needed to make their case in the public square.” \nThe advisory board of the Truman National Security Project is full of anti-Trump luminaries like former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris. \nThe other Obama appointee, Kayla Williams, said she planned to attend the anti-Trump Women’s March in Washington, D.C., in January and said she would bring her children. \n“I plan to attend as a private citizen with my young children as part of my efforts to show them that people should stand together for what they believe in,” Williams told Stars and Stripes . \nWilliams has also retweeted messages that oppose Trump’s immigration suspension . \nShe also retweeted a message Nov. 9 that urged women to get their IUDs as soon as possible “before Trump-Pence reverse the requirement for full contraceptive coverage.” \nAlthough White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has stated that “we should be making sure that people who are coming in as appointees of the President support the President’s agenda,” both Fureigh and Williams seem to prove an exception to the rule. \nSend tips to [email protected] .
