So how good has he actually been? Is the 26-year-old Australian midfielder worth the hype? \nFoxsports.com.au quizzed Stuart Brennan from The Manchester Evening News and Blake Welton from The Huddersfield Examiner for their insight. \nWelton, who covers every game for the local paper, described Mooy’s arrival as a “coup” for the club – adding that his arrival has pushed the club from “instead of being seventh, or eighth, pushing for the play-offs … the club is third, pushing the automatic promotion places”. \n“Aaron Mooy has been the extra bit of star dust and sparkle this season,” Welton said. \nHowever, an early decision by Town boss David Wagner to shock Mooy and push him deeper, away from the position he starred in for Melbourne City, could be the catalyst for the door to open for a chance at Manchester City under Pep Guardiola. \nWHAT DID CITY THINK WHEN MOOY’S SIGNING WAS ANNOUNCED? \nBrennan : Mooy was not on our radar at all when he signed, and the presumption was that he was another Caceres or Brattan. \nThe club hinted that he would not be joining the first team squad, so the signing was pretty much ignored, especially as Sane, Gundogan, Bravo, Nolito, Stones and Jesus business was also being done.

(Friends in Australia told me) ‘This is guy is good’ – but could he step up? That was the issue. \nHe’s come from Australia; Melbourne City and Pep Guardiola have seen something in him, but the Australian league is something different to the competitiveness of the Championship. That was the issue everyone had, but he was not the only one people had concerns over. It was one of many unknown quantities. Most people here didn’t know what to make of (the season) – we would have looked at a top 10 finish as a major part of successful season. \nHOW TOWN BOSS DAVID WAGNER COULD HAVE OPENED CITY DOOR FOR HIM \nWelton: He’s come in and played a different role to his Australian (position). \nHe plays deeper, further back for Huddersfield Town, it was a conscious decision. Huddersfield's team manager David Wagner. Source: AP \nMooy came to the club thinking he’d be a No.10, but David Wagner brought Jack Payne in at No.10, Kasey Palmer as a No.10 from Chelsea, Izzy Brown can play No.10 – so Wagner had a pre-defined idea of what he wanted for Aaron, which was more a deep role where he can orchestrate more alongside Jonathan Hogg, the enforcing midfielder. \nHe can direct and dictate more with his array of passing, keeping the ball, using the ball, and creating. 14 min delay for neck injury 1:19 \nWatch the Socceroos play Iraq in Iran on Fox Sports, kick-off 11pm, preview 10.30pm AEDT, Fox Sports 505 HD. \nSO WHAT HAVE CITY FANS MADE OF HIM NOW? \nBrennan: Those City fans who have watched him play for Huddersfield have been very impressed. \nHe looks a very good all round midfielder and seems a genuine guy as well. The FA rules wouldn’t allow it but some fans were hoping he could get dispensation to play against City in the FA Cup tie last month, so they could see him tested. \nHE COULD ACTUALLY FIT IN AT CITY? \nBrennan: I know he is seen as more of an attacking midfielder in Australia, but that would bring him into direct competition with world class Silva, De Bruyne and Gundogan at City. From what we have seen of him, he is more than capable of playing a deeper role, and with Yaya Toure’s future uncertain this summer, and Fernando perhaps a little short at this level, he could get a chance to stake a claim in a deeper position. David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Fernandinho. Source: AFP \nWelton: Playing the deeper role at Town, learning that craft, honing it so successfully, could mean he has a future at Manchester City. Now he’s playing further back, doing so well, I can see him being a more than able deputy for Fernandinho, or even replacing him when he’s got a 24-match ban for something stupid.

Source: News Corp Australia \nWHAT’S ACTUALLY BEEN SO IMPRESSIVE? \nWelton: His reading of the game and how he’s able to control the tempo of the game - when to speed it up, play killer balls, keep possession. He makes Huddersfield tick, there’s no disputing that. \nWe would maybe like him to weigh in with more goals … but because of his deeper role, he’s not taking up the offensive positions from Melbourne. \nIf he’s on form, Huddersfield Town are on form. \nBrennan: He rarely gives the ball away, which is a pre-requisite for any Pep Guardiola player. His passing is accurate and meaningful, he has the necessary physical aggression for the English game, and he can score goals, from open play and set pieces. Aaron Mooy in the Championship. Source: Twitter \nAlso his attitude and demeanour are exactly what Guardiola asks for in a player. He has been the best Championship player I have seen this season, so he is clearly good enough for the Premier League - whether he is also good enough for City remains to be seen. \nPODCAST: Adam Peacock and Daniel Garb are joined by Mike Cockerill to discuss the Socceroos, a controversial weekend in the A-League and much more. \nLIVE coverage of the Socceroos’ World Cup Qualifiers on FOX SPORTS with the Foxtel Sports Pack.

From mid-October through to November, Town went on a terrible run, from top of the league flying high to looking over the shoulder at the top six – Aaron did look jaded then. It wasn’t just an issue with you guys (Socceroos), he looked jaded for Town. As a result, Town weren’t at the high intensity they’re used to. Aaron Mooy of Huddersfield Town. Source: Getty Images \nHOW DO TOWN FANS FEEL ABOUT HIS SOCCEROOS COMMITMENTS? \nWelton: There has been a bit of friction between club and country. Town fans want him to come back in one piece … and there might have been a little friction David Wagner and the Australian boss. \nThis time, Aaron hasn’t had as many minutes as in November, so Wagner is more confident as he has had a rest. \nCertainly, in November, David did give some advice to the Australian manager to say ‘can he have an extra day here to recuperate’ and it was basically ‘no he has to come train and come to Thailand to train with the squad’. Manchester City's Spanish manager Pep Guardiola Source: AFP \nWILL CITY TAKE HIM ON? \nBrennan : It seems Pep wants to take a look at him in the summer, so we expect him to join pre-season and, if things go well initially, possibly to go on the US Tour. \nWILL HE DEFINITELY BE IN THE PREM NEXT YEAR? WHAT IF TOWN GET PROMOTED? \nWelton: Maybe, if after pre-season, Guardiola might end up not yet be convinced, he might go on loan, or get sold, but if he got sold, it would be to another Premier League side. \nA lot depends what league Huddersfield Town is in. He knows the team, himself, the area and (if) it’s the Premier League, it’s another change, step up. I can more than see him coming back. Can’t see what else he’ll learn from the Championship. \nIf Town do go up, everyone wants to keep him, but money wise … Town won’t spend that sort of money, they’ll look at the Burnley model. They’ll make astute signings, won’t be held at ransom (current record signing is £1.9m). \n(If it’s not City, or Town) I could see him … as a perfect fit for the Santi Cazorla player/role at Arsenal. He is out of contract, 34, I could see him as the perfect replacement. I think he’d do well there. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
