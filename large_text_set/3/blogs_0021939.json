Fun fact: a bunch of stuff’s being outright buffed, but nothing’s being nerfed without some form of buff to offset. It’s been a while since that’s happened.\n\nGameplay aside, it’s been a while since we talked about the updated client here in the intro. The team’s been focusing on performance and stability improvements, and while these don’t make for the sexiest patch notes, they add up to make for significant improvements. We’ve got snappier mastery page edits and a smoother champ select experience across the board. Check the  League Client Update  section below for the specifics.\n\nThat’s it for this patch! As always, best of luck on the Rift. We’ll see you next time!  Paul \"Aether\" Perscheid  Mattias \"Gentleman Gustaf\" Lehman  Lucas \"Luqizilla\" Moutinho Champions Galio Galio, the Colossus, will be updated with the launch of patch 7.6! For more details, check the following links: Champion Reveal Gameplay Teaser The Hour of Need Champion Bio A Hero Wakes Champion Insights Champion Spotlight Head to the “Extras” section of Galio’s Champion Reveal article above for high-res images of his updated base and skin splash art! Aatrox After reviving, Aatrox now keeps his primed Blood Price/Thirst hits and gets full Blood Well. Between the depth of Aatrox’s changes last patch and the buffs we shipped shortly thereafter, the dust has yet to settle. We’re holding off on targeted balance follow-up until his performance has stabilized, but in the interim, we’re delivering some quality of life changes that should make the revive experience feel more consistent. Also... is it Darkin here or were Aatrox’s tooltips just hard to read? Turns out, a bit of the latter, so we’re doing some cleanup work. Passive - Blood Well NOT ACTUALLY DRAVEN Aatrox’s full Blood Well buff is now “Hellbent”, not “Blood Rush” THIS ISN’T EVEN MY FINAL FORM On reviving from his passive, Aatrox now has a full Blood Well WAIT FOR IT Aatrox now no longer loses his third hit from Blood Price/Thirst after reviving DARK BUT NOT MYSTERIOUS Aatrox’s passive tooltips rewritten for clarity These changes are already live; we’re just putting them here as a reminder. Base stats HEALTH 537.8   ⇒   580 Q - Dark Flight COOLDOWN 16/15/14/13/12 seconds   ⇒   13/12.5/12/11.5/11 seconds W - Blood Price BASE DAMAGE 30/60/90/120/150   ⇒   45/80/115/150/185 Cho'Gath R grants more health per stack and stacks an additional time from minions/small monsters. There’s always a relearning curve after we update a champion. In Cho’Gath’s case, this was more notable: few players had been picking him  before  the update, so there’s more  learning  than  re learning. That being said, we think he’s slightly on the weak side even for those players who have adjusted. He  is  a giant monster, so we think a bit more base tankiness from Feast should do the trick. R - Feast BONUS HEALTH 80/110/140 per stack   ⇒   80/120/160 per stack MINION/SMALL MONSTER CAP 5 stacks   ⇒   6 stacks Fiddlesticks Q cast range increased. W refunds its remaining duration when its target dies. Fiddlesticks has been having a rough time clearing camps since pre-season’s updates - particularly the raptors. While Dark Wind is a solid AoE tool, it’s the only one Fiddle’s got, so after he’s Drained the Crimson Raptor, he’s left with nothing but basic attacks to slap the remaining little birds with. We’re giving him the option of chain-Draining the chicken nuggets (and other small monsters, like the smaller Krugs), provided he’s got the mana to do so.\n\nOn a completely separate note, we’re reverting last mid-season’s change to Terrify’s cast range. Our thinking back then was that if Terrify had a lower cast range than Drain, Fiddlesticks would get better mileage out of his Terrify-Drain combo since his target wouldn’t be forced out of tether range as quickly. What ended up happening is that trying to quickly execute the combo only worked if Fiddle was already in Terrify range - otherwise, his attempt to walk up would immediately be overwritten by Drain. This is equally - if not more - problematic than the original interaction, so we’re giving our scarecrow his 50 cast range back. Caw Caw. Q - Terrify CAST RANGE 525   ⇒   575 W - Drain NEW I CAN CAST IT TWICE?! If Drain’s target dies before the channel completes, the remaining duration is applied as cooldown reduction Gnar Mini Gnar and Mega Gnar have the same health regen. When Gnar is ahead, his constant basic attacks and ability-casts send him Mega that much more often. But when Gnar is behind, he often can’t safely build the fury he needs to transform, denying access to Mega Gnar’s increased health regeneration. We’re smoothing out Gnar’s regen between forms to make him a little more capable of healing up when he falls behind. That being said, this should be an overall buff to Gnar; he spends more time small than large, even when he’s  not  behind. Base stats HEALTH REGEN (MINI) 2.5   ⇒   4.5 health per 5 seconds HEALTH REGEN GROWTH STAT (MINI) 0.5   ⇒   1.75 health per 5 seconds HEALTH REGEN (MEGA) 6.5   ⇒   4.5 health per 5 seconds HEALTH REGEN GROWTH STAT (MEGA) 3   ⇒   1.75 health per 5 seconds Mega E - Crunch BUFF-FIX Mega Gnar can now queue another spell during  E - Crunch ’s cast time Miss Fortune Q damage up. Q and E are smoother to use. Last patch’s shifts to Lethality, Deathfire Touch and Double Up were a big, coordinated swing at Miss Fortune’s strength. While these changes were important to keep MF healthy in the long run, it was overall a bigger power-down than was needed, so we’re adding a few follow-up buffs. Double Up should pack a bit more of its old punch (still not three-quarters of a health bar), especially as she transitions into the mid and late game, and we’ve bundled in some Lucian-style slickness improvements to boot. These changes will help the pirate hunter scale better as she starts to pick up her big-ticket crit items. Q - Double Up DAMAGE 20/35/50/65/80   ⇒   20/40/60/80/100 RATIO 0.85 total attack damage   ⇒   1.0 total attack damage NOW WE’RE PLAYING WITH POWER Cast range now adjusts based on Miss Fortune’s attack range (ex. Rapidfire Cannon) HAIR TRIGGER Miss Fortune no longer briefly pauses after casting Double Up E - Make It Rain HAIR TRIGGER Miss Fortune no longer briefly pauses after casting Make it Rain Orianna The Ball no longer returns to Orianna if the target it’s attached to dies. The one-liner below is a one-stop ‘fix’ to a few bugs that occurred when an ally holding the Ball died (more specifically, when the Ball returned to Orianna immediately after). Unintended benefit of ditching the bugged mechanic entirely: one less case of accidentally ulting yourself! E - Command: Protect STAY! If an ally dies while holding the Ball, it now drops in place rather than returning to Orianna Quinn Harrier procs grant more attack speed. Skystrike damage down. Quinn respawns as Valor once R is available. Let’s paint a picture: you’re minding your own business when a blazing-fast bird streaks out of the fog of war. In an instant, your vision disappears. A moment later, you’re dead. Quinn’s burst - combined with her high movement speed - gives opponents little time to react to her entrance. We want Quinn’s kill combo to have a little more room for enemy reaction, shifting some of that burst into extended trade strength. W - Heightened Senses BONUS ATTACK SPEED 20/25/30/35/40% on Harrier proc   ⇒ 20/35/50/65/80% on Harrier proc R - Behind Enemy Lines SKYSTRIKE DAMAGE 100% total attack damage   ⇒   40% total attack damage NEW CATCH THE PIGEON After putting at least one point in Behind Enemy Lines, Quinn respawns as Valor after deaths for the rest of the game Varus Q refund from Blight procs no longer reduced by cooldown reduction. Last patch’s changes to Varus  were part of a three-pronged approach to knocking Varus off the bot-lane throne (the other two being Edge of Night and Deathfire Touch nerfs). Speaking to Varus specifically, we tied Piercing Arrow’s cooldown to Varus’s willingness to use basic attacks to nock enemies dead. We’re happy with this  direction , but have some room to restore a bit of power.\n\nPart of Piercing Arrow’s cooldown refund mechanic included anti-scaling with cooldown reduction: we were hesitant to give him the option of getting Piercing Arrow’s cooldown  lower  than it was pre-nerf. Ultimately, though, Varus still has to use his basic attack to get his refund, which is the main improvement we wanted to see. Nixing the anti-scaling is a power-up for Varus that also makes the refund easier to understand and feel better in cooldown reduction builds. Q - Piercing Arrow COOLDOWN REFUND ON BLIGHT PROC 4 seconds, scaling down with cooldown reduction   ⇒   4 seconds Lux VO Expansion We’ve added a bunch of new lines to Lux’s existing voiceover. She’s now got about four times as much to say, including many champion-specific interactions! Magic Damage Shield UI Real quick: we’re slightly changing the color health bars use to represent magic damage shields (Morgana, Camille, and now Galio!) Masteries Warlord's Bloodlust Now restores health based on attack damage rather than granting lifesteal. 7.5’s update to Warlord's Bloodlust is living up to its goal of creating discrete-high impact moments. It also came with a few kinks to smooth out, thanks to the way lifesteal works. Since lifesteal works based on damage dealt, the health you get can vary from one attack to the next, depending on stuff like basic attack modifiers and enemy armor. This becomes a pretty significant difference once the lifesteal value climbs up to 50%.\n\nWarlord’s should have success cases, but “Caitlyn Headshots a minion” shouldn’t be more rewarding than “Caitlyn kites the enemy frontline”. Switching to a heal effect keeps Warlord’s rewarding as a combat sustain tool while making success easier to ID: kite and reposition against any threat that comes your way. SUSTAIN BONUS Grants 1-50% lifesteal (at levels 1-18)   ⇒   Restores health equal to 3-40% total attack damage (at levels 1-18) CRITICAL HEAL If the attack that procs Warlord’s Bloodlust critically strikes, the heal crits as well (further increased by crit damage modifiers, ex. Infinity Edge) Summoner’s Rift Red Brambleback Magic resist down. Per our pre-season changes, Red Brambleback is meant to be resilient against magic damage, while Blue Sentinel offers the same challenge against physical damage. Those numbers didn’t line up, so we’re standardizing them now. MAGIC RESIST 15/20/26/29/30 (at levels 1/4/8/9/10)   ⇒   10/15/18/19/20 (at levels 1/3/5/7/8), matching Blue Sentinel’s armor In-Game Options Menu Back in 7.4, we increased the size of the Options menu to make it more readable at high resolutions. The resulting size was a bit  too  large at super-high resolutions, so we’re reining the change in to a sweet spot somewhere in between. COMFORTABLE SIZE The Options menu has been significantly reduced in size at larger than 1200 vertical resolution (smaller size reductions at smaller screen resolutions) CONVENIENT POSITIONING The Options menu can now be click-and-dragged from any empty spot, not just the title bar Rotating Game Modes Attack. Defend. Repeat. Nexus Siege blasts back into rotation from 3/24/17 12:00 PT - 3/28/17 04:00 PT and 3/31/17 12:00 PT - 4/4/17 04:00 PT. TL;DR: Take turns charging and protecting the Nexus with a crazy arsenal of unique and mega powerful siege weapons. Earn the fastest base destruction (in attack mode) and victory is yours. Average game length: 25 minutes. Seem simple enough? Let the mayhem begin. League Client Update We’ve updated Low-Spec Mode to make it feel smoother and improve performance even more drastically. There’s still some work to be done here, but we think enabling Low-Spec Mode will solve most performance issues for players having trouble running the updated client.\n\nEnabling Low-Spec Mode kills the client while you're in-game, boosting your in-game machine performance but adding to the time it takes to get to the end-of-game screen (since the process has to automatically reboot the client).  Based on player feedback, we’re working on making this an optional toggle in the settings  so you can enable Low-Spec mode without killing the client in the background (or vice versa).\n\nYou can find solutions to most common issues in the  Known Issues  section of our support site. Notable Fixes We've improved the performance of the chat module in champ select, eliminating bugs that were causing lock-ups. When using Low-Spec Mode, mastery pages should now work more smoothly in both champ select and the collection. We rebuilt the ready-check process to improve stability and responsiveness. Interactions with the champ select grid are now smoother—including hover, click, and open/close actions. Clicking on the summoner name of \"recently played with\" players in the \"Add Friend\" interface will now take you to their profile. You can now right-click friends in the conversation chat panel to invite them to your game, view their profile, or spectate their match.
