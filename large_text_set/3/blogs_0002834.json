We're not sure what it is (some sort of magic dust, perhaps), but it just tastes right. That being said, there are a few things that can be done to make it taste even better. \nFirst off, this is going to be controversial — but skip the Funfetti cake mix. Instead pick up a box of yellow cake mix (it's richer in flavor than Funfetti's white cake base) and a big container of rainbow sprinkles; you're going to make your own Funfetti! Don't even think about tossing a tub of store-bought frosting into your cart (sorry, but no — shortening-based frosting is just wrong). \nMix up the cake mix according to the box's instructions (in this case, we added 1 cup water, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, and 3 eggs), and then fold in a whopping 3/4 cup rainbow sprinkles (don't overmix, or the sprinkles' color can bleed). Bake the cake according to the box's instructions — we're partial to a good, old-fashioned sheet cake, for ease, but you do you — and let cool completely. ADVERTISEMENT \nMeanwhile, it's time to make the frosting of your dreams. This is not the time for a swiss meringue buttercream, which is too airy, light, and, frankly, refined for this application. Rather, we're going for a dense, salty-sweet, butter-rich recipe that's like tub frosting but 100 percent tastier (and made with far less scary ingredients). Follow this salted buttercream recipe , scaling back all of the ingredients by half. \nFinally, ice your cake, blanket it with a ludicrous amount of rainbow sprinkles, and decorate with the cutest candles you can find. On the hunt for candles? We've had the best luck at suburban Target and Safeway stores; Amazon also has some cute options . \nWant to take your boxed-cake creations to the next level? Try one of these clever recipes that also start with a mix .
