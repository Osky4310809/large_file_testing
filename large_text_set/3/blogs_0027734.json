It launched earlier this month but has picked up traction this week as people aim to pressure politicians on the healthcare vote. \nCreated by startup entrepreneur Eric Ries , it turns text messages into faxes which are then sent to members of Congress. And it’s free – Resistbot is supported by donations. \n“Resistbot was born out of my personal frustrations with trying to contact my members of Congress,” Ries said . \n“My reps’ phone lines are always jammed, and there’s only someone there during the day [...] So I designed Resistbot to solve this problem for me. It makes it insanely easy to generate a fax to each of my representatives every day.” Barack breaks his silence \n• Barack Obama broke his silence this week to defend the Affordable Care Act and appeal to Congress to resist the GOP healthcare bill, which is due for a vote late Friday. \nThe former president wrote that he had “always said we should build on this law [the ACA], just as Americans of both parties worked to improve social security, Medicare, and Medicaid over the years”. But he noted more than 20 million people had been helped onto insurance and implied the healthcare legislation backed by Trump would not be an improvement. \nSo if Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if they’re prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals – that’s something we all should welcome. But we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our healthcare system better, not worse for hardworking Americans. \nPeople across the country have been protesting against Trump’s proposed healthcare bill this week. On Thursday , when Congress had been due to vote on the new legislation, hundreds turned out in Washington DC, Chicago and Los Angeles . \nThe House is expected to vote on the bill – which the Congressional Budget Office has said would leave 24 million people uninsured – on Friday night.

Big Bird, seen here in happier times. Photograph: Matt Sayles/AP \nThe Washington Post noted that Sesame Street has parodied Trump for decades – with a sporadically appearing character called “Donald Grump” . An episode from 1994 sees Big Bird lead a march against Grump – played by Joe Pesci – to stop his evil plan to demolish Sesame Street and replace it with “Grump Tower”. The resistance’s villain of the week \nThis bus. Trans rights activists protest in front of the ‘#FreeSpeechBus’. Photograph: Alba Vigaray/EPA \nThe National Organization for Marriage launched an anti-transgender bus tour outside the UN headquarters in New York City. \nUnfortunately for NOM the bus was almost immediately vandalized by activists. “Trans rights now!” someone wrote over the #freespeechbus. NOM is now asking for donations to remove that particular act of free speech from the bus. Coming up \n• National Nurses United has thrown its weight behind Democrats’ opposition to Neil Gorsuch. Senate hearings on Gorsuch’s nomination to the supreme court have been taking place all week, with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer vowing to filibuster Gorsuch’s confirmation. \nNNU described Gorsuch as “a man driven by ideology” and accused the judge of having “been consistently dismissive of Americans’ rights to meaningful equality and workplace justice”. \nOn Thursday the Guardian reported that Gorsuch had been the only judge to rule in favor of a delivery company that fired an employee for seeking warmth after his truck broke down on a dangerously cold winter night. Neil Gorsuch has faced a grilling this week. Photograph: Jack Gruber/ddp/Barcroft \nOn Tuesday a coalition of progressive groups including Indivisible, MoveOn.org Civic Action and the SEIU launched a digital ad campaign urging Democratic senators to filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination. \n• Madison County Democrats are holding a “Ready to run” event in Huntsville, Alabama, on Saturday. It’s specifically aimed at getting women into office – the classes are actually women only – and apparently will cover how to register an election bid and launch a campaign. \n• Pro-Trump “Make America Great Again” marches are due to take place in 41 states across the country on Saturday. \n“It is about time we stand up for America,” says the organizers’ website. Counter-rallies are planned in Boston , Houston and Huntington Beach in California. \nSimilar pro-Trump events took place on 4 March. The one in New York City was rather underwhelming . Innovation \nA new cell service called Resistbot is exciting activists. It launched earlier this month but has really picked up traction as people aim to pressure politicians on the healthcare vote. \nCreated by startup entrepreneur Eric Ries , it turns text messages into faxes which are then sent to members of Congress. And it’s free – Resistbot is supported by donations. \n“Resistbot was born out of my personal frustrations with trying to contact my members of Congress,” Ries said . \n“My reps’ phone lines are always jammed, and there’s only someone there during the day [...] So I designed Resistbot to solve this problem for me. It makes it insanely easy to generate a fax to each of my representatives every day.” What we’re reading \n• This stunning Trump interview with Time magazine . Time published a transcript of the interview, and it makes for macabre reading. Jezebel, in a fine act of public service, redacted “everything that’s not a verifiably true statement” from the exchange. It’s good.
