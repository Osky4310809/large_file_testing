A knee injury limited Torres to just 44 minutes of action over three substitute appearances with the club. He did manage to score a goal during his brief time on the pitch. \nTorres arrived in Houston with big expectations, but has failed to score a goal in 22 league appearances since his 2015 arrival. The designated player initially made a big impact in MLS, notching 22 goals in a season and a half with Chivas USA in 2013 and 2014. \nNew Dynamo head coach Wilmer Cabrera was in charge of Chivas USA during a majority of that period, offering some hope that Torres will be able to turn around his Houston career.
