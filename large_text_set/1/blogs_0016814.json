Fabulous! Don't forget to share with your friends on Twitter and Facebook. People Are Saying That Twitter Forced Them To Follow Trump’s @POTUS Account “Being forced to follow the POTUS account without my consent is a metaphor for this administration.” Stephanie M. Lee BuzzFeed News Reporter As soon as President Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President, he got a new Twitter handle: @POTUS. Meanwhile, Barack Obama’s presidential tweets and followers followed him over to @POTUS44 . \nOn behalf of my entire family, THANK YOU! #InaugurationDay — President Trump (@POTUS) ID: 10366990 It was a highly choreographed social media transition . The idea was that the people who had been following @Potus would now find themselves following both it, and the new @Potus44 account. But later in the day, Twitter users started complaining that for some reason, they had found themselves following @POTUS and seeing President Trump’s tweets in their feeds — even if they said they’d unfollowed the account purposefully before the hand off, or had never followed it at all. \nwhoah i unfollowed @POTUS as soon as Obama was out and now THEY HAVE ME SOMEHOW FOLLOWING AGAIN #unfollowinfinity — Chelsea Peretti (@chelseaperetti) ID: 10366970 \nBeing forced to follow the POTUS account without my consent is a metaphor for this administration. — Lily Mars (@LilyMarsWrites) ID: 10366966 It wasn’t immediately clear why people were seeing Trump’s tweets — but many of them weren’t happy about it. \nFuck you, @Twitter. I was intentionally NOT following Trump's new account and I come back to see this. This is not… https://t.co/BA4u9m7ory — Izzy Galvez (@iglvzx) ID: 10366972 \nWTF?! Did Trump just force a bunch of us to follow his account?! I never followed @POTUS here & this morning I wasn… https://t.co/GCRxJr1gag — Linda Dianne (@Elle_Lo) ID: 10366968 The apparent glitch also seemed to extend to the Vice President’s and First Lady’s Twitter accounts. \nConfused as to why @Twitter forced me to follow @potus, @vp and @flotus today when I unfollowed and blocked them for a reason. #stop — N.L Lavien (@nithefiasco) \n@Twitter Not cool that you had me automatically follow POTUS, VP, and FLOTUS! WTH!? — Kerry (@AGirlInSanDiego) It even happened to an ex-Twitter head of product. \n@rr @Support @POTUS same. — Michael Sippey (@sippey) ID: 10367204 Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was telling users that the company was looking into the issue and that feeds would eventually catch up. \n@micamaryjane @POTUS should unfollow if you unfollowed. Script is taking some time — jack (@jack) \n@GlennF @edbott @POTUS if you unfollowed it will replay. Just taking time. — jack (@jack) ID: 10367108 Twitter’s support team also said they were trying to get to the bottom of the issue. \nWe are aware of the issue with migrating @POTUS followers and investigating. More soon. — Twitter Support (@Support)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T07:05:53.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
