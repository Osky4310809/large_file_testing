The company has raised an undisclosed amount of early stage funding from Exigent Capital , and individual angels, according to co-founder and CEO Richard Demb. \nStorePower’s technology helps groceries of any size to take orders from customers, and arrange for in-store pickup or delivery. Customers can order by text message if they so choose, which alleviates the burden of groceries asking them to download yet another app. The platform also helps groceries manage the packing and prepping of customers’ orders with features like indoor mapping, and multi-order picking. \nShoppers preparing an order in a store can bypass checkout. By contrast, companies like Instacart and Postmates usually require their personal shoppers to go through a check out line or dedicated express lane to prepare a customers’ order. \nAccording to StorePower’s co-founder and CEO Richard Demb, the company was inspired by Abe’s Market , his earlier startup, a high-end online grocery, and a kind of spiritual predecessor to businesses like Thrive Market or GrubMarket . Grocery chains consistently reached out to Demb, he says, asking to use the company’s e-commerce platform as a white label solution to reach shoppers online. \nRather than pivot, Demb and his cofounders sold Abe’s to build a new, software-as-a-service offering for the industry. Terms of the sale of Abe’s were not disclosed. But investors in that earlier business have a stake in StorePower, the CEO confirmed. \nSo far, Chicago- and Jerusalem-based StorePower has attracted clients like New York City’s Fairway Market and Gelson’s in Los Angeles, Demb says, along with four other chains that the company did not yet have permission to name. \n“Supermarket brands have spent generations building trust with consumers, and should be engaging with the online customer not handing that relationship to a third party app never to win it back,” Demb tells TechCrunch. “Target, Toys-R-Us and Borders let Amazon host their ecommerce in the mid- 2000’s and never fully recovered.” StorePower gives grocery chains a choice of paying a monthly fee per-location for its software, or paying a share of revenue for orders processed through the platform. \nStorePower intends to focus on the US market, initially, even though the startup has fielded inquiries from European supermarket chains already, Demb says. It’s not surprising that companies want to own the US where grocery deliveries are concerned. According to Morgan Stanley research , domestic spending on groceries reaches $675 billion annually. Groceries sold online represent about 6% of the total market, and are expected to grow even beyond that in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:27:18.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
