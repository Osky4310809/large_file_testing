The leaked footage shows two women accosting an individual believed to be Kim Jong-nam, who was assassinated Monday. \nThe killers reportedly splashed a toxic substance “ more potent than cyanide ” in his face. Kim Jong-nam sought help but died on the way to the hospital. \nWATCH: \nMalaysian authorities have arrested two women — 28-year-old Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam and 25-year-old Siti Aisyah from Indonesia — for the murder. Police have also picked up a North Korean national, Ri Jong Chol in connection with the killing. \nMalaysia is also chasing at least four more North Korean suspects who fled the country after the hit. \nU.S. and South Korean officials suspect that Pyongyang was behind the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, who criticized his younger brother’s rule publicly. Kim Jong-un previously issued a standing order for his death, and an assassin made an attempt on his life a few years ago, prompting Kim Jong-nam to beg his younger brother to spare him. \nHe once told reporters that he felt like he “ was living on borrowed time .” Many observers believe that the assassination was an attempt to further consolidate power by eliminating external threats to his regime and his absolute authority. \nFollow Ryan on Twitter \nSend tips to .
