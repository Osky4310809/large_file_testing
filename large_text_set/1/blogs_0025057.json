Now, have I got a story for you (Photo: BT Sport) \nThe referee claims that he was still \"pulling his trousers up\" as he made his way onto the pitch and received a yellow card for his tardiness. \nWebb made the unusual - albeit hilarious - revelation when asked to recall the strangest booking he ever had to make. \nThe question was asked after Shettleston goalkeeper Gary Whyte was sent off for urinating behind his goal on Saturday. Caught with his trousers down... literally (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) \nThe West of Scotland Super League First Division side were hosting Shotts Bon Accord when he was given his marching orders in the 72nd minute. \n* BT Sport is your home of unmissable live football from the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and FA Cup.
