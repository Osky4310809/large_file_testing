Startup Battlefield is TechCrunch Disrupt’s startup competition that takes place three times a year. Applications to participate in Startup Battlefield are due February 28th . \nWhile participation in Battlefield is free for all companies, we understand that costs to attend the conference include more than just the conference tickets. It’s been shown that underrepresented founders face additional challenges raising early capital making it hard for those companies to participate and travel to competitions such as this. \nOnce teams are selected to participate in Startup Battlefield, they will have the opportunity to fill out a short survey outlining need. When they apply, no financial information in relation to the scholarship will be collected until after the selection process. The main criteria is that teams must have raised under $1million USD. Teams outside the greater New York Area will be given preference. \nPlease note that companies will need to be reimbursed as TechCrunch’s financial processing will take longer than the time between selection and Disrupt.
