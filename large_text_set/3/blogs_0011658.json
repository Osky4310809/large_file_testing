(Helen H. Richardson, The Denver Post) \nHeads up, jazz lovers: Michael John LaChiusa’s Tony Award-winning musical “The Wild Party” is coming to Denver. \nBut per the bacchanalian setting the play plumbs, it won’t be in a stuffy theatre. \nOff-Center, the unconventional programming arm of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, is bringing the musical to the Stanley Marketplace, the new 16,000 square-foot communal market in Aurora . Amanda Berg Wilson, the artistic director of Boulder’s the Catamounts, will direct the production, which runs Oct. 12-31. \nThe musical follows a fête thrown by two vaudeville performers that descends into lascivious mayhem. Wilson’s interactive, 360-degree production will cast the audience as guests in the jazz-age party, complete with booze and a live band. \nThe musical, which is Off-Center’s first, will be the series’ second production at the Stanley Marketplace. Cross-dimensional adventure comedy “Travelers of the Lost Dimension” is Off-Center’s first foray into the Stanley. It’s running right now, and wraps up on May 21. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:37:58.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
