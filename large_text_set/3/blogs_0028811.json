Then, his family moved to Gardena in Los Angeles. \nHere is what the USC star recently said about getting drafted by the Rams: \n“I grew up a St. Louis Rams fan, so it’s always fun and exciting to be in front of the team that you grew up with — your dream team … I went to school [in Los Angeles] here, I went to high school here a little bit. Just being out here I feel like it would be a homecoming. And we (I say we because I’m a Rams fan still) just got Robert Woods [who also went to USC]. He’s coming back.” \nJackson spoke about having a bit of a Trojans family reunited in Los Angeles, which many in Los Angeles would certainly enjoy as well. \nSince the Rams lost Benny Cunningham, who was an excellent kick returner for the team, Jackson could also fill that role next season. \nLos Angeles lacks depth at defensive back and it’s unclear how long they will keep cornerback Trumaine Johnson after giving him the franchise tag for two years in a row. \nWhile Jackson mentioned T.J. McDonald, who also went to USC, it’s unclear if the safety will return to the Rams next season.
