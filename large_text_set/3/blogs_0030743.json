Coming this summer is a theatrical adaptation of The Dark Tower , coming in September is the first installment in a two-part It adaptation, and later this year is the 10-episode season of The Mist . \nThere's no denying that King is one of the greatest all-time horror writers and Hollywood can't help themselves when it comes to mining his stories for content. For four straight decades, King's works have been turned into films and TV series, all with varying degrees of success. \nConsidering It and The Mist have already gotten a shot at live-action adaptations, we think it's time to give some of his previously adapted works another shot at success. This isn't to say that the original adaptations are necessarily bad, but for one reason or another, the stories have elements that deserve an upgrade. \nWhat are some of your favorite Stephen King adaptations that you think deserve another shot? Let us know in the comments! \nMORE NEWS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:35:44.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
