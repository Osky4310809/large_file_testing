Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDisgraced Keith Vaz has been handed a powerful new role by Labour amid a bitter internal row over the selection of the party's next MP. \nJeremy Corbyn is at war with his deputy Tom Watson after scandal-hit Mr Vaz was given a key job selecting Labour’s candidate in Manchester Gorton, one of the party's safest seats. \nLabour's whopping 24,000 majority means that whoever is chosen to succeed the late Sir Gerald Kaufman looks certain to win the looming by-election and remain an MP for years to come. Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson have clashed over the looming Manchester Gorton by-election (Photo: Christopher Furlong) \nMr Vaz was drafted onto Labour's five-strong selection panel at the last minute at the expense of shadow cabinet minister Rebecca Long-Bailey, a close ally of Mr Corbyn. \nAngry sources close to the Labour leader accused Mr Watson of organising an “ambush” during a fiery telephone meeting on Monday that resulted in Ms Long-Bailey being booted off the panel. \nHer name had been on a draft list drawn up by Mr Corbyn’s office ahead of the meeting - but in a telephone conference call key figures from the ‘moderate’ wing of the party including Mr Watson voted her off. Salford MP Rebecca Long-Bailey was voted off the selection panel at the 11th hour (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nThe move will shift the balance of power on the panel significantly, with Labour ‘moderates’ confident that with Mr Vaz’s support they can now block the selection of Mr Corbyn’s favoured candidate. \nAnd it reignites the long-standing conflict between the party’s two most senior figures, which began last summer when Mr Watson told Mr Corbyn to quit during the attempted coup by Labour MPs. \n“This was definitely what you’d call an ambush,” a Labour source on the left of the party said. \n“Jeremy’s team are furious with Tom - this is all about them stopping a Corbyn candidate becoming an MP.” Jeremy Corbyn's allies were desperate to get their choice of candidate elected (Photo: Jack Taylor) \nMr Corbyn’s allies are pushing for the selection of a young grassroots activist, Sam Wheeler, who was born in Manchester and is heavily involved in the pro-Corbyn Momentum campaign. \nBut his opponents within the party insist picking yet another white man in such an ethnically diverse seat as Manchester Gorton would not be appropriate. \nAnd a leading ‘moderate’ MP accused Mr Corbyn of failing to turn up for Monday’s telephone meeting, so missing his chance to have his say. The motion to have Ms Long-Bailey removed from the panel and replaced with Mr Vaz was carried by just a single vote. \n“Jeremy was perfectly entitled to turn up and vote himself. You cannot and should not take these meetings for granted,” the MP said. \n“They are just bad losers.” \nAllies of Mr Watson insisted Mr Vaz was anyway a more suitable figure to help make the selection, as the Leicester MP is the party’s black and ethnic minority rep on Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC).

Former Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman died last month (Photo: PA) \nLabour ‘moderates’ are now hopeful of securing the seat for a candidate they see as more centre-ground such as Amina Lone, a local councillor who stood unsuccessfully for the party in Morecambe and Lunesdale at the 2015 general election. \nThe highest-profile runner is likely to be Tony Lloyd, the former Manchester Central MP who is now the local police and crime commissioner and interim Mayor of Greater Manchester. \nOne local MP said Mr Lloyd has a “fighting chance” because “he’s everybody’s second choice - which is not a bad place to be.” Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd is a potential candidate to be the next Gorton MP (Photo: MEN) \nLocal MEP Afzal Khan today became the first candidate to formally throw his hat into the ring, saying he had been “urged” to do so by “friends and colleagues in the Labour Party \". \nThe by-election itself is currently pencilled in for May 4, the same day as local council and Mayoral elections in Manchester and across the country.
