Now, BuzzFeed is trying to salvage its reputation as the attacks intensify from both the left and the right.

The documents had been shopped around for quite some time, but nobody would publish them until BuzzFeed decided to would step in and put them out there, even though the website admitted it had reason to doubt them. CNN pushed the story into the mainstream with a separate account about a two-page summary of the dossier the network claimed had been shown to both Trump and President Obama in private briefings last week. \nDoubts about the document’s veracity grew larger after Trump went on Twitter to call it fake news and Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen — whose presence in Prague played an important part in the story — was discovered to have never visited Prague in his life.

According to The Hill , BuzzFeed has also announced that it will donate the proceeds from the sales to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a sign perhaps that the website realizes what its flippancy is costing it a bit in terms of journalistic reputation. (A website that posts stories on “17 sex tips for a kinkier 2017” shouldn’t be too worried about that.) \nBut judging by the mainstream media’s current pariah treatment of BuzzFeed, it’s too late for that. \nPerhaps the most damning evidence of this was BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith’s contentious exchange with Chuck Todd on liberal stalwart MSNBC, where he accused Smith of spreading fake news. \n“Don’t you have a responsibility of not spreading false information?” Todd asked Smith during the Wednesday interview, according to RealClearPolitics . “Are you knowingly spreading false information?” Advertisement - story continues below Trending Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T05:36:01.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
