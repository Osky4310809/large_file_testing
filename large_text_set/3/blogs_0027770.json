After the multiple mini-insults exchanged between the two during Rangoon promotions, it can be easily said that they are not exactly friendly. Kangana, being Kanagna, called out on Sasha’s nightmarish company. The actor, in return, hit at her by labelling her vividly imaginative (a remark that Kangana alleges has been stolen from Hrithik Roshan). This, however, didn’t quite mark the end of their public combat. Recently Shahid, in an interview with a leading daily, presented his case even more fiercely. \nHe said, “Kangana has a thing for one liners… When actors start engaging in this table-tennis match through interviews, the focus is then on the actors and not on the film. I don’t believe in publicising a film or myself through this kind of activity… I choose not to discuss my problems in print. Some discretion is welcome. I wish her all the best. I wish she gets along with some co-stars. It will be good.” \nSomeone is likely to get knocked out in this loaded banter. Keeping in mind the candour of a certain Ms. Mince-no-words, we have a fair idea of who is winning this round. Over to Kangana.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:13:18.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
