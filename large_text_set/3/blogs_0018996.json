Dave Birkett , Detroit Free Press 12:48 p.m. ET March 22, 2017 Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. The first wave of NFL free agency is in the books, so it’s time for Dave Birkett's Mock Draft 2.0, with a better read on every team’s biggest needs. USA TODAY Sports 1. Cleveland Browns: DE Myles Garrett, Texas A&M -- Garrett is no sure thing, but he’s a better bet than any of the quarterbacks in this draft. Sam Craft, Associated Press 2. San Francisco 49ers: QB Mitchell Trubisky, North Carolina -- It’s looking less and less likely that the 49ers can land Kirk Cousins in a trade -- and thus, more likely they take quarterback at No. 2. Steve Helber, Associated Press 3. Chicago Bears: QB Deshaun Watson, Clemson -- They signed Mike Glennon in free agency but still need a quarterback to build around. Chris O'Meara, Associated Press 4. Jacksonville Jaguars: S Jamal Adams, LSU -- There are some people who believe that Adams could turn out to be the best player in this draft. John Raoux, Associated Press 5. Tennessee Titans: DT Jonathan Allen, Alabama -- After fixing their secondary in free agency, the Titans have the freedom to take the best player on the board. David Goldman, Associated Press 6. New York Jets: CB Marshon Lattimore, Ohio State -- The Jets easily could take a quarterback here, but Lattimore is the better value. Brian Spurlock, USA TODAY Sports 7. Los Angeles Chargers: S Malik Hooker, Ohio State -- Hooker fills the role vacated by Eric Weddle a year ago. Rick Scuteri, Associated Press 8. Carolina Panthers: RB Leonard Fournette, LSU -- Jonathan Stewart turns 30 this month. It’s time to find his replacement. Butch Dill, Associated Press 9. Cincinnati Bengals: DE Solomon Thomas, Stanford -- The Bengals keep getting gutted in free agency, but Thomas is a future star. MARK LAMBIE, Associated Press 10. Buffalo Bills: QB DeShone Kizer, Notre Dame -- With Tyrod Taylor back for one more season, the Bills can give Kizer a year to develop. Ethan Hyman, TNS 11. New Orleans Saints: TE O.J. Howard, Alabama -- Drew Brees was at his best when Jimmy Graham was dominating at the tight end position. Kevin C. Cox, Getty Images 12. Cleveland Browns: QB Patrick Mahomes, Texas Tech -- At some point, the Browns have to pull the trigger on a quarterback. Brad Tollefson, Associated Press 13. Arizona Cardinals: WR Mike Williams, Clemson -- With Larry Fitzgerald entering what’s probably his last season, the Cardinals grab the best receiver in the draft. Richard Shiro, Associated Press 14. Philadelphia Eagles: DE Taco Charlton, Michigan -- In Philadelphia, Charlton would pair with another ex-Michigan pass rusher, Brandon Graham. David J. Phillip, Associated Press 15. Indianapolis Colts: RB Dalvin Cook, Florida State -- With Frank Gore on his last legs, the Colts need to get Andrew Luck more help. Mark Wallheiser, Associated Press 16. Baltimore Ravens: LB Charles Harris, Missouri -- Harris can fit in a 3-4 or 4-3 scheme, but wherever he goes, he’ll be a pass rusher. L.G. Patterson, Associated Press 17. Washington: LB Reuben Foster, Alabama -- Foster will be a steal if he falls this far, as he should start in the middle for a decade. USA TODAY Sports 18. Tennessee Titans: TE David Njoku, Miami (Fla.) -- Like his mentor Bill Belichick, Titans GM Jon Robinson knows how important tight ends are to an offense. Chuck Burton, Associated Press 19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: DE Derek Barnett, Tennessee -- Even with Will Gholston back, the Buccaneers need more out of their pass rush. Adam Lau, Associated Press 20. Denver Broncos: OL Garett Bolles, Utah -- He’s old for a prospect, but he can step in and help the Broncos up front on Day 1. USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 21. Detroit Lions: S Jabrill Peppers, Michigan -- If Charlton, Barnett or Harris make it to 21, that’d be a no-brainer for the Lions. But in this situation, they have to choose between possibly overdrafting a linebacker or taking the versatile Peppers, who’d help in both the secondary and return game. Brian Spurlock, USA TODAY Sports 22. Miami Dolphins: CB Quincy Wilson, Florida -- Wilson might be the No. 2 cornerback in this draft now that Sidney Jones has a torn Achilles. USA TODAY Sports 23. New York Giants: OT Ryan Ramczyk, Wisconsin -- Signing D.J. Fluker doesn’t fully take care of the Giants’ needs up front. Brian Spurlock, USA TODAY Sports 24. Oakland Raiders: RB Christian McCaffrey, Stanford -- McCaffrey steps in as Latavius Murray’s replacement and doesn’t even have to leave the Bay Area. Marcio Jose Sanchez, Associated Press 25. Houston Texans: CB Marlon Humphrey, Alabama -- It’s a deep cornerback draft, but Humphrey still belongs in the first round. Joe Robbins, Getty Images 26. Seattle Seahawks: OL Cam Robinson, Alabama -- There aren’t many teams with a worse offensive line than the Seahawks. Gary Cosby Jr., Associated Press 27. Kansas City Chiefs: WR Corey Davis, Western Michigan -- Davis could go in the top 15, but if he can’t run a 40 before the draft, teams will be leery of his speed. LM Otero, Associated Press 28. Dallas Cowboys: WR John Ross, Washington -- Pairing the fastest player at the combine with Ezekiel Elliott would be unfair to opposing defenses. Marcio Jose Sanchez, Associated Press 29. Green Bay Packers: DE Tak McKinley, UCLA -- A shoulder injury will keep him out till training camp, but he’s still one of the draft’s best pass rushers. Mark J. Terrill, Associated Press 30. Pittsburgh Steelers: LB Tim Williams, Alabama -- Williams has admitted to failing multiple drug tests, but he’s still one of the best pass rushers in the draft. Butch Dill, Associated Press 31. Atlanta Falcons: CB Gareon Conley, Ohio State -- He moves into the first round after an impressive NFL combine. Andy Manis, AP 32. New Orleans Saints: LB Haason Reddick, Temple -- Standout performances at the Senior Bowl and combine make Reddick a good bet to go in Round 1. Chris Dunn, Associated Press Like this topic?
