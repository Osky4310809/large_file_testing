Salahuddin told TIME magazine that Iranian security officials detained the two, but while he was released the following day, Levinson was never seen again. After working for the DEA and then FBI, Levinson was hired as a contractor by the CIA, to write reports for the agency, in 2006. Despite government insistence that he was in Iran as a private contractor, several media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post , reported in 2013 that Levinson was in Iran on behalf of the CIA, and was attempting to turn Salahuddin into an intelligence asset. The White House said in response that Levinson was not a government employee at the time of his disappearance. Earlier this month, on the tenth anniversary of his disappearance, Levinson's family released a statement lambasting Iran for the alleged detention, and the US authorities for their inaction in attempting to repatriate him. \"For 10 years the government of Iran has been allowed to dodge and weave every time it was asked to come clean about what happened to Bob and send him home,\" the statement, released March 9, reads. \"Where is the outrage of this treatment of an American citizen? For 10 years, over and over and over again, two US Presidents abandoned him, a lifelong public servant.\" US sent plane with $400 million in cash to Iran Investigators: Levinson may still be in Iran FBI investigators believe Robert Levinson, if he is still alive, is being held in Iran despite some US officials saying the proof-of-life video and photos sent to his family in 2010 and 2011 gives clues that indicate Levinson was in Pakistan or elsewhere.
