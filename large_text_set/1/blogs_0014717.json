A source confirmed to People that they are making cameos in the movie. \nThe women were wearing long, white, lacy dresses, and appeared to be filming a scene set at a fake Met Gala. That makes sense as Met Gala organizer and Vogue editor Anna Wintour has been seen on set, as has model Adriana Lima. \nThey aren't the only high-profile celebrities appearing in the film. James Corden recently joined the cast, and Matt Damon has booked a cameo . Katie Holmes also told Entertainment Tonight that she has a small role in the film starring Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, and more. \n\"I'm a fan of all the 'Ocean's' movies. So, I'm happy that it has so many amazing women in it, so many amazing actresses. It's really so much fun being a part of,\" she said. \"I play myself. It's just a cameo.\" \n\"Ocean's Eight\" opens in theaters June 8, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:10:25.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
