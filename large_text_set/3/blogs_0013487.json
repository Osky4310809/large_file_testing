I am really looking forward to see how director Rajkumar Hirani and Ranbir bring Sanju baba ‘s character to life on the big screen. \nDia Mirza will be reportedly essaying the role of Maanyata Dutt , and we hear that Sonam Kapoor will be playing Tina Munim , while Anushka Sharma will be seen as a lawyer. Now we hear that Karishma Tanna has also been roped in to play one of the female leads in the film. Although the details of her character are not known to us, she has reportedly shot for her role over a 3-day schedule in the Malabar Hills. \nIt would be interesting to see Karishma and Ranbir romance onscreen. Are you looking forward to this jodi ? 8", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T12:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:16:05.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
