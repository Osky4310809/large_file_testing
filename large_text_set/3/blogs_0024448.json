We’re feeling those growing pains today,” Ryan said Friday afternoon, addressing reporters. “We came really close today, but we came up short.” \n“This is a setback, no two ways about it, but this is not the end of the story,” Ryan said of the failed American Health Care Act — oftentimes referred to as TrumpCare or RyanCare. \nRyan declined to cast blame on any specific lawmaker or caucus but did contend that “there was a bloc of ‘no’ votes” that prevented the legislation from passing. \nThe powerful House Freedom Caucus remained a thorn in Ryan’s side throughout the push for the American   coalition of conservative Republicans said that the legislation lacked key provisions important to conservatives, including repealing essential health benefits such as maternity leave and addiction treatment; cutting preventive health measures such as birth control; and repealing the standardized benefit and coverage documents required by Obamacare. \n“The conference is let down. The conference is disappointed,” Ryan said, but adding that the votes were “almost there.” . @SpeakerRyan : \"This is a disappointing day for us.\" #AHCA pic.twitter.com/MSX9AsmmeG \n— CSPAN (@cspan) March 24, 2017 \nAfter multiple days of contentious fighting in Congress — even among Republican factions — the bill was ultimately pulled after it became clear it would not get   needed to pass the House and head to an even more uncertain future in the Senate. \nIt was a stunning defeat for Trump – who prides himself on his deal-making skills. And Ryan made sure to connect Trump to the failed legislation Friday, thanking the president for his efforts with the bill. \n“The president gave his all in this effort,” Ryan told reporters. “He did everything he could to make people see the opportunity we had with this bill.” \nAs news broke that the health care bill was being pulled, Washington Post reporter Robert Costa tweeted that Trump personally called him. Trump said he “does not blame” Ryan, Costa tweeted. \"I don't blame Paul,\" Trump tells me \n— Robert Costa (@costareports) March 24, 2017 \nTrump told reporters earlier Friday that Ryan should remain House Speaker even if the health care bill failed. \nOffice of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney warned Thursday that should the House not pass the Obamacare replacement, Trump will move on from the health care legislation, and Obamacare will remain in place. \nRyan said Friday that Congress would now turn its attention to other issues such as tax reform and border control. \nAs for health care, Ryan said Americans will be “living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.” \nTheBlaze’s Kate Scanlon contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:16:02.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
