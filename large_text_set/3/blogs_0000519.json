It’s something I have to take responsibility for. However, even if these events occurred, I’m still planning on releasing my EP album, which I’ve been working on, as planned.” \nHe continued, saying, “I don’t want to say anything about the people who are cursing [at me]. Because the people who are cursing have their own reasons for doing so. I’m not pretending to be generous either. If you want to curse [at me], then you can.” \nMeanwhile, Jang Yong Joon, the son of politician Jang Je Won, recently became involved in a controversy after screenshots allegedly taken from his social media revealed him boasting about participating in “conditional meetings,” a phrase that can be associated with soliciting prostitution. \nMnet’s “High School Rapper” airs every Friday at 11 p.m. KST.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T08:29:15.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
