They didn’t say it would happen, but they said it was something that should be avoided.” \nM ore than half a million British pensioners live in EU countries outside the UK, with most based in Ireland, followed by Spain, France, Italy and Germany. \nTheresa May has insisted she will not guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK unless those Britons in the EU are also given assurances. \nBoth Number 10 and Brussels has said securing a deal on this is a priority for the talks, which will be triggered next Wednesday and last for two weeks. \nHowever ministers have warned that the issue is far more complicated than assumed by those demanding a guarantee in recent months. \nA source familiar with the discussions said: “There are concerns about the potential costs to social care and the NHS in general. It is an area ministers are looking at seriously.” \nEarlier this month the Government announced an extra £2.5 billion in spending on social care amid growing concerns of a funding “black hole”. \nHowever councils said more money was needed in the coming years as Britons continue to live longer than previous decades.

That is where the pressures would come. It is not simply a question of cost, it is also a question of actual capacity.” \nPhilip Hammond, the Chancellor, acknowledged the challenge an aging population was putting on social care during his Budget speech this month, \nToday, our social care system cares for over a million people and I pay tribute to the hundreds of thousands of carers, who work in it,” Mr Hammond said. \n“But the system is clearly under pressure. And this in turn puts pressure on our NHS. Today, there are half a million more people aged over 75 than there were in 2010. And there will be 2 million more in ten years’ time.” Share this article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:18:51.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
