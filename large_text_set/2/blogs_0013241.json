He respectfully gave it. … He didn’t have to do that because what he did wasn’t wrong. … What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem,” Trump said. \nTrump deflected a question about what evidence has convinced him Flynn committed no wrongdoing, just merely misled Vice President Mike Pence. \nTrump flatly denied directing Flynn to contact the Russian ambassador about the sanctions imposed for the Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine and its election meddling. \n“No I didn’t,” Trump said. \nBoth Republicans and Democrats in Congress have called for an investigation into whether the Trump campaign was in contact with Russian officials as well as Russia’s interference in the election process. The FBI also is investigating. Related Stories Who Is Admiral Robert Harward? \nRetired Vice Adm.
