That is my priority. \n“For the rest, we will see. I know Rudi Garcia well, Marseille have a good project. In life, everything is possible. I do not know what the future holds for me. I am open to all.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:37:00.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
