Sweden.”\nAfter much head-scratching and Internet mockery , it was later discovered that the President was referring to a segment on Fox News about a filmmaker who claimed there was a link between an uptick in crime and migrant communities in Sweden, a country that accepted about 160,000 asylum seekers during the height of the European migrant crisis in 2015.\nRead More: Newspaper Reports What Really ‘Happened in Sweden Last Night’ for President Trump \nTrump doubled down after the ensuing criticism, tweeting on Monday that “The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!”\nLoefven acknowledged during Monday’s press conference that the country faces “many challenges,” according to Bloomberg, but that Sweden was also a place of opportunity. The Nordic nation is generally viewed as progressive with a strong track record on employment, equality, health and social services.\nThe Swedish Embassy in Washington, D.C. has offered to help the Trump administration understand the social dynamics in Sweden, saying it would explain the country’s immigration policy to U.S. officials.\nWe look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies. https://t.co/x5G3euOWRh \n— Embassy of Sweden US (@SwedeninUSA) February 19, 2017 \nWhile there is no reason to believe there was an “incident in Sweden” last Friday, reports have pointed out that there have, in fact, been a number of recent attacks in the country — unrelated to Trump’s comments or the Fox News segment on which they were based.\nAFP reported in early February that there was an attack in Sweden last month, during which a group of suspected neo-Nazis bombed a refugee center in the city of Gothenburg, injuring a staff member. The attack was reportedly linked to a string of incidents committed by far-right groups.\n[ Bloomberg ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:50:44.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
