The tradition traces back as far as the middle ages. \nBecause Advent is a time to anticipate and prepare for the coming of Christ at Christmas, a Jesse Tree project is a great way to celebrate with your family. What Is a Jesse Tree? \nThe Jesse Tree represents the family tree, or genealogy , of Jesus Christ . It tells the story of God's salvation plan , beginning with creation and continuing through the Old Testament , to the coming of the Messiah. \nThe name \"Jesse Tree\" comes from Isaiah 11:1: \"Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.\" (NASB) The verse refers to King David 's father, Jesse, who is in the lineage of Jesus Christ . The \"shoot\" that grew from the \"stem of Jesse,\" that is, the royal line of David, is Jesus Christ. How to Celebrate Advent With a Jesse Tree \nEach day of Advent a homemade ornament is added to the Jesse Tree, a small tree made of evergreen branches or any creative materials you choose to use. \nFirst, you and your children will need to decide exactly how you will create your Jesse Tree and ornaments. With a bit of creativity, the possibilities are limitless. Try to choose materials and activities that fit your kid's ages and abilities so that everyone can participate in the project. \nNext, you'll need to decide what the symbolic ornaments will represent. Some families choose to represent different prophecies foretelling the coming of the Messiah . Another variation includes ornaments that represent the ancestors in the lineage of Christ , or the various monogram symbols of Christianity . \nOne popular variation for the handmade ornaments is to trace the many promises of God through the stories in the Bible, beginning with Creation and leading up to the birth of Jesus Christ our Savior. \nFor example, an apple might represent the story of Adam and Eve . A rainbow could symbolize the story of Noah's ark and the flood . As you make the ornaments together, remember to discuss what they mean so your children will enjoy crafting as they learn about the Bible. \nEach day of Advent, when you decorate your tree by adding an ornament, take some time to reinforce the symbolism behind the ornament. You can read a Bible verse or expound on a related Bible story. Think of ways to tie in your lessons to the lineage of Jesus and the season of Advent .
