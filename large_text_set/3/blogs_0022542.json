Photo: Benjamin Geskin/ Twitter \nApple shocked no one this morning by announcing a new special edition (PRODUCT) RED version of the iPhone 7 , but not everyone is in love with the new color. \niPhone lovers took to Twitter to complain about the new color scheme that features a red anodized aluminum shell and a white front glass panel. To show how much better the device could have looked, one concept designer created some mockups of what it would be like with a black front and we’ve got to say, this would’ve been so much better. \nHere’s another angle: Darth Vader would love this iPhone. Photo: Benjamin Geskin \nDesigner Benjamin Geskin’s concept looks absolutely amazing. Hopefully Apple will take it to heart for future versions (RED) versions of Apple products. \nThe (RED) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available to order on Friday, March 24. This is the first time Apple has released an iPhone under the (RED) banner. \nAll of the internal components on the special edition (RED) iPhone 7 are the same as on the colors Apple introduced last year. Prices on the new devices are not the same though. A 32GB option isn’t available so you have to pay $749 for a 128GB iPhone 7, and $869 for a 128GB iPhone 7 Plus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:44:14.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
