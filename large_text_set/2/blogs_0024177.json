Brie’s blue Gucci dress at the 2016 Academy Awards was romantic, slightly whimsical, and regal. She chose to show off a different side of her fashion sense this time on the red carpet, and we love how much she’s reminding us of Morticia Addams, the unforgettable matriarch of the Addams family .\nBrie’s black, Oscar de la Renta gown (designed by Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim) is strapless and it has lovely waves running down the front and the side of it. She looks like she jumped straight out of a Tim Burton storybook — as the heroine of the tale, of course.\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images She chose to keep her hair quite simple and naturally wavy, and rather than overloading with the jewelry, Brie left her neck and wrists free of anything shiny, which allows the dress completely speak for itself. Her only major additions are a red lip and dangly gold earrings. Even her strappy black shoes are simple.\n\nWe have a strong feeling that if Morticia ever attended a red carpet event, she would pick something very close to this number. After all, we know she loves anything black, gothic-looking, and tight-fitting to show off her figure. She would be positively head over heels for that trail, too.\nWe’re used to seeing Brie in bright colors, so to see her channel her edgy side is a real treat. Will it make the Best Dressed list? We vote yes, because anyone willing to wear something Morticia-inspired deserves some credit.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:14:24.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
