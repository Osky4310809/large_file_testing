Taken from XL Recordings label boss Richard Russell’s project Everything is Recorded , Sampha swung by London’s Reprezent Radio to perform the two, beautiful new tracks live in celebration for The xx’s Night + Day events in Brixton this weekend.\nBringing his usual haunting vocals to the show, Russell asserts that he used a Curtis Mayfield sample, “These words I’m trying to recite, they come close but not quite,” for the track as Sampha’s style reminded him of the legendary jazz artist’s vulnerability. Listen to “Close But Not Quite” (at 53:58) and “Everything is Recorded” (at 1:13:51) as part of the entire, fantastic show below.\n\nThe album will bring a plethora of musical talent together, including soon-to-be-Drake collaborator Giggs, English novelist Warren Ellis, Gorrilaz and Blur innovator Damon Albarn, jazz sensation Kamasi Washington and Highsnobiety favourite Syd. We cannot wait for it’s release. Until then, watch some more clips from the show below.\nMore from last night \nA post shared by Richard Russell (@everythingisrecorded) on Mar 14, 2017 at 1:18pm PDT \n\nLast night \nA post shared by Richard Russell (@everythingisrecorded) on Mar 14, 2017 at 10:23am PDT \n\nIn other UK music news, Actress has dropped a blistering new track “X22RME”, ahead of his new album AZD , which you need to listen to here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T14:02:25.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
