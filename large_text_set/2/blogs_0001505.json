At that time and up until yesterday, festival organizers were unaware she was pregnant with twins, according to TMZ . \nTMZ adds that Goldenvoice, the company behind Coachella, has attempted to reach out to Beyoncé’s representatives for more details, including how far along she is in her pregnancy. However, as of Thursday, they’ve yet to hear back. \nNevertheless, TMZ reports that Beyoncé still intends to headline the festival in April as long as the pregnancy goes as planned. Goldenvoice is not actively looking for a replacement headliner. \nCoachella goes down over two weekends, April 14th – 16th and 21st – 23rd, in Indio, California.
