Had a follow-up question for a client that just occurred to you at 1 AM? Want to write a heartfelt thank you to be texted at a later date? Unfortunately, neither SMS nor most messaging apps – including iMessage – allow you to draft a text in advance and schedule it to be sent out on a later date. But a new iOS application called Scheduled can help. \nTo be clear, the app does not actually schedule texts for automatic sending. \nFor that, you’d need to hack your iPhone and use one of the jailbreak apps instead. Apple does not allow for this functionality, officially. \nWhat Scheduled does is offer an App Store-approved workaround for scheduling texts. \nThe app itself is simple and straightforward to use. \nYou first select the person you want to text from your Contacts, then write the text you want to send and select the time you want to be reminded to send the text. When that time rolls around, Scheduled sends you a push notification so you can return to the app to send the text. \n\nAfter sending, a quite swipe will delete the reminder from the app’s queue. \nScheduled isn’t only for SMS or iMessage, however – it also supports messaging apps like Telegram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Twitter, and it allows you to copy the message’s text to paste it into any other app of your choice. It can be used for reminding you of emails or phone calls, too. \nFurther down the road, Scheduled plans to add support for LinkedIn and Slack, and it will roll out a few tweaks to the sending flow, Apple Watch integration, and Android support at some point. \nTo be fair, there are other text message scheduling apps on the App Store, but Scheduled’s interface is clean and modern, compared with those I’ve seen previously. compose message – text - en@1x", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:58:56.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
