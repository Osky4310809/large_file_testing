Coleen and husband Ray (Photo: PA) \nIt came after Coleen had the shocking revelation that her little half-sister, who was born in the 1950s, could have been among the hundreds of bodies found in an unmarked grave at the site of Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway. \n\"I've talked about the half-sister I've never met. She was born in Ireland,\" Coleen revealed in her last appearance on Loose Women. \n\"I always wondered why she didn't get in touch and I thought, she could have been one of those babies.\" Coleen struggled to take in the tragedy (Photo: ITV) \nNow fans are wondering whether it was this realisation that led to Coleen taking time away from the screen. \n\"Coleen is touched by everyone's concern,\" her rep told the magazine. \n\"The truth is she needs some time away from the spotlight to get her head together. \n\"With so much going on in her family, she just wanted to be at home, so that's why she cancelled all her appearances over the last few weeks.\" Coleen worries Ray has already moved on (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nThe entertainer has also struggled with the breakdown of her relationship in recent months, confiding that she fears it's \"too late\" to fix things with Ray following her CBB stint. \nBefore Christmas, Coleen revealed she and Ray were having problems and were thinking about having a trial separation. \nThen after being physically separated from Ray while in the Celebrity Big Brother house, Coleen found that she still had feelings for him.
