Can you hear me now?’ and it’s a recording.” \nLeah Johnson received more. \n“It’s like the third or fourth time this happened on my phone,” Johnson says. \nInvestigators are not sure what scammers are trying to do, but they believe the “yes” recording may be used to authorize a purchase or a service. The person saying “yes” could then get billed, the Federal Trade Commission warns. \n“They may try to use the recording of you saying ‘yes’ to convince the third party that you authorized the service,” says Ted Kossow. \nThe call also might be an attempt to verify your number is a working number, and not a fax machine, in order to sell it to a telemarketer. \nThe FTC warns calling back the incoming number can leave you vulnerable to being scammed. \n“When you call it back, the number just says, ‘Oh, the survey you are trying to take is now over,’” Lombardo says. “I wasn’t trying to take a survey.” \nBest response to this call, according to the FTC, is to hang up and never give out personal or financial information. \nIf you already said “yes” to this recorded call, check phone and utility bills for any unauthorized charges. \nDave Savini facebook Follow Award-winning Chicago journalist Dave Savini serves as investigative reporter for CBS 2 Chicago.
