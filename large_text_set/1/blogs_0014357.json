While you read this, the actor is probably planning another record-shattering movie slated to release on Eid . Or, he could be saying something wildly inappropriate to the reporters, or passing the buck or whatever. Bottomline, Bhai ain't got no time to waste. This was recently demonstrated in his tweet, where he posted a throwback picture of himself with Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan on the sets of Karan Arjun . Thanx rakeshji 4 giving @iamsrk n me #21yearsofKaranArjun , Congrats duggu on #17YearsOfKNPH @iHrithik . Best of luck Raees & Kaabil 25Jan . pic.twitter.com/DOxvXaZkjs â€” Salman Khan (@BeingSalmanKhan) January 15, 2017 \nWith that one tweet, he expressed his gratitude to Rakesh Roshan, congratulated Hrithik on 17 years of Kaho Na Pyaar Hai , and wished luck to both Shah Rukh and Hrithik for their upcoming movies, Raees and Kaabil . Any potential awkwardness was hence averted as Sallu did his bit by showing equal love to the superstars, who are all set to battle it out on January 25 with their overlapping movie releases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T19:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T09:16:27.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
