The goal that officially sealed their fate was a thing of beauty, however. \nMorocco‚Äôs Rachid Alioui locked his country‚Äôs quarterfinals spot ‚Äî and kept the Ivorians out ‚Äî with this gem of a curling long-range strike. An absolute peach from Rachid Alioui gives @FIFCI_tweet everything to do. #CAN2017 üçë https://t.co/NIgIt9CRl5 \n‚Äî beIN SPORTS USA (@beINSPORTSUSA) January 24, 2017 \nThe Cote d‚ÄôIvoire defense stands off of Alioui, ensuring the 24-year old forward doesn‚Äôt get a run at goal. There‚Äôs just one problem, though: the space gives Alioui plenty of room to shoot. And shoot, he does. It‚Äôs a pearler into the far corner, and it all but dooms the defending champs. \nCote d‚ÄôIvoire shoulder a lot of the blame for flaming out of AFCON. The Ivorians are a squad full of stars, and yet they failed to register a single group-stage win. Of course, being so reliant on big names gave them precious little time to practice in earnest, but Alioui‚Äôs dagger certainly didn‚Äôt help their cause, either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:31:16.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
