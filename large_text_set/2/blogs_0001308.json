My blood is boiling right now!” \nWhile his wife, Mila Kunis, doesn’t use social media, Kutcher shared her story online this week. The actress was born in Soviet Ukraine and came to the United States during the Cold War on a refugee via when she was a little girl. While Trump was campaigning last year, Kunis shared her opinion of his hateful rhetoric: “The whole Syrian-refugee thing—we came here on a religious-refugee visa, and I’m not going to blow this country up. I’m clearly paying taxes. I’m not taking anything away.” She told Glamour , “So the fact that people look at what’s happening and are like, “Pfft, they’re going to blow sh-t up”? It saddens me how much fear we’ve instilled in ourselves.” \nKutcher also commented on letting fear dictate national policy. My wife came to this country on a refugee visa in the middle of the Cold War! My blood is boiling right now! \n— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) January 29, 2017 \nActors, former presidents, and current members of the same political party have spoken out against Trump’s ban. In the days following his executive order, the world has watched as families were torn apart. A family who was traveling to America for a life-saving surgery for their baby girl was denied entry because of the ban. A mom and her breastfeeding child were separated for hours at an airport because of it. \nThe actor remained committed to calling out the policy online. We have never been a nation built on fear. Compassion that is the root ethic of America. Our differences are fundamental 2R sustainability. \n— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) January 29, 2017 If standing for the America that doesn't discriminate makes me a left wing actor who is out of touch. Fuck it. \n— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) January 30, 2017 As an American I respect my president but I do not respect this policy. #ABetterWay \n— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) January 30, 2017 I believe in protecting borders. I believe is enabling safety and security but we do so with honor. We are Americans. #ABetterWay \n— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) January 30, 2017 This isn't no nonsense policy this is no sense policy. #ABetterWay \n— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) January 30, 2017 \nThe actor also commented on the ban and the people stranded in airports during Sunday night’s SAG Awards , which he hosted. “Good evening, fellow SAG-AFTRA members and everyone at home. And everyone in airports that belong in my America,” Kutcher said. “You are a part of the fabric of who we are, and we love you and we welcome you.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:28:43.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
