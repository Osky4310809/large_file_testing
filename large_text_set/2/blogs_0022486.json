By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 24, 2017 4:15 PM The abduction case of the Malayalam actress has opened a can of worms for the Malayalam film industry. \n“She is with me and she is slowly recovering from the horror,” actress Remya Nambisan stated. The night when the Malayalam actress had been abducted and tortured by the main accused Pulsar Sunil and gang, she had been heading to her friend’s home – Remya Nambisan. The events played out in a horrifying manner and the actress took refuge in the house of actor-turned-director Lal. Now a day after Pulsar Sunil’s arrest, Remya Nambisan opened up about her friend who is with her, “Her fight is not just for herself but for all women in our society. She had apprehensions about the fact that the main accused had not been nabbed but now she is fine. She is recovering now and all of us trying hard to help her.” \nThe abduction case of the Malayalam actress has opened a can of worms for the Malayalam film industry. Several names spread like wild fire on social media, to the extent that Dileep, a leading actor in the industry, was forced to publish a Facebook update where he said that he is not the actor whose residence was visited by the police and he categorically stated that he has nothing to do with any of the accused who are mentioned in this case. \nActor-turned-Director Lal has expressed his pain at having been targeted by some sections of the press and social media. He explained the sequence of events to reporters and said, “I feel pained that my name and Anto’s are being wrongly interpreted in this case. We were trying to help her and that is all we did.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:05:44.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
