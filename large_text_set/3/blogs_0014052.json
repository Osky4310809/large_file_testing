We'll NEVER know. \nBut Tyrone Mings sent an interesting tweet on Tuesday night. \nWell, we say interesting. It actually comprised of just three letters. Lol. \nBut those three letters MIGHT have signified an awful lot. And you probably know why. Very subtle, Tyrone (Photo: Twitter / @OfficialTM_3) \nMings' tweet appeared in the immediate aftermath of the news that Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo WON'T be facing an FA probe into an allegation that he stamped on Chelsea's Eden Hazard in the FA Cup clash on Monday night. \nThat's WON'T be. Ouch (Photo: BBC) \nBecause Rojo's offence looked mightily similar to Mings' stamp on the Argentinean's team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the Premier League 10 days ago, an offence for which Mings is currently serving a five-match ban. Zlatan's face being used as a doormat (Photo: Sky Sports) \nGranted, Mings went for Zlatan's head and Rojo seemed to be going for Hazard's chest, but still. Both were body parts connected to an opposition player, but obviously both have been met with drastically different results. \nWhich is clearly something worth 'lolling' about if you're Mings. Or not. \nMaybe it was a cat video after all? poll loading Does Tyrone Mings deserve his five-game ban? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T23:27:57.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
