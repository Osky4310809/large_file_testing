While you are paying a pretty penny for all the rides and entertain inside the park, now think about everything else , like merchandise and food. You can easily rack up a hefty bill for a single-day of magic, and Disney knows it. That’s why they’re rolling out a brand new food offering for your day in the Magic Kingdom , and we like the sound of this.\nAlso, we’re already hungry.\nIf you’re familiar with Disney’s Dining Plan (DDP), there are two options for it, but the one were going to talk about here is for their Quick Service Dining Plan. It basically gives you a set number of meals for your vacation, and you can redeem that at Quick Service Restaurants. Only thing is you have to be staying at a Disney hotel to receive this promotion, and not everyone stays at a Disney hotel. So…now what?\nWELL, the Disney Parks Blog just announced a brand new dining promotion that is for EVERYONE and is SUPER AFFORDABLE. Basically, it breaks down to this: Two meals at the Magic Kingdom for $29 (for kids it is $12!!). Talking in Disney dollars, that is as cheap as it comes.\ntxcrew/Flickr This packages, Disney Dine on the Go, includes one coupon for any meal before 4 p.m., and then one meal after 4 p.m. — so you either get a breakfast/lunch, and then a dinner in the park. The coupons can be redeemed at Pinocchip’s Village Hause, Pecos Bill Tall tale Inn and Cafe, Columbia Harbor House, Casey’s Corner, and Cosmic Ray’s Starlight Cafe. You’ll get one entree and a drink, for roughly like, the same price as 10 Starbucks coffees. This is a STEAL.\nDisney Dine and Go starts on January 12th, and runs through February 22nd (however, it is assumed that if this is well received, the program will stick around for longer — possibly forever). If you’re heading to the parks soon, you can purchase one of these packages at one of the Magic Kingdom ticket booths or at Guest Relations. Have fun eating your way through Fantasyland!!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T03:15:58.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
