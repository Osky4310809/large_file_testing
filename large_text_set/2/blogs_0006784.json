Photograph: HANDOUT/REUTERS   22.47   22.50 GMT \nHundreds of whales have died overnight on a New Zealand beach after a mass stranding thought to be the largest in decades. \nThe Department of Conservation discovered 416 pilot whales had beached themselves at Farewell Spit in Golden Bay at the top of the south island, with more than 70% perishing by the time dawn broke on Friday. The eco guide to saving the whale Read more \nDOC staff and dozens of volunteers were on hand this morning trying to save the remaining 100 whales. \nAs the morning wore on an urgent plea was issued for locals to drop work and school commitments and head to the remote beach to save the whales, bringing towels, buckets and sheets to keep them cool, calm and wet. \nDOC Takaka team leader Andrew Lamason said the stranding was the largest in living-memory, and although he had “no clue” why the whales had beached themselves this time, Golden Bay was prone to strandings because of its shallow bay, which made it difficult for whales to swim out once they’d entered. \nAt high-tide at 10.30am the 100 remaining whales were successfully re floated, but were currently milling around the bay just off-shore, said Lamason, who was on the scene. \nHe said because so many of the whales kin were lying dead on the shore it was “very likely” the surviving whales would re-strand themselves at low-tide this afternoon, and DOC was preparing itself to launch a second mass rescue effort. \n“We are trying to swim the whales out to sea and guide them but they don’t really take directions, they go where they want to go. Unless they get a couple of strong leaders who decide to head out to sea, the remaining whales will try and keep with their pod on the beach.” \nLamason said whale strandings, which were common in Golden Bay, were an emotionally exhausting event, and anyone who wasn’t fit and strong and equipped to cope with the trauma were advised to stay away from the beach and not participate in the rescue effort. \n“It is cold, it’s wet and some of us have been in and out of the water for nine hours now, we can only cope with robust volunteers, not ones that are going to break down, which happens quite often.” he said. \n“We are in the farthest corner of the universe here but now volunteers have started turning up en masse and there are hundreds of people here and they have brought food and supplies so they are prepared to be here all day and all night if needed.” Tony (@Tonylean) Cape Farewell is a headland in New Zealand 400 pilot whales who have become stranded at Farewell Spit in Golden Bay. pic.twitter.com/6CEaCwe6Qo February 9, 2017 \nThe beach was still littered with the bodies of the nearly 300 dead pilot whales which perished overnight, but plans for disposing of their bodies naturally at sea were on hold while rescuers “concentrated on the living”, Lamason said. \nToday’s stranding at Farewell Spit makes it the third largest whale stranding in New Zealand’s recorded history. \nIn 1918 1000 whales beached themselves on the Chatham Islands, and in 1985 450 stranded at Great Barrier Island off the coast of Auckland. \nAccording to Project Jonah, a whale-rescue group, New Zealand has one of the highest rates of whale strandings in the world, and on average around 300 whales and dolphins beach themselves on Kiwi shores every year. \nThe reasons for whales strandings are still unclear, but it is thought a combination of factors contribute with old, sick and vulnerable whales being particularly vulnerable. Navigational errors among pods are also common, especially when chasing food or coming close to shore to avoid predators such as Orcas. \nSince 1840, more than 5000 whales and dolphins have beached themselves on New Zealand shores according to DOC records. \nStrandings occur year round, but usually only involve one or two animals. DOC respond to around 85 events a year, usually of single animals.
