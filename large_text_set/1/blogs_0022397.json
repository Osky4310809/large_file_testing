James-Catchings, St. Louis \nA • Chef Sonny Lewis’ skillful recipe for Chicken Portobello demonstrates why his Drake’s Place customers come back often for his cooking. Each considered step and every specific ingredient in the dish speaks of his training in country club and fine dining kitchens. \n“I’ve worked under four French chefs. I’ve cooked in Italian restaurants and even in an Irish pub,” he says. “I retired as the first black executive chef after 20-plus years at the Heart of St. Charles Banquet Center.” From a casual lunch with friends to a special date night dinner with a glass of wine or beer, Drake’s delivers with warmth and style. \nCredit for the ambience and good service goes to Lewis’ business partner and wife, Bridgett Lewis. She’s rarely without a smile. She maintains her calm demeanor even at the height of busy service. \nShe often posts photos of their daily specials on Facebook like hot Nashville chicken, double cut pork chops with a Cabernet sauce or Mandarin chicken. The couple lists the special fare for the day on a sign out front. “Whenever we put the double-cut pork chops on the sign, people just pull in. We nearly always sell out,” Bridgett Lewis says. \n“We make everything in house, to order, from scratch — even our salad dressings,” Bridgett Lewis says. “Sonny takes time to make each plate look beautiful, too.” \nThe Lewises opened Drake’s Place in Ferguson early in the summer of 2014. By late August, Ferguson was embroiled in the unrest following the death of Michael Brown. Although they were far from the activity on West Florissant, their business was adversely affected. Through it all, Drake’s Place remained open. \n“During that time, people came in from all over the city and county to support us here in Ferguson. That helped pull us through. We have our base of regular customers, but we’d like to see more new faces,” Sonny Lewis says.
