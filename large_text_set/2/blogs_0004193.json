Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTamara Ecclestone has shared a candid shot of herself breastfeeding daughter Sophia with her 250,000 Instagram followers. \nThe daughter of billionaire Bernie Ecclestone posed for a beautiful shot with Sophia, who turns three in March, in her lavish London home. \nAlongside the candid picture, Tamara, who looks angelic in a floaty white gown as Sophia sits on her knee, thanked photographer Ivette Ivens for \"spreading this message\". \n\"Thank you @ivetteivens for capturing this beautiful moment this is by far my favourite photograph but mainly thank you for spreading this message,\" she wrote. https://www.instagram.com/p/BQQOBJpDQIM/?taken-by=ivetteivens&hl=en/embed \n\"Breastfeeding is a powerful demonstration of love and nurturing yet it has become so normal to hide. I want to take that normal and toss it.\" \nIvette also shared the same picture and simply captioned it, \"Breastfeeding goddess\" - the name of her book which features a collection of women breastfeeding their children. \nLate last year, Tamara said she has no plans to stop breastfeeding her daughter.

Can anyone say anything?’ I find it bizarre what people’s priorities are.” \n“My boobs are like a tap!\" joked the star. Sophia Ecclestone and Tamara Ecclestone attend the UK Premiere of \"Finding Dory\" at Odeon Leicester Square (Photo: Getty) \nBut when questioned about getting Sophia to move on from being breast fed, Tamara made it clear that she has no intentions of changing her routine at the moment. \n“We’ll cross that bridge if it comes to it, but for now she’s my baby. You’re doing something that is so amazing for your child, but it can cause such hostility and anger.\" \nShe continued: \"Sophia is two and a half and yes, a lot of people wouldn’t breastfeed now. \n\"But it’s so comforting for her and she loves it. Although I’m going to have the saggiest boobs around by the time she’s finished,\" added the star.
