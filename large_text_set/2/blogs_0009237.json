Mary Berry decided to stay with the BBC Credit: Ian West/PA \nI ndeed, Leith has already served as a judge for a decade on the similarly-named BBC cookery contest, Great British Menu, which pits professional chefs against one another. \nOnly four months ago she said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph that she had no intention of throwing her hat in the ring to replace her friend Berry in the show's new line-up. Prue Leith previously denied she was interested in the job Credit: Andrew Crowley \n\"I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about, really. I was more concerned about Brangelina,\" she said following the break-up of the original Bake Off team. \nB ut now a source has told the Sun that Leith - who at 76 is the same age as Berry was when the programme first launched - has been recruited as the new judge. \nThe source said: “Both are from similar backgrounds, so hopefully viewers will be accepting and give Prue a chance to win them over. \n“Following in Mary’s footsteps is a big challenge. \n“But the producers are confident that Prue has all the attributes.\" Paul Hollywood is the last man standing of the original line-up Credit: Mark Bourdillon /BBC / Love Productions \nL eith is famed for her eponymous cookery school, which she founded in 1975, and for running a Michelin-starred restaurant. \nBerry said she decided to stay with the BBC \"out of loyalty\" to the corporation for nurturing her and the show from its beginnings. \nThe programme will also need to find new presenters, after comedy duo Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins also declined \"go with the dough\". \nA spokesman for Channel 4 said: “We’ll be announcing the line-up in due course.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:37:11.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
