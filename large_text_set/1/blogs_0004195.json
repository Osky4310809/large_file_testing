On the Monday, January 2, premiere of the second half of Teen Mom 2 season 7, Jenelle Evans came face-to-face with the judge in her assault trial…along with ex-fiancé Nathan Griffith and his girlfriend, Jessica Henry . Elsewhere, Kailyn Lowry could have used the decisiveness of a judge herself as she worked out what she wanted when it came to her relationship with Javi Marroquin . PHOTOS: Teen Mom Stars, Then and Now! \nOne Small Step for Kailyn, One Giant Leap for a Whole Production Crew \nThe episode began with Kailyn still reiterating what she had been saying during the first part of the season: She was confused about her future with Javi. So of course, she did what any rational person confused about their relationship would do and went skydiving.   \nYeah. We’re serious. She said she was having a “quarter-life crisis” and leapt out of a plane. Not only did she jump, but a camera crew had to do it with her to capture the whole moment. MTV, give these people a raise. \nLater, she worked out her issues in a slightly more rational way by talking them over with a friend. Together, they realized she couldn’t make any decisions until Javi got back from deployment. During FaceTime calls for the rest of the episode, it became pretty obvious that the deployment was hard on just about everyone involved, not least of all the kids. \nChelsea Keeps Her Dress Under Wraps \nChelsea Houska made it pretty clear that her daughter’s father, Adam Lind, no longer spoke to her, let alone wanted to be part of the show. He made it clear, too, when he refused to allow the crew into his house to film because he was “napping,” even though they’d told him what time they were coming. When producers and camera operators finally got into the home 45 minutes later, he complained that they never filmed him being a good dad to little Aubree. \nWhen a producer asked why he never alerted them about activities he’d like filmed, he said he shouldn’t have to, as Chelsea could do it, or the producers should just know. Makes sense to Us! PHOTOS: Celebrity Babies 2016 \nChelsea was in a much better mood than her ex as she planned her wedding to Cole DeBoer , taking care to make Aubree feel extra special by making a big deal of the day that the 7-year-old tried on the dress they’d ordered. \nIn contrast to the big event that was Aubree’s dress shopping day, Chelsea elected not to have cameras present as she searched for a wedding gown. She said she was starting to value privacy more and more as she got older and wanted her wedding to be personal, not public.

Jessi, the Jury Has Decided … \nThe mom of two was nervous about going to court and was furious that Jessi wouldn’t drop the assault charges that could send her to jail and prevent her from ever getting custody of her firstborn, Jace. \nNathan and Jessi testified about the alleged assault, insisting that Jenelle was volatile and shouldn’t have custody of her son with Nathan. Jenelle’s lawyer came back on the defensive, asking if they had gone looking for a fight the day the alleged assault took place.
