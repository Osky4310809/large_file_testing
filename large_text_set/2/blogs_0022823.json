With credits that include The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Tales from the Borderlands, and Minecraft: Story Mode, the four will bring a wealth of storytelling expertise to Ubisoft San Francisco future projects. \nThe new hires include two senior design directors, Dennis Lenart and Nick Herman, as well as narrative director Pierre Shorette and creative producer Adam Sarasohn. Lenart was a key member of the direction and cinematics departments on the first season of The Walking Dead, guiding its teams through six-week release schedules before going on to helm the wildly successful Minecraft: Story Mode as its creative director. Herman – who’s worked on more than 40 shipped games, and joined Telltale in its startup days as its first cinematic artist – also helped oversee season one of The Walking Dead as its lead cinematic artist and director. \n“We are excited to welcome these strong industry veterans to our skilled team at Ubisoft San Francisco,” says, François Pelland, Executive Producer at Ubisoft San Francisco. “As we continue to expand our portfolio of games, we look to hire the best talent in the industry and infuse team members with a shared passion for development.” \nShorette, meanwhile, cut his teeth at Telltale writing for The Wolf Among Us, then led writing for The Walking Dead’s second season and Tales from the Borderlands. Before joining Ubisoft San Francisco, he was Telltale’s director of writing, guiding other writers across all of the company’s projects. Finally, Sarasohn has been overseeing dev teams for more than 10 years as a producer, shipping Tales from the Borderlands and training new producers during his four years at Telltale. \nLenart, Herman, Shorette, and Sarasohn are formidable additions to the team at Ubisoft San Francisco, where they’ll work on future projects.
