According to Dunham — the show’s creator — a movie will definitley happen in the future, so yay!\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter , as a part of their Girls cover issue , the 30-year-old actress talked about what’s next for her and Girls .\n“What’s next for me? I love writing my stupid books, and Jenni and I have [our newsletter] Lenny and a bunch of feature ideas, but we’re giving ourselves the gift of a little time,” Dunham told The Hollywood Reporter .\n“We feel like no one necessarily needs to hear from us right now. But if someone wants to do the [ Girls ] movie, we’ll do it,” Girls show producer, Jenni Konner added.\nBen Gabbe/Getty Images “Oh, we’re doing the movie,” Dunham continued. “I’d just want to leave enough space so that we are finding them in a super different place than we left them. But if HBO paid for two Sex and the City ones, they’d better pay for one of ours.” Preach, Lena, preach!\nKonner then pointed out that the movie studio paid for the SATC films to which Dunham said, “Oh, we may have more trouble with that…”\nWe’re not going to focus on the possible trouble, we are however going to keep our eyes on the prize…a feature film about our favorite dysfunctional friends!\nIt's here!

She remembers that last day of shooting perfectly, and it makes sense why someday she’d want to do more.\n“For the last shot, Jenni was directing, and I wasn’t wearing pants,” Dunham explained.\n“I looked up at the trees and smelled the air, and it was one of those moments where I was like, ‘I want to remember exactly what this was.’ Then Jenni called cut, and literally men in their ’60s were weeping,” she recalled.\n2/12/17 \nA photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Jan 31, 2017 at 2:16pm PST \n“It was really special, and since I hated both high school and college, I was like, ‘Oh, that must be what it felt like when people were sad.'” While we too might cry when the HBO series comes to a close this spring, we can’t wait to watch what unfolds when Season 6 premieres on Sunday, February 12th.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:44:33.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
