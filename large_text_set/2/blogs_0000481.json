Fast facts about President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Before you go, we thought you'd like these... Morgan Whitaker, AOL.com Jan 31st 2017 8:57PM \nPresident Donald Trump fulfilled yet another promise for his first 100 days in office on Tuesday night as he nominated federal judge Neil Gorsuch to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. \nGorsuch is a relatively unknown outside of legal circles. Here are a few quick things to know about him. \n1. He is the youngest nominee in decades \nAt 49, Gorsuch will be seven years younger than the next oldest colleague on the Supreme Court if confirmed and 34 years younger than Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Supreme Court Justices serve for life, which means Gorsuch could have a significant impact on U.S. law for decades to come. \n2. He got his law degree from Harvard \nEvery current member of the Supreme Court attended either Yale or Harvard Law School -- although Ginsburg transferred from Harvard to Columbia Law and ultimately received her degree from there -- and Gorsuch continues this tradition. \nGorsuch also attended Columbia as an undergraduate and received a Ph.D. in philosophy from England's Oxford University, where he was a member of the prestigious Marshall Scholar program. 13 PHOTOS See Gallery Judge Neil Gorsuch \nJudge Neil Gorsuch speaks, after US President Donald Trump nominated him for the Supreme Court, at the White House in Washington, DC, on January 31, 2017.
