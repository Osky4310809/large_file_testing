Highest paid were foreign workers in Switzerland who got an average salary of $188,275, followed by Hong Kong at $169,756.\nLike Switzerland and Hong Kong, India has a financial hub in Mumbai. The survey showed that India has the highest proportion of expats on international secondment or assignment.\nMore In Expats It’s Time to Apply for H-1B Visas to Work in the U.S. What Expats Really Think of India ENLARGE India is home to high-flying expats, an HSBC survey shows.

Photo: Dominic Lipinski/Zuma Press \nDespite the large pay packets in Asia, Europe was home to some of the best destinations for a successful expat career, said Dean Blackburn, Head of HSBC Expat.\nHe said six European countries made it into the top 10 of the bank’s wider ranking that included scores for economics, experience and family. The survey showed Singapore came top for that, followed by New Zealand and Canada. On that ranking, India came 26th, scoring particularly low for “experience,” the measurement for lifestyle and ease of setting up there. The U.S., meanwhile ranked 30th.\nBut he said where expats decided to live depended on their goals. “Some expats are looking for an accelerated route to the top of the career ladder, some want to put themselves on a firmer financial footing, while others want to improve their work-life balance,” Mr. Blackburn said.\n \n\nShare this: Expats India Pay Wages Previous Islamic Group Calls for Death of Son of Murdered Pakistani Politician After He Criticized Blasphemy Law", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T13:44:38.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
