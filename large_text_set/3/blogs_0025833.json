Unless you have some secret Instagram following, why won’t you wear them?! \nFashion blogger, Zaklina, isn’t your typical grandma. \nThe 47-year-old has two grandchildren, but they’re obviously not cramping her style on Instagram . \nTBH, I would be pissed AF if my grandma looked this good while I’m over here, surviving on a healthy diet of Starbursts, sunflower seeds and alcohol. \nThe grandmother, who is originally from Serbia, has already amassed a huge following on social media where she shows her eye for fashion. \nShe even includes the hashtag “#grandmotherthatlovesfashion” in her posts, should you forget that this isn’t some 20-something model. \nI also suspect her followers are low key trying to figure out where she keeps the Fountain of Youth. \nShe says she owes her style to living in Switzerland, France and Poland. She currently lives in Italy, which is considered one of Europe’s largest fashion hubs. \nZaklina said, \nMy main goal is to inspire women to wake up their wild side. \nHonestly though, if you want to look like this by the time you’re a grandma, or even 47, then you probably shouldn’t wake up that wild side. \nStay indoors, out of sunlight, so you never get wrinkles. Eat healthy, take cold showers, don’t drink. \nBesides fashion blogging, Zaklina says her favorite thing to do is to hang out with her 28-year-old daughter. \nBut her life isn’t all fashion, beachside vacations and happy times. \nShe refers to her late son, Stefan, as her guardian angel, and tags him in every post “#rememberstefan.” He passed away on Christmas Eve of last year when he was run over in Belgrade, Serbia. \n\nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
