Ahead of the device’s anticipated March announcement, noted journalist Evan Blass has leaked the flagship’s specs, and they’re pretty much what you’d expect.\nAccording to the one-sheet shared by Blass (pictured at the bottom of this post), the Galaxy S8 Plus will feature a 6.2-inch (full rectangle) QHD+ display, a 12-megapixel Dual Pixel camera, 8-megapixel front-facing camera, IP68 dust and water resistance, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of expandable storage.\nThe sheet doesn’t say how big the battery will be, though we’d expect it to be in the 3,000mah to 3,500mAh range. The device will also feature an iris scanner, Samsung Pay, and support for wireless charging, which will require a separate charging pad.\nThe sheet also mentions that the display will feature rounded corners, which cuts down slightly on the viewing area (6.1 inches, according to the document). Otherwise, the device is as you’d expect.\nThere’s no mention of DeX , Samsung’s rumored desktop functionality, nor is there mention of Bixby, which is allegedly the company’s brand new artificial intelligence. We also previously heard the device will sport a Snapdragon 835 chip though, again, the document doesn’t mention it.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com We still have a lot of questions Yesterday, we saw the device powered on and ready to go, confirming Samsung is ditching capacitive buttons . Today, we pretty much have a full picture of what the device will offer when it launches, reportedly in April.\nAlongside the LG G6, the Galaxy S8 is one of the more anticipated phones hitting in the next few months. Based on the spec sheet, the Galaxy S8 Plus is going to be a beast, but we still have a few questions the document doesn’t answer.\nFor one, how big will the battery be? And how much will the phone cost when it launches? Perhaps most important of all: When is the phone going to be available to buy?\nHopefully, all that information and more will officially be made available next month.\nSamsung Galaxy S8+ spec sheet.
