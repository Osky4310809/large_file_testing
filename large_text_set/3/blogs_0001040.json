Wouldn’t it be nice if we could all just wake up with our own personal glam squad? Meet 26-year-old Jade Hydaria. She posted an Instagram video of her boyfriend, Curt Rendle, 29, applying a full face of makeup on her. The caption read, “So I let my baby @rocknrendle slay my makeup today. I can’t believe how good he did bc I did not help him.” As you may have already expected, people instantly unleashed their inner makeup artist and rushed to comment. For the haters and Internet trolls who felt the need to question Hydaria’s boyfriend and his masculinity, she updated her caption later, noting: \n“I HATE explaining myself bc I don’t have to but I NEED to say: so many of you men have such fragile masculinity that you can’t understand that we did this for fun. I am a professional Make-up artist and wanted to see him do my art.” Others were way more encouraging and supportive. Knowloveart wrote, “The same men questioning your relationship and his masculinity are the same men beating on their girl, cheating and leaving their kids behind. I’m sure of it. Love him and let him love you that’s all that matters #goals!!!” Kaylalynne_xoxo also left a comment: “He actually did great! I love how you guys’ happiness shines in the video. So glad i followed!” Hydaria opened up to Yahoo Beauty and shut down Internet trolls. At first, she says she was upset, “but I stopped caring after the first day or two. I know he’s all man! That’s all that matters,” she says. “I think people are insecure and have never been loved, so when they see true love, they don’t recognize it. I take the negativity with grace, and I appreciate all of the love immensely. I review tons of messages daily about me inspiring people, and I respond to every single one because I am forever grateful to inspire. It’s all I’ve ever asked God for — to inspire.” Hydaria has been a professional hairstylist and makeup artist for almost a decade, and her boyfriend is a boilermaker and guitar player. The two met on the Internet after following each other’s social media accounts for four years, but they thought it would be crazy to pursue one another, as they lived in different countries. One day, everything changed. “Curt had a dream about me in a red dress and decided to work up the nerve to tell me,” she recalls. The couple has no regrets whatsoever about posting their recent makeup video, and the two are really appreciative of the followers who are enthused by their shared moments together. When we asked what Hydaria’s boyfriend thought about the way she applies her own makeup, she responded, “He loves anything that I am passionate about. He loves that I creatively express myself through my art, but to be honest, he prefers me without makeup and loves my naturally kinky hair.” Still curious about this dynamic duo? You’re not alone. Check out their latest YouTube video, in which they answer some of their followers’ most burning questions. Below, they school everyone on their love by touching on everything from how they met to how they deal with cultural differences as well as groupies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:49:45.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
