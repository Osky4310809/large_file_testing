He told her to start living with him in his sister’s house. \n“He brought her to Lagos on Feb. 3 to buy some things for his business at Mile 12, but on Feb. 5 one of Hausa leaders saw them. \n“After series of questions, it was discovered that the girl had been passing through a lot in the hands of the accused. \n“She was taken without her parents’ knowledge and was being defiled every night by the accused,’’ he submitted. \nIhiehie said that the victim told the police that since she met the accused, she had not been the same. \nThe prosecutor said that the offence contravened Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011. \nThe trader, however, pleaded not guilty. \nThe magistrate, Mrs O. Sule-Amzat, remanded him in prison custody, and ordered that the victim should be taken to an orphanage until the next adjourned date, March 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T17:17:38.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
