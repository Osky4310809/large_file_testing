(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press) While Republicans hold the White House and majorities in both houses of Congress, one cannot overstate how tenuous their grip on power is. President Trump, to his dismay, is a popular-vote loser who got into office with less than 46 percent of the vote against a weakened candidate, even with the help of Russian disinformation and propaganda efforts. His polling has not improved.\nIn the latest Gallup poll, his approval rating clocks in at 41 percent, with 53 percent disapproval. The NBC News-Survey Monkey poll shows 43 percent approve of Trump’s performance, while 54 percent disapprove. Even worse, his agenda fails to attract support. On the Affordable Care Act in the Politico-Morning Consult poll, only 24 percent think it should be completely repealed. In the NBC-Survey Monkey poll, 68 percent want to repeal some or all of the law, while 29 percent don’t want it repealed at all. The pollsters explain: “In a Morning Consult/Politico poll from January 7, 59% of voters said Obamacare should be repealed completely or in part. Today, only 51% of voters say the same. This drop-off includes Republicans: In January, 83% of Republicans thought Obamacare should be repealed. Today, 78% think it should.” The more House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Trump talk about Obamacare repeal, the less the voters want them to do it.\nOn immigration, 56 percent in the NBC-Survey Monkey poll oppose building a wall and 58 percent say immigration helps more than it hurts. The public is not with Trump on Russia and NATO, either. A strong 80 percent of voters say NATO is good for the United States. Some 62 percent think we should take into consideration concerns of allies, while only 34 percent think we should act in ways to help ourselves even if we hurt allies. Some 61 percent think Russia is not an ally or an enemy of the United States. However, Republicans — following dutifully behind Trump — are thinking more positively about Vladimir Putin, according to the Politico-Morning Consult, NBC-Survey Monkey and Gallup polls (“A major reason for the overall rise in Putin’s favorable rating this year is Republicans’ more positive views of the Russian leader, from 12% in 2015 to 32% today.”)\nAside from inducing the once freedom-loving, anti-despot Republican Party to become more favorably disposed to a repressive, aggressive Russian president, it is hard to see that Trump is building a coalition for any major initiative — the wall, full repeal of Obamacare or even “America First.” A mass roundup of illegal immigrants who have committed no violent crimes, an expensive boondoggle to build a wall on the southern border and other bones thrown to the alt-right and the anti-immigration right aren’t going to make up for failures on the big-ticket items the GOP and Trump promised.\nTrump got himself elected by telling working-class whites that the elites are out to get them and only he, the great businessman, could make their economic condition better. Literally nothing he has done — the travel ban, the fights with the press, his executive orders on the wall and Obamacare (which covers many of his strongest supporters), etc. — has done a thing for these people. The Democrats might want to point that out, and Republicans might want to think about whose interests they are actually serving.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@JRubinBlogger", "http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/data-points/poll-majority-americans-worried-about-war-feel-favorably-toward-nato-n723931", "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/170205_crosstabs_Politico_v3_TS-1-1.pdf", "http://www.gallup.com/poll/204191/putin-image-rises-mostly-among-republicans.aspx?g_source=Politics&g_medium=newsfeed&g_campaign=tiles"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:49:45.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
