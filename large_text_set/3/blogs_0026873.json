Memes about the debate were shared online (Photo: Bristol Post) Read More \nThe post went viral on a number of mums’ internet forums in Bristol. \nThe responses ranged from mockery to outrage. \n“Who are you to determine what is acceptable?” wrote one angry parent. \n“Taking a five week old to a playing field? Interacting with other children at five weeks old? What an idiot. Also, what has breastfeeding got to do with it? \n“Is the woman not allowed a glass of wine or two on Mother’s Day? If she was drinking whilst feeding it wouldn’t have even affected her milk before the baby needs another feed. Judgemental tw*t who clearly needs to get a life.\" \nEven after the original post was deleted, the debate continued, with people even going to the lengths of creating Sheldon breastfeeding memes, and starting new threads about the issue of breastfeeding in pubs. The rant was swiftly deleted (Photo: Bristol Post) \nOthers also pointed out the latest NHS guidelines state research has revealed a mother’s body is remarkably adept at screening alcohol out of breastmilk, so the issue of drinking while feeding was a red herring. \nLorna Cahill wrote an open post to all breastfeeding mums not to be put off by the furore. \n“Please don’t ever feel embarrassed to feed your babies in public,” she wrote. \n“The early days of motherhood are scary and overwhelming and many women assume they'll receive a negative reaction from some people for breastfeeding in public.\" Read More British mums on maternity leave get worse pay deal than most European neighbours Hundreds of women wrote about their own breastfeeding experiences (Photo: Bristol Post) \n“I feed my daughter wherever I am whenever she needs it and have never had any negative feedback,\" she continued. \n“I was so upset when I read that persons horrid post yesterday, on Mothers Day, but it's so refreshing that so much positivity and support for normalising breastfeeding has come out of it.\" \nIt is unclear which of the pubs in North Street Mr Sparks was referring to.
