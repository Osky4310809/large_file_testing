Not only is it a major piece of silverware, but it's also the only major honour the club are yet to add to their considerable trophy cabinet. As an added bonus, it also ensures qualification into next season's UEFA Champions League. Considering that finishing in the top four is far from guaranteed this year with six teams competing for those places, the Europa League could be the club's best chance of reaching Europe's premier competition. In their way stand Rostov. United shouldn't have too much difficulty in this tie, particularly over two legs—they should be fine provided they avoid complacency. Football writers Liam Canning Jonas Giaever believe the draw is almost perfect for United: Liam Canning @LiamPaulCanning I'm sure José Mourinho will have a view on the travelling side of things, but in terms of opponents, it should be very comfortable. 2/24/2017, 12:18:38 PM Jonas Giæver @CheGiaevara Rostov are by no means any pushovers, but I think United should defeat them over two legs. A long travel to Russia is a minus, I will agree. 2/24/2017, 12:20:54 PM Indeed, the only real issue is the timing of the tie, sandwiched between the two legs is their FA Cup quarter-final at Chelsea on March 13. Roma will undoubtedly have their eye on the trophy also —they're second in Serie A, but making up a seven-point deficit on Juventus will be extremely difficult. The Giallorossi swept aside Villarreal 4-1 over two legs in the last round, and that's no mean feat —the Spanish side boast the best defence in La Liga with just 15 goals conceded in 23 matches. With strength running throughout their side, they're among the best teams left in the competition. As OptaPaolo noted, the Italians have the advantage in their brief head-to-head record: OptaPaolo @OptaPaolo 0 - #Roma are unbeaten against Olympique Lyonnais in European matches: 1 draw at home and 1 win in France in the UCL Last 16 2006/07. Draw. https://t.co/erW8c1xw9q Lyon are among the more difficult teams they could have drawn and should not be taken lightly —they beat AZ Alkmaar 11-2 on aggregate in the last round. Nevertheless, Luciano Spalletti's side should be set to progress to the quarter-finals if they play their best.
