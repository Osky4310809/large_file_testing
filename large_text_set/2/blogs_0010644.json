Since wearing its current RS production body instead of its previous S5 clothes , the upcoming RS5 will – as seen here – have an RS-exclusive front bumper, which incorporates large air intakes on the sides, and a more pronounced double lip, while the honeycomb grille mesh is also expected to make it to the production car. \nAlong the bodywork, the RS5’s flared wheel arches – which keep the car’s beefed-up brakes, wheels and tyres tidy to sight – and oval exhaust tailpipes are another RS model signifier. \nMotive force for the upcoming RS5 will come from the 2.9 litre, twin-turbo petrol V6 that already serves in the Porsche Panamera 4S , in which it produces 440 PS and 550 Nm of torque. For the RS5, output is expected to reach 450 hp and 605 Nm of torque. \nIn terms of performance, the upcoming RS5 is expected to run the 0-100 km/h benchmark in under four seconds, onwards to an electronically-limited 250 km/h top speed; there may be scope for optional equipment to raise the top speed limitation. \nThe car’s public debut is expected in March at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, while its Audi Sport sibling, the next RS4 Avant , is slated to make its debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show later this year.
