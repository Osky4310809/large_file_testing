A post shared by Bastian Schweinsteiger (@bastianschweinsteiger) on Mar 22, 2017 at 4:09am PDT \nBut before he departs for pastures new Schweinsteiger took the time to thank a number of the Old Trafford staff, in particular fitness coach Paolo Gaudino. \n“A big thank you to the entire staff, for everything you've done for me,” he posted on Instagram. Schweinsteiger set to become fourth Van Gaal signing Mourinho has sold \n“Especially to my friend and PT Paolo for always standing by my side! Mille grazie! \nMeanwhile, Germany boss Joachim Low, speaking before his side’s friendly with England on Wednesday evening, believes the 32-year-old still has plenty in the tank and could have offered something to the heart of United’s midfield. \n\"We spoke some weeks ago and he said in training he has given everything he has got,\" he said in his pre-match press conference. \n\"For a while there was some light on the horizon, but it was just not to be at Manchester United. \n\"I saw a few of United games. As a midfield organiser, I think United could have done with Schweinsteiger in a few games.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T11:33:46.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
