The following women on this list (okay, with the exception of maybe one), were known for having a little more meat on their bones, but when they slimmed down, people had a lot to say. Check out 10 women who were criticized for losing weight. Jennifer Hudson The actress and singer looked great with weight on her and still looks stellar with a slimmer frame. But when she initially lost weight, a lot was said about her body, from her head to her chest, and it wasn't always nice. But as she told Redbook in 2012, \"I’m at the weight I want to be. But I hear all the time, 'Don’t lose any more weight, you need to stop.' People are under the impression that I’m still losing but I’m not.\" Lena Dunham The Girls star recently started shedding weight, and her critics, per the usual, had a lot to say about it. \"I got all these people saying, 'You're a hypocrite. I thought you were body positive. I thought you were a person embracing bodies of all sizes,\" she told Ellen DeGeneres . \"And I was like, 'I do,' I just understand that my body's changed. We live a long time, things happen.\" She continued, \"I was frustrated about it because it really is evidence that as a woman in Hollywood, you just can't win.\" Mo'Nique You know you're going to get a fair share of criticism when you write a book called Skinny Women Are Evil: Notes of a Big Girl in a Small-Minded World and then lose a heap of weight. But as she told Hot 97, she lost the weight for her family -- not for anyone else. \"My family is the secret. I’m 45 years old and I have babies,\" she said. \"I want to have the opportunity to know their babies. Going at the rate I was going, I was going to lose that opportunity. I would be neglectful to my family because of my self neglect.\" Ashley Graham Last summer the new \"It\" model, considered a plus-size model, was criticized for appearing to have lost a few pounds. When people asked her why she was \"changing\" herself on social media, she hit back saying, \"People come on my page and body shame me because I’m too big, because I’m too small, because I’m not good enough for their standards. But at the end of the day I’m good enough for me. Angles will make anyone look bigger or smaller and I just happen to know mine.\" Star Jones It wasn't the weight loss as much it was the way Star Jones lost her weight that seemed to rub her fans the wrong way. Despite being very public with her weight loss ups and downs, she kept the gastric bypass surgery she had to herself for quite some time. \"It really ticked them off,\" Jones said on Today about her fans . \"Because I was so public with all other aspects of my life I think the audience felt betrayed in some way. And I completely understand that. The reason I say I don’t regret that...is it really worked for me. It allowed me to get emotionally safe and secure.\" Raven-Symoné While she was still a co-host on The View , Raven-Symone opened up about the time she was told by producers of her former show, State of Georgia , that she had lost too much weight. \"On State of Georgia they had me wear a fat suit,\" she said . \"Because they said I wasn't the size they wanted me to be.\" Emma Stone Okay, she wasn't necessarily \"curvy,\" but roll with me. If you've seen Superbad , then you probably noticed that Emma Stone, now an Academy Award winner thanks to La La Land , had some baby fat on her. In an interview with Seventeen in 2014, she mentioned that she'd noticed the criticism of her once she started shedding pounds. \"It can be really challenging in today's world for anyone—especially girls and women—to feel good about their bodies,\" she said. \"No matter how things look from the outside, we can all be super critical of ourselves and of our image in the mirror. I've seen articles or comments that have addressed my weight, or 'caving to pressure to be thin.'\" Kerry Washington While the actress hasn't spoken openly about what people may think about her weight loss over the years, there have been people, and sites ( like this one ) that have asked if Washington, who stepped on the scene with a little more meat on her bones, lost too much weight. Toccara Jones \"I think it's just about being healthy and about being fit,\" Jones said about her weight loss to, get this, Yvonne Orji (of Insecure ) back in 2011. \"I think some of your fans do get a little upset with you, but it's really about loving yourself. I think that they embrace that. I think that's why they love you in the first place because you embrace who you are. And as long as you continue embracing who you are, they're going to fall in love with you again. They're just tripping right now but they'll be right back.\" Khloe Kardashian After years of being labeled as the least attractive Kardashian sister by harsh critics, once Khloe Kardashian lost weight, she was still being called out, but this time, for losing too much weight. \"I need to remember the date today!\" she tweeted last year . \"Never would I have ever thought I would be in the media for being 'too skinny.' What on earth?!?! She continued, \"First I'm too fat and now I'm too skinny. I love this game!\"   Images via WENN The post 10 Curvy Women Who Were Criticized For Losing Weight appeared first on MadameNoire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:00:31.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
