Future deaths risk \nA collision investigator said Milan Dokic lost control of the motorcycle upon entering the CSH to overtake a van on Battersea Park Road on 1 March, 2016. \nCCTV shows the motorcycle losing grip and sliding along the road, causing the rider to come off and hit a bollard. \nWhile no conclusion has been reached about the cause of death, the pre-inquest review on 14 February heard the CSH road surface at the crash site had lower skid resistance than normal road surfaces and those close to pedestrian crossings. \nIn her pre-inquest review report, Dr Wilcox said: \"In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.\" \nShe concluded the risk was too high for TfL to delay action until the conclusion of the full inquest hearing in the summer. \nLeon Daniels, TfL's director of surface transport, said: \"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Milan Dokic. \n\"We're preparing our response to the coroner and carefully considering the issues raised. We are confident our cycle superhighway network is improving the safety of London's roads.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T09:06:01.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
