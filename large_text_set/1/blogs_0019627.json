You know, that moment where you smack your knee against something and release a symphony of swears while hopping up and down on one leg? It’s impressive if you think about it. But…why? Why do we swear like a sailor when we’re hurt? Well, it turns out that it may genuinely help reduce pain! 2 source \nStudies have shown that people who were constantly swearing aloud were able to endure pain for up to 50% longer than their non-swearing counterparts. The pain was simply being induced by having participants submerge their hands in ice cold water. Studies similar to this have all yielded very similar results from different universities around the world. Heck, even Mythbusters tried it out. So, it turns out swearing does somehow help us deal with pain easier. But the question remains, how? 3 source \nThe exact process in which swearing helps us deal with pain is yet to be clear. However, researchers believe that brain circuitry linked to emotion might be involved. \nFor example, when we use words that are considered appropriate, we are activating the outer few millimeters of our left brain. But when we are using swear words, we are activating structures found deep in our right brain. 4 source \nThe amygdala, a small group of neurons in our brains that trigger our fight or flight response, can make our heart rates climb thus making us less sensitive to feeling pain. Researches suspect that the amygdala is involved in helping us with pain when we swear. 5 source \nPsychologist Timothy Jay of The Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts believes that the use of profanities allow us to express a plethora of emotions from anger to joy. It’ sort of akin to a car horn in that it’s built into you and can be used to express a variety of emotions. He believes that it is that very emotional connection that we have to swearing that helps us endure pain longer. \nPsychologist Richard Stephens also suggests that the more often we swear, the less potent that emotional bond becomes. So maybe it’s best to leave the loud and aggressive swearing for when you next stub your toe.
