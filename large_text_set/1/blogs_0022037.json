Plans for the £800 million Waterloo and South West Upgrade, including faster and more frequent services including a fleet of new trains, were announced last year but the full extent of disruption for passengers was only revealed on Thursday. \nCommuters arriving at Waterloo on Thursday morning were handed leaflets detailing the work and the “significant reductions in service.” \nThe work will have a huge knock-on effect on commuter services from Dorset, Hampshire, Surrey, Berkshire and Wiltshire. Busy services from Basingstoke, Guildford and Reading will be hit. \nSWT, which operates 1,700 services carrying 650,000 passengers a day making it the busiest commuter operator in Europe, warned the majority of its stations will have fewer services and some will have a queuing system just to get in. \nThe operator saidtrains and stations will be busier than usual especially during peak periods; \nAnd some journeys will take longer. \nDuring the August Bank Holliday – 25 to 28 August – 14 platforms will be closed adding even more delays and cancellations for those heading off or returning from holiday. \nThere will also be reduced and changed services on some weekends between April and October but details have yet to be finalised. \nPlatforms are being closed so they can be lengthened for longer trains. \nThe leaflets state: “During this time we will not be able to run as many services as usual. \n“There will be significant reductions in services for some stations and a small number will be closed. \n“The impact on your journey will vary depending on where and when you are travelling.” \nIt advises travelling from a different station and avoiding morning and evening peak periods.
