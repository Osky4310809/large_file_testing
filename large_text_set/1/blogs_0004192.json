The meeting came at a time there are speculations that Buhari may be considering some former governors for appointment in an imminent cabinet shakeup. Oshiomhole came out from the meeting that lasted about an hour at about 4.40pm. Although he did not grant interview, the ex-governor chatted informally with State House correspondents during which he said he decided to pay a thank you visit to the President after returning to the country from a foreign trip. He recalled that Buhari was in Edo State to inaugurate some projects about three days to the end of his administration as governor, saying it was only appropriate for him to come round to thank the President. Oshiomhole stated, “You guys know that the President was in Edo State about three days to the end of my administration to inaugurate some projects. “This is the first time we will be seeing since then because I have been out of the country. “Since I am back in the country, I decided that it is necessary for me to come and thank him for that visit. That is the basic reason why I am here.” Oshiomhole deliberately avoided making comments when his attention was called to the news doing the rounds that some former governors might be appointed as ministers soon. Buhari had, during his visit to Edo State in November, expressed the hope that the ruling All Progressives Congress would find another assignment for Oshiomhole at the federal level. He said it would mean wasting Oshiomhole’s energy if he was allowed to retire immediately after his tenure as a state governor. Buhari had said the country would be the loser if the APC failed to utilise “the people’s governor’s” wisdom, skill and energy. He had said, “It will be a pity to waste his (Oshiomhole’s) energy by him retiring. I hope there will be a higher assignment for him to do more for the nation. “I congratulate the governor for his hard work; Oshiomhole is a hard-working governor. We will need his services in Abuja. “Thank you for inviting me, most especially during this time in the country. “You have served two terms and you are about to leave. You deserve a place in history. I hope the APC will look for a place for you because your service for the country is far from over.” SGF not removed as new boards’ panel chair –Presidency Meanwhile, Buhari did not remove the embattled Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, as chairman of the presidential committee on the reconstitution of Federal Government boards of parastatals, agencies and commissions, The PUNCH learnt on Tuesday. It was further learnt that Buhari would not take any action against Lawal until the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), submitted his report on the investigations into alleged corrupt acts by some government officials. The President recently directed the AGF to investigate the SGF, the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Mr. Ibrahim Magu, among others. There was a report on Tuesday that the SGF had been removed as the chairman of the boards’ reconstitution committee and replaced with Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. Sources in the Presidency told our correspondent on Tuesday that Lawal had concluded his assignment. It was further learnt that the panel Osinbajo was presiding over was only a review committee that Buhari set up, based on the request of state governors, elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, and other stakeholders, calling for “more inclusiveness” in federal appointments. “To say that he (the SGF) had been removed as the chairman of the committee constituting federal boards is not true and is uncharitable,” one of the sources said. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, also told our correspondent that the SGF had not been sacked, adding that Lawal had completed the assignment given to him. The presidential spokesman said, “It is not true that the SGF has been removed from the committee. “I can confirm to you that the committee he headed has completed its job and submitted its report to the President. As we speak now, the report is in the Presidency. You do not sack somebody that has completed his job. “What happened was that the APC governors and party leadership showed interest in the appointments. They demanded further inclusiveness. “The President agreed. It was that request that called for a review and further action. The President therefore asked the Vice-President to do a review. “The Vice-President is joined by the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara; the APC leadership and one APC governor each from the six geopolitical zones.” The Senate had, on December 14, 2016, called for the removal and prosecution of the SGF following allegations that Lawal awarded contracts to firms where he had interests regarding some projects for the Internally Displaced Persons in the North-East. \\ Copyright PUNCH.
