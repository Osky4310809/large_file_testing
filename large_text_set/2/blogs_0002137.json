And now that Game of Thrones will be entering its second to last season in 2017, that’s more true than ever. So, SportsBettingExperts.com decided to poll fans of the HBO series to see who they think is most likely to die first in Season 7 of Game of Thrones . And really, the results aren’t that surprising.\nSportsBettingExperts.com asked 10,000 U.S. fans on Facebook who would be the first character to die on Game of Thrones next season . (Note: It’s not overall most likely, just first since there are bound to be plenty of deaths in Season 7.)\nThe definitive winner with 1,422 votes was none other than Theon Greyjoy . While 1,422 votes out of 10,000 doesn’t sound like a lot, the second place person was Melisandre with 802 votes, so Theon’s 14% of the vote is pretty decent.\nTheon has already dealt with an incredible amount of shit throughout the course of Game of Thrones , which is truly saying something. Theon might just be able to claim “most tortured person of Game of Thrones ” with Ramsay Bolton cutting off his penis and emotionally and physically abusing him for so long that he gave up his true identity for a while.\nSo, it’s only fitting that many fans just expect Theon to die. Plus, his character has majorly evolved over the course of the previous six seasons, which would make his death all the more poignant.\nWe might even shed a tear if Theon dies, which is not something we would have said back in Season 1. \nAnother factor for all the Theon votes may have to do with a Game of Thrones Season 7 spoiler (STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON’T WANT IT RUINED) that states that there will be an epic sea battle where good ole Uncle Euron captures either Theon or Yara.\nOf course, this poll was purely speculative and if Yara has anything to do about it, she surely won’t let her brother be the first death of Game of Thrones Season 7 . But as the series wraps up, it’s probably best if we just assume ALL of the characters we love will die to adequately prepare ourselves emotionally.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:37:26.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
