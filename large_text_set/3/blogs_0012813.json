The good morning is also a great exercise to perfect your form for a deadlift .\nHere's how to do a good morning — make sure you're activating that lower ab section (transverse abdominis) and keeping your core stable to protect your back.\nRelated:\nNo Equipment, No Gym, Just Calorie Burning — Let's Go!\nStand with your feet hip-width apart and place your hands on your hips (or at the back of your head) with your elbows opened wide. Pull your abs to your spine and keep your back neutral while pressing your butt backward, hinging at the hips, until your back is almost parallel to the floor. Keep a slight bend in your knees as you hinge forward. Return to standing, squeezing your glutes when you are upright to reset. This completes one rep. Repeat as many times as you can for 60 seconds.
