That normalizes the Trump presidency. \nInstead, there should be no vote on Gorsuch’s nomination until Trump’s legitimacy as a president is established. \nWhich means the Senate intelligence committee and the FBI must first conclude that Russian operatives were not responsible for Trump’s electoral victory, and Trump must reveal his taxes and put his assets into a blind trust. \nMitch McConnell wouldn’t even permit a vote on former President Barack Obama’s pick, Merrick Garland, on the ground that Obama’s term would end in 10 months. Here, we have a president whose term itself may not be legitimate. \nA Supreme Court pick is the most important nomination a president can make, affecting how the Constitution and laws are interpreted and potentially affecting generations to come. There should be no cloud over the legitimacy of the president who makes such a pick. \nDemocrats and courageous Republicans must not produce the 60-vote quorum needed to overcome a filibuster. When and if this strategy no longer works, it is imperative that senators continue to vote against consent orders to proceed with the nomination — until and unless Trump’s legitimacy is established. \nTrump is the issue here, as well as the integrity of our democracy.
