And his best friend, a Mike Wozowski doll from Disney’s Monsters, Inc., has been by his side for every single one, bringing him comfort and calming him down.\nBut during Ryan’s most recent procedure, his urologist, Dr. Travis Groth, noticed that Mike the monster was looking a little worse for wear. So, the doctor tried his hand at a stuffed-animal operation.\nPost-surgery, Groth re-assembled his surgical team, prepped the monster toy and proceeded with a surgical time-out to accurately identify the patient! Much to Ryan’s delight, he then successfully sutured Mike’s arm.\n“Both Ryan and Mike are recovering well at home,” a spokesperson from the hospital tells PEOPLE.\nChildren’s Hospital of Wisconsin A photo of Groth mid-procedure, posted to Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin’s Facebook page on December 28, has since garnered over 12,000 likes.\nNeed a little inspiration?

Nothing is more important than our friendship!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:01:33.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
