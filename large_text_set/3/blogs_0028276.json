Coates/Times Newspapers / News Syndication) New aerial images of the London terror attack show the moment killer Khalid Masood was shot by police. \nDramatic photographs from the scene show the terrorist sprawled on the floor after being shot in the chest.\nEverything we know about the London terror attack investigation Tragically, the images also show heroic officer Pc Keith Palmer after he was stabbed by the British-born jihadi.\nMasoon, who was born Adrian Russell Aja, was a 52-year-old Muslim convert.\nThis image shows Pc Palmer collapse after being stabbed (Picture: Sam Coates/Times Newspapers / News Syndication) The former English teacher was shot dead in the grounds of Westminster Palace after he drove across Westminster Bridge ploughing into pedestrians.\nMasood had previous convictions for assaults, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences.\nHe had not been convicted of any terrorism offences, Scotland Yard said.\nEverything we know about Khalid Masood Westminster attacker who has been named as Khalid Masood (Picture: PA) The Westminster attacker was born on Christmas Day and converted to Islam after years of criminality.\nThe attack Khalid Masood carried out was the end point of his evolution to extremist from the boy born in Kent.\nHe spent years moving round the country – and the prison system – with a host of different identities.\nHe was born to a single mother as Adrian Russell Ajao, but after a religious conversion years later, also called himself Khalid Choudry.\nMasood was also known as Adrian Elms but was using the name Khalid Masood at the time of the attack.\nHis criminal career dated back to 1983 and included convictions for assault, GBH and possession of an offensive weapon.\nThis led him to spend time behind bars at Lewes Prison in East Sussex, Wayland Prison in Norfolk and Ford open prison in West Sussex.\nBut he would later mask his life of crime with a CV which claimed he was an experienced English teacher who had worked across the world.\nThe document, seen by The Sun, lists Masood as a university-educated English teacher with experience working in places such as Saudi Arabia and Luton.\nIt is understood he never worked as a teacher in any of England’s state schools.\nWhen he died on the cobbles outside Parliament, he reportedly left behind three children and a wife.\nThe killer most recently appeared to be based in the West Midlands, but also spent time in London, Sussex and Luton.\nAfter his armed onslaught on Wednesday, police searched a three-storey townhouse in the Winson Green area of Birmingham and neighbours said Masood lived there for around seven months until December last year.\nWhat happened outside Parliament? Members of the emergency services work to help vicitms on Westminster Bridge, alongside the Houses of Parliament in central London on March 22, 2017, during an emergency incident (Picture: Getty) \nA massive police investigation is under way after a terror attack in central London.\nHere’s everything we know so far about the Westminster attack: \nFive people have died – a police officer, the attacker, a woman named as Aysha Frade, 43, US tourist Kurt Cochran and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes succumbed to his injuries in hospital a day after the attack.\nThe officer was Pc Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old husband and father with 15 years of police service.\nA minute’s silence was held at 9.33am to honour Palmer, whose police shoulder number was 933. \nTen people have been arrested and six addresses raided across London, Birmingham and elsewhere. One person has been released on police bail.\nThe woman was killed on Westminster Bridge as a number of pedestrians were mowed down by a grey Hyundai i40.\nIt is believed the man was also killed in the incident on the bridge.\nSeven people are in a critical condition, and 29 have been treated in hospital.\nOne woman ended up in the Thames and was treated for serious injuries after being pulled from the water.\nThe attacker, has been named as Khalid Masood by police, although he used several alias.\nArmed with two large knives, he jumped out of the car after smashing it into the railings encircling the Palace of Westminster, fatally stabbing Pc Palmer as he entered the grounds.\nHe was shot dead moments later by another officer.\nTheresa May told MPs he was a ‘peripheral’ figure, adding: ‘He was not part of the current intelligence picture.’\nTo see all of our coverage of the London terror attack click here. \nMore: UK Police search London terrorist attacker's mum's house \n'Burglar' dies after getting trapped in chemist roof space \nHow London Terror attack survivors got away from attacker Khalid Masood \nEverything we know about the London terror attack investigation \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:06:39.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
