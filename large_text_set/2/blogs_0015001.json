The battery capacity is expected to be between 3,000 to 3,200 mAh. \nCore components will be reused but cases will be newly made. \nSamsung earlier announced that 98 percent of the 3.06 million devices distributed to the market had been recalled. 200,000 of the units were used to find out the cause of the battery fires and Samsung expects there are 2.5 million units on standby, Hankyung said. \nSelling refurbished phones will also allow the firm to avoid paying a fine for environmental damages. Korea's environment ministry previously said it may levy a fine on the tech giant if the remaining stocks of Note 7s are not deposed properly. \nLast month, Samsung announced that faulty batteries were the cause of the debacle last year and stressed that there was nothing wrong with the phone itself.
