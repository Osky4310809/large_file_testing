HB 106 and 141 are both similar the transgender bathroom laws, and HB 127, just like SB 17 would allow federally funded colleges to discriminate. \nSince the election of Tea Party favorite Matt Bevin as the governor of the state and furthered by the election of President Donald Trump, states like Kentucky have felt emboldened to make such discriminatory moves seeing as how they know Attorney General Jeff Session, will do nothing to defend LGBTQ rights.
