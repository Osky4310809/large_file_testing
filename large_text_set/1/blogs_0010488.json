Check out our complete guide to Facebook Ads here and learn all you need to get started . \n\n\nHow to navigate this guide There’s a lot of different types of Facebook Ads! And the design specs are always changing. If you want to know what size images or videos to use for each type of Facebook ad, or how much text you have to play with, you’re in the right place.\nWith these recommendations, you’ll be able to design ads that look great no matter where they appear on Facebook – whether it’s in the desktop or mobile news feed, or the right sidebar.\nWe’ll be keeping this post up-to-date with the latest ad specs and recommendations. If you notice anything that’s out of date, let us know in the comments! We’ll keep an eye out and update the post (and give you a shoutout! )\nTo make it easier to find the specs you’re looking for, we’ve broken this guide down by the 5 Facebook Ad types. Here’s where to find any info you might need:\n\n \n\nFacebook Ad Objectives, Types, and Placements Before we jump into the meat of this post — the specs for each type of Facebook Ad — I first wanted to share a little context about the various objectives, ad types, and placements you can use with Facebook Ads.\nObjectives Facebook offers 15 objectives for ads, which are split into three categories:\nAwareness: Objectives that generate interest in your product or service Consideration: Objectives that get people to start thinking about your business and looking for more information about it Conversion: Objectives that encourage people who are interested in your business to purchase or use your product or service \nOnce you select an objective for your advert, you’ll be guided through the process of creating your ad and get to choose one of five ad types to serve to your target audience.\nAd Types Facebook offers 5 different types of ads to choose from:\nSingle image: Create up to 6 variations of your ad using 1 image Single video: Create an ad with one video Carousel: Create an ad with 2 – 10 scrollable images or videos Slideshow: Create a looping video ad with up to 10 images Canvas: Tell a more immersive story by combining images and videos into a full-screen, interactive experience \nNote: The ad types available will vary based on the objective you selected in the previous step.\nAfter you’ve picked an ad type, the next step is to choose where you want your ad to show up.\nAd Placements Ad placements determine where your ad will be shown. You can run Facebook ads in the mobile News Feed, desktop News Feed, desktop right column, and you can also choose to have your ads appear on Instagram.\n\nNote: The ad placements available will vary based on the objective and ad type you chose in the previous steps.\nOnce you’ve decided what kind of ad you want to run and where you want it to be displayed, the next step is to put together the creative – the images, videos and copy for your advert.\nLet’s jump in!\n\n\nCreate the perfect Facebook Ad: Design specs for the 5 ad types In the following sections, my goal is to give you an all-in-one guide to Facebook Ad specs and content sizes for 2017.\nSo if you want to set up a carousel add, how big should your image be? Or if you want to run a video ad, what’s the best size for the thumbnail image? And how much text do you have to play with?\nThe specs are always evolving! And the following recommendations will help to ensure the photos and videos you use in your ads will look great everywhere in Facebook \n \n\n1. Single image ad specs The single image ad type is one of the most versatile types of ad, as you can use this ad type with every objective except for video views.\nHere’s an example of what a single image ad looks like in action:\n\nAnd here are the recommended design specs:\nImage specs Image size: 1,200 x 628 pixels Image ratio: 1.91:1 Copy Text: 90 characters Headline: 25 characters Link description: 30 characters If you want your ad to get the most distribution and exposure, Facebook recommends using images that contain minimal (or no) overlaid text.\nEdge cases There are two objectives that have slightly different design specs for this ad type: promote your page and app engagement. Here are the differences in their specs:\nPromote your page: \nImage size: 1,200 x 444 pixels Image ratio: 8:3 Increase app engagement: \nImage ratio: 16:9  \nIf you plan on using an image in a carousel , slideshow , or canvas ad , Facebook recommends using different image dimensions than the specs outlined above. Check out the respective sections to make sure you’re using the right design specs!\n \n\n2. Single video ad specs This ad type is amazing because it let’s you use video to tell an even more engaging story with your content. And you can run video ads with every objective except for product catalog promotion.\nHere’s an example of what a single video ad looks like:\n\nAnd here are the recommended video specs:\nVideo specs Video format: .MOV or .MP4 files are ideal ( Here’s a complete list of supported video formats ) Aspect ratio: 16:9 ( Here’s a complete list of supported aspect ratios ) Resolution: at least 720p File size: 2.3 GB max Facebook length: 60 minutes max Instagram length: 60 seconds max Thumbnail image size: 1,200 x 675 pixels Thumbnail image ratio: Should match the aspect ratio of your video Caption length text: Text only, max 2,200 characters Copy Text: 90 characters Headline: 25 Characters Link description: 30 characters And if you’re interested in the technical video requirements (like video compression, audio specs, frame rate, bitrate, and all of the supported aspect ratios), I highly recommend checking out this guide provided by Facebook .\n \n\n3. Carousel ad specs The carousel ad type allows you to run up to 10 images, videos, or slideshows in one ad, all linked to different pages – and your audience can scroll through the media on their device. Pretty cool, eh?\nFor a breakdown of how to set up carousel ads, check out our ultimate guide to Facebook carousel ads and learn all you need to get started . \nHere’s a quick example of a Carousel ad:\n\nAnd here’s example of a mobile carousel ad in action:\n\nYou can use this ad type with every objective except for: boost your posts, promote your page, reach people near your business, raise attendance at your event, and get video views.\nHere are the recommended design specs for your carousel ads:\nImage specs Image size: 1,080 x 1,080 pixels Image ratio: 1:1 (square) Copy Text: 90 characters Headline: 40 characters Description: 20 characters If you want your ad to get the most distribution and exposure, Facebook recommends using images that contain minimal (or no) overlaid text.\nVideo specs Format: .MOV or .MP4 files Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square) Resolution: at least 720p File size: 2.3 GB max Facebook length: 60 minutes max Instagram length: 60 seconds max Thumbnail image size: 1,080 x 1,080 pixels Thumbnail image ratio: Should match the aspect ratio of your video If you’re interested in all of the technical video requirements (like video compression, audio specs, frame rate, bitrate, and all of the supported aspect ratios), check out this guide provided by Facebook. \nNote : If you want to run a carousel ad using the video views objective, you’ll only be able to use videos in your ad. And if you’re using the the app engagement & offer claim objectives, Facebook will only allow you to use images in your carousel ads.\n \n\n4. Slideshow ad specs The slideshow ad type allows you to create a looping video advert with up to 10 images. And they’re available for every objective except for product catalog promotion.\nHere’s an example of how a slideshow ad works:\n\nAnd these are the recommended ad specs:\nSlideshow specs Image size: 1,280 x 720 pixels Image ratio: 16:9, 1:1 or 2:3 Video upload format: .MOV or .MP4 file types Copy Text: 90 characters Headline: 25 characters Description: 30 characters Try to use images that are all the same dimensions.

Get the Most Out of the Slideshow Format  \n\n5. Canvas ad specs Canvas is the newest ad type. It’s only available on mobile, it allows you to create highly engaging mobile ads, and you can use this ad type with six objectives:\nBoost your posts Increase brand awareness Increase your reach Send people to a destination on or off Facebook Get video views Increase conversions on your website. At first glance, when you see it in the mobile News Feed it looks quite similar to all the other ad types. Here’s an example of what a canvas ad looks like on the timeline:\n\nBut when people tap on the canvas ad, it opens up and they’re taken into an immersive, full-screen experience where they can interact with your branded content – with the option to exit out of the ad at any time, of course \nHere’s a quick example of what a canvas ad looks like in action (you can check out more examples here on Facebook’s Canvas site ):\n\n\nThe Canvas ad components Canvas ads are made up of a variety of multimedia components, including:\nAd unit Photos Tilt-to-pan images Video Carousel Text block Buttons Header Here’s a quick visual summary of all the components that can go into a Canvas ad:\n\nYou don’t have to use every component, and you can pick and choose which ones you’d like to include in your canvas.\nYou’ll also need to provide creative for the ad unit that appears in the mobile News Feed.\nAnd in the following sections, we’ll dive into the design specs for all of the Canvas components:\n\nAd unit (what people will see in the mobile News Feed) The canvas ad unit is the part of the ad that people will see in their mobile News Feed. Here’s what it looks like:\n\nYou can either use an image or a video for this part of the ad. Here are the recommended specs:\nText: 90 characters Headline: 45 characters Description: 30 characters Image size: 1,200 x 628 pixels Image ratio: 1.9:1 Video format: .MOV or .MP4 file types Video aspect ratio: 16:9 or 1:1 For more details about video technical requirements, check out this guide provided by Facebook .\n\nPhotos A canvas photo is a full-screen image that uses the entire width of the screen by default. Here’s an example of how it looks:\n\nCanvas photos have three image sizing options – each of which have different recommended specs:\n\nHere are the design specs for each of the sizing options:\nImage size: Fit to width ( linkable): image width of 1,080 pixels Fit to width ( tap to expand): minimum image height of 1,080 pixels Fit to height ( tilt to pan): image height of 1,920 pixels Image ratio: Images use the full width of the screen by default File type: .PNG and .JPG Number of photos: up to 20 photos can be used in a Canvas Facebook describes Canvas photo sizes like this :\nA full width image is 1,080 pixels, but you can use wider images if you select the fit to height (tilt to pan) display option. A full-height image is 1,920 pixels high, but you can use a taller image if you select the fit to width (tap to expand) display option\nAnd if you’re interested in the tilt-to-pan option, I’ll share more details about it in the next section.\n\nTilt-to-pan images With the tilt-to-pan option you can upload photos that are wider than the mobile device, and people can tilt their phone to rotate the image from side to side.\nHere’s what it looks like in action:\n\nAnd here are the image specs for a tilt-to-pan photo:\nImage height: 1,920 pixels Image width: between 3,240 and 5,400 px (which is 3-5x the width of the screen) Image ratio: Images use the full width of the screen by default File type: .PNG and .JPG Number of photos: up to 20 photos can be used in a Canvas \nVideo The video component of Canvas allows you to incorporate engaging video clips alongside the rest of your branded content – to create an experience that’s never been possible quite like this before.\nHere’s what a video looks like in a Canvas ad:\n\nAnd here are the Canvas video specs:\nFormat: .MOV or .MP4 file type Length: keep the collective run time of all videos in the Canvas under 2 minutes total Resolution: at least 720p Orientation: portrait (landscape-oriented videos will automatically resize to portrait) Thumbnail: this will be the first frame of the video We also recommend using captions – that way people can still engage with your video, even if they don’t have their audio turned on.\n\nCarousel This component allows you to upload 2-10 images and show them in a carousel format. Each item in the carousel can be linked to a different page, and people can scroll left and right on their mobile device to interact with them.\nHere’s an example of what the carousel component looks like in a Canvas ad:\n\nHere are all the design specs for putting together a carousel component in Canvas:\nImage size: 1,080 pixels (maximum width) x 1,920 pixels (maximum height) Image ratio: Images can be full or partial height, but all images should be the same size File type: .PNG or .JPG Number of images: 10 images per carousel max Try to use the same dimensions for all the images you upload into your carousel. If your images are different sizes, they’ll get cropped to match your first image.\nAlso, keep in mind that images in carousels use the full width of the screen by default.\n\nText block A text block is exactly what it sounds like You can use this component to create a block of text to help add context to your ad and tell people more about your product or brand.\nHere’s what a text block looks like in Canvas:\n\nAnd here are the ad specs to make sure your text blocks look great in Canvas:\nText: 500 characters max Font size: 6 point up to 72 point Font color: #rrggbb Font style: Bold, italic or underlined (must be applied to the entire text block, not individual words) Font alignment: Left, center or right Font options: Serif or Sans Serif \nButtons Each Canvas ad has to have at least 1 call-to-action button included in it, linking to an external URL that you’d like to send visitors to.\nThe Canvas editor makes it super easy to whip up CTA buttons in a snap!
