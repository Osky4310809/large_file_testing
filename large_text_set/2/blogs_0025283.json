With a price tag starting from Rs. 47.50 lakh going up to 60.5 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), Jag's latest launch somewhat sweetly priced at least for starters. \nThe made in India Jaguar XF will be available in a 2.0l Ingenium diesel engine with a power output of 132 kW, and a 2.0l petrol engine with a power output of 177 kW. The new XF will be available in three variants: Pure, Prestige, and Portfolio, in both diesel and petrol options. \nThe mean machine will also come with a slew of advanced tech features including InControl Touch Pro with a 25.9 cm touchscreen infotainment system and a Meridian Sound System. \nWhile there’s no complaint regarding the British Jaguar Land Rover imported cars, barring the ridiculously hefty import duties of course, we’re definitely happier with the XF now being actually produced in India. All said and done, there’s nothing quite like flashing a beast that’s a power machine, and proudly bears the ‘Made in India’ tag. \nManaging director and president of Jaguar Land Rover India, was quoted saying: “Since its introduction in 2009, the Jaguar XF has gained immense popularity and success in the country. The introduction of the all-new Jaguar XF into our locally manufactured portfolio reiterates our commitment to the Indian market.” \nThe Jaguar range in India (and we see the number of them on Indian roads steadily increasing) includes the imported F-TYPE starting at Rs. 1.25 crore, the locally manufactured XJ starting at Rs. 99.99 lakh, the F-PACE priced at Rs. 68.40 lakh, and the locally manufactured XE starting at Rs. 39.9 lakh (all ex-showroom Delhi prices). \nAnd now you can book the brand new Indian Jaguar XF across 24 authorised Jag retail outlets in India.
