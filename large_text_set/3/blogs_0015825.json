This file photo shows members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters in their camp in Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Maguindanao in September 2012. File photo by Jeoffrey Maitem/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines – The Philippine military has used aircraft and artillery to attack a group of extremists who were learning how to make improvised explosive devices, a spokesman said Sunday, March 19. \nThe attacks between March 13 and 16 were a severe blow to fighters of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), some of whose members have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS) group, said Brigadier General Restituto Padilla. \n\"The target was completely destroyed,\" he told Agence France-Presse following assaults by planes, helicopter gunships, and artillery in the southern island of Mindanao. \nThere were no civilians in the area during the attack, he said. \nForeign and local extremists were meeting in a BIFF enclave in the southern province of Maguindanao when the attack was launched, Padilla said, declining to say where the foreigners had come from. \nHe cited intelligence sources as saying 21 extremists were killed and 26 wounded, although no bodies were recovered. \nMuslim rebels often carry away their dead and wounded. \nFive completed improvised explosive devices were recovered along with bomb-making manuals and materials, the military said. \nTroops are still tracking down the remnants of the BIFF group, Padilla said. \nMuslim rebels have waged a separatist insurgency in the south of the mainly Catholic Philippines since the 1970s, with the conflict claiming more than 120,000 lives. \nWhile the major rebel organizations have for years observed a ceasefire as part of peace efforts, breakaway factions like the BIFF and other Muslim gangs still engage in bombings and kidnappings. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
