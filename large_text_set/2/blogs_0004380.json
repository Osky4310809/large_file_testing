A legend of the game, Henry conquered the international stage with France. \nHe won the World Cup in 1998 before adding a European Championship medal to his collection two years later. He was part of the France side that reached another World Cup final in 2006, losing to Italy in a penalty shoot-out. \nNow, the student becomes the teacher and he’s working with an exceptional class. Belgium’s Golden Generation have failed to achieve much of note yet but their potential is clear for all to see. The squad is packed with world class talent: Courtois, Vertonghen, Alderweireld, Witsel, Hazard, Dembele, De Bruyne and Mertens to name but a few. The Lawyer \nHenry was impressed by the quality of the players as well as their thirst for knowledge. One player sticks out in particular: “All the Red Devils want to learn. I call Romelu the lawyer. He discusses everything, even his socks. \n“It’s important that people know that because sometimes they think the younger generation doesn’t care enough. \n“What does he need to improve? Everything should be even better. But he’s young. He’ll keep getting better.” Loading tags...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:36:23.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
