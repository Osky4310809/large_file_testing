It's not really strange for him to be feuding with ANYONE anymore!\nThe President's latest beef is with Snoop Dogg after the rapper dropped a music video for his track Lavender , in which he kinda shoots the POTUS in effigy.\nTechnically, he fires a toy gun at a clown named \"Ronald Klump,\" but the implication is clear.\nRelated: Justice Department Asks For More Time Regarding Trump's Wiretap Claims! \nNow, since we know Drumpf already isn't a fan of the \"freedom of the press\" part of the First Amendment, we're guessing the whole speech thing is up in the air too.\nWell, his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen , took to TMZ to say: \n\"It's totally disgraceful, Snoop owes the president an apology. There's absolutely nothing funny about an assassination attempt on a president.\nI'm really shocked at him, because I thought he was better than that. I'm not really sure I understand the artistic value to having somebody dressed up as Trump and firing a weapon at him.\"\nCohen added:\n\"In all fairness, it's not funny. It's not artistic. If you have a protest, that's fine. Make your point… Just because you want to hide behind the guise of artistic capabilities or artistic freedom of speech doesn't make it right, and Snoop knows that. And he played very close to the line here\"\nHmm. We heard reproach there but no legal threat. Plus he said it to TMZ — not exactly official legal channels. Not to mention he is busy as hell these days.\nRelated: Trump Facing Defamation Lawsuit From Former Apprentice & Sexual Assault Accuser \nSo we're guessing Snoop is legally in the clear.\nIn case you thought he was worried, here's what Snoop posted on Instagram afterward:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:22:24.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
