I would love to tell my doctor or the IRS that they are fake news, likely around the time they’re taking everything I used to own. \nRex Tillerson also gets a closer look in this segment , putting more spotlight on his past relationship with Vladimir Putin and the humorous aspects of his testimony in front of Congress. If you don’t want to answer a question, I think Tillerson has it figured out. Play dumb at all times until you’re confronted and then just go with a mix of the truth and your lie. Seems like the perfect skill for a future Secretary of State. \n(Via Late Night )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T07:48:35.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
