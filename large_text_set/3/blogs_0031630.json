In the speech, Clinton specifically mentioned Ryan, along with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) who was mocked Tuesday by Fox News host Bill O’Reilly for her “James Brown hair.” \n“Too many women, especially women of color, have had a lifetime of practice, taking precisely these kinds of indignities in stride,” Clinton said. Bill O’Reilly and Sean Spicer beware: @HillaryClinton just called out sexist, racist attacks on Maxine Waters and April Ryan. pic.twitter.com/xEVQ5PxSj7 \n— Deep South Daily (@DeepSouthDaily) March 29, 2017 \nLet’s be clear about one thing: In no way, shape, or form am I dismissing or belittling the very real struggle of women and minorities in this country throughout its history. But, what I am saying is that the liberal, knee-jerk reaction to label anyone who disagrees with a woman or a minority individual as “sexist” or “racist” is, at best, misinformed, and at worst, intentionally divisive. \nSpicer has served in his current position for just more than two months, but in the relatively short time span, he has already had plenty of cut-throat exchanges with reporters. But this type of brash, no-holds-barred approach shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone considering the unique personality of Spicer’s boss: President Donald Trump. \nIf one pays any attention to the hours upon hours of White House press briefings so far during the Trump administration, they quickly see that Ryan is in good company when being treated like a child during televised briefings. In fact, just recently, Spicer told ABC News’ Jonathan Karl, a white male, to “calm down” as Karl kept pressing for answers. I don’t recall anyone calling Spicer “racist” or “sexist” then. \nI can only imagine the comments there would have been had Spicer told a female reporter, especially a black female reporter, the same thing. \nBut I digress. \nLet’s not forget the time Spicer accused CNN reporter Jim Acosta of being “cute.” And that other time when Spicer accused Karl of the same. \nThen, just over the weekend, Politico reporter Tara Palmeri tweeted in the wake of the Republicans’ failure to garner enough votes to pass the American Health Care Act, that “source close to @POTUS says he being advised to replace @Reince45 [White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus] and is open to possibility — health care was last straw.” Source close to @POTUS says he's being advised to replace @Reince45 & is open to possibility — healthcare was last straw \n— Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) March 25, 2017 \nSpicer took issue with he said was a false report, calling Palmeri “an idiot with no real sources.” \nThe point is, Spicer — and just about anyone serving in the Trump administration for that matter — could care less about the gender or race of the people they insult. What this administration does care about is detracting attention from the real stories of the day by creating these relatively minor and unimportant media spectacles. \nLove it or hate it, it’s a trick that has worked for Trump since he first announced his bid for the presidency in June 2015. And, thanks to many of the same reporters who often criticize Trump and his administration for their distractions, these types of tactful diversions will continue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:18:28.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
