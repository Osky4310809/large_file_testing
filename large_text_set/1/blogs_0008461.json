I got the flashlight out on my phone and I immediately knew the earring was there because it was sparkling in his poo.” Pooch Vinnie had to let nature take its course... the earring was recovered after a few days (Photo: cascadenews.co.uk) \nHe’d taken Vinnie to Parkside Vets, Dundee, but despite making him sick to try to retrieve it, nothing was found. \nKevin, 30, said: “They couldn’t do anything else, as Vinnie is so small, so we just had to keep an eye on him. Kevin called Vinnie a little 'menace' (Photo: cascadenews.co.uk) \n”We’ll just have to keep a close eye on him in the future, as he’s a wee menace - he’s always looking for the next thing to steal.” \nBecca Cunningham, from Parkside Vets, said: “I’ve been at Parkside for seven years and I’ve never come across diamond earrings being swallowed - Vinnie obviously has expensive tastes.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T09:14:35.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
