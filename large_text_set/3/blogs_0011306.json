Then a decision will be made.\" \nVarela also revealed why he had opted to spend another season out on loan, having played for Real Madrid Castilla under Zinedine Zidane during the 2014-15 season. \n\"I talked to Jose Mourinho and we talked about my future and what would be best for me,\" he added. \nRUMOURS: Man Utd plot Alexis move \n\"He was very sincere towards me. He told me my playing time would be little so my decision was that I preferred to go. \n\"A player needs to play and this is what I'm looking for and this is what I sought here in Frankfurt.\" \nVarela spent time training with Manchester United last summer before heading to Frankfurt and was impressed with Mourinho’s methods. \nKlopp: We could miss Champions League \n\"I really learnt a lot from the way he trained - the ball was always in the centre of the exercises,\" he explained \n\"The relationship was very good and I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe I expected his character when he is confronted with the press, but that was definitely not the case. \n\"He's always asking how everyone feels, making no difference between Rooney or a player who has just come up. He was always joking and ensuring he had a good connection between everyone and himself.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T10:18:09.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
