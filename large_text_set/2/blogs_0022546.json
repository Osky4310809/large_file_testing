Getty Images Claudio Ranieri has been sacked by Leicester following a horrible campaign Tony Cottee speaks on the shock of Leicester City sacking manager Claudio Ranieri \nLess than 24 hours before, Leicester's 2-1 Champions League defeat against Sevilla was seen as some as the 'turning point' in their season. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Leicester news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nHowever that view wasn't shared by the Thai hierarchy who had seen enough of Leicester's dreadful performances this season under the 65-year-old. \nSo where did it all go wrong for the so-called Tinkerman? Reuters Claudio Ranieri will be waving goodbye after his heroics last season Tinkerman fails to tinker \nRanieri built a growing reputation for keeping his opposing managers guessing his team selection and tactics. \nLast season Ranieri found a winning formula which he rightly trusted into the new campaign. Getty Images Claudio Ranieri failed to adapt his tactics after his opponents worked out how to beat them \nHowever teams had worked out a way how to deal with their previously lethal counter-attacking football. \nTheir opponents would drop deeper, allowing Jamie Vardy little space in behind the back four. \nThey also nullified the threat of Riyad Mahrez and Danny Drinkwater leaving Ranieri scratching his head on how to get the better of his opponents. Getty Images 9 Riyad Mahrez has cut a frustrated figure for the majority of the campaign \nAnd although Ranieri altered his team-sheet to try and find a winning side, he made a costly mistake as his tactics became too predictable. Kan't replace N'Golo Kante \nThe departure of N'Golo Kante exposed the defensive weaknesses of centre-backs Wes Morgan and Robert Huth. \nThe defensive duo have been nothing short of a shambles this season but they had little protection in front of them. AP:Associated Press 9 Claudio Ranieri failed to replace N'Golo Kante who was the linchpin in their midfield \nRanieri tried to replace Kante with summer signing Nampalys Mendy but the Frenchman is a shadow of the now Chelsea enforcer. \nInjuries have hampered his season but even when fit, Ranieri lost faith with the 24-year-old limiting him to just four league starts. \nLeicester were averaging 22.9 tackles per game last season compared to just 16.2 this time around. PA:Press Association Nampalys Mendy hasn't cut the mustard after joining in the summer Loss of appetite and desire \nRanieri effectively couldn't motivate his players anymore. \nAfter lifting the title what more could have been achieved in domestic football for a club of Leicester's size? Reuters 9 Leicester's players had lost all their hunger and desire following their previous success \nThe players had quickly realised that they were playing on past glory and all the energy that was required to be crowned champions was sucked out of them. \nThere was no motivation for the Foxes to achieve anything special because they had already pulled off a miracle. Big Egos \nReports in February suggested that Ranieri had become increasinly distant from his group of stars. \nHis tactics and managerial decisions left the players scratching their heads at times. \nThe Italian publicly fell out with striker Leonardo Ulloa over his refusal to let him join Sunderland in January which should have provided a huge hint to the relationship with his other players. Reuters Leonardo Ulloa admitted he feels 'betrayed' after Claudio Ranieri blocked his move to Sunderland \nHis team lost faith in the manager and the boss was quickly losing faith with his players. \nJamie Vardy's goalscoring heroics last season encouraged the England striker to create a movie about himself but his head was stuck on the film set rather than the football pitch. Great expectations \nPeople often forget that Leicester looked all-but doomed before their title winning season. \nOnly an extraordinary run of results kept them in the Premier League before that run continued into the following season. PA:Press Association Expectations were massively raised at Leicester - but the team crumbled under them N'Golo Kante 'attacked' by former manager Claudio Ranieri in Leicester tunnel \nNobody was expecting Leicester to challenge yet again but there was no reason why the Foxes couldn't mount for a top six spot in the league. \nExpectations grew from the board and supporters and players became complacent in their performances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:27:06.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
