You may be looking for the episode or the Farmworld version . \nFinn Mertens (full title: Finn the Human , or formerly known as Pen in the original short ) is the main protagonist of the series Adventure Time . Contents Background Margaret finds Finn and adopts him. \nAs revealed in \" The Visitor \" by Finn's biological father, Martin , Finn was supposedly born in a \"banana boat\" in the middle of the ocean where he nearly fell prey to a host of sea-creatures (and a tiger, by Martin's recollection). However, since Martin seems to be confused when recalling Finn's birth, it is uncertain whether or not his memory is accurate. \nAs shown in \" Memories of Boom Boom Mountain ,\" Finn appears to have been abandoned in the woods during infancy. He reveals that he made \"boom boom\" (Finn's word for defecation) on a large leaf and fell on it. He lay there crying until Jake 's parents, Joshua and Margaret , rescued him from the wilderness and brought him to their home . They raised him alongside Jake, who, along with Jermaine , became Finn's adopted brother. \nIt is revealed in \" Susan Strong ,\" that Finn knows nothing of his human parents or any other humans . In \" Henchman ,\" Finn states that Jake told him that he originated from a cabbage as a joke. However, Finn later learns about his biological father, Martin, in the episode \" Billy's Bucket List .\" Status as the last human Main article: Humans \nFinn was, for a long time the only confirmed human in the Land of Ooo . The reason for this is revealed in the episode \" Her Parents ,\" as Lady Rainicorn 's dad believed that humans were extinct. \nUp until \" Susan Strong ,\" Finn believes he has never met another human and becomes morose and \"soul-searchy\" when he thinks about it. However, Finn encounters Susan Strong a member of a tribe of mutants called Hyoomans . However, in \" Beautopia ,\" it is hinted that Susan Strong is unlike the rest of her tribe and may potentially be another human. In \" Dark Purple ,\" Susan removes her hat and reveals she is a human with a device on her head, making her a cyborg. \nIn \" Billy's Bucket List ,\" Finn is told by a deceased Billy that his father, Martin, is still alive and is trapped in the Crystal Citadel . This prompts Finn to go there to free his father in \" Escape from the Citadel ,\" making him one of four known humans in existence. \nAlthough various other humanoids exist in the Land of Ooo, most have been confirmed by the show's creator, Pendleton Ward , to be mutants , such as Penny , Phil or the Old Man Henchman . [ citation needed ] According to Pendleton Ward's FAQ page, even Finn is mutated in some way. [1] It is not until season 7's finale, \" Preboot \", that the myth of the status of Finn as the last human is completely dispelled. Appearance and equipment Finn's hands have five digits in \" His Hero \" when he makes air quotes while saying \"pooping.\" \nFinn is a teenaged human. He was roughly five feet tall at the show's debut, but sometime between \" The Cooler \" and \" The Pajama War ,\" he underwent a growth spurt and is currently almost the height of Princess Bubblegum. He is missing several teeth due to his habit of biting trees and rocks among other things. [ citation needed ] \nAlthough his eyes typically lack detail and appear as small black dots, they are shown to have color in \" The Enchiridion! \" while Finn is under going Dark Magician 's trials. His left eye is green while his right eye is blue, characteristic of the genetic condition heterochromia. However, as stated by lead character designer Andy Ristaino , \"That was a special occasion. The heterochromatic effect was a byproduct of him being hypnotized by that guardian dude.\" He went on to confirm that both of Finn's eyes are blue. [ citation needed ] \nFinn's weight seems to fluctuate between episodes, with him seeming chubbier in some instances than others. Pendleton Ward stated on the \"In Your Footsteps\" commentary on the Season 4 DVD that his weight depends on how active he is adventuring, along with his diet, so it often changes. \nIn \" Escape from the Citadel ,\" Finn's right arm is actually torn off, and then coated by the blood of a Citadel Guardian , which grows a small flower. He later got his arm back in the episode, \" Breezy ,\" where the flower stub matured into a tree and broke away like a cocoon, revealing a new limb, with a green thorn protruding from the palm. This thorn was later revealed in \" The Comet \" to be part of the Grass Sword sticking out from his skin, as his new arm was made of grass. Hair Finn revealing his long hair \nFinn has blonde hair which is first seen in \" To Cut a Woman's Hair ,\" where Finn removes his hat, and long, golden locks of hair flows out. His hair has a glowing sheen and extended his body length, until he cuts it off and gives it to the Tree Witch . His hair slowly begins to regrow throughout several episodes until \" Another Way \" where it has grown to his shoulders. By \" The Lich ,\" Finn has grown his hair slightly longer than in its appearance in previous episodes. However, in the episode \" Davey ,\" Finn has shaves off almost all of his hair for the second time so he can disguise himself as 'Davey', but begins to regrow it in \" Little Dude ,\" and the episodes after it. In \" Puhoy ,\" an adult Finn is shown to have grown facial hair and his hair become curly although since that part of the episode was a daydream it may not be 100% accurate. In \" May I Come In? \", Finn's long hair is shown to have grown back to around the length it was in \"To Cut a Woman's Hair\", when Finn takes of his hat while acting as bait to lure out The Hierophant . Clothing Main article: Finn's hat \nFinn typically wears a munsell blue (\"color #0093AF\") t-shirt, denim shorts, a two-colored lime green circular backpack, rolled-down white socks, and a pair of black shoes. Finn's most prominent attire is a white hat with two \"ears\" (which Joshua calls \"nubs\") sticking out on top that covers his entire head minus his face. The hat is inspired by a character called Bueno , a bear from a Pendleton Ward comics. Finn can occasionally be seen in variations of his standard outfit. In \" Ocean of Fear ,\" his footwear appears to be black booties with white cuffs. In \" It Came from the Nightosphere ,\" Finn has a small pocket sewn onto his shirt that he carries Jake in. This appears again in \"Davey\" where he uses it to hide Jake while Finn steals the keys from the guards as he breaks the former out of jail. During \" In Your Footsteps ,\" the Bear wears Finn's clothes, which suggests that Finn has multiple sets of the same outfit, including his hat. However, in \" Little Dude ,\" when Finn's hat comes to life and is set free, Jake tells Finn, \"Okay, let's go skin an evil bear,\" which may imply that Finn only had one hat. \nAside from his normal outfit, Finn can be seen wearing a cream-yellow sweater in colder areas such as the Ice Kingdom but currently wears his pink sweater made by Princess Bubblegum. In \" Holly Jolly Secrets Part II ,\" he wears a dark blue sweater with Christmas decorations on it and a green scarf. Finn also wears white briefs that make their first appearance in \" City of Thieves \" when Penny steals his shorts at the end of the episode. In \"Who Would Win,\" he was shown to wear a different pair with red elastic. Finn sleeps in red footie pajamas that appear in many episodes, but in the animated short, he sleeps in a red sleeping bag in his regular clothes. In the series, the sleeping bag is beige. Weapons Main article: Finn's swords Finn's first sword \nFinn has had a total of five major swords, plus temporary borrowed ones. (1) He originally favored Scarlet, the Golden Sword . After being first turned into a 4-D Sword and then destroyed by a black hole in \" The Real You ,\" (2) Finn is shown using the Root Sword (having a pink/silver blade and a red, twisted \"root\" handle) as seen in \" Mystery Train .\" Along with this sword, his backpack has a new side strap that can hold the sword while walking. (3) In \" Dad's Dungeon ,\" Finn and Jake venture into Joshua's dungeon , built by Joshua to toughen Finn up. There, Finn retrieves the Demon Sword , which uses now as primary weapon. (4) After being first turned into the Grape Sword and then forced to destroy it in \" Play Date ,\" he replaces his weapon with the Grass Sword , as seen in \" Blade of Grass .\" However, this too was lost, along with his right arm, after Finn's encounter with his father in \" Escape from the Citadel .\" There have been a number of other swords used by Finn, but all were used only for a short period of time. (5) After Finn's grass sword was destroyed, he acquired the Finn Sword in \" Is That You? \" It was created by interacting with an alternate Finn from the past, creating a paradox. Finn uses this sword first in \" Dentist .\" Main article: Finn's crossbows \nIn \" Conquest of Cuteness ,\" Finn was shown to have a crossbow. He uses a different one in \" The New Frontier ,\" although it appears he is less proficient with them than with his swords. Personality and traits \nAlthough at times violent and aggressive, Finn is a brave and righteous boy. His aspirations to become a great hero makes him somewhat of a moral sheriff in the Land of Ooo, as he is willing to help and protect any innocent person or creature. Finn has a very strong sense of responsibility and becomes upset when he is unable to help others. Due to this and being somewhat simple-minded, Finn often feels conflicted when it is unclear whether something is good or evil as exemplified by his dealings with Marceline in the episode \" Henchman .\" Despite his heroic nature, Finn also takes a liking to a \"normal life\" without any recognition or praise for being a hero and demonstrates this in \"Davey.\" Finn after losing his arm \nFinn is also almost incapable of doing anything evil or unjust, and will struggle greatly against doing such things, as seen in several episodes such as taking part in thievery in \"City of Thieves\" or killing a neutrally aligned ant in \" The Enchiridion! .\" However, Finn undergoes a slight change in \" Wake Up \" after he realizes that his father, whom he had high hopes of being a great hero, is nothing more than a selfish criminal. This, coupled with the loss of his favorite arm and sword due to his father's selfishness, pushes Finn to the point of wanting revenge. This is shown in \" The Tower ,\" where he attempts to go into space by building up a tower so that he could find his father, punch him, and take his arm. However, in the end, Finn learns to control his feelings of revenge with the help of Princess Bubblegum. \nWhile he portrays himself as a rough and tough hero, Finn has a tender side that is capable of love and compassion, as shown by his boyhood crush on Princess Bubblegum and his brotherly relationship with Jake. Finn is also able to act like a gentleman when it comes to ladies. However, Finn seems to hate romantic scenes to the point of vomiting as seen in \" Go With Me .\" However, Finn demonstrates growth in accepting romance and physical love as he willingly kisses Princess Bubblegum in \" Too Young \" and his latest ex-girlfriend, Flame Princess, in \" Burning Low .\" His tolerance is seen again near the end of \" Dream of Love ,\" as he is no longer disgusted by Tree Trunks and Mr. Pigs' passionate kissing. Finn's care for his friends makes him very protective of them as demonstrated when Tree Trunks almost gets killed in the episode \" Tree Trunks \" and Jake in \" The New Frontier .\" Overall, Finn is a very kind and selfless person who is always putting the safety of others above his own. Jake comments on his adopted brother by saying that \"he is a good kid with a kind heart.\" \nIn the episode \" Rainy Day Daydream ,\" it is shown that Finn believes that \"imagination is for turbonerds who can't handle how kick butt reality is\" and that he finds real life to be better than anything imaginary. Finn then refuses to use his imagination until he has to reactivate Jake's \"bombastic personality\" in his imagination land, (which was just a basic gray and white empty plane hinting that Finn is not very imaginative). However, this is disputable when the gnomes harness the energy from Finn's imagination in the episode \" Power Animal \" despite it being inhabited with a few dainty creatures such as Bellamy Bug . The gnomes state that Finn's imagination is powerful enough to effect the real world (like Jake's but to a lower degree) and turn on Jake's imagination. \nFinn can also be very stubborn; such as in \" Memories of Boom Boom Mountain ,\" \" Wizard ,\" \" Dungeon ,\" \" Rainy Day Daydream ,\" and especially in \" Another Way .\" This is likely a reason why Finn is often determined to work without taking the easy way out as seen in \" Business Time \" and \" The Real You .\" Finn can also be easily tricked, as in \" The Eyes \" when Jake convinces him that the giant hawks would take the horse to a land of sunshine and love stuff and take care of him. He can get overly angry and yell as in \" Trouble in Lumpy Space \" and \" Tree Trunks ,\" but immediately feels guilt and remorse and apologizes when he can. Finn is also quick to try and resolve problems that he may have caused, such as when he caused Flame Princess to get hurt by the Ice King . Finn is also empathetic and this was developed when he was an infant since no one (except Jake's parents Joshua and Margaret ) helped him. \nAs a courageous warrior and a fearless thrill-seeker, Finn enjoys putting himself in the midst of danger simply because he enjoys a challenge as shown in \" Jake Suit .\" However, he is also shown to have several fears. In \"Another Way\" and \" King Worm ,\" he demonstrates a fear of clowns. Also, in \"King Worm,\" he shows a fear of Bubblegum calling him too young. In both \"King Worm\" and \"Ocean of Fear,\" Finn has an unexplained phobia of the ocean, or thalassophobia , despite the fact that he can effortlessly come into contact with any other body of water. Other fears that Finn has are the Ghost Lady , King Worm , and the Lich. Finn's fears change in \" Billy's Bucket List ,\" after he destroys Fear Feaster , a manifestation of his fears, with his grass sword while attempting to go into the ocean to fulfill Billy's wish. The Fear Feaster's death seems to have eliminated all of Finn's fears, or at least his fear of the ocean. \nDespite being mischievous from time to time, Finn is a very kind-hearted person. It's shown multiple times that he shows clear concern for others, even for those who have willingly hurt him, such as in The Enchiridion , he returned to the giant his dollar (note that this was was the very same giant who ate his beloved brother Jake and even kept insisting that he was dead). Furthermore, he shows clear contempt for anything that is done out of immoral reasons. \nFinn is also afraid of vampires, as shown in The Empress Eyes when he hears Ice King breaking twigs. Thinking that it was a vampire, he starts throwing vampire hunting sticks into thin air. Abilities Physical \nDespite his age and appearance, Finn seems to be quite strong and athletic; he can be seen wrestling full-grown Marauders , the large grass ogre Donny , and a general variety of monsters and creatures several times his size. Finn is also capable of lifting up Princess Bubblegum, as shown in \" Mortal Recoil \" when he picks her up and puts her in her bed, and capable of lifting up Marceline as seen in \" Daddy's Little Monster .\" In addition, he is able to pick up a tree and hit Barb, a giant spider, in \" Web Weirdos .\" In \"Another Way,\" Finn is able to run long distances while carrying a giant cyclops' eye. Lastly, in \" Dad's Dungeon ,\" when Finn stabs the Evil Monster in the eye, he is able to lift it up slightly off the ground and flip it into the pit. Being the size it is, the giant Evil Monster should have weighed at least several tons, thus showing Finn's strength. Finn is also agile as he can jump very high and even make his arms and legs bend in inhuman ways, as during the Science Dance and when he uses \"spaghetti limbs\" (waving his arms and legs, which Jake can also do). In \" The New Frontier ,\" it is shown that Finn can make fire only with his hands. \nFinn is very tolerant to pain as in \" No One Can Hear You \" he merely says \"whatever,\" when the Stag breaks his legs. Finn can also endure high temperatures, as seen in \" Jake Suit \" as he allows Jake to dip his head in lava, and also in \" Rattleballs ,\" when he sits in a mini-barbecue. This may be because he is already accustomed to heat from his relationship with Flame Princess. Also, in \" The Lich ,\" he is able to break the Enchiridion on his knee without any sign of pain, demonstrating considerable strength and resilience. He even tries to teach Jake how to tolerate pain in \"Jake Suit,\" when he says, \"just pretend like every bruise is a hickey from the universe.\" Finn seems to have impeccable balance, as he is able to balance himself on two wheels in his wheelchair in the episode \"No One Can Hear You.\" However, he refers to it as \"skills.\" Finn is known to have deuteranopia, a form of heredity dichromatism that makes it difficult to distinguish green hues from red, as shown in \" Red Starved .\" As this is a sex-linked genetic condition inherited on the X chromosome, Finn must have inherited the condition from his mother. Mental \nFinn has the ability to mentally fight psychic abilities. The first time he shows this during the Lich's attempt to control his mind. The second time was against Goliad , as he was constantly able to manipulate his own thoughts in order to avoid revealing the plan to defeat her, allowing Princess Bubblegum to create Stormo . Finn can focus for a very long time as shown in \" Still \" when he spends hours telepathically summoning an Astral Beast . As demonstrated in \" The Creeps ,\" Finn can lock unwanted memories in \"the vault,\" which is later seen in \"King Worm.\" However, this is considered a normal human ability that occurs where certain memories are removed from the consciousness if is too painful or traumatic for them to recall. Finn also has the ability to read and write, and he can also do simple math. Fighting Style \nFinn is proficient in several forms of combat, including hand-to-hand, magic, and swordsmanship. When using hand-to-hand combat, he is an aggressive fighter, combining some forms of martial arts or his amazing swordsmanship skills. Finn prefers overpowering his opponents, but he is also quick enough to understand an opponent's weakness or using his environment to win a fight. He also received training from the old gumball robot Rattleballs which dramatically improved his sword skills and his reflexes to greater levels. Creativity \nBesides combat, Finn displays many other impressive abilities in handicraft. He has some origami skills, as shown in \" Ricardio the Heart Guy ,\" in which he makes Princess Bubblegum a paper crane, as well as in \" Marceline's Closet ,\" in which he makes a paper airplane. In addition to that, Finn is shown to be able to construct a sculpture of the Candy Kingdom from his saliva for Princess Bubblegum in \" The Real You .\" Finn is also somewhat gifted at constructing simple machines, such as the catapult in \" The Witch's Garden .\" Musical \nFinn enjoys singing; after swallowing a tiny computer, he gains the ability to Auto-tune his voice on command, although he can sing without it as well. Apparently, Finn can also play the flute, as seen in \" Prisoners of Love ,\" where he plays a short lick before javelin-throwing it at Ice King. Unfortunately, the flute falls apart before it could hit him. Because of this, Finn is not seen playing the flute until \" The Lich \" as Farmworld Finn and near the climax of \"Finn the Human\" when he shoves it into Tromo 's nose. He is also very good at beat boxing as seen in \" It Came from the Nightosphere \" and \" What Was Missing .\" In \" Gut Grinder ,\" Finn tries to play Jake's viola, but Jake says he stinks. Jake even imitates his foot prints and said \"I'm Finn the Human, and I stink at viola.\" However, during \" Death in Bloom ,\" Finn panicked over what instrument to pick, supposedly because he could not play any of them, and settles for sleigh bells. In the episode \"Go With Me,\" Finn is seen playing the lute. In \" Daddy's Little Monster ,\" he is seen playing the tambourine. Miscellaneous \nFinn is very good at playing a video game called Adventure Master , which he and Jake play on BMO from time to time. Finn can also spit very long distances, as he demonstrates in \" Evicted! ,\" when he spits on Marceline, \" My Two Favorite People ,\" when he spits on Tiffany 's face, and in \" Web Weirdos ,\" when he spits on birds flying overhead, while suspended upside down on a giant spider web. In \" Dungeon ,\" one of the trials that Jake says Finn would have breezed through is a spitting competition against a goblin-like creature. In \"Burning Low,\" Finn is shown to be able to spit water incredibly high into the air. In \"Who Would Win,\" Finn showers Jake with an abnormal amount of saliva through spitting. He also handles his sword with his right hand, suggesting he may be ambidextrous , able to use both hands with equal skill. This is also seen in \"Frost & Fire,\" where Finn writes with his left and right hands and, occasionally, both at the same time. Finn is able to cook, although he leaves this task mostly to Jake. However, in \" In Your Footsteps ,\" it mentions and shows him making Finn Cakes . Temporary \nFinn and Jake gain magical abilities in the episode \" Wizard ,\" but they never use those abilities in any other episode. Pendleton Ward later revealed on his Spring that all of the magic that Finn and Jake gained in that episode was contained in their robes, which were destroyed. [ citation needed ] Likewise, in \" The Chamber of Frozen Blades ,\" Finn and Jake gain ice-ninja skills, but it is unlikely they will use them again because, according to Adam Muto, \"They didn't have enough time to commit the incantations and hand positions to memory.\" [ citation needed ] Finn seems to speak Latin (as evident in \" Morituri Te Salutamus ,\") although this may be caused by the magical powers of Fight King's arena. In \" Daddy's Little Monster ,\" for the first time, he becomes an antagonist by wearing the Nightosphere amulet , although it is only temporary. In \" The Tower \", Finn gains a new mental arm with the ability to interact with the physical world. His emotions seem to cause this, along with the ability of telekinesis. Since it was linked with his emotions, it exploded into a huge arm of spikes when he confronted his \"dad,\" and disappeared when Finn's animosity abated. Age \nFinn is twelve years old at the start of the series and progressively grows older relative to the passing of time in real life. [ citation needed ] As of \" Mystery Train \" (March 14, 2011), he is thirteen years old. Finn is shown going through puberty throughout the series. This is seen whenever when he screams as his voice cracks. Finn's voice is noticeably deeper at thirteen than it was at age twelve as a result of his voice actor aging. Episodes with early production codes have Finn with a very childlike voice such as \"The Enchiridion!,\" \"Prisoners of Love,\" \"Evicted!,\" and \"Ricardio the Heart Guy.\" \nIn an interview in early 2012 (at the end of season three), Pendleton Ward stated that Finn is fourteen. \nAfter the episode \" Earth & Water ,\" it was revealed that Flame Princess was fifteen years old. Assuming that they are both the same age (in \" Incendium ,\" Flambo and Jake states that she was Finn's age), Finn is then fifteen as well. Finn was eventually confirmed to be 15 years old in the second half of Season 5, according to Adam Muto , and in \" The Comet ,\" he is sixteen years old.
