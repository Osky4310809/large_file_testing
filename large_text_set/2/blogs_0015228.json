King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 13 hours ago 3 \nAvenged Sevenfold guitarist Zacky Vengeance talked about why the band decided to part ways with their ex-drummer Arin Ilejay, citing the songwriting aspect as the key factor. \nHe told Metal Forces Magazine : \"One of things that always set us apart was having a drummer like The Rev with us. \n\"After he passed away, we knew that it was gonna be really hard to fill that void. We brought in a young kid named Arin to tour with us, and he played on the ' Hail to the King ' album. He's a brilliant drummer, but doesn't have the same - I guess way of writing that The Rev had. \n\"We were just really missing that element of our songwriting, and Brooks was always a drummer who we were fond of for his unique style, coming from the punk rock scene and a famous family of drummers. We asked him if he would be interested, and he was interested. We jammed together, and it was definitely a perfect fit for us musically.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:59:52.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
