I wasn’t there, so I’m not entirely sure this is the case, but maybe that was the moment she told him that she looked so goddamn effervescent because she wasn’t wearing “all that underwear.”\n\nAdvertisement \n\nSpencer sat down with Ellen DeGeneres on Wednesday to discuss Hidden Figures and the logistics of attending an awards show in a pantsuit instead of a gown that would normally require Spanx, more Spanx, a smoothing tight and maybe a control top panty.\n“I don’t think I’ve ever been to an awards show and had as much fun as I did this time,”she told Ellen. “I chose to wear a tuxedo, and in doing that, I was able to be freer. Less underwear. A lot less underwear.”\n\nWhen Spencer later ran into Affleck the Younger, he commented on how “radiant” she looked. Perhaps emboldened by the lack of foundation garments and a glass or two of a nice Pinot Grigio, she said in response “You know why I’m happy? I’m not wearing all that underwear!”\nAdvertisement \n\nI love Octavia Spencer!!! She seems like a really lovely woman. \n[ Us Weekly ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:32:08.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
