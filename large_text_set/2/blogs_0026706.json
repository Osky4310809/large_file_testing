Everything happens quickly. There’s a lot of emotion and passion. Referees, we believe them, they need to make good decisions, then there will be no point. \n“It’s important to get the right decision. Maybe for that kind of situation where you’re not sure, and it can be very quick, maybe then. Mistakes are normal. It’s not good when it happens to you. Referees need to concentrate and try not to make mistakes.” \nSouthampton legend Matt Le Tissier claims big clubs always get the decisions — and even believes that if Manchester United had 'scored' in those exact same circumstances, the goal would have stood. Gabbiadini scored both Southampton goals that stood - so was denied a Wembley hat-trick (Photo: Getty) \nLe Tissier told talkSPORT: “The history of football shows you the bigger clubs get a lot more decisions in their favour than the small ones. \n“(If United had scored like that) it wouldn’t have been given offside, I genuinely think that. The flag wouldn’t have gone up in the first place. \n“Big teams get so many more decisions. \n“I still can’t understand how he can give Gabbiadini offside when the ball was played by Cedric (Soares, Southampton's right-back), he couldn’t even see Gabbiadini because a (United) defender was in the way. \n“Surely that gives him a clue that, actually, Gabbiadini wasn’t offside.” poll loading Should video replay be used to decide if a goal-scorer is offside? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:46:29.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
