Now, some of these not-to-dos might seem obvious, but trust us ‚Äî and Conrad and every other woman who's ever had a baby on board ‚Äî the currently-not-pregnant public really needs a reminder.\n1. \"When do you plan to start a family?\"\nThis question usually kicks in before the baby-to-be has even been considered, but it's probably the most important one the list.\nSay, for instance, your loved ones just said \"I do\" ‚Äî that doesn't mean it's time to ask them about babies. First of all, it's an extremely personal decision, and as Conrad writes, \"You also never know if someone may be privately struggling with fertility or has suffered through a recent miscarriage. In those cases, asking someone when they are going to have kids can be a major trigger question.\"\nHer advice for the curious is simple: Wait for your friend or family member to bring up the subject first.\nOur added advice?

When are you due? (Wait ... are you due?)\nMaybe this one belongs on a list called \"things not to say to a woman you think is pregnant,\" but either way, Conrad's right. Our bodies come in all shapes and sizes. Don't know? Don't ask.\nWhen faced with this sort of query in the past, TODAY's own Natalie Morales put it plainly : \"We all know better than to ask that question.\"\nOr at least we should!\n3. \"My! What a h ge baby bump you have.\"\nWhile Conrad admits she's been \"guilty of this one\" herself, she now sees the error of her ways.\n\"Whether a woman is bigger than average or she‚Äôs not showing as much as she thought she would be, keep in mind that it can be a very sensitive subject,\" she warns.\nWATCH: Blake Lively discusses pregnancy: Is it ever ok to ask? Dylan weighs in\nAnd we think it never hurts to remember that commenting on the proportions of another person's body ‚Äî pregnant or not ‚Äî is always a \"no,\" no matter what etiquette guideline you're using.\n4. Don't let your hands do the talking, either!\nFor some of us, it's hard not to smile when we see a baby bump, and that's just fine. But for others, it's hard not to touch ... and that's a problem.\nAccording to the former \"Hills\" star, no matter how close the relationship, \"it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask first before making a grab for the belly.\"\nAnd if you don't have any relationship with the bump bearer, maybe just move along.\nClosed Captioning ON OFF apply | reset x Text Display Background Enhancements font\nTimes New Roman Arial Comic Sans size\nT T T T color\nshare link What to say (and never say) to a pregnant woman Play Video - 1:21 What to say (and never say) to a pregnant woman Play Video - 1:21 More video Mother of child with cleft lip and palate is inspired by stranger‚Äôs generosity 1:06 These garbagemen made a sweet gesture that brought hope to one family fighting cancer 3:20 How Jenna Bush Hager helped daughter Mila get excited about being a big sister 0:54 All grown up (and a little gray)!
