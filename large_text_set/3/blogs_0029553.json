Other collaborators in the project include Andy Spade and Kate Spade. \nCarlson said: “We thought, ‘Let’s throw a bunch of little design challenges. Let’s have some of the people in the Minted community do some. Let’s do some ourselves. Let’s just have a little bit of fun with everyday design.’ ” He added: “Minted is such an amazing brand. And being their partner in this allows us to explore our creativity. … It wasn’t a question of ‘Let’s do some advertising.’ It was ‘Let’s behave like them.’ ” \nSee also: VSG’s Scott Carlson Picks His 3 Favorite Ads \n“We have found over the past nine years that anyone, anywhere can emerge as a powerful designer who creates a new perspective,” said Minted’s Naficy. “Moreover, when put into the right setting, artists will collaborate—and collaboration surpasses the power of the individual.” \nAt the end of the 50 days, on May 6, all of the projects will be collected and shown at VSG’s Yellow Chair Gallery, a gallery space at the front of the agency’s Lower East Side offices. The pieces will all be available for purchase via a silent auction, with all proceeds benefiting RxArt, a nonprofit whose mission is to help children heal through the power of visual art. \n“RxArt is delighted to be the charitable recipient of the Minted 50, working with Minted, Van’s General Store and longtime RxArt friend Andy Spade to promote an inspiring community of artists and designers,” said Megan Skidmore, director of development at RxArt. “The exposure and support received through the Minted 50 will help advance our arts education initiative in RxArt project hospital sites, where we work with artists to bring creative arts activities to patients that will help them develop new skills, modes of expression and confidence.” \nKeep an eye on the project page and follow along for the next 50 days.
