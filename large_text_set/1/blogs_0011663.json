(Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik, Kremlin pool photo via AP) \nC-SPAN can claim with considerable justification that it’s the ultimate in anti-propaganda information. Online and on cable, it feeds Americans unfiltered footage of proceedings in legislative chambers, the White House briefing room and many pressing public events. It also does public-affairs programming that is meticulously fair and nonpartisan. \nSo it’s fitting in these crazy political times that an online feed of C-SPAN was … well, let C-SPAN explain things: \n— CSPAN (@cspan) January 12, 2017 \nRT! \nThat’s the Russian government-sponsored English-language television network that broadcasts decidedly non-C-SPAN content. A recently released U.S. “Intelligence Community Assessment” on Russian activities surrounding the 2016 presidential contest contains this cheat sheet on RT: \nThe rapid expansion of RT’s operations and budget and recent candid statements by RT’s leadership point to the channel’s importance to the Kremlin as a messaging tool and indicate a Kremlin-directed campaign to undermine faith in the US Government and fuel political protest. The Kremlin has committed significant resources to expanding the channel’s reach, particularly its social media footprint. A reliable UK report states that RT recently was the most-watched foreign news channel in the UK. RT America has positioned itself as a domestic US channel and has deliberately sought to obscure any legal ties to the Russian Government. \nThe report highlighted content on the network, noting these stories: “RT’s most popular video on Secretary Clinton, ‘How 100% of the Clintons’ ‘Charity’ Went to…Themselves,’ had more than 9 million views on social media platforms. RT’s most popular English language video about the President-elect, called ‘Trump Will Not Be Permitted To Win,’ featured [Julian] Assange and had 2.2 million views.” \nFor context, RT made the news nearly three years ago when an anchor quit on air while saying that the network “whitewashes” the actions of President Vladimir Putin . \nThanks to Timothy Burke of Deadspin, folks can relive this Media Twilight Zone moment: Here's the moment Russia Today took over the C-SPAN1 feed. Unclear what happened. RT aired for about ten minutes before C-SPAN1 came back. pic.twitter.com/mhWVgCoFxF \n— Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) January 12, 2017 \nThere you have Rep. Maxine Waters (D.-Calif.) talking about the regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and BOOM — RT takes over. Howard Mortman, a spokesman for C-SPAN, indicated that the organization was still investigating the matter internally and had nothing more to add to the statement. opinions", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:02:45.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
