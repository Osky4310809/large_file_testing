We'd start at one end of the gymnasium and have to run to the other end before the beep rang out. \nAfter 10 rounds the beep got faster and faster. People who were unfit would drop off. It became a competition among the best athletes, who would eventually get picked for the skilled sports. I did anything I could to avoid the Beep Test. As a teen, I was overweight and unfit. I was the kid you'd find sitting in the bleachers writing songs instead of playing football. \nEventually, I got tired of the humiliation. I realized I had to pay attention to life's feedback. I started eating better and exercising more. I saw that building my physical stamina would not only help me make it through the Beep Test but perform better on stage, too. I now work out with a personal trainer. When he put me through an aerobic test recently, I aced it. \nMy experience with the Beep Test, dreadful as it was, shaped the approach I take to my career as a musician. Recently, I have signed a publishing deal with multi-Grammy Award-winning producer Robert Cutarella, and I've released singles like \"Say Something,\" which made it to the top 20 on the Billboard charts. I've realized I can't focus only on my music, much as I would love to do that. I've got to perform in other areas of my life — and running my business as a creative professional is an important one. \nFor me, thriving in a hugely competitive creative field requires me to use a three-pronged approach. It's one that I believe will help many independent creative professionals succeed as entrepreneurs. Here is what it takes. 1.Think like an executive \nToday's creative artists are expected to master many things beyond their music, from social media to online event management. Instead of trying to handle it all on my own, I've recruited experienced executives to help me. For instance, as my music caught on, I hired Phil Q, a music manager who has held executive positions at Virgin Records, Warner Bros. Records and EMI. He has been involved in the careers of recording artists ranging from Linkin Park and U2 to Josh Groban and the Spice Girls. \nMy manager has advised me that for every marketing dollar we spend, we need to see a return of $3 and create a brand that will be relevant for years to come. Most artists don't think along those lines naturally. I don't, either. \nAt the end of the day, however, I've learned I need to think like a business person to sustain my career for the long term. As a result, the challenge he set out really excites me — and I'm working just as hard to meet it as I did to pass the aerobic test. \nMore from iCONIC:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:14:21.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
