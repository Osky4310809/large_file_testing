From stunning photo shoots to juicy gossip, these mags provide that monthly dose of entertainment. But as we were rifling through some glossies, we realised that many celebrity duos that featured together on covers, have not worked together in movies. Curious? \nJacqueline Fernandez and Harshvardhan Kapoor \nThis newbie hottie was seen posing with the gorgeous Jacqueline on the cover of Harper's Bazaar Bride. Wearing a Ralph and Russo couture gown, Jacqueline looked no less than a dream. Accompanying her was Harshvardhn, looking fetch in an Ermenegildo Zegna suit. We think this couple should soon star together on the silver screen. \nSalman Khan and Aathiya Shetty \nThey both posed for Hello magazine. This goes back to the time when Aathiya was all set to make her big Bollywood debut. Salman Khan looks super dapper as Athiya poses next to the superstar godfather. \nHrithik Roshan and Lisa Haydon \nThey created a stir appearing together on the cover of Vogue. We are wondering, why no director thought of signing these two good-looking people together? Casting directors, are you listening? \nSonakshi Sinha and Aditya Roy Kapoor \nSona and Adi were supposed to star in the Hindi remake of the film O Kadhal Kanmani . However, later Shraddha Kapoor stepped into Sonakshi's shoes. The movie titled Ok Jaanu , released early this year and didn't do really well at the box-office. \nAnushka Sharma and Abhay Deol \nWe think the two complement each other really well. Now that both of them are seen doing quality films, and are super talented (do we even need to say that?), we think they should definitely sign a movie together. What say?
