Obiano \nAnambra State Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs, Culture and Tourism, Mrs. Stella Onuorah said the choice of Easter day for the show was deliberate. According to her, the groups had virtually faded from public consciousness, but their music still holds strong appeal across generations. \nShe said: “The lovers and followers of this generation of music will sentimentally connect the return of these legends with the Easter mystery of resurrection and that is the one key reason that we have sub-tagged it the “Resurrection Show.” \n“On a practical plane, Governor Willie Obiano has brought into Anambra a life of light, joy and concord. It is through events like this that citizens can savour the environment of security and personal safety in the state. \nShe commended Obiano for being the first governor in Igbo land, since the end of the civil war more than four decades ago, to accord these groups the opportunity to play a recognition live show. \nOnuorah said further: “It does make a very profound statement on Governor Obiano’s brand of leadership. It takes a leader’s discerning mind to recognize epochs in his people’s history and the forces that were agents of critical changes in the peoples’ socio-economic progress. \n“The pop and funk groups contributed immensely in invigorating the lgbo spirit downcast by the ravages of the war. This was through the export of profoundly creative music which helped in no small measure to rebuild morale, confidence and competitive spirit in the war survivors.” \nAccording to her, the primary purpose of the concert was to stoke nostalgia and re-awaken the spot of enterprise which this genre of music fed with its appeal, adding that “there is an immeasurable reward in the present when we give what is due to our past.” \nShe said that Anambra was proud to provide the lead in demonstrating the faith of the people in this very profound lgbo philosophy adding, “it is our thought that a throw-back to the past may come with some possible benefits like bringing to the fore again, song styles, lyrics and base sounds that may trigger off a new revolution in music.” \nThe Pop stars, in their various speeches, said they never expected that they would still be remembered in their lifetime and thanked the governor for bringing them together for the first time in 43 years. There was jubilation among them when the commissioner handed the musicians 50% of their performance fee.
