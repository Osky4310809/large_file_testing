(RELATED: Riots Erupt In Swedish Immigrant Town Days After Trump’s Refugee Remarks) \nZografos’s blog post went up on Huffington Post’s contributor platform on Wednesday, with a note saying that “Contributors control their own work and post freely to our site.” \nBy Thursday morning, the blog post had been pulled .
