Fox: We fired Stacey Dash. \n— Heel Turn Haden (@_TheSonOfMars_) January 22, 2017 \nWhile we don’t know the circumstances surrounding Fox’s decision not to renew Dash’s contract, the truth is that she was a solid, outspoken conservative who bravely risked this vile condemnation and shunning to stand up for what’s right, honest and fair. \nAt times she may not have been politically correct in her comments, but she was willing to say what needed to be said, regardless of what it meant for her popularity. \nThose celebrating her dismissal from Fox shouldn’t get too happy too fast, as people as resilient as Dash have a way of coming out on top in the end. \nLike and share this article on Facebook and Twitter if you’re disgusted at how liberals on social media have been celebrating Fox News’ decision not to rehire Stacey Dash.
