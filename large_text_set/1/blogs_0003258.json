In fact, there aren't enough houses. Property is being snapped up within days, sometimes hours and prices are flying up. \n\"With the railway electrification of the south Wales mainline , the planned south Wales Metro , the proposed M4 Relief Road around Newport, coupled with the beautiful countryside of south Monmouthshire and the Wye Valley, this is desirable place to live.\" Image caption Nathan Reekes says 80% of estate agents' 179 sales in 2016 were to customers from Bristol \nTwo big housing developments are planned at Chepstow's old dockyard and near its hospital while a new estate is heading for Undy, bordering the M4 motorway near Magor. \nSevern Tunnel Junction railway station in Rogiet, between Caldicot and Magor, has recently undergone an £8m refurbishment while a new train station at Magor has the backing of Monmouthshire council and is part of the new South Wales Metro proposal. \nNathan Reekes, owner of Nathan James Estate Agents in Caldicot and Magor, explained why south Monmouthshire is becoming attractive for commuters from Bristol. \n\"We recently had a couple from Bristol who bought a property in Rogiet near Severn Tunnel Junction station,\" said Mr Reekes. Media caption People living near the border say current bridge tolls make for an expensive commute \n\"They bought a four-bedroom detached house with detached garage for about £295,000, after selling their three-bedroom mid-terrace in Bristol for £390,000. \n\"So they made almost £100,000 on a bigger house and the new owner can get to his work in Patchway on the outskirts of Bristol quicker from Severn Tunnel Junction than from when he lived in Bristol. \n\"That's typical of our business in the last six months as since the government was announced they are reducing the bridge tolls, 80% of my buyers have come from over the Severn Bridge. \n\"The accessibility for Bristol, the Midlands, the south west, south Wales, London and Heathrow Airport is all the more desirable as south Monmouthshire offers a semi-rural location with a stunning backdrop. \n\"It's a great place to bring up children and with a new comprehensive school opening soon in Caldicot , the Monmouthshire market is very strong.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T11:25:44.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
