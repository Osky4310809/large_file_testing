He has 43 million followers between the @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS accounts, and other national politicians, media members and stock traders pretty much have to follow him as part of their job. His tweets have even moved markets (although Wall Street seems to be wisening up ), and last week, Trump said Twitter was integral in getting him elected. \nSo why can’t Twitter turn itself into a functional company with a healthy stock price? The company’s stock closed Tuesday at $14.54 a share, well off its 52-week high of $25.25 — and significantly south of its 2013 IPO price of $26 a share.

In its most recent quarter, Twitter reported a year-over-year 5 percent dip in U.S. advertising revenue and only increased its monthly active user base by 4 percent. That’s despite becoming more important than ever to people involved in the information economy, Gerber said. \nTwitter did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment on its fortunes in the President Trump era.

It’s the place where news breaks the fastest. When something’s going on in the market, I don’t Google it — I go on Twitter. The Bloomberg terminal is old news.” \nThe company’s management acknowledged the Trump effect in its most recent earnings call , saying his use of the platform “shows the power of Twitter.” \n“When he tweets, it sparks conversation and discussion,” Dorsey said on the call. \nBut Trump hasn’t sparked increased profitability or share price. “The magnitude of the impressions of the platform is so large, it’d be very hard for an event or a single person to drive sustained growth in impressions growth,” Dorsey added on the call.

They just half-ass it.” \nHe also criticized the company’s inability to introduce meaningful product improvements, mentioning an edit feature long sought by rapid-fire typing journalists. \n“The fact that user growth is falling is disgraceful, with all the action on Twitter,” Gerber said.

Gerber said that’s currently a possibility, but the company’s muddled strategy makes it a lot less effective. \nAs a result of these realities, there is mounting pressure on Dorsey, who returned in 2015 to the company he co-founded with Evan Williams. (Twitter has had a revolving door of chief executives over the last decade.) “Obviously, Jack can’t run a company,” Gerber said. “A board of directors’ job is to do what’s best for shareholders. He should be fired and it should be sold.” \nA digital giant like Google with an established advertising infrastructure would be a logical buyer, Gerber said.
