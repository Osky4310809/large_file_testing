Flynn was a loyal Trump supporter throughout the campaign, but his ties to Russia caused concern among other senior aides. \nFlynn initially told Trump advisers that he did not discuss sanctions with the Russian envoy during the transition. Vice President Mike Pence, apparently relying on information from Flynn, publicly vouched for the national security adviser. \nFlynn later told White House officials that he may have discussed sanctions with the ambassador. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
