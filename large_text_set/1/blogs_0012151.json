It is charged via USB-C however Nintendo made clear to note that battery life will vary per game and using Zelda as an example said a player could on expect between 2.5 and 5 hours of play between charge. 5 \nThey then showed off a bevy of features the Joy Con has that hadn’t previously been known. They both have motion sensing and distance sensing essentially making them improved Wii Remote controllers in addition to sliding onto the system and operating it normally.

A wii looking party game where players look at each other instead of the screen. \nThey showed off a elastic arm fighting game called ARMS where players throw punches from great distances. 10 \nSuper Mario Odyssey was shown with a full length trailer. Nintendo said it was a game returning to the roots of Mario 64’s hub world idea and showed off a bizarre human world called New Donk City with normal human beings standing next to Mario. Advertisement Advertisement 11 \nThey also showed a story trailer (in Japanese) of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The trailer was gorgeous and impressive and left breadcrumb hints that it may be a direct sequel to another game in the franchise. Speculation is that it is a follow up to the original Legend of Zelda but I thought I spotted a hint at Ocarina of Time in the trailers final moments. 12 \nNintendo showed off the box art for Zelda and a few others. 13 \nImportant to note that these boxes are a lot skinnier than standard game or Blu Ray cases. Probably since they hold cartridges instead of discs. 14 \nFan reaction was strong in both directions. Pre-orders went live as soon as the event ended and sold out on some sites. 15 \nBut for the die hards enough was said. \nThe Nintendo Switch comes out worldwide and region free on March 3rd but Nintendo said systems would be available to try at Best Buy stores around the country for the last 6 Sundays leading up until launch day. \nWhat did you think of the presentation (if you watched it)?
