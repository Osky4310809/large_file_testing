Cole takes a pretty huge hit, and Gucci Mane comes in very high up with the help of Drake. Huge Drop For J. Cole \nJust last week, a grand total of five tracks from J. Cole’s latest album 4 Your Eyez Only were sitting in the top 20, including three new entries. One week later, all five have dropped out of the top 20, with four of them dropping past 30 and lower. It’s a huge decline in sales, with “Deja Vu” the highest ranked at 21. Gucci Mane Lands Strong \nThe hype around The Return of the East Atlanta Santa has been very real. With that in mind, it’s not so surprising the single “Both” featuring Drake has done so well. The track has entered the Hip Hop charts in fourth. We wonder if this will convince Cole to use some big name features next time around. The Weeknd Takes Top Spot \nThe Weeknd’s “Star Boy” has been floating around the top of the charts for no less than 14 weeks now, and last week it overtook Bruno Mars’“24K Magic” to claim the top spot. The single saw a massive 49 percent increase in sales from the previous week, and is now fewer than 3,000 sales short of going platinum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-12-31T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T06:55:22.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
