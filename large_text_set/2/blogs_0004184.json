At least that’s exactly what happened when this giant Target ball got loose and started rolling all over a parking lot. In addition to damaging a customer’s car – it looked like a scene straight out of Indiana Jones: Raiders Of The Lost Ark . \nYou can’t help but laugh at the strangeness of what you see on this video. Of course, it’s not great news that a woman’s car was damaged. But at least everyone remained unhurt .\nOrdinarily, the giant Target ball sits comfortably outside of the store as decoration. Unfortunately, a truck hit one of the balls and dislodged it from its resting spot. That caused the giant ball to roll away and into Eileen Grady’s Nissan Rouge, leaving a nasty dent, according to Mashable . \nBut the ball didn’t stop there. It bounced off Eileen’s car and kept rolling. The surveillance video shows a man rushing to stop the boulder with his dog following right behind. We guess heroes truly exist after all.\n\nThe whole fiasco caused about $3,500 in damage to Eileen Grady’s car. At the moment, Target is claiming it’s the truck drivers fault and not theirs.\nWhile the fate of the dispute is uncertain, we must remember the brave man who rushed towards the rolling ball. Heroes are everywhere people!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:34:55.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
