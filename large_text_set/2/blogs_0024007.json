We saw Paris Saint-Germain humble Barcelona, Bayern Munich seemingly end Arsenal’s European run (again) and Manchester City and Monaco compete to see who could defend the least in an eight-goal thriller to name just three of the matches that stood out over the past couple of weeks. \nBut which players have impressed the most at the halfway stage? Here are the 11 top points-getters in our Champions League Team of the Week(s). \nGK: Ederson Moraes (Benfica) - 1 Game, 1 Penalty Save, 4 Saves = 14 Points \nDF: Layvin Kurzawa (PSG) - 1 Game, 1 Assist, 1 Clean Sheet = 10 Points \nIt was not surprising to see Kurzawa charging up the wing to supplement PSG's attack but it certainly caught people off guard to see how well they contained Lionel Messi. It’s unlikely Unai Emery's team will be able to keep another clean sheet in the reverse leg, however, so take the points and run before the clash at Camp Nou. \nDF: Thomas Meunier (PSG) - 1 Game, 1 Assist, 1 Clean Sheet = 10 Points \nDF: Luisao (Benfica) - 1 Game, 1 Assist, 1 Clean Sheet = 10 Points \nMF: Thiago Alcantara (Bayern Munich) - 1 Game, 2 Goals, 1 Assist = 17 Points \nMF: Angel Di Maria (PSG) - 1 Game, 2 Goals = 14 Points \nDi Maria was mentioned in our Champions League preview guide and certainly lived up to expectations. What’s even more impressive is that, based on his chance-creation stats, he should have had an even bigger day. Barcelona need to score five goals at home in order to advance in normal time, which should open up their defence for the in-form Argentine winger. \nMF: Raheem Sterling (Manchester City) - 1 Game, 1 Goal, 1 Assist = 11 Points \nSterling has probably not gotten the plaudits he deserves since the arrival of Pep Guardiola - his pace has always been his greatest asset, but his finishing and crossing have definitely improved this season. The result is that the English winger has contributed more goals and assists (19 combined) than anyone but Sergio Aguero at Manchester City this season. Monaco’s defence has shown just how susceptible it is to direct wingers so it’s definitely worth doubling down in two weeks' time. \nMF: Leroy Sane (Manchester City) - 1 Game, 1 Goal, 1 Assist = 11 Points \nFWD: Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) - 1 Game, 2 Goals, 1 Assist = 15 Points \nFWD: Kevin Gameiro (Atletico Madrid) - 1 Game, 1 Goal, 1 Assist = 10 Points \nGameiro was spectacular against Bayer Leverkusen and his anger at being substituted in the second half is completely understandable. His stats in La Liga (nine goals, five assists) are strikingly similar to his team-mate Antoine Griezmann’s (nine goals, six assists) and Gameiro has actually done it with 18 fewer shots. Considering his incredibly low ownership rate (0.62%), he will be an excellent differential play in the second leg. \nFWD: Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munich) - 1 Game, 1 Goal, 1 Assist = 10 Points Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:18:18.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
