[Suarez] wasn't happy. He's a great striker and it's nice to have him in the team. \n“[But] Paco scored in our last match and that was very important for us, so now it's his turn to step up and I think he's going to do it.” \nStats Showdown: Messi vs Hazard \nCillessen himself was a rare stand-out performer for the Catalans as he produced a string of saves to keep Antoine Griezmann and Co. at bay, leading to reporters asking whether it was his best performance in a Barca shirt. \n“I think so,” he said, “ but I preferred the game against Gladbach where I had nothing to do. When I don't have anything to do it's much better!” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:53:35.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
