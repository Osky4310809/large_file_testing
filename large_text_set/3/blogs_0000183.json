So Chance tried again in 2016. And they said no again, but they did let him narrate a few commercials for the team as well as throw out the first pitch on opening day.\nIt was also around this time that Chance started producing limited edition hats for the team that were essentially mashups between The Social Experiment and White Sox logos. \nI partnered with New Era to redesign the White Sox cap. https://t.co/m5rYnxicio pic.twitter.com/C3zrYpExea \n— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) April 6, 2016 ESPN reported last April that the south side native was even set to become a team ambassador. According to Chance, that deal was never completed. \nWhich brings us to the cover art for “Coloring Book”.\nChance originally wanted to wear a White Sox hat in the image. But seeing as how the team never really held up their end of the bargain, he didn’t feel beholden to the idea of repping them. Instead he decided to create his own look: the “3” hat.\nThat turned out to be serendipitous, as Chance notes, the album won three Grammy awards.\nThe White Sox went on to lose 84 games and are now in the midst of a rebuild. \nMoral of the story: Take your chance with this rapper.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:07:27.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
