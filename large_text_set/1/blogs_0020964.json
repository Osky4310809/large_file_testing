Dan Minton. “Go nuts. This is your life. I want you to walk into this room and go crazy.” \nQuincy Police have offered the self-defense training for years but Wednesday night’s class filled up quickly after at least four brazen robberies in just the past two weeks. \n“I know there have been a lot of things going on in the city,” said resident Pam Dunn. “Even people going into their houses. I read about that on the Quincy Police Department webpage. It’s kind of scary.” \nThe mostly female victims have been targeted while getting into or out of their cars — the suspects, some of them armed with guns, demanding money. \nThe class gives participants tools to reach for, but police say the most important goal is to get away fast. \n“That’s the first step, yell,” said Lt. Minton. “Hopefully some light is going to come on or someone is going to hear you or a car is going to stop. At the same time you’re ready to do what you have to do to protect yourself.” \nQuincy businesses are pooling together money for a reward for anyone who has information that leads to an arrest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T07:41:40.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
