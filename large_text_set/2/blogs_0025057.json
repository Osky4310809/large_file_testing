Everyone’s talking about it. Honestly, at first, I thought I was watching a Nike commercial. It was that intense! \nI’m obviously referring to the moment a Black Lives Matter activist leapt over a barricade to snatch a Confederate flag from a protester on February 22. \nWhile peaceful protesting is the only way Americans and people around the world will ever get their messages across, I must admit watching this dude defy the laws of gravity is incredibly exhilarating. Giphy \nBlack Lives Matter activist Muhiyidin d’Baha had been at the College of Charleston where North Carolina activist Bree Newsome was set to give a speech. \nYou might remember Newsome as the woman who boldly climbed atop the flagpole at the South Carolina state house in 2015 to remove the Confederate flag after Dylann Roof killed nine innocent black American churchgoers. \nAs expected, there were Confederate flag-bearing protesters around to protest Newsome’s speech at the College of Charleston. \nSo, what did Muhiyidin d’Baha do when he saw a member of the South Carolina Secessionist Party waving a Confederate flag around in the distance? You’re just going to have to see this for yourself, my friends. \nLuckily for you, a producer for Live 5 News shared the moment on Twitter. The tweet quickly racked up over 12,000 retweets and 24,000 likes. \nIt’s not hard to see why. I can watch this over and over again. Here’s the moment BLM activist Muhiyidin d’Baha jumped a police barricade to snatch a Confederate flag from a protester.

I mean, the incident occurred in the middle of a fucking news segment. Talk about quick reflexes! D’Baha’s swift action did come with swift consequences. He was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. the guy snatching the confederate flag is a hero, he didn't deserve to be arrested \nFortunately for him, advocacy group Showing Up For Racial Justice has crowdfunded over $14,900 to put toward D’Baha’s bail. According to the activist’s Twitter account, he has since been released following the arrest. Thank you to everyone who supported me & the bail fund. I'm home safe \n— Muhiyidin d'Baha (@daBlockUp) February 23, 2017 \nI’m sure he’s “home safe” watching this epic clip over and over again.
