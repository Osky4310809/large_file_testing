The biggest change is the introduction of the “Smart Magazine”, which changes the way you organize stories and topics you’re interested in.\nSee also: 5 Android apps you shouldn’t miss this week! – Android Apps Weekly 4 days ago In an official blog post, Flipboard gave us an example of how the new feature works. When you open up the app, simply swipe left to add your passion. If you pick a broad topic like photography, you can then dig a little deeper and choose what kind of photography you are most interested in (for example: street photography). After you have made your selection, simply press “Done” and Flipboard will automatically create a Smart Magazine just for you with stories relating to the topic you have chosen.\nYou can also create and build your own Custom Magazines by adding content from any source, person, or publication you want to follow. The update also brings a new feature called Home carousel to Flipboard that allows you to quickly access the content you are most interested in and can hold up to nine Smart Magazines.\nThe main purpose of the update is enabling users to easily find highly specific topics. This really does make the experience a lot better, as you don’t have to flip through content that you’re not really that interested in reading. Update or install the app by tapping the button below.\nDownload Flipboard ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:55:11.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
