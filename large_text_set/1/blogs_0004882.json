In a news conference, attended by what appeared to be numerous relatives of the victim, brother-in-law Brian Boyd expressed gratitude for the victim’s return, and then asked something most people couldn’t image – prayers for “all involved,” including, presumably the monsters who staged this horrendous attack. \nCheck out WGN’s coverage here. \nAs a comparison of two classes of Americans goes – as a comparison of two classes of humanity goes – the differences in the two videos couldn’t be more stark. \nIn the video purported to be of the suspect Cooper, a wild-eyed, possibly drugged man swings an apparent firearm and threatens to kill the people watching.
