One of the biggest winners of the evening was none other than Donald Glover, who picked up two trophies for his hit show Atlanta , for Best Actor in a TV musical/comedy and Best TV Series musical/comedy. And as fate would have it, among those he thanked in his acceptance speech was Migos.\n“I really want to thank the Migos—not for being in the show—but for making ‘Bad and Boujee.’ Like that’s the best song ever” Glover gushed backstage in the press room. He went on to say that the Atlanta trio was “The Beatles of this generation,” a claim that is certainly… a bold one. Watch his full speech above.\nGlover is riding high off a 2016 that was nothing but hit after hit for the actor and musician. Atlanta was among the most highly-acclaimed new series of the year, and future prospects in his acting career now include playing a young Lando Calrissian in an upcoming Star Wars spin-off. Music-wise, he released “Awaken, My Love!” under his moniker Childish Gambino, which saw him take a bold new direction into funk and R&B that was drastically different from his previous forays in rap.\nMigos, meanwhile, recently announced that their sophomore album C U L T U R E will be released at the end of the month. Watch the music video for the lead single (and Donald Glover’s personal favorite) “Bad and Boujee” featuring Lil Uzi Vert below.\n\nIn related music news, rumors have been swirling that Childish Gambino may be on the verge of releasing new music with Chance the Rapper.
