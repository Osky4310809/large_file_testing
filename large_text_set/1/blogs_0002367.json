The majority ruling by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur and three other judges said that religion “has no role in electoral process which is a secular activity.” \nThree dissenting judges said the issue should be left to parliament to decide.\nThe ruling came on a batch of petitions, including one by Abhiram Singh of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party whose election had been set aside by a Mumbai court.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T16:19:42.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
