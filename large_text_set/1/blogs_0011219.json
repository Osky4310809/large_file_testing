Shares Long Story Short \nAfter struggling to pin down performers for Donald Trump's inauguration, alternative rock band 3 Doors Down has officially been booked. Long Story \nIt's no secret the Trump team had trouble booking A-List musical acts to perform at his inauguration on January 19th. Garth Brooks said no. Céline Dion said no. Andrea Bocelli said no. But when god closes an A-List door, he opens a B-List window. The inaugural committee has announced that early aughts alt-rockers 3 Doors Down have said yes. \n3 Doors Down came to fame in the year 2000 with their first single \"Kryptonite\"— which just happens contain some Trump prophecy with the line \"If I go crazy, will you still call me Superman?\" The concert, entitled the “Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration,” takes place at the Lincoln Memorial. The alt-rockers will be joined by country performers Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood. The announcement received the swift Twitter treatment, as expected. Trump IS creating jobs. This is 3 Doors Down's first paying gig since '07. — Eli Braden (@EliBraden) January 13, 2017 I don't know what's more embarrassing: 3 Doors Down having to play the Trump inauguration or Trump having 3 Doors Down play his inauguration — Zach Heltzel (@zachheltzel) January 13, 2017 I've spent this whole post-election cycle being mad. But seeing that Trump had to resort to 3 Doors Down legit cheered me up. pic.twitter.com/YqXdydYyiI — Mike Drucker (@MikeDrucker) January 13, 2017 \nNot to say Lee Greenwood and 3 Doors Down won't make for one hell of a show, but it's worth comparing it to a similar event held for Obama's inauguration in 2009. Beyoncé performed. Bruce Springsteen performed. U2 performed. Stevie Wonder performed. Tom Hanks and Samuel L. Jackson were featured speakers. At Trump's event? Jon Voight is a featured speaker. That's right, Jon Voight from the hit film National Treasure . \nThere will be a few A-List celebrities around that weekend, though. Katy Perry, Cher and other celebrities are participating in the Women's March on Washington happening the very next day. \nTune into the inaugural celebrations on January 19th to see 3 Doors Down sing the lines \"I really don't mind what happens now and then, as long as you'll be my friend at the end\" in what we can only assume is their explicit condoning of Donald Trump's potential ethics violations . Own The Conversation \nIs this gig more embarrassing for Trump or 3 Doors Down? Drop This Fact \nGeorge Washington's inaugural address was the shortest, clocking in at only 135 words.
