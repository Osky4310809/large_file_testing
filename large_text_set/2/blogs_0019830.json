I think it's just something people have held on to. Image caption Christina Matthews, a wicketkeeper, played 20 test matches for Australia between 1984 and 1995 \n\"Words matter, and words demonstrate respect as well. By not changing the terms, you're disrespecting half the population. \n\"I'm not saying people are deliberately trying to offend but it's a bit like bullying - whether you're bullied or not is dictated by the person who is on the end of it, not the person who's doing it.\" \nShe also doesn't think people will be confused with the term batter, instead of batsman, because \"our whole lives have been Americanised\". \nPerth Scorchers fast bowler Piepa Cleary has backed Christina Matthews and says it's important to take steps towards gender equality in cricket. Image caption Piepa Cleary plays for the Western Fury and the Perth Scorchers in Australia \n\"Everyone still says female athletes or female cricket, but we're athletes playing cricket,\" said Piepa Cleary. \n\"We need to stop being compared to the men's game and be recognised for playing the same sport in our own field. \n\"It's going to take a long time to change, but hopefully it will start to happen sooner rather than later.\" \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:34:55.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
