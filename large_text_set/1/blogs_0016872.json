Murgatroyd gave birth to her and co-star Maksim Chmerkovskiy 's son Shai on Jan. 4. \n\"Love thy self ♥ #Day17 postpartum,\" she wrote. \"I think I'm doing ok....and I'm actually fine with the rate at which my body is shrinking back. After 2 days back at the gym I'm feeling like the old Peta again. I definitely don't have my 6 pack, and I still have excess skin and rolls on my belly, however I feel good. After all, slow and steady wins the race!\" \n\nCeleb Baby Bumps \n\"I knew I needed to get back into the gym for my own sanity, but I also remind myself (as does Maks) that I still need to take it easy,\" Murgatroyd added. \"I cannot jump yet and still can't run a mile, but the exercises I've planned out are a good start. Honestly, the hardest part for me is getting my core strength back. \nShe said that on the first day after giving birth, she \"couldn't do a sit up\" but that \"here's day 17 and I'm doing 70+.\" \n\"Ladies, we all have to start somewhere...being an athlete I pride myself on having a lean, strong physique, so believe me this has been a challenge to work through, but as long as you have a loving support network around you, you will be fine ♥ #theresnothinglikehardwork,\" she said. \nMurgatroyd shared her first post-pregnancy selfie 11 days after welcoming Shai, saying she left the hospital looking five months pregnant and that her son is \"worth every pound.\" TAGS/ Pregnancies , Babies , Dancing With The Stars , Maksim Chmerkovskiy , Top Stories Additional Privacy Statement Your information may be shared with other NBCUniversal businesses and used to better tailor our services and advertising to you.
