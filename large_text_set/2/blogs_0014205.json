We may call it \"radical\" or even \"provocative,\" but part of the raw power of celebrities speaking up about their insecurities comes from a much-needed place within our culture in which bodies, particularly women's bodies, are so rarely depicted honestly. \nFrom Getty Images, to Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In organization, and celebrities with powerful followings like Jessica Alba , the collective force is challenging some of the biases in our innately visual culture and it's exciting. The opinions most likely to shift people's perspectives radically are those, like Alba's, that depict self-image candidly—most relevant from a woman who's been sexualized and airbrushed to perfection. \n\"Even though some might consider them a flaw, I've learned to love my stretch marks. Pregnancy was the most incredible experience I've ever had. So I'll take the stretch marks. I'll take the cellulite I can never get rid of,\" the 35-year-old said to Women's Health . The Honest Co. co-founder has previously confessed she doesn't see those new attributes as flaws. \"If you walk around with your head held high and you're happy and positive, then all that other stuff is irrelevant,\" she told Self magazine. \"Confidence is number one.\" \nAs a mom and wellness pioneer, when things do get to her, she says her kids—with husband Cash Warren—fix all. \"They are the best cure for stress. When I spend time with them, I get instant perspective. I can be hard on myself if I don't do everything perfectly. But now that I have (them), there's no time for that...and if you keep moving and stay positive and loving, everything will work out,\" she shared with Self . \nAt mbg , we try to treat our bodies as something to love rather than loathe. Ex-bodybuilder Taryn Brumfitt, has taken on body image prejudices in a new documentary Embrace , showing her message winning global support. \"I want people to know that they do have a choice: you can either spend your life being at war with your body and hating it, dieting, shaming yourself, using exercise as punishment, or you can embrace your body, move it for pleasure and live an exciting and uninhibited, liberated life. I know which one I'd choose.” Words to live by and words we can wholeheartedly get behind. ADVERTISEMENT Kayla Jacobs \nKayla Jacobs is the Beauty & Style Editor at mindbodygreen.
