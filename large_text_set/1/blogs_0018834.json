Row over Plaid Cymru Labour coalition comment after Brexit \nSpeaking on Sunday Politics Wales , former MEP Eluned Morgan said her understanding was access to the single market would be the top priority for Welsh party leaders. \n\"There needs to be a different approach to immigration, so that if people come here they need to be here with a job, but there's also an understanding that we need people to be helping us with our services,\" the Labour AM for mid and west Wales added. \nThe document follows an agreement between Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats. \nWelsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he would have tried to reach a wider cross-party agreement but claimed the first minister had not invited him. \n\"We have a disorganised message coming from Wales,\" he said, adding Europe also needed to respond on the issue of immigration. \n\"When the single market was created and the tenets that underpin the single market, this mass movement of people around Europe wasn't a consideration,\" he said. \n\"It is a consideration today.\" \nThe leaders' launch comes ahead of the expected decision by the Supreme Court on Tuesday on whether Parliament should have a say before Article 50 is invoked .
