It’s not something you’re likely proud of, but it’s actually fairly common (especially among Uproxx writers). If you ever lived with roommates who were ready to head out for the night just as you were getting home from work, you might have brought a beer or two into the shower at some point. It’s efficient! \nThere are even products designed to help you drink beer in the shower. SipCaddy is a removable cup holder that sticks right to your shower wall and is designed to hold beer bottles and cans, cups and even wine glasses (if you’re feeling classy). \nSipCaddy isn't just for showerbeer & bathwine! How do you SipCaddy? #bestgiftever https://t.co/uJrPPdR1IT pic.twitter.com/hCDrJRNNNR \n— Sip Caddy (@SipCaddy) December 16, 2016 \n\n\nYou may have wondered at times if doing this was socially acceptable. Well, a Swedish craft brewery wants you to know that not only is it not deviant behavior, but it’s so normal that they created a beer specifically for this niche. \nGone are the days of slowly sipping a PBR Tall Boy during your post-work shower. There’s no reason to drink so much beer in one short period. Who are you trying to impress? You’ll be burping all night. \nEnter PangPang brewery and their “Shower Beer”. The name might be a little on the nose, but these guys don’t want consumers to wonder when and where to imbibe their beverage. Guys, it was brewed to be enjoyed in the shower, don’t even try to drink it anywhere else. You’ll look like a fool. \nShower Beer is a collaboration between PangPang and creative agency Snask. “We always loved the concept of drinking beer in the shower, so the idea to create a beer that would be drunk while showering was a must,” Fredrik Öst, Snask Founder and Creative Director told MUNCHIES .\nAt a potent 10% alcohol by volume, this pale ale is no joke. You definitely wouldn’t have a really fun night if you started it by guzzling 12-ounce beer (or more) while you shower. The folks at Snask realized this and designed the beer to be in a very crushable six-ounce bottle that is supposed to be finished off fairly quickly. So, now you have no excuse to stay in the shower for 45 minutes. Or at least, you can’t blame the fact that you have to finish your Old English Forty before you dry yourself off.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T20:11:48.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
