Koscielny's red card proved to be the turning point (Photo: Getty) Arsenal found themselves beaten 5-1 once again (Photo: REUTERS) \nBayern are a brilliant side but you cannot take Arsenal seriously as a genuine European force if you concede TEN goals over the course of two legs. \nThe first half gave Arsenal hope, Theo Walcott fired them into a half time lead and restored some pride with a battling, brave response to restore some pride. \nBut the second half, ten men or not, highlighted all of Arsenal’s problems as Bayern cut through the home defence like a knife through butter. Theo Walcott gave Arsenal some early optimism (Photo: Shaun Botterill) But it all turned sour quickly for Arsenal (Photo: Shaun Botterill) \nThe defending became non-existent, they waved Bayern through for wave after wave of attacks and Arsenal merely collapsed. \nJust as with the first leg when Koscielny went off injured, as soon as Arsenal’s captain was off the pitch they lost all their organisation and, most worryingly of all, they had no leaders. \nWell, unless you count Petr Cech, Arsenal’s only Champions League winner, but he was on the bench because Wenger starts European games with David Ospina. \nThere should be no room for such sentiment or charity in football. Wenger has relied on sentiment for too long, living off the back of his previous achievements in his glorious first ten years at the club. The protests outside of the Emirates were only small before the game (Photo: REUTERS) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:38:32.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
