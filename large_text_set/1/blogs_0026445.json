It holds that obesity is caused ‘by a lack of energy balance … ‘” \nYet, as Taubes pointed out, researchers have known since the 1960s that your body metabolizes different types of carbohydrates, like glucose and fructose , in different ways, causing very different hormonal and physiological responses that absolutely may influence fat accumulation and metabolism. 3 \n“In light of this research, arguing today that your body fat responds to everything you eat the exact same way is almost inconceivably naïve,” Taubes said, “But don’t blame the sugar industry for perpetuating this view. Blame the researchers and the nutrition authorities.” 4 ‘Energy Balance’ Theory Perpetuated by Nutritionists, Soda Industry \nMany conventional nutritionists are among the top supporters of the energy balance theory, which still suggests that weight gain is simply a matter of consuming more calories than you burn off. \nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute is among those prominent government organizations still perpetuating this myth 5 — alongside soda giants who obviously have a vested interest in keeping sugar’s “OK-in-moderation” reputation. \nIn 2015, for instance, Coca-Cola Co. was outed for secretly funding and supporting the Global Energy Balance Network , a nonprofit front group that promoted exercise as the solution to obesity while significantly downplaying the role of diet and sugary beverages in the weight loss equation. 6 \nPublic health authorities accused the group of using tobacco-industry tactics to raise doubts about the health hazards of soda, and a letter signed by more than three dozen scientists said the group was spreading “scientific nonsense.” 7 \nBy December 2015, the Global Energy Balance Network announced it would be shutting down, with Coca-Cola claiming it was working on increased transparency. \nHowever, as reported by CrossFit bloggers Russell Berger and Russ Greene, the soda industry maintains many close ties with organizations that continue to promote the energy balance myth (and directly funds such organizations). 8 Among them: The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) , which was funded by Coca-Cola until 2015. \nThey also founded a program called “Energy Balance 4 Kids With Play” in partnership with the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation (HWCF), “an industry organization representing Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle, General Mills and other distributers of sugar-sweetened products.” 9 \n“The program promotes the concept of energy balance among children and parents through registered dietitians,” Berger noted. 10 The International Food Information Council Foundation , which is funded by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, promotes the idea that “when it comes to weight management or weight loss, it’s the total calories that matters most.” The National Institutes of Health “We Can!” Campaign. Coca-Cola has channeled millions of dollars to the NIH Foundation. The campaign advises drinking soda only “once in a while” and suggests balancing out days when kids eat lots of high-sugar foods/drinks with more physical activity. The American College of Sports Medicine , which is also funded by Coca-Cola, suggests that while water should be your first choice of beverage, “there is no harm in drinking juice or even soda in moderation.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , which also receives funding from Coca-Cola via the CDC Foundation, also promotes “energy balance,” assuring that: “Healthy eating is all about balance. \nYou can enjoy your favorite foods even if they are high in calories, fat or added sugars. The key is eating them only once in a while … “ How the Soda Industry Downplays the Health Risks of Excess Sugar \nWhile leveraging the energy balance theory via public health organizations, the soda industry also uses a variety of other smoke-and-mirrors tactics to distract the public from the true health risks of consuming sugary beverages. \nOne of their favorites is blaming obesity on lack of exercise and suggesting that you can somehow out-exercise the effects of a poor diet, which you cannot. Berger noted: 11 \n“Perhaps the biggest trick of Big Soda nutrition science is to promote physical activity instead of fitness and weight loss. Weight loss and fitness require limiting the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages. \nGeneric references to physical activity, however, may actually encourage the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, especially when the same organizations promote the idea of “earning” sugar by burning off additional calories through daily activity.” \nThere are other stealthy tricks too, like industry-funded health organizations suggesting metabolic syndrome is the result of obesity and can be remedied with physical activity. \nBut independent studies have suggested insulin resistance, caused by overconsumption of sugars, especially fructose, may, in fact, be a primary cause behind metabolic syndrome. \nFor instance, a meta-review published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings found that once you reach 18 Visit Site", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T09:31:52.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
