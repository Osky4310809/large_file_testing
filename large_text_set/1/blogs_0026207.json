Interested in the Moto Z but looking for a good deal? Today, you can get an unlocked Moto Z combined with one of the more expensive Moto Mods, the Hasselblad True Zoom Camera , for just $599.99 at B&H Photo.\nSee also: Moto Mods Review: Blast, Power and Project in a snap July 27, 2016 That price is $400 off that bundle’s normal cost of $999.99. That basically means you are getting the $299.99 Hasselblad True Zoom Camera Moto Mod for free while still getting the $699.99 Moto Z itself for $100 off. All in all, that’s a terrific deal.\nHere’s a quick recap on both the Moto Z and the camera mod. The 5.5-inch unlocked Moto Z has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM, along with a 13MP rear camera, a 5MP front-facing camera and a 2600mAh battery. The version of the phone in this bundle has 64GB of onboard storage, and it has Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, with the promise that the update to Android Nougat is coming sometime in February .\nThe unlocked phone included in this bundle can be used on GSM networks run by T-Mobile and AT&T in the US, but it cannot be used on Sprint’s network. Verizon does sell its own version of this phone, under the name of the Moto Z Droid, that can only be used on its network.\nAs with all the Moto Mods, the Hasselblad True Zoom Camera connects magnetically to the back of the Moto Z. Its main feature is the 10x optical zoom lens, which will make taking photos from a distance much easier. Most of the rest of this Moto Mod’s hardware is not quite as impressive. It only has a 12MP sensor, and it supports filming video at up to 1080p. However the big jump for the optical zoom may make this worth getting, especially since, as we pointed out before, this bundle essentially makes this Moto Mod free with the purchase of the Moto Z.\nHopefully, we will get to hear more about the next wave of Moto Mods from Motorola in time for the MWC 2017 trade show in late February. In the meantime, you can get the unlocked Moto Z and the Hasselblad True Zoom Camera from B&H Photo at the discounted price from now until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on Jan. 29.\nGet it at B&H Photo ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:31:36.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
