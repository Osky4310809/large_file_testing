He would belittle me and not want me to succeed. \n“He would lie about things and if I confronted him he had an explosive temper.” \nMelissa tried to break up with him but Burton told her he would kill himself if she left him. Melissa thought she'd be single forever following the attack until she met her rescuer \nIn October 2011, after a heavy drinking session, he launched a violent attack on her. \nShe reported it to the police and he was charged with domestic battery and sentenced to 10 hours in prison. \nMelissa thought their relationship was finally over but on 24 January 2012 he called her at 2am and said he needed closure from their romance. \nHe promised that if he could see her for one final time he would leave her alone. \n“I didn’t listen to my intuition telling me it was wrong, and that was the biggest mistake I ever made. \n“I took my pepper spray and phone, thinking I could protect myself if I needed to,” she said. \nMelissa walked up to him and it appeared he was reaching out for a hug. \nHowever, instead of embracing her he flipped a switchblade open and manically started stabbing her. \n“I remember the pain of the first few but after that I went into fight-or-flight mode,” she said. \n“I tried to fight back and bite his hand. I was punching and screaming and doing everything I could, but I kept falling to the ground because I was losing so much blood.” Determined to not let the attack rule her life, Melissa has spoken out about the assault \nA young couple intervened and called 911. Burton went to his car to get an even bigger blade and Melissa said he had “every intention of killing me”. \nPolice arrived on the scene and found her lying in the road. \nShe had suffered a stroke because of the extreme loss of blood and her speech was slurred. \nA helicopter airlifted her to hospital and surgeons said she “died on the table several times” and had to be resuscitated. \n“My wounds were severe. I had a broken skull and jaw. My head and nose were fractured,” she said. \n“He had severed my facial nerve, so I had paralysis on the right side of my face. They gave me 12 units of blood and the body holds about seven on average. It was a miracle I survived.” \nMelissa spent several days in intensive care. She had had 19 stab wounds on her head, neck and face, was missing teeth and doctors had to shave her head. \nMeanwhile, Burton had attempted to kill himself but was unsuccessful. \nMelissa feared she would be “single for the rest of my life” because of what she looked like and the emotional impact of the ordeal. \nDetermined to not let the attack rule her life, she began speaking out about the assault to help others. The student was knifed in the neck, arms, face and hand in frenzied attack (Photo: Boston Globe) \nAt a speaking event in October 2012 she met Cameron Hill, now 41 – one of the emergency service operators who saved her life. \nAfter hugging and crying together they exchanged numbers. \n“I was weirdly giddy. I had this feeling about him,” she said. \nThey arranged to meet up and Melissa quickly developed romantic feelings towards him. \nCameron did not know what to do but could not get the young woman he rescued out of his head. \nHe eventually asked her out on a date. \n“We had different dates, we had a barbecue – we love barbecue in southern Florida – and we went to a shooting range,” she said. \n“Cameron showed me how to improve my shooting and I now have a concealed-carry permit. It makes me feel better, that I can protect myself.” \nCameron was by Melissa’s side in August 2013 when she faced Burton in court. \nHe was given life without parole and Melisa finally felt like she had her life back. Cameron proposed to Melissa at Tampa Bay Rays baseball game in Mexico \nShe finally had her happy ending a couple of years later when Cameron popped the question with a “beautiful” diamond ring. She immediately said yes. \nThe pair are set to tie the knot later this year. \nShe said: “All the people that saved me, from the first police officer on the scene to the trauma surgeon, are coming. \n“Today I just feel very blessed to be here. I know that the attack was just one day in my life and it will never define me.” \nMelissa has set up a Facebook page to support other domestic violence sufferers.
