At age 49, the comedian and UFC announcer looks like he’d be just as comfortable inside the Octagon itself, and we sure wouldn’t want to be on the other end of those furious hands. Notice the lightning-fast jab-hook-jab combos, too; this guy was clearly meant to fight. But how did the microphone jockey get a lean, heavyweight physicality? Turns out he had it in him all along. \nGrowing up in Newark, New Jersey, Rogan was the 1987 U.S. Open champion in Taekwondo, a competition he dominated by leveling his competitor with brutal spinning back kick . Rogan developed head trauma in his young career, according to the 2002 book Black Belt , and so he made the move to pursue comedy and television. But Rogan has continued training as a fighter his whole life, which would explain his kinetic assault on the heavy bag. And lest we forget, Rogan is a comic, UFC announcer, podcaster and sitcom actor all at once, but still finds time to maintain fighting form.
