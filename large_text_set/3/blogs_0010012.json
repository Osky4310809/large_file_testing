Instead, the onus appears to be on council members, aged 16 to 24.\n“We have been given some autonomy in terms of building our own agenda,” said Donovan Taplin, 22, from Bell Island in Newfoundland and Labrador.\nIt’s “early days,” he said. Two in-person meetings have been held by far, one with 15 youth in the fall and another, concurrent to the Calgary cabinet retreat in January, with an additional 11 members. Monthly meetings occur online and by teleconference, with the next scheduled for March 28. In the last couple of months, 11 subcommittees have been struck on various policy issues.\nYouth have met with cabinet ministers, including natural resources minister James Carr, defence minister Harjit Sajjan and environment Catherine McKenna.\nTaplin, who has taken a co-ordinating role, said the council is figuring out how best to make their deliberations public, whether through releasing transcripts, summaries of meetings, or issuing media releases. “I personally would invite and be very open to releasing the minutes of our meetings when the prime minister has been present,” he said.\nRelated Lauren Heuser: Give the plebs a voice Neha Rahman, 19, who’s from Toronto but is studying in Montreal, said she has discussed topics such as climate policy, innovation and youth employment in “parlay sessions” with youth from outside the council. Trying to get more opinions and ideas from their peers is something others have been working on too.\nTo share results of those sessions and of bigger meetings, Rahman said, “we’re in the process of trying to have a centralized platform, like a website,” where documents can be uploaded. “Myself, I am definitely open to sharing them.”\nAshley Whiteman, 18, from Edmonton, said she doesn’t want any youth to be excluded from the conversation. “We’re definitely open to the idea of having more transparency,” she said, adding some people share personal stories in meetings, so “we have to look at ways of how to make sure people’s privacy is respected.”\nStephanie Austin, a spokeswoman for the Privy Council Office’s Youth Secretariat, said “transparency has been a key pillar of the prime minister’s youth council since its inception.” For example, she said, details about the application and selection process are online, as well as questions and answers and news releases.\nThe PCO and council are working to develop “procedures for how to inform Canadians about the council’s work,” Austin said, and “it was critical that the full council be involved in defining these procedures and practices.”\nAll young Canadians should have the opportunity to know what’s being discussed and take a look at the recommendations.\nStill, New Democrats have been trying to take Trudeau to task on the fact he hasn’t specifically mandated transparency at the council.\nA nascent e-petition , launched this week by the vice president of communications in the NDP’s youth wing, Alex Gold-Apel, and sponsored by youth critic Anne Minh-Thu Quach, asks that records be made publicly available and “a clear path to offer broader input is established.”\n“All young Canadians should have the opportunity to know what’s being discussed and take a look at the recommendations,” Gold-Apel, 21, explained. “We’d like hard transcripts.”\n“As of now, we know nothing about the issues that have been discussed or whom the council has met with,” Minh-Thu Quach said in a late February question period. NDP leadership candidate Niki Ashton followed up, “young Canadians are facing significant challenges, and they deserve to have access to this process.”\nAs Gold-Apel put it, council members have direct access to the prime minister. “This isn’t to take away from them, and this isn’t their fault, but they’re really the only young Canadians who have been given access to the government.”\nTrudeau’s parliamentary secretary, Peter Schiefke, has offered no specifics in the Commons, only saying the prime minister is proud to have the council in place.\n“I can only hope that his pride in creating this council will translate to him valuing the information and the feedback the council gives him,” Taplin said.\n“I think it is important to reach out to all groups, even those who are partisan. I want to hear from the Young Conservatives, the Young NDP and the Young Liberals,” he added. “I think it’s important to hear what these groups believe in, what they’re advocating for, what they’re organizing for.”\n• Email: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: amariedanielles \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:22:04.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
