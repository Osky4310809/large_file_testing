Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nWomen. *eye roll* \nHere we thought the goal of the Women’s March was to make broads seem more empowered and involved in their communities. All we’ve seen them do however is make jokes of themselves and unfortunately by default, some women. \nLike the silly hashtag they tried to push today as a “gotcha” for Jeff Sessions: We can't give #Sessions a pass when it comes to the rules. The deck is already stacked against women & minorities. BE LOUD. #LockHimUp \n— Women's March (@womensmarch) March 2, 2017 \nBE LOUD. Because we haven’t joked for years that women never shut up. \nAnd PLEASE, why pick a hashtag so close to the one that dogged Hillary for her entire campaign, #LockHerUp. It’s like they wanted their efforts to backfire and bite ’em in the arse. \n— Linda Quinlan (@lindaq777)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:16:58.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
