First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the British government’s reluctance to listen to her proposals and pleas to remain in the single market meant it should now be left up to the Scottish public to decide whether it wants to ride shotgun on a “hard Brexit” or pursue independence. Can the SNP Call Another Referendum? \nSturgeon vowed to give the Scottish public a second vote on independence between autumn 2018 and spring 2019, coinciding with when the conclusion of the UK's Brexit negotiations is expected. Getting the green light to implement a second legally binding vote shouldn’t be much of an issue. Sixty-five seats are required in order to pass legislation on a referendum, which can realistically be met by combining the SNP’s 63 seats with the six seats held by the pro-independence Scottish Green Party. Incidentally, Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green Party's co-convener, has already confirmed that he plans to vote in favor of seeking a Section 30 order. Technically, the British Parliament could still veto another referendum, although that is unlikely to happen if opinion polls show that the Scottish public have experienced a drastic change of heart. \nBack in 2014, the SNP’s previous leader, Alex Salmond, pledged that there would be no second referendum for \"a generation.\" Yet after seeing the independence he fought for shunned by a decisive 10 percentage point margin, most commentators agreed that it would be only a matter of time before the SNP found another reason to reopen the debate. The shocking Brexit vote last summer, it seems, has created precisely the type of tense environment it requires to relaunch a campaign for independence. Support for Independence Rising After Brexit \nRecent polls indicate that 50 percent of Scots now want independence. That marks a sharp rise on a similar survey conducted in January, when 45.5 percent of voters favored that outcome. Sturgeon and her team will be hoping to see even more convincing levels of support over the next year, driven by the triggering of Article 50 and the British government's aggressive negotiation strategies. Independence Brings no Guarantees of EU Membership \nHowever, while it’s apparent that many Scots are against the U.K. government’s desire to exit the EU at any cost, a win for independence is by no means guaranteed. For example, appetites could change should Scotland be forced to re-apply for EU membership as an independent state. \nEuropean Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso hinted that this would be the case ahead of the last referendum. His argument has since been confirmed by the European Commision’s spokesman Margaritis Schinas, leaving Scotland facing the uncomfortable prospect of a drawn out application process. (See also: Can Scotland Join the EU If it Leaves the U.K.? ) \nThese observations could be enough to strike fear into voters, particularly as an independent Scotland will be in desperate need of allies. Impact on Currency Markets \nShort-selling sterling would likely emerge as the biggest investment play should Scotland edge toward breaking away from the rest of the U.K. Westminster previously dismissed the idea of a formal currency union, which would force Scotland to either adopt a new currency or use sterling unofficially—without having any say over monetary policy . All this uncertainty will likely see investors dump sterling in favor of the U.S. Dollar. \nA weakened pound might help the majority of big U.K.-listed exporters, much like it did after the Brexit referendum result came out. But it would also create a pile of problems too. For example, if a new Scottish currency is created, the raft of companies that do business across the border will be hit with potentially expensive transaction costs . Several U.K.-listed Sectors Look Particularly Vulnerable \nRBS and Lloyds, the two biggest Scottish-registered banks, look particularly vulnerable to a break up of the union. Both previously warned that independence would affect their credit ratings and force them to move their domiciles south of the border. One of the biggest risks they would face is countless loans issued in sterling and repaid in a potentially depreciated Scottish currency may result in defaults. \nAnother sector of the U.K. stock market that could find Scottish independence particularly difficult to stomach is aerospace and defense. After centuries of union, Scotland and the U.K.’s defense commitments are now closely intertwined. Many of the Ministry of Defence’s main contractors, such as Babcock, BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and QinetiQ, run big operations north of the border. \nOther sectors that look especially vulnerable include oil and gas, energy and asset managers. The Bottom Line \nAs previously mentioned, investors would be foolish to assume that a Scottish referendum will favor independence. Just like last time, the result could go either way depending on what facts and opinions are thrown up along the way. \nFor stock markets, this will likely result in a period of heightened volatility. While that might sound like a scary prospect for holders of U.K.-listed companies, it may also present plenty of opportunities to buy stakes in quality stocks on the wrong side of market sentiment. \nIt is also worth bearing in mind the U.K.’s status as a key trading partner of the U.S. Murmurs of two relatively small countries across the Atlantic Ocean possibly parting ways might not sound particularly worrying, yet any hits to those economies could effect the global economy and equity markets back home. \nIn short, talk of another Scottish referendum should not be taken lightly. The great unknowns associated with Scottish independence could have unpredictable consequences on a number of global stock markets. There’s always plenty money to be made in such environments — although investors would be wise to act prudently and carefully assess whether they have the risk appetite to bet on uncertain outcomes.
