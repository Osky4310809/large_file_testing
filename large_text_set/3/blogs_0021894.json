As the film progresses, the mood turns darker. Joey has a bad interaction with a gas station clerk, “they think they know but they have no idea” and drives up the mountains eventually settling besides a large ominous cross. What we first interpreted as aloofness turns chilling, and by the end we see that Joey isn’t as normal as she seems.\nWatch the video above and some stills from the set below.\nIn other news, Vans and Urban Outfitters tap Sasha Lane to represent outspoken women everywhere.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T12:10:58.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
