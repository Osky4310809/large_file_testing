As is pretty obvious, the highlights of all major shows were celebrity showstoppers. The dazzling Bollywood personalities added all the more glamour to the already stunning collections by the designers. Here is a list of the stars we spotted! 1. Vidyut Jamwal The actor walked the show for Bharat Reshma in an intricate, and very sharp, monochrome bandhgala paired with flared bottoms (No other man can carry THAT off! . Looking like the perfect dulha, the Commando actor made sure we couldn’t take our eyes off him. 2. Malaika Arora Khan With a blinding glow and a sleek side-swept bun in place, the Bollywood diva dazzled in her Aastha Narang lehenga that was a showstopper in itself. The heavily sequined ensemble and regal bling, by PC Jewellers, made her look like the queen she is. 3. Randeep Hooda Malaika was accompanied by the king of our hearts, Randeep Hooda who wore a Sahil Aneja bandhgala and a pearl neckpiece from PC Jewellers, that even ladies wouldn’t mind swapping with! Besides the royal outfit, it was also his long unkempt hair and moustache that added to all the glory! 4. Divya Khosla Kumar Divya walked for Nitya Bajaj on the second day of India Showcase Week. The actress wore an icy blue maxi dress, with sprinting horses printed all over. Floral lace detailing on the sleeves and a pussy bow added the final touch. With beautiful voluminous curls and flowers in her hair, the lady looked nothing short of a beautiful bohemian goddess! 5. Zareen Khan Show stopper for the Karishma Deepa Sondhi show, Zareen dazzled the ramp in a muted peach lehenga with some heavy-duty embroidery, that we are sure took ages to complete. With a Bollywood blowout and dramatic eyes, the actress looked fabulous! 6. Gauhar Khan Gauhar Khan walked the ramp for the Meena Bazaar show on the last day, in a gorgeous off-white lehenga with a statement blouse. Besides, her sleek ponytail and a choker necklace (that was to die for), what caught our eye was the fact that the lehenga had POCKETS. All our wishes have finally come true, ladies!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:29:22.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
