But those journeys have become epics. Photograph: Ben Gurr for the Guardian Seaford residents feel the pinch from Southern rail's disrupted 'lifeline' \nCommuters hope for relief as planned strikes are suspended, but long-running dispute has taken a toll   12.55   13.11   \nAt one time, so many visitors would bother him for directions that the newsagent next to Seaford station put up a sign on his door, with exact instruct ions on how to get to the Seven Sisters, the chalk cliffs that run east from the town to Beachy Head. Lately, with train services eroded and finally halted by the long-running dispute between unions and Southern railway , the sign has barely been needed. \n“I’m not a negotiator but if I was I’d bang their bloody heads together,” said the shop’s proprietor, Brian Tickner. “Other conflicts in the world have been sorted out. It must be able to be sorted.” \nNormally, even in winter, there would be a regular flow of Chinese tourists and day-trippers from London to walk the coastal path. Worse is the lack of trains for Seaford’s commuters, without whom, Tickner says, business is terrible. He has “no sympathy at all with either side” in the rail dispute: “I’ve seen too many people affected. The railway employees at the end of this will still have a job. But the guy working in construction in London won’t.” Day-trippers would get to Seaford to walk the coastal path. Photograph: Ben Gurr for the Guardian \nThere are signs of a breakthrough. Talks between the drivers’ union, Aslef, and Southern’s owners, Govia Thameslink Railway, restarted and are continuing this week. \nAslef has suspended a planned strike and, crucially for Seaford, lifted an overtime ban that has left Southern short of drivers and left this branch line virtually closed for almost two months. The dispute is not over – the RMT union, representing the conductors whose responsibilities for train doors are being transferred to reluctant drivers, is not in the talks and went on strike again on Monday . But Southern has said trains to Seaford will be restored on Tuesday: a development that will vastly improve the wellbeing of commuters to London and of local schools, businesses and families who have felt the impact too. \nThe word “lifeline” comes up regularly here in conversation about the trains. Two direct daily services to the capital and regular connections at Lewes had made Seaford a viable residence for commuters, swelling the faded resort to a town of 27,000 people. But those commutes have become epics of cancellations , delays and desperate alternatives. \nDisruption has also affected sixth-formers and students who travel by train to Brighton or Lewes. Businesses are suffering, not just because visitors – to local companies as well as tourists – are deterred, but because journeys within the area are harder, as more people turn to cars. Jams and delays have multiplied on largely single-lane coast roads, not least through Newhaven, the cross-Channel ferry port which has also been left trainless. Alasdair Fortune, the president of Seaford’s chamber of commerce, says traders have been hit by the industrial action. Photograph: Ben Gurr for the Guardian \nTraders are feeling the pinch, according to the president of Seaford’s chamber of commerce, Alasdair Fortune. While his own business, Badger Inks, does not directly rely on visitors, neighbouring cafes and shops do. “If the traders around me are affected, then they aren’t buying my services. It all has a knock-on effect.” \nMany fear, in dark moments, that the line could eventually be lost. Fortune said it would “kill the town”. \nThe local Conservative MP, Maria Caulfield , said there was “no way” that the government would allow the line to be cut but said she understood the concerns. “It’s having an enormous impact. This has been a misery for 18 months.” \nWhile rail replacement buses are a poor substitute, things have deteriorated to the point where Caulfield said parts of her constituency, even on the main line, would welcome them: “It’s tough on Seaford, but it’s tough on the rural villages who have nothing. Trains are regularly terminated early or don’t stop at the stations – they are having to get taxis home, and pay hundreds of pounds more to get their kids on a school bus. They are stranded.” \nSouthern trains now run along Seaford’s branch line only as far south as Lewes. In the heart of what should be a well-trodden interchange station is the long-established Runaway Cafe. When the disruption started, the cafe tried selling coffee outside; now, on strike days, it closes altogether. \nPaweł Szala, the cafe’s manager, said: “We still pay the people but we don’t have any income – so it’s been a hard time for us to survive.” He added: “I understand that drivers worry about safety, it’s a massive responsibility for thousands of people.” Told of the latest talks, he clasped his hands together in prayer. “Great! I’ll open a bottle of champagne with my staff if it’s resolved, if we survive.” Paweł Szala, manager of the Runaway cafe, said: ‘It’s been a hard time for us to survive.’ Photograph: Ben Gurr for the Guardian \nAs the sun set beside Seaford Head, Charlotte Cockburn, 38, arrived home from her teaching job in the village of Firle, 10 miles away. Her husband, Robert, works in London. “We decided that one commuter in the family is enough – you can’t have two, someone’s always late.” \nTheir children, four-year-old Reuben and six-year-old Hope, used to get bedtime stories from their dad. “He’s gone before they wake up, so that’s their lifeline.” With a two-hour journey often eventually taking four, the children sometimes do not see him for days. “So it’s really upsetting for them, if I have to explain that Daddy’s late because the train isn’t working again.” \nCockburn, in desperation, twice wrote to Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, in the autumn to appeal for help, telling him: “I feel my family life is at threat.” She has yet to receive a reply.

She says: ‘It’s a horrible existence, commuting on that line.’ Photograph: Ben Gurr for the Guardian \nShe said: “We’re in a nice road, in a nice house: that’s why people move here, they want their kids to grow up in the country near the beach in a quiet safe place. The commute was just about doable. Something like this just throws a curveball.” \nNow, she said: “It’s just miserable, a horrible existence really, commuting on that line.” \nHaving been delayed by – and sometimes unable to board – rail replacement buses, and sometimes unable to find a taxi when trains have been cancelled, Robert now drives to Lewes and pays a daily parking fee of £6.20 on top of the £5,000-a-year season ticket. With an understanding employer (John Lewis), he has managed to sometimes work at home and keep his job. \nOthers have been less fortunate. Back at Lewes from London Victoria and waiting in the freezing January night outside the station for the replacement bus, a civil servant delivered a long tirade against Southern, then asked to remain anonymous because of her job. Four people she knew had been sacked after written warnings, despite their efforts to get to work, due to the trains. \nAlso in the queue was Stephanie Harvey, who works in banking in London. She was looking for a new post, but she said: “I’ve been told in job interviews that I’m not reliable, because I commute on Southern.” \nSuspending the strikes should bring some relief. But, as Caulfield said: “Even if the dispute was resolved tomorrow, we know there have been performance issues with Southern .” \nCommuters, and their forlorn families, agree. Cockburn said: “It’s still a nightmare. Never mind the strikes, it’s the service in general, the continuum of unreliability. If it was just the odd strike, I think people could handle it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T15:16:35.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
