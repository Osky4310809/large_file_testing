Today, the company has introduced new storage variants for the iPhone SE ( review ) as well. The brand has replaced the 16GB and 64GB variants of the phone with new 32GB and 128GB models. Apart from new storage options, the rest of the specs of the new variants are the same as the earlier models. \nThe Apple iPhone SE 32GB model is being offered for $399 (~Rs 26,000), while the 128GB variant will set you back by $499 (~Rs 32,500). The new storage options will be first available in the US starting from March 24th. The recent price drop on the iPhone SE in India seems to be for clearing the stock of 16GB and 64GB models. It’s worth mentioning that Apple is all set to begin manufacturing in India, and the first product it will manufacture here will be the iPhone SE. So it’s quite possible that the new iPhone SE models could be priced competitively once the manufacturing in India begins.
