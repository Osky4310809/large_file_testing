Did I?!?! Did I?!?! Did I Lose You,” wrote James. Turns out those lyrics are almost a word-for-word repeat of the chorus for “Lose You,” which appears on Drizzy’s new album. Sometimes I gotta just make sure that i didn’t lose you. Did I?!?! Did I?!?! Did I Lose You \n— LeBron James (@KingJames) January 31, 2017 \nDrake and James’ worlds collide regularly. The Canadian hip-hop star was appointed team ambassado r to the NBA’s Toronto Raptors in 2013, and he’s a regular courtside at home games… especially when James’ champion Cleveland Cavs roll into town. Did the IFPI’s reigning Global Recording Artist of the Year flick the four-time NBA MVP a preview copy of his new set? \nYeah, it’s good to be The King.
