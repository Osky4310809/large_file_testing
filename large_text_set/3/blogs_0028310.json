Haley Nelson/Post-Gazette The Peters Township High School hockey team celebrates defeating Central Catholic High School in the Penguins Cup Class 3A championship at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex on March 22, 2017 in Cranberry Township. Peters Township defeated Central Catholic 5-2. (Haley Nelson/Post-Gazette) By Keith Barnes Tri-State Sports & News Service \nPeters Township did not win a regular-season game against the three opponents it faced in the PIHL Class 3A playoffs. \nThat didn’t matter. The Indians took care of business when it counted the most. \nPeters Township (13-8-2) capped off an improbable run to its sixth Penguins Cup title and first since 2014 with a 5-2 victory over top-seeded Central Catholic (18-5-0) Wednesday night at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex. The sixth-seeded Indians also defeated Canon-McMillan and North Allegheny on their way to the finals. They were 0-5-1 against the teams they played in the tournament before it began. \n“From the standpoint of, if you had asked me after the last game of the season then, yeah, it was a surprise, but if you’d have asked me at the beginning of the season, I’d have said we’d do well,” Peters Township coach Rick Tingle said. \n“This may be the worst or second-worst record of any Peters team I’ve had and we were fairly mediocre, so we came together at the right time.” \nJunior forward Conrad Deemer scored a pair of goals to kick-start the offense in the first two periods, and helped keep Peters Township in the game against the highest scoring attack in Class 3A. He also took a key penalty that turned into a game-tying goal with less than a minute to go in the second period. \n“The first one was on a shot by Ryan Luppe and it felt amazing to tip it in,” Deemer said. “On the second, I was just in the right place at the right time and it felt amazing.” \nFor Central Catholic, the drought continues. The Vikings last won the Penguins Cup in 1998 and had not played in the finals since 1999, but this was supposed to be the team that broke the string. \nInstead Central Catholic took several critical penalties in the third period, including a minor/​10-minute misconduct on both Ryan Haag and Jake Tepe, two of the team’s top forwards, that both helped Peters Township maintain its attack and stunted any hope of the Vikings generating enough momentum to come from behind. \n“It wasn’t the ending that we expected, but it was the game we expected it to be,” Central Catholic coach William Connelly said. “We expected them to push.” \nPeters Township will play Holy Ghost Prep, the Flyers Cup champion, in The Pennsylvania Cup championship game at 5 p.m. Saturday at the Island Sports Complex at Robert Morris. The Firebirds last won the Class 3A title in 2015. \n“I’m already done celebrating,” Tingle said. “There’s plenty of time to celebrate in the summer and we’ve got three days to get ready.” Related Media:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:17:17.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
