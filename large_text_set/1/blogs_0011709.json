News. \nKate, 33 and Jamie, 30, went public with their romance in May 2015, when they were spotted going for an affectionate stroll together in Malibu, California. \nA source said at the time: \"They 100 per cent looked like they were a couple. They had their arms around one another the whole time and they looked totally in love. (Photo: Twitter/Kate Mara) \n\"They were holding each other the whole time. They didn't let go. They were hugging and walking with their arms around each other and were totally focused on one another. They were walking the dog, but even when the dog was running off they were still focused on each other.\" \nLater that month they were seen holding hands at the Met Gala in New York. Jamie split from Evan Rachel Wood, with whom he has a young son, in 2014 after just 19 months of marriage.
