Musician Want to Smoke Crack \nLike Trump, Abramson too is struggling to secure a roster of A-list entertainment to his swearing in — not least of all because it will be held at the Lyric-Hyperion, a tiny black-box theater in Silver Lake that can only accommodate several dozen attendees. But so far, he has managed to corral a who’s who of the L.A. comedy scene to participate. \nAhamed Weinberg, a stand-up with producing credits on Comedy Bang! Bang! and The Birthday Boys , has agreed to play the sitting president (Abramson has granted him full improvisational freedom with the role) and Martha Kelly, who co-stars along with Zach Galifianakis on his FX show Baskets , will embrace the role of first lady, which she is also writing herself. Abramson sees the whole thing as one indulgently chaotic, mostly unscripted piece of performance art, but in a small way, it’s also an absurdist protest against the incoming administration. \n“With all of the frustration of the election, a lot of real fear, a lot of asking like, ‘What is our role and our responsibility?’ this is kind of what I know how to do,” says Abramson. “This is what I’ve always done.” \nFor example, when he landed an agent and decided to leave Chicago more than two years ago, he staged a mock wedding in which he publicly married his career. He hired an officiant, wrote some vows and had his closest friends throw French fries instead of rice (he figured it was a more American update to the age-old wedding tradition). The permanent honeymoon, of course, was right here in Los Angeles. \nSix months later, he held a more somber ceremony: a funeral for a legendary prop comic he’d invented, complete with fictional sponsorship from Bob’s Big Boy in Burbank. This time, the stakes feel higher, even if the characters performing on stage are even more cartoonish. \nAbramson’s decade-plus love affair with McDonaldsland began, like most obsessions, on the internet. Wikipedia was relatively new at the time, and Abramson had been searching to find a topic that didn’t yet have an entry on the site. That’s when he came across the page detailing the backstory of Mayor McCheese. “I was just kind of fascinated by how much was there, but also how inconsistent the narrative was,” he recalls.
