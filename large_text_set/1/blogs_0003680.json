At the very least, the whole undertaking has been one of the more interesting approaches a major smartphone maker has taken over the past year, appealing to the internet hive mind for ideas every step along the way. \nI’ll admit I expressed a bit of disappointment the last go round, when the company finally unveiled the winner – a sticky-backed handset with built-in eye-tracking. Sure, it’s not exactly par for the course for the fourth-ranked smartphone maker in the US, but I likely wasn’t the only one rooting for something exceptionally weird out of the project – like the piano playing robot hand or VR diving mask. \nBut the people had spoken. And now they’ve helped pick a name – one that will either evoke a sharpshooting superhero or a wise-cracking army surgeon, depending on your age range/level of geekdom. \nThe name Hawkeye apparently won out over 540 name submissions from interested parties, a moniker it carries with it as it hits Kickstarter today , with a typically low ZTE asking price of $199 (a crowdfunding discount off the final market price, mind). \nThe final version of the phone is set to start shipping in Q3 of this year – all said a pretty ambitious timeline for such a project.
