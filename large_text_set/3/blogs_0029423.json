Gareth Widdop makes a break for the Dragons against the Warriors. Picture: Mark Evans Source: News Corp Australia \nMcGregor had spotted Widdop waiting for a tow truck, so they waited together. Then they headed off to the game which also saw the unassuming Englishman write his own name in St George Illawarra’s record books. \nAfter starting the season under fire to keep his place in the team, let alone his job as captain, Widdop produced another fine performance, while his radar boot landed all five attempts at goal. \nIt saw him become just the third Dragon at the joint venture to notch up 500 points, joining Jamie Soward and Mark Riddell. \n“I didn’t know about that,” Widdop said. \n“It is obviously a big club and to do that here at Kogarah is pretty special. \n“But I think the most important thing is getting the win.” Gareth Widdop celebrates the Dragons’ victory with Russell Packer.   \nBut for his coach, Widdop’s effort again highlighted his worth to the team. \n“To put that aside (the accident) and perform like that is a credit to the skipper,” McGregor said. \n“A real credit.” \nNot that Widdop saw it as any big deal. \n“I won’t be seeing it again, put it that way,” Widdop laughed. \n“I will be riding my push bike to training for the next few weeks I think. Anyway, that is what happens, that is life.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T14:53:09.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
