The phone is expected to be one of the first devices to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. Now a new report has revealed that the Mi 6 will come in a couple of variants. The report has also tipped core specifications and pricing of the device. \nAs per the source, the Xiaomi Mi 6 will be available in two models – one with a flat screen and another one with a curved display. Both will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors. The flat screen variant of the Mi 6 will get 4GB of RAM, while the model with a curved display will be fitted with 6GB of RAM. The former will be priced at RMB 1,999 (around Rs 19,700), while the latter will be available for Rs 24,600. \nAn earlier report had suggested that the Xiaomi Mi 6’s trial production will begin this month.

It is said to utilise the latest LPDDR4X memory chip with UFS2.1 standard. The company is expected to unveil the phone on Valentine’s Day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T14:38:56.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
