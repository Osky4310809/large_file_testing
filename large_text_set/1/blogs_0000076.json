That’s what one woman asked Dear Abby today. \nSince my sister [the baby’s grandmother] watches the little boy at her house, would it be wrong for us to organize an informal baptism — just holy water and a couple of prayers? We don’t feel we need to have an officiant of any religion present and, of course, we would not tell the baby’s parents. Would this be appropriate? \nThink about how you’d respond, eliminate the swearing, and I suspect your answer will match up pretty closely with what Abby said . \nMy biggest problem with the situation is that I doubt it would end with a baptism. What about religious indoctrination? Confirmation (if it applies)? What intrusive relatives ever conduct a secret baptism, then stop pushing their views on the child ever again? It doesn’t happen. \n(Image via Shutterstock .
