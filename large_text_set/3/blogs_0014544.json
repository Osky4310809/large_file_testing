All four countries, plus Nigeria’s western neighbour, Benin, have mounted a regional force against the rebels. \nDalung earlier this month indicated that a Nigerian vote for Hayatou was in the country’s interest, not just because of geographical proximity but also as he had been “a true friend”. \nNigerian media reports suggested the minister told FIFA secretary-general Fatma Samoura that African football must not be railroaded into making changes by forces outside the continent. \nThe NFF’s Pinnick made his announcement after a meeting of 12 federation bosses with the world governing body’s president Gianni Infantino in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. \nThe meeting was organised by the Council of Southern African Football Associations, who have pledged to support Ahmad at the polls. \nSamoura, who joined FIFA last year from the UN Development Programme in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, reportedly told Dalung Nigeria was “key” to toppling the long-serving Hayatou. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T10:39:57.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
