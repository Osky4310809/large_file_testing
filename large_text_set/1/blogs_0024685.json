They weren’t going to stop burning the flag or protesting “injustices” or hating on cops. \nThey just wanted to continue being taken care of by big daddy government. That’s it. \nAt a protest this morning in Iowa, Old Glory was about to go up in flames. \nThen, a FedEx driver put an end to the nonsense with the help of a fire extinguisher… \nFrom IJ Review : \nA small protest in Iowa over “racial and social injustice and U.S. imperialism” almost turned violent Thursday, after a FedEx driver who witnessed an American flag being burned decided to put a stop it—with his bare hands and a fire extinguisher. \n[Editor’s note: the following video contains language that some viewers may find offensive.] \nThe FedEx driver, identified as Matt Uhrin, declined to comment, saying only that his actions don’t represent his employer. \nMatt Uhrin, a true patriot. \nTwo people were arrested. \nThey face a $625 fine and up to 30 days in jail.
