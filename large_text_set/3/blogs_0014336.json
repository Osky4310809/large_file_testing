Fake stories of Christian persecution never get old for the Religious Right, and movie studio Pure Flix knows damn well that the series just mints money for them at this point. \nNow we know when it’s going to be released: March 30, 2018 (Easter weekend). This went up on Box Office Mojo and IMDB yesterday: \nWhat’s the plot this time (at least beyond the usual story of atheists trying to destroy Christianity)? Well, the end of God’s Not Dead 2 featured a pastor getting arrested and told to hand over his sermons. Pure Flix co-founder David A.R. White (who played the pastor) said that was a hint about the next movie’s plot. \nIf true, it’s a reference to something that happened in Houston, Texas a couple of years ago, when city officials subpoenaed certain pastors’ sermons in a case involving the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), which was up for a referendum vote (and eventually failed). \nConservatives howled about those subpoenas, acting like it was a violation of their civil rights, but officials were never trying to punish pastors for speaking out against homosexuality. They just wanted to figure out if pastors’ instructions to their congregations about signing petitions against HERO matched up with what their lawyers were saying in the courtroom. \nIn other words, if that scene was a hint about the plot of God’s Not Dead 3 , we know the film will once again distort reality to serve a Christian agenda. \n(via @alissamarie .
