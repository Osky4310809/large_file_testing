In an interview with Marie Claire , Lovato discussed how people misuse the term “bipolar.” Lovato, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder nearly six years ago, explains that the term being thrown around casually is actually a problem.\nPreviously known as manic-depressive illness, bipolar is marked by emotional highs and emotional lows . These changes in mood may seem relatable if you have mood swings, but Lovato knows firsthand that bipolar disorder is a serious medical disorder that shouldn’t be joked about.\nAs she told Marie Claire :\n“I get frustrated when people use the term ‘bipolar’ loosely. Like, they say ‘Oh, I can’t decide what movie to watch, I’m so bipolar.’ You don’t say, ‘I can’t decide what movie to watch, I’m so cancer.'” Pictures showing people living with mental illnesses can be so negative, and really just paint a stigmatizing picture. That’s why I’m excited to announce the launch of The Be Vocal Collection. With @GettyImages we created 150 new photos that show ten amazing people living well with a mental health condition. Check them out on BeVocalSpeakUp.com and share your favorite pics #BeVocalSpeakUp \nA post shared by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) on Nov 30, 2016 at 5:01am PST \nWhile you may not have realized that it’s hurtful to call yourself bipolar when you’re just being indecisive or erratic, the singer and actress is using her influence to help educate people about mental health. Lovato even just produced the documentary, Beyond Silence , that follows three people who have spoken out about their mental illnesses.\nToday we are premiering Beyond Silence, a #BeVocalSpeakUp documentary that shows how the power of one voice can inspire and help so many others. We follow three different people –Jeff, Lauren and Lloyd – whose lives have changed by speaking up for mental health. Watch the documentary at BeVocalSpeakUp.com and help us spread the word! \nA post shared by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) on Feb 22, 2017 at 2:56pm PST \n\nWith this mental health documentary and her tireless efforts, Lovato is helping to fight the stigma that surrounds mental illness. She told Marie Claire :\n“There’s a stigma surrounding mental health issues because nobody talks about it. When you spread awareness and create conversation, that’s when you realize mental health conditions aren’t anything out of the norm. They’re very common. They shouldn’t be judged. They should be accepted.” Unfortunately, that stigma sometimes comes with a lack of education, awareness, and sensitivity to people with mental illness, as she noted by discussing people using the word “bipolar” in a glib way.\nI hope Beyond Silence inspires you to be vocal for yourself and empowers others to do the same #BeVocalSpeakUp https://t.co/qI9S7S8w94 pic.twitter.com/F3G2zj4w9p \n— Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) March 1, 2017 If that is a term you use in casual conversation, just take a moment to think about what it must really be like to have bipolar disorder and use that empathy to create a more positive, understanding way of speaking. Not only will Lovato thank you for it, but so will the many others in the world who cope with mental illness.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:16:33.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
