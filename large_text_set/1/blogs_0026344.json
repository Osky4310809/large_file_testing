What Does Plunder Do In the Comics? Russ Burlingame \nTonight on The Flash 's season 3 midseason premiere, titled \"Borrowing Problems From the Future,\" audiences were introduced to a super-thief by the name of Jared Morillo. \nPlayed by Stephen Huszar, Morillo is the villain known to comic book fans as Plunder. (Photo: CW/WB) \nYou can check them out in the attached image gallery. \nAs seen in an earlier teaser trailer , Plunder uses a high-tech rifle and commits high-end robbieres, but his screen time is pretty limited: during a robbery in the first 20 minutes or so, he manages to keep Barry busy with the gun, only to be caught by Wally. \nMorillo had been named early on as a villain Team Flash would face in the mid-season premiere, but it seems likely he's less a major player in the season and more a one-off villain to be used as a plot device to drive a wedge between Barry and Wally. \nIn the comics, Morillo was actually a good man -- a cop who moved from Los Angeles to Keystone City and was a valuable ally to Wally West during his time as The Flash. Morillo was created by Geoff Johns and Scott Kolins and first appeared in 2001...kind of. \nPlunder -- an alternate-universe version of Morillo brought to Keystone by The Rogues while The Flash was trapped in his universe -- first appeared in 2000. Working with The Thinker, he and The Rogues briefly took over the city before Wally could find his way back. \nLater, he would attempt to kill and briefly replace the Morillo of The Flash's world, only to be defeated and either killed or sent back to the mirror universe by -- of all people -- Zoom. \nNEXT: The Flash , Arrow , Supergirl , Legends of Tomorrow Crossover Trailer / First Look At The Dominators / Invasion!

Crossover T-Shirt \nWhile up to this point in season 3, The Flash has dealt with the fallout of \"Flashpoint,\" an alternate timeline he created at the end of season 2, that's taking a backseat in the second half of the season to Barry's attempts to prevent the speed god Savitar from killing Iris West -- something he saw when he accidentally traveled to the future. The second half of season 3 will also see another crossover with Supergirl - this one a musical crossover featuring the singing talents of stars Melissa Benoist and Grant Gustin, who both appeared on Glee before their superhero careers. \nSupergirl airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET/PT; The Flash on Tuesdays at the same time, followed by DC's Legends of Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; Arrow on Wednesdays at 8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:59:13.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
