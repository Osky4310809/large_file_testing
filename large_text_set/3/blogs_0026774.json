Misfit would be the word. Shaking hands with him, he was a dead fish,\" manager Marcus Dagan told the Daily News. \n\"He was definitely weird,\" he said, referring to confessed stabber James Harris Jackson . \nDagan, 48, recalled one bizarre incident around Christmas 2014 when another neighbor had a gathering and Jackson was spotted roaming their building with no clothes on before he bolted upstairs to lock himself in his apartment. \nFatally stabbed New Yorker loved meeting Hollywood stars \n\"He was running around stark naked,\" he recalled. \nDagan said Jackson, 28, showed no remorse when he skipped out on seven months rent after the ailing, elderly woman who owned the building Dagan helped manage rented one of her four units to him. James Harris Jackson told police he took a bus from Baltimore to carry out the sickening sword attack. (Jefferson Siegel/New York Daily News) \n\"He was the last one she approved. She had no idea what was going on. He saw an opportunity and took advantage of it. He screwed an old lady out of her money,\" Dagan said. \nAn artist and musician now living in Omaha, Dagan said he took Jackson out for martinis on two occasions hoping to convince him to pay what he owed. Jackson touted his experience in the Army and claimed he was studying to be a lawyer, the manager recalled. He gave excuse after excuse as he asked for more time. \nA closer look at the Md. man who visited NYC to kill black men \nWhen Dagan took a quick trip to Bermuda in 2015, he returned to find Jackson had moved out, leaving behind a \"disgusting\" mess along with a collection of war movies and video games, he said. \nDagan later got a court order for Jackson to appear before a judge for his bounced checks, but the future killer was a no-show. \nThe last text Dagan got from Jackson read, \"Good luck finding a lease.\" Detectives booked the confessed killer on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:48:08.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
