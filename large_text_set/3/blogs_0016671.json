Sir Alex will manage the #MUFC team at @Carras16 's testimonial! Harry Redknapp leads the All-Stars. — Manchester United (@ManUtd) March 20, 2017 \nHe said, as quoted by the Daily Mirror : \"After I arrived, he came in again. He came back to visit the people he worked with for so many years. And he travelled with us once again. \n\"And that’s what I said to him, ‘It doesn’t make sense that we’re playing in London and go on a private train and you, Sir Alex, will go by car. You’re not going by car. No. Go by train, with the team’. \n“But he is so respectful that he becomes even a little shy in this approach. We have to make him feel loved. \n“In our head there are no ghosts, no complexes, no such thing. \n“There have been ­situations at the end of the game where Sir Bobby Charlton comes down, the executive director Ed Woodward comes down, and Sir Alex, who is with them, does not come to the dressing room. \n\"That kind of situation, I already said that makes absolutely no sense.” \nCarrick's testimonial fixture against a Harry Redknapp-managed All-Star team will feature the likes of Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, with the match taking place at Old Trafford on June 4. \nRashford can end 'Zlatan-dependence' \nIt is, however, as yet unknown if Real Madrid sensation Cristiano Ronaldo, who left United back in 2009, will feature for the Red Devils. \nCarrick's situation at United, meanwhile, remains uncertain, with the player's current contract expiring in the summer and no new deal yet in place. \nThe former Tottenham and West Ham midfielder has revealed that he would likely retire from football if he is not offered a contract extension at the club, with the 35-year-old having been at Old Trafford for over 10 years.
