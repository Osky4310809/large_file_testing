They might win the rest of the games!

That gap would obviously make the league that little bit more exciting for a lot of people. \n“But we need the points. That’s it. We cannot waste time or points any more. \n\"We never wanted to. It’s not to say we can’t catch them. But that means nothing. We want to go for these three points and that’s enough to be motivated at the highest, highest level.” \nDespite the setbacks which saw Liverpool crash out of two cups in a week, Klopp insisted that he retains belief in his side, because he has seen the quality they possess. \nLiverpool have won just once in January, but in the season he left Dortmund, his side won just once in the December AND January then went on to win every game in February. \nHe explained that belief is the key.

Even when you have too many bad moments. \n“I 100 per cent believe it makes you more of a winner if you are looking forward to winning and not worrying about losing. We can win the next game. \n“I love working with the players even when it is difficult because part of this game, even though nobody around Liverpool wants to hear it, is losing. If you lose you cannot stop. You have to go for the next game.” \nKlopp revealed he will wait until the afternoon of the game before deciding if Sadio Mane will play, after the club’s plans to fly him back early from the Africa Cup of Nations were scuppered.
