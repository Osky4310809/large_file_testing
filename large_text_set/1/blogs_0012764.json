When she went to investigate, she found a man trying to break into her home.\n“He didn’t see me,” she told the news station. “He was so concerned about breaking in that I was able to go get the gun, take a breath, and come out the other door and surprise him.”\nAt that point, the man jumped in his car and fled. However, after driving down a dead end, the man turned the car back towards Brooks.\n“I shot at him a couple times and then he tried to run me down, and I shot a couple more times,” she said. “I think they caught him up the street at the church, so maybe he was getting some religion before he goes to jail, I’m hoping.”\nPolice caught the suspect a short while later. Darrell Chaffin, 47, will be charged with attempted house burglary, police told WAPT.\nBrooks said she choose to fight back against the burglar because she wanted to stand up for herself, her property, and her city.\n“We want our city back,” Tonya Brooks said. “We’re sick and tired of being sick and tired.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:15:11.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
