Mr. Shaw became one of the most vocal advocates of Mr. Trump’s tough stance on immigration during his presidential run, appearing in a television ad on his behalf and giving a prime time speech at the Republican National Convention.\nPhoto Jamiel Shaw Sr., whose son was killed by a man who was in the country illegally, spoke at the Republican National Convention in July.

The officers, Michael Davis Jr. and Danny Oliver, were shot and killed in 2014.\nThe release of Mr. Trump’s guest list comes as the president prepares to argue that, despite serious accusations about his administration’s relationship with Russia, the botched rollout of a travel ban with seven majority Muslim nations and other problems, he is following through on key campaign promises, particularly on illegal immigration and national security.\nThe president’s guests at a joint session of Congress are typically reflective of the administration’s priorities. Presidents often reference their guests during their addresses, sometimes using their personal stories to illustrate their points.\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Mr. Trump’s emphasis on the victims of crimes committed by those in the country illegally offers a sharp contrast to President Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address last year, when his guest list included a Syrian refugee and a Mexican immigrant who came to the United States illegally and went on to serve in the United States Army.\n  Many congressional Democrats have announced they will bring their own guests to counter Mr. Trump’s messages, including immigrants who would suffer under his policies and people who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama’s signature health care law that Mr. Trump and Republicans are working to dismantle.\nAlso seated in the first lady’s box will be Maureen McCarthy Scalia, the wife of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died a year ago. After a bitter, protracted Senate fight last year over Republican efforts to hold the seat open for the next president, Mr. Trump last month nominated Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to succeed Justice Scalia. Mr. Gorsuch’s confirmation hearing is scheduled to begin March 20 .\nMegan Crowley, whose rare genetic disorder, known as Pompe disease, prompted her father to start a pharmaceutical company in search of a cure, will also attend, as will Denisha Merriweather, who became the first in her family to graduate from high school and college after benefiting from the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:31:13.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
