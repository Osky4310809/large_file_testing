Swinton, who was with Kansas City in 2012, replaced Keith Burns in Denver. \nThe Broncos entered the offseason with another year left on DeCamillis’ contract. But he left for Jacksonville after Joseph was hired to replace Gary Kubiak . The Jaguars were a wreck on special teams last season and showed a neediness for some experience. DeCamillis has been in the NFL for 28 years. Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:07:50.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
