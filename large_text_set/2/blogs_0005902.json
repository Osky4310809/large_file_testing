The third-year Raider finished his 2016 campaign with just 11 sacks, but terrorized quarterbacks with his speed rush and ability to dislodge the ball on contact.\nMack had three different games in which he squashed an opponent’s rally with a second-half strip sack , establishing himself as a game-changing defender and catalyst behind Oakland’s metamorphosis. The Raiders went 3-13 in Mack’s rookie year, improved to 7-9 last season, and went 12-4 in 2016 despite losing star quarterback Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16.\nThe former No. 5 pick in the 2014 NFL Draft has been a revelation as a professional. Oakland has been able to line him up at both outside linebacker and defensive end to slice through blockers and force bad throws. Mack’s athleticism and strength give him the speed to rush around the edge or the power to cut inside and engage blockers one-on-one.\nThe Raider beat out a stacked field of candidates for the award. Broncos linebacker Von Miller was in strong position to repeat as DPOY after terrorizing quarterbacks despite a litany of double teams. Lineman Aaron Donald was a disruptive presence in the trenches for the Rams . Falcons linebacker Vic Beasley led the league in both sacks (15.5) and forced fumbles (six).\nIn the end, Mack’s versatility and ability to bring chaos were enough to secure the league’s most coveted defensive award.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:32:38.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
