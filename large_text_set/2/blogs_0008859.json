Of course, we never expected to see Rihanna grasping a sparkly hip flask at last night’s Grammy Awards, but it happened and it’s absolutely hilarious.\nOn Sunday night (February 12th) we got our lives watching the 2017 Grammy Awards . Whether it was enjoying Katy Perry’s performance of “Chained To The Rhythm,” Beyoncé’s EPIC Lemonade mini-medley , Demi Lovato’s Bee Gees tribute , or Adele’s stunning George Michale tribute , the performances were out of this world.\nSimilarly, there were more dramatic and hilarious moments than we could count. CeeLo Green rocked up at the awards dressed like a giant Ferrero Rocher, and Adele gave a weepy apology to Beyoncé for winning the prestigious Album of the Year award.\nHowever, the most relatable moments from last night’s Grammys came from Rihanna and her sparkly hip flask. Honestly, @rihanna and her diamond flask are my #Grammys goals. pic.twitter.com/fOe69Iypj3 \n— refinery29 (@Refinery29) February 13, 2017 Now, the Grammys are a dry affair, meaning that there’s no alcohol served during the ceremony. However, this is BadGal RiRi we’re talking about, and the singer decided to flout the rules by sneaking in her own hip flask. Of course, she was captured on camera sneakily sipping from it, and it has the internet relating HARD.\nIn one night, Rihanna has:\n\n- served face\n- taken multiple shots out of a flask\n- FaceTimed\n- danced her heart out\n\nGod fucking bless.\n— Kevin O'Keeffe (@kevinpokeeffe) February 13, 2017 oh my god Rih and her flask #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/BASBwmEsl2 \n— destiny | 15 (@destinysaidit) February 13, 2017 every thanksgiving dinner pic.twitter.com/iQysElGVU7 \n— Mark (@tole_cover) February 13, 2017 Rihanna with the flask?!?!? pic.twitter.com/gGi8nfPp6O \n— (@LaLaChannell) February 13, 2017 Rihanna and her flask made my night pic.twitter.com/9B59uvNWlR \n— Jhennoy (@httpsjhey) February 13, 2017 rihanna is at the grammy's taking shots out of a customized diamond flask she has no chill\n— angie (@rightheredinah) February 13, 2017 mood: Rihanna taking shots out of a bedazzled flask\n— lazuli (@IazuIi) February 13, 2017 Rihanna drinking out of her diamond encrusted flask & passing it around is my mood pic.twitter.com/l54WGvjjqg \n— nañi (@pettyblackgirI) February 13, 2017 \"I think it's time for another shot\" #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/5XIyrSmR6U \n— Rihanna Navy Brasil (@RNavyBrazil) February 13, 2017 Even Rihanna herself noted how people on the internet were finding her hip flask absolutely HILARIOUS. In fact, she shared a pic of her and the flask on Instagram, and we just can’t get enough of it.\nA video posted by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Feb 12, 2017 at 11:13pm PST \nRi and her hip flask are now officially our OTP.\nSeriously, don’t ever change RiRi!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:48:32.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
