Photo by Asier Marzo \nFor decades tractor beams have been thought of as science fiction. Now, you can build one yourself. \nThe team that created the first single-sided acoustic tractor beam capable of trapping and pulling an object from one direction with sound waves has now created a version of the technology that can be 3D-printed by anyone. \nAs you might remember from Star Trek , a tractor beam was used to trap spaceships, basically immobilizing them in space. The U.S.S. Enterprise could then pull or push the trapped ship around at will. \nAsier Marzo, a research assistant at the University of Bristol, was part of a team that developed a tractor beam that can trap small objects in the real world. It levitates, pushes and pulls them them in mid-air using sound waves. \nMarzo has since modified the technology, creating a new design that can be assembled from 3D-printed parts and inexpensive Arduino components. His team released the open-source plans via a freely available publication in the journal Applied Physics Letters and also put together a video showing the step-by-step instructions for assembling a home-printed tractor beam. \nYou might need someone with a certain amount of maker experience to figure it all out. But think about it this way: you can make your own frickin' tractor beam! You'll be a hero at Comic-Con! How to build your own real-life tractor beam Engineers created a sonic tractor beam that essentially uses sound waves to levitate, push and pull small objects just like in Star Trek. Then they created a 3D, printable version you can make yourself. by Eric Mack and contributors 8:14 Close Drag \nThere are other types of tractor beams in the real world that you may have heard about. One was created in water , and a laser-based beam built in a New York lab could actually be used in space one day. \nIn addition to automatically boosting your nerd cred, DIY tractor beams have real implications for advancing science and research.
