Under the Obama administration, the program was focused on illegal immigrants 100 miles of the border who had been in the U.S. for up to two weeks. \nKelly’s plan expands that to cover illegal immigrants located anywhere in the United States who have been in America for up to two years. \nAlthough the Times reported that the memo would not target children of illegal immigrants who were born in America, it left open the potential prosecution of their parents.
