There was a time when Kareena Kapoor Khan and Sonam Kapoor would have been a perfect choice for the roles, but the latest episode of Koffee with Karan 5 has a different story to tell. The two actresses were on Karan Johar’s show. Interestingly, the episode was taped a month ago, but was only aired tonight. There were reports that the episode came out to be so boring that makers decided to delay its airing. Well, after watching the episode, you will know that there can be a lot of truth to this story. \nKareena and Sonam were a misfit to share the couch to unimaginable heights. You literally can edit out all the chunks of Sonam Kapoor from the episode, and it won’t hamper it in anyway. Sonam carried herself with poise – or we should say an overdose of poise. It is one thing to abstain from gossip, whole other to behave as if you are Mother Teresa invited to a kitty party. Kareena also has definitely toned down her fire since her previous appearances. She appeared to be guarded, but also more graceful than Sonam – and probably because she was not trying too hard for that. A solo episode featuring Kareena could just have been a better idea. Sonam could have been a better fit with someone brings out the best in her. Maybe her sister Rhea Kapoor! Or better, ex-friend Deepika Padukone. \nKareena brought along her spokesperson \nWe thought Kareena is coming along with her Veere Di Wedding co-star and good friend. It came as a big revelation that she instead picked her spokesperson to tag along with. Yep! We are still talking about Sonam Kapoor. The Neerja actress took a few turns to answer on Kareena’s behalf and it was irritating. When Karan questioned Kareena on her true blue attitude, before she could say anything, Sonam jumped in and answered, “I don’t think so that’s true. I don’t think so it comes from that sense of superiority. It comes from the fact that they are both working a lot, they have their families, they have their own lives…”. Before she can go on, Karan stopped her. You can almost sense Kareena sarcastically reply that what Sonam said is indeed the reason. \nBus nahi plane se ja rahe hain \nKareena while answering a question in Rapid Fire Round, Kareena says that she is happy that everyone is catching the bus to Hollywood. Sonam interrupts, “Bus nahi! Plane se ja rahe hain!”. I don’t know what was dumber? Sonam’s joke, or editor’s decision to include the joke not only in the episode but also in promos.

It has become like a filler question. Why waste 15 minutes going in circles, and strengthening the ambiguity? Ask a question that would actually end with a proper answer? How about that for a chat chow concept? “I am always dating a business boy from London. But I don’t discuss my personal life with anyone. Let’s put it that way. I think it is very sacred and I don’t like talking about it because there is a reason it is private and persona. So I keep it that way.” Sonam said while talking about dating rumours. \nThe Rapid Fire Round turned into a TedX talk \nThe answers were as long as a Tedx Talk (not even the original Ted Talks). Sonam Kapoor spoke to length about how she didn’t do Neerja for awards. Karan calls it “UNESCO speech” while Kareena is visible being lost in her own zone, and even says that Sonam is “conducting an opera.” Kareena herself was not too good in her turn. Whatever happened to the sassy diva that she was on the last season. \nArjun Kapoor was back! Why? \nKareena Kapoor Khan’s Ki and Ka co-star and Sonam’s brother Arjun Kapoor made his fourth appearance on Koffee with Karan 5. If we had to rank all his appearances out of four, this latest one would be on tenth spot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T21:09:47.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
