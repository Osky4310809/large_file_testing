Morris and Bersten hit the dance floor to perform a jive set to \"Grown\" by Little Mix, and they pair burned up the dance floor with a high-energy performance that let the actress show off her talents. Morris -- who previously performed as a backup dancer for Beyonce and served as a dance choreographer on Glee -- even got to showcase her skill set with a pseudo hip-hop dance breakdown that wowed the crowd.

Len Goodman complained that the dance didn't have enough traditional jive, saying he wanted to see Morris perform outside of her comfort zone. Meanwhile, Julianne Hough, Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba had a lot more praise for her dance, and it reflected in their scores. Tonioli, Hough and Inaba awarded the pair with three eights, while Goodman gave a six, for a total of 30 out of 40.

A pre-taped package that preceded Morris' performance showed fans exactly what happened to the veteran DWTS pro when he suffered the injury. While practicing their jive, Chmerkovskiy brought his leg down, heard a snap, and was immediately in pain. Morris, who shined with a skillful performance in her debut last week , is considered one of the season's frontrunners, but fans will have to wait and see how Chmerkovskiy's injury will impact her future on the show.
