club Las Palmas on loan until the end of the season, the Spanish club’s president said on Monday. \nMiguel Angel Ramirez told the Spanish club’s radio station that a deal to send the 23-year-old back to La Liga was close to being finalised. \n“The operation with Jese is practically finished, the agreement with the player and his parent club is complete,” Ramirez told UD Radio. \n“We’re on the contract. By the end of the day we will be able to say Jese will join Las Palmas,” he added. \nRamirez said the club was planning to unveil the former Real Madrid forward on Tuesday, having fought off interest from Premier League side Middlesbrough to secure his signature. \nIt is being reported that both PSG and Borough had agreed on a deal, but the striker intervened to prevent the move taking place - even taking a pay cut to do so. \nJese signed a five-year deal with French champions PSG in August but has scored just once in nine league appearances for Unai Emery’s side this season. media_camera Paris Saint-Germain's Spanish forward Rodriguez \nELSEWHERE, Brazilian forward Alexandre Pato has signed with Tianjin Quanjian, the latest major acquisition by the Chinese Super League. Pato posted on Twitter Monday that he was “very happy” to join Quanjian from Spanish club Villarreal. Tianjin did not immediately confirm a report in Chinese state media that his transfer fee was 18 million euros ($19.3 million). The 27-year-old Pato scored six goals in 24 appearances for Villarreal after playing just twice during a disappointing loan spell at English giants Chelsea. He has been in and out of Villarreal’s starting lineup amid rumors of a transfer to China. \nQuanjian, promoted to China’s Super League after winning the second tier last year, also acquired Belgium’s Axel Witsel this month and is coached by former Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro. media_camera Pato. \nMeanwhile, a day before the transfer window closes, the managers of Crystal Palace and Sunderland turned to former clubs to refresh their relegation- threatened squads on Monday. \nAnd Leonardo Ulloa got tough in his fight to leave Leicester, accusing the English Premier League champion of reneging on a pledge to allow him to leave. \nPremier League clubs have until 2300 GMT on Tuesday to sign players for the final time this season. \nCRYSTAL PALACE Palace signed defender Patrick van Aanholt , a 26-year-old Netherlands international, from Sunderland on a deal through June 2021. \n“He will add pace and energy to our team, has strong defensive qualities and has the added ability to score and create goals,” Palace manager Sam Allardyce said. Palace is two points from safety and a point above last-place Sunderland, which Allardyce managed last season. media_camera Patrick Van Aanholt \nSUNDERLAND Sunderland sold Van Aanholt in a deal that could be worth 14 million pounds ($17 million) to fund manager David Moyes’ recruitment drive. \n“It was my decision to sell Patrick, so if anybody thinks it was because (owner) Ellis (Short) was wanting money, it was far from that,” Moyes said. “Because of the level of the wages, the sale meant that I had opened up the ceiling, which allowed me to maybe get some players in.” Like Allardyce, Moyes has turned to an old club - Everton - to bolster the squad. Defender Bryan Oviedo and midfielder Darron Gibson signed up on Monday to join former Everton teammates Joleon Lescott, Victor Anichebe and Steven Pienaar at Sunderland. \nThe 26-year-old Oviedo made just 68 senior appearances during almost five years at Goodison Park, while the injured-dogged 29-year-old Gibson managed one more in his five years. \n“Every player who is coming into Sunderland is a bit of a gamble,” Moyes said. “I don’t think we could get an absolute nailed-on player.” \nUlloa, who has handed in a transfer request, went public on Monday with his demand to be released by Leicester. The striker has been targeted by Sunderland, Turkish club Galatasaray, and Spanish side Alaves. \n“I am a bit sad about the current situation because it’s been two wonderful years at the club but now not playing and not being part of the team’s plans I feel the best way forward is that I leave and I can be happy somewhere else,” Ulloa told Sky Sports television through a translator. “The manager has been telling me for the last three months and for the last two weeks that if an offer of four or five million (pounds; $5 or 6 million) was coming to the club he will help me to leave. \n“My understanding is at this moment there are offers around those figures or even bigger that are not being considered.” \nManager Claudio Ranieri wants to keep the 30-year-old Argentine, with Leicester only five points above the relegation zone. \n“I know he is very, very anxious but we don’t change our mind,” Ranieri said. “For us it’s important. We don’t want to sell him. Also I don’t want to because I have just (Islam) Slimani as a target man and I need another target man. I want Leo here and I hope he can be calm and understand my position. Of course he’s not happy and I understand him. \n“The club know my idea very well and also Leo knows very well my idea. He is a fantastic player, a fantastic man, and I believe in him.” \nHull, which is in the relegation zone with Sunderland and Palace, is looking to sign three or four players. \n“We need to put more players in our squad to change this situation because it is not easy to play all the games and keep players fresh,” Hull manager Marco Silva said. “We need to put quality players in our squad.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T09:07:18.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
