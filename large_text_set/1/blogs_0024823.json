Obama banned entry from Iraq in 2011 after terrorists were mistakenly let through, the exact concern here. There was no Democratic or media outrage then. 2. Obama flagged the 7 countries as of special concern , Trump didn’t pull them out of the air. 3. It isn’t a Muslim Ban as media is saying because it leaves out most of the Muslims in the world. It applies only to the 7 countries, 40+ other countries which are majority Muslim are not named.
