Here's the line scene at the Union Sq station for the Supreme x Metro cards. üé• @offtheglas pic.twitter.com/ivla15XM1p ‚Äî Complex Style (@ComplexStyle) February 21, 2017 \nThe cards are dispensed by machines at the Broadway-Lafayette stop, Prince Street, Atlantic Avenue, Spring Street, Union Square, Queens Plaza, Marcy Ave in Williamsburg and 125th Street in Harlem. A post shared by MRKT5 (@mrkt5) on Feb 21, 2017 at 8:38am PST \nThe highly-coveted MetroCards , which only come with two swipes (lol), are pegged to the opening of the Supreme flagship store‚Äôs opening on Lafayette Street. The MTA has announced that they‚Äôre currently sold out of the cards featuring the iconic logo, but that people should check back within the next day or so. We've had a run on machines today and may be sold out of Supreme Metrocards until we can replenish. Check back in a day or so. ‚Äî NYCT Subway (@NYCTSubway) February 21, 2017 \nGuess some people out there won't be so bothered by the upcoming fare hike .
