This is mainly to ensure both the actors are comfortable with each other, and get an equal amount of limelight. In fact, it is said that if the jodi looks great, they might end up getting more movies to star together in. But in the Hindi film industry, algorithms change every moment. There are several on-screen couples who, despite having a hit debut to their credit, didn't work together. Here are some we can think of. \nSonam Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor \nThey both made their debut with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Saawariya. The movie released a decade ago and, yet, the two have not done a single film together again. There are rumours going around that Sonam will star opposite Ranbir in Sanjay Dutt's biopic, but nothing is confirmed yet. \nBobby Deol and Twinkle Khanna \nTwinkle and Bobby's debut film, Barsaat , did extremely well at the box-office and the two star kids became the toast of Bollywood. But they never worked together post that. Did something go wrong? \nArjun Kapoor and Parieenti Chopra \nThe two made their debut opposite each other in 2012's Ishaqzaade . A romantic thriller about honour killing, the two did a fantastic job as newcomers. They did several other Hindi films individually, but none with each other. Don't you think this pair should soon sign a movie together, at least once more? \nTiger Shroff and Kriti Sanon \nWe think the two looked adorable together in the film, Heropant i. While Kriti is doing several love stories and Tiger doing every other action film, we think the two should reunite and star in a romantic-action film. What say?
