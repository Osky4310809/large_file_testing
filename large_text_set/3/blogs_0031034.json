I am tired because I haven’t slept much.”\n“Right now, we are waiting for a resolution on Brittanee’s case,” she continues. “Eight years is too long.”\nIn August, an FBI agent testified in court that authorities believe Drexel was kidnapped, gang-raped, fatally shot and then thrown into an alligator pit near McClellanville, South Carolina, which is about an hour and a half south of Myrtle Beach.\nThe FBI claimed in court that a father and son, Timothy Shaun Taylor and Timothy Da’Shaun Taylor , are connected to Drexel’s disappearance and death .\nThe family dismisses these allegations and neither man has been charged.
