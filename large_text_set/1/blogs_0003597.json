The December update for most other Nexus devices failed to reach Nexus 6 due to a \"last minute bug,\" but is now ready to be rolled out. The update will be distributed with the latest security patch for the Nexus 6. \nAndroid 7.1.1 will bring some added new features to the Nexus 6, including app shortcuts, night mode, GIF support for Google Keyboard and other performance improvements. Unfortunately, features such as the Pixel Launcher and Google Assistant are not part of the update as these are exclusive to the Google Pixel. \nThe Android Nougat update will most likely be the last big update for Nexus 6. Google has been making an effort to keep the Nexus 6 updated with newer Google-branded hardware, but older hardware has become less of a priority since the launch of Google's self-branded, top-down Pixel line. \nSource : Android Police Nexus 6 Android 6.0 Marshmallow update \nFactory images from Google have arrived for the Nexus 6.

Nexus 6 monthly updates and Stagefright fix \nAs with other Nexus devices, the Nexus 6 has received the patch for the Stagefright MMS vulnerability. If you don't know much about it, read our Stagefright: what is it, am I affected and what can I do about it? guide. From this point forward, Google will provide monthly security updates for the Nexus 6, as well as the usual fixes that appear in Google Play Services updates via the Play Store. \nIn March 2016, Google announced an emergency security patch, independent of the monthly updates, for a vulnerability affecting the Nexus 5 and 6. The issue relates to the device's kernel being used by a malicious rooting tool to compromise the device. The update is beginning to roll out and should be on all Nexus 5 and 6 devices within the coming days. Thankfully, the odds of having been affected are slim, as the rooting tool must be manually installed by users to be able to take advantage of the vulnerability. \nIf you haven't received the over-the-air (OTA) Nexus 6 update, you can visit the Nexus factory images page and flash the firmware on your Nexus 6 yourself. The update just arrived on our Nexus 6 and we can confirm Stagefright has been patched.
