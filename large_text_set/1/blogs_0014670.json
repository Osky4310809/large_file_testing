The New York Times is reporting that President Obama has commuted Chelsea Manning's sentence . What this translates to is a reduced sentence for Manning, from 35 years to just over seven years. Since Manning has already served a majority of those years, she is due to be released from federal custody on May 17th. The Verge reports: While serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq, Manning leaked more than 700,000 documents to Wikileaks, including video of a 2007 airstrike in Baghdad that killed two Reuters employees. In 2013, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison for her role in the leak and has been held at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth for the past three years. Julian Assange, who has long been sought by U.S. and EU authorities for extradition on Swedish rape charges, had previously pledged to surrender himself to U.S. authorities if Manning was pardoned. Born Bradley Manning, Chelsea announced her gender transition the day after the verdict was handed down. \"I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female,\" she said in a statement. \"Given the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible.\" Obtaining the resulting medical treatments was extremely difficult for Manning, and was the subject of significant and sustained activism. After a lawsuit, Manning was approved for hormone therapy in 2015 . In September 2016, she launched a hunger strike , demanding access to gender reassignment surgery; the military complied five days later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:18:09.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
