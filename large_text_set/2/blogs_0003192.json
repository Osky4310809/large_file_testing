When the girl complained of pain and told Payne to stop, he told her, “shhh” before leaving the room, the complaint says.\nPayne is also accused of ordering the girl and her brother to stand against the wall as he duct-taped their arms and pressed nails into their hands — imitating a crucifixion — as a form of punishment.\nIf they dropped their arms, he would hit or pinch them, the court papers say.\nPayne was hit with multiple counts of rape, assault, sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child, among other charges.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:53:27.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
