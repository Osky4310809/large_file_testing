In court papers obtained by ET, 28-year-old Tran claims Brown has threatened to kill her, and claims he physically abused her while the two were dating. Brown, 27, has been ordered to stay 100 yards away from Tran, as well as her mother and younger brother. He is also ordered to not contact her, as well as surrender any firearms he has until their next hearing, which is scheduled for March 9. ET has reached out to Brownâ€™s lawyer for comment. WATCH: EXCLUSIVE -- Chris Brown Accuser Baylee Curran Says She Feels 'Validated' By Singer's Arrest According to the court documents -- which were filed on Friday -- Tran claims that Brown recently told \"a few people\" that he was going to kill her. \"He said if no one else can have me, then he's gonna 'take me out,'\" she claims. \"I have text messages from December 2016 to January 2017, where he's made several threats, including beating me up and making my life hell.\" Tran also claims Brown punched her in her stomach twice \"years ago\" and pushed her down the stairs. Tran and Brown dated on and off for years, starting in 2011. The model refers to the \"Run It\" singer as \"her ex-boyfriend from two years ago\" in the court documents. Brown has yet to comment on the allegations, though on Tuesday, he posted an Instagram video promoting his upcoming tour. He also told his fans to \"just don't believe all that bulls**t.\" \"Make sure y'all don't be listening to all this bulls**t, man, whatever people on the other side doing, let them do what they doing,\" he said. \"I don't know what the f**k they talking about.\" Brown has been in trouble with the law before. In 2009, he was arrested in a domestic violence case, and subsequently charged with felony assault, after attacking his then-girlfriend Rihanna the night prior to the GRAMMY Awards. Brown pleaded guilty, completed the court-mandated community service and was let off with probation.
