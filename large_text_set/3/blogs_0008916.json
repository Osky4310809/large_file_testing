The scene looks like a combination of a construction zone and baseball field. \nThe intersection of baseball and building, most obvious, when you see supplies and equipment where a field would normally be. \nThe Chicago Cubs said they are 100 percent confident Wrigley will be ready for the home opener on April 10. \nWorkers fortify concrete, relocate the bullpens underneath the bleachers and replace some seats. \n“The construction is on schedule, and maybe even a little ahead of time,” Derek Rettell said. \nRettell will open up Smoke Daddy Barbeque across from Wrigley. It’s one of about a half dozen business slated to open there in 2018. \nHe said the unusually mild winter has helped speed construction for his business and the home opener. \n“It’s clear Mother Nature is a Cubs fan and wants all these projects to get off the ground, on schedule,” Rettell said. \nThat includes the preparation of the new plaza, the grounds being groomed and the light posts in place. \nThe Cubs said the green space eventually hosting farmers markets, concerts, movies and fans will be ready in time for the home opener. \nThe aldermen told CBS 2 that on event days, like for games and concerts, that plaza would be limited to those with a ticket. \nConstruction around the ballpark will continue through 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T07:59:59.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
