Petar Petrov has been jailed for 21 years for trying to murder his pregnant fiancé (Photo: Met Police) \nBut the woman remains in a persistent vegetative state following the vicious attack, which left her with multiple facial fractures and severely bruised lungs. \nPetrov, from Edmonton, North London, stabbed himself and jumped him through a first-floor window after neighbours reported hearing loud shouting and arguing for around an hour. \nMr Keogh found Petrov unresponsive lying on the floor surrounded by broken glass with knife wounds to his body and initially assumed he had been thrown through the window. \nMr Keogh provided first aid and called police. \nWhen other neighbours came to help, Mr Keogh entered the flat to check on the welfare of any other occupants. \nHe found the female victim, 30, lying on the floor with injuries to her head and neck.

I am going to come in Oh, we need serious help here. \n\"Are you... Oh my good God. She is having some sort of fit. She can't breathe. She is bleeding from her (inaudible). \n\"I think her throat has been cut.\" \nThe police call handler wanted to know details of the scene including if there was anybody else in the room. \n\"There are two patients. There is a knife on the floor,\" Mr Keogh said. \n\"It looks like they have had some sort of altercation... Oh, she's pregnant.\" \nThe police call handler queried whether she was pregnant. \nMr Keogh: \"She's pregnant, yeah.\" \nIn court yesterday, Petrov, a Bulgarian national, was also given an extended license of five years and issued with a European Protection Order preventing him from ever entering the country in the EU where the victim resides. \nThe couple had met a year earlier working in a hotel in upmarket Knightsbridge, west London. \nDetective Inspector Christopher Skelt of Enfield Police Community Safety Unit said: \"The severity of the sentence handed to Petrov today reflects the seriousness of this offence.

This meant that the members of the public who were witnesses were not required to give evidence forcing them to relive the terrible events of that day.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T19:19:37.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
