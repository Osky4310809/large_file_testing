You can't even get away to be a politically incorrect character, because that is seen as being politically incorrect. \n“Everyone's down on everyone for everything.” Jennifer Saunders has revealed that an illiberal culture has made Ab Fab impossible now (Photo: PA) Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Saunders in character at Patsy and Eddie (Photo: Rex) Read More 'Patsy and Edina' to host gala marking 25 years of Absolutely Fabulous \nThe 58 year-old's co-star, Joanna Lumley, added that it was best to “leave it where it is”. \n“The world's a bit funny now, it's gone a bit strange, it's a bit harder to parody,” she continued. “Because so much of the world right now is so grim, and hard and fearful, and people so take affront at everything.” \nIt comes just a year after the Ab Fab movie hit cinema screens ina flurry of drama by so-called liberals such as Korean-American actress Margaret Cho , who took offence at the Huku Muki character. The duo are two of the most beloved British comedy characters (Photo: BBC) Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie received mixed reviews, but was a commercial success Read More Absolutely Fabulous co-creator Jennifer Saunders says 'Pat's yer lot' as she calls time on popular sitcom \nShe tweeted: \"I AM F***ING SICK OF YELLOWFACE. Have some respect. Hire Asian actors 4 Asian roles... I'm DISGUSTED! (sic)\" \nIn a series of posts on Twitter, she wrote: \"I love AbFab but #YELLOWFACE is something I cannot watch - I just can't. It's sad when heroes are no longer heroic. Too bad. #racism. \nHowever, in a typical display of inconsistent principles, liberals - including feminists - said nothing about the storyline which suggested a 15 year-old Jon Hamm had been raped by Lumley's character.
