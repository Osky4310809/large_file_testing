Almost 30% of pregnant women in the most deprived areas are smokers, compared to just 4.5% in wealthier parts of the country. \nThe report looks at 25 health rates including asthma, diabetes and epilepsy, as well as obesity, breastfeeding and mortality, to provide a snapshot of health and wellbeing. \nIt says Scotland leads the way with high vaccination rates, few cases of tooth decay and a decline in suicide rates amongst young people. \nBut the report adds: \"Child health in Scotland is amongst the poorest in western Europe.\" \nIt found that children who live in poverty in Scotland are more likely to be overweight or obese, have a mother who smoked during pregnancy, and be exposed to alcohol or drug misuse. In numbers: The health of Scotland's children 210,000 \nChildren live in poverty in Scotland \n400 Children and infants die each year - a \"significant\" number are potentially avoidable. \n27% of all children in Scotland are overweight or obese. \n29% of pregnant women in deprived areas are smokers. \n15.4% of mothers in deprived areas were exclusively breastfeeding after six weeks. State of Child Health report Getty Images \nDr Steve Turner, RCPCH officer for Scotland, said: \"The Scottish government has repeatedly said that children are a priority, and its focus on strong early years provision is heartening. \n\"But there are significant gaps and the problem of health inequalities is continuing to grow. \n\"It is startling that over 29% of pregnant women in the most deprived areas are smokers, compared to just 4.5% in the least deprived, putting babies at risk of complications during pregnancy and birth and increasing the likelihood of cot death or still birth. \n\"Before a child is even born they are set on a path to ill health. This simply cannot be allowed to continue.\" \nThe report recommends extending the smoking ban to school grounds, sports fields and playgrounds, raising awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding, and measuring child health rates more regularly. \nIt suggests taking steps to implement 20mph zones in built up areas to create more safe places for children to walk, cycle and play, and to reduce the proximity of fast food outlets to schools, colleges and leisure centres.

This is why this government has committed to ensuring the best start for all our children. \n\"The State of Child Health report recommendations provide focus to develop this further; including delivering on our Programme for Government a commitment to produce a child health and wellbeing strategy. \n\"We look forward to working with RCPCH to take this forward to improve all children's health over the next 10 years and beyond.\" 'Irrevocably damaged' \nHowever, the Scottish government came in for criticism from opposition parties on the results of the report. \nMiles Briggs, of the Scottish Conservatives, said it was proof that the SNP was doing little to tackle key health issues across Scotland. \nScottish Labour's inequalities spokeswoman Monica Lennon described the findings as \"simply appalling\". \n\"This report highlights the failings of the SNP's decade in power to halt the impact deprivation has on a raft of health and wellbeing issues from smoking to breastfeeding,\" she said. \n\"Another Â£327m of cuts to schools and social care departments across Scotland will only make this worse. We need to take a different path.\" \nMeanwhile, Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Lib Dems' health spokesman said: \"Scotland should aspire to be a world leader in children's health, yet our children have some of the worst health outcomes in Western Europe. 'Shocking report' \n\"Experts are quite right to warn that unless we take dramatic action now then some children's lives will be irrevocably damaged. \n\"We need dramatic action to curb smoking, obesity and child mortality now. To kick this issue down the road is to doom another generation to ill health and dramatically reduced prospects.\" \nThe Scottish Greens' Alison Johnstone said the \"shocking report\" proved that a \"transformation\" was needed in how government approaches the issue. \nShe called for an allowance for young carers and promotion of the living wage to prevent in-work poverty. \n\"We also need to see a shift in spending to make it easy to be active every day,\" she added. \n\"The lack of funding for walking and cycling while motorways and air travel are set to benefit, and the deep cuts planned to sports agencies and council services, show that Scottish ministers haven't grasped how serious the situation is.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:34:21.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
