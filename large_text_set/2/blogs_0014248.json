The Los Angeles resident who was previously from Penn Hills went to England to film a movie. \nProsecutors say Miller was dishonest and only fessed up to her real income after a bankruptcy judge saw her on TV in 2012 and figured she had to be lying. They’re seeking a prison sentence of up to 30 months. \nMiller’s attorneys say their client simply got caught up in her fame and fortune, but always intended to repay her debts. They’re seeking probation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:37:12.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
