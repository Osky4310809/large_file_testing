I wake up feeling a little more sluggish than the two days before. My body is tired and my mind is over the day before I even leave bed. This frustrates me.\nI stare at my Facebook and Instagram repeatedly for a solid 30 minutes before I pull myself out of bed because, well, to be honest, I had to pee. But also because it was almost 9:30am and sleeping longer would just make me feel like a bum. I make it to the bathroom and as I sit cold and tired on the toilet I realize “today is one of those days.”\nImmediately I begin trying to clear my mind of all of these negative thoughts, stressing myself that my thoughts WILL cause this day to be horrible.\nI make my way to the charger on the living room floor where I continue to slump in my sleepy sorrows, even alerting my hero of a boyfriend that this “wasn’t my day.”\nForcing myself, I make it to my cup of coffee and find my way to the patio. I figure a little caffeine and prayer in my favorite spot will turn this day around. And now, here I sit.\nI’m trying to pull my mind away from everything storming through it. I’m beating myself up over being tired and I’m annoyed that my coffee isn’t doing its job. But then something hits me. I’m allowed to have bad days. Why do I have to be so damn hard on myself? I’ve spent the last two days being active, accomplishing goals and tackling tasks. Why did I not find myself deserving of a mental health day?\nWe look at days off or breaks as slacking off or not pushing ourselves. But maybe sometimes we aren’t meant to be pushed. Maybe some days it’s okay to have a bad day. I think our problem is that we insist on calling it a “bad” day instead of what it really is–a mental health day.\nOur mental health is the center of our well-being. Our bodies talk to us. We just rarely slow down enough to listen. A bad day is your mind telling you, “I need you to take a break.” We don’t realize how many things are manifesting in our subconscious. Without the time to breathe, release, and heal we hold on to all of this negativity. This causes us stress which is only gasoline for the fire that is our mental and physical health.\nBad days, or mental health days as we’re calling them now, are days where you just need to allow your body and mind the rest they need without beating yourself up for it. When we become in tune with our bodies wants and needs, we become happier.\nNo matter your beliefs on life, I think we can all gather that while on earth we are learning every single day. If we don’t give ourselves the time we need to process, analyze, and get rid of unwanted storage we will overload. (Nothing positive comes from overloading)\nI’m blessed enough to be surrounded by people who understand this. Who support my mental health days and have mental health days of their own. I realized when I surrounded myself with people who were patient and understanding with me , I became more patient and understanding of myself.\nAbove all, you have to be kind to yourself. Love yourself and remember you are growing. Always cheer yourself on. Allow yourself to be strong. More importantly, allow yourself to be weak.\nThe best news about mental health/bad days; they never last forever. Tomorrow is a new day. For now just kick today’s ass! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T07:03:20.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
