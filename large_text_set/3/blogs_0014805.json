Though it's unclear when the performance took place, the retro video was recently shared on YouTube by Q Productions, an entertainment company started by Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla. At press time, the video has over 26,000 views.\nIn it, the late singer appears effervescent and energetic as she covers the classic '80s hit. Her flawless cover of the English-language song also serves as further proof that she was always destined for success in the American music industry before her untimely death in 1995. Coincidentally, her final and perhaps most popular album was titled Dreaming of You .\nWatch Selena's mesmerizing cover of \"Only in My Dreams,\" above. You won't be able to take your eyes off her.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouxN_YT5HmE"], "published": "2017-03-18T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T07:27:32.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
