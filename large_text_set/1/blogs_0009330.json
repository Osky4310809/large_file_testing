On the borders with Poland and Czech Republic, 155 and 106 people were arrested respectively.

Authorities have not revealed the number of actual convictions in any of the cases. \nDespite the staggering number of arrests, rates of human trafficking has actually dropped from the record-breaking 2015, when all of Europe was overwhelmed by an all-out refugee and migration route crisis. \nThe German Federal Police detained 3,370 suspects in 2015, according to the German paper. \nAuthorities say the decrease in migration to Germany is as a result of the closure of the Balkan route which used to be most popular passageway into EU, until the bloc negotiated an agreement with Turkey to send those crossing illegally back. \nREAD MORE: German interior minister wants federal ‘departure centers’ to speed up deportations \nA heated debate is ongoing in the EU over migration policies coinciding with increased terrorist acts and threats.

This has sparked anti-immigration protests and radical proposals such as that from the Christian Social Union (CSU), and of course, the far-right AfD. \nThe CSU is championing a program called ‘Germany must remain Germany’, reportedly authored by the Prime Minister of the southern state of Bavaria, Horst Seehofer. The document, according to a report by local Munich media, seeks to impose stricter limits on entrance than those of Merkel’s CDU government. \nHowever, the charter will still offer mercy to “those in need of protection,” and propose new Turkey-like refugee agreements with third countries in order to relieve the EU’s external borders and further reduce human trafficking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:31:17.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
