She had to do this 40-minute walk to school twice a day, five days a week, but she didn’t mind. She dropped her rucksack at the door of the mud hut she shared with her dad, mum and five brothers, sisters and nieces in a rural village in Taiwan. Before anyone could spot her, she ran as quickly as her legs could carry her into the rice fields. \nShe could hear her mum shuffling out of the front door, and – like most days – she was waving a bamboo stick, trying to get her youngest daughter back into the house to help cook the sweet potatoes. But there were trees to climb and fields to dig in – and that was much more fun for Su-Man. \nFast-forward nearly 50 years, and Su-Man, now 53, has set up shop in a swanky London hotel, where A-list actresses wait for weeks for an appointment to experience one of her facials – which Anne Hathaway once described as ‘life-changing’. \n\"I never knew I’d find myself here,\" Su-Man says modestly. \"None of it was planned, but I worked for it all.\" \nGrowing up, she had no phone, no TV, and only candlelight to do her homework. Her tiny village in Taiwan was made up of just four other families, and Su-Man’s hut was usually overcrowded, with five or six people often staying in one small wooden bed.

Like a greenhouse,\" she remembers. \"Mushrooms grow at night so I would get up at four in the morning and pick them. The moonlight made them look magical. My father also taught me how to look at the sky and tell what the weather would be the next day. Even now, I still use that trick.\" Secret passion \nBut other jobs were less fun, and living on a farm meant there was always more work to be done. \n\"We had geese, ducks, chickens, pigs, dogs, cats and an ox – and they all had their own shed and huts!\" says Su-Man. When typhoon season hit, the family struggled to keep all the huts standing. \"We had to put ropes over the sheds and tie them down to baskets filled with heavy stones to keep the roofs on,\" explains Su-Man. \nSchool was a lengthy walk away, but also a welcome break from her hectic family life. At 16, when it was time to choose special subjects, she decided on business. Su-Man thought getting into a money-making industry might take her away from the mud hut and into the city. But her plans quickly changed, and her life took a completely different turn; all because she signed up for an after-school ballet class. Su-Man left Taiwan to become a dancer, then trained as a skincare specialist – she now has her own skincare range (Photo: Su-Man Hsu) Read More How old is your skin?

I was amazed by the dance teacher – the way her body moved, how elegant she looked,\" says Su-Man. \"I didn’t know if I could dance or not, but I knew right then that it was what I wanted to do.\" \nWithout telling her parents, she practised every day until she was good enough to audition for a dance college in the capital Taipei. It took her hours to get there and she was one of the last to perform for the admissions panel. \n\"I watched the other girls through the door window, and they were all doing this type of backbend,\" says Su-Man. \"I knew I wouldn’t get in because I didn’t know how to do it – I’d never been taught it. When it was my turn, they asked me to perform that move, and I did. I said, 'Sorry,' thinking it had gone wrong, then left.\" \nAssuming she’d blown her chances, Su-Man went home to carry on with her business studies – but her heart wasn’t in it any more. Then, after losing all hope, she heard her name being yelled from outside. \n\"A man was running through the fields shouting at me and waving a newspaper,\" she says. \"I went over and he told me I’d made it into the college. We didn’t have post, so the paper was the only way we found out about these things.\" A new venture \nLife wasn’t easy, and to cover the college costs, Su-Man worked tirelessly. In the day, she’d practise her dancing and at night she was completely exhausted, but worked in bars and restaurants. At the end of her three years of college, she knew she wanted more. When one of her dance teachers showed them a video of the famous dancer Pina Bausch performing at a dance college in Germany, she decided she wanted to start a new life there. \n\"I didn’t have any money to get to Germany so my sister bought me a one-way ticket to Frankfurt,\" she says. \"I didn’t think about what I would do when I got there, I just knew I wanted to go. At that time I didn’t speak English or German so I had no way of talking to anyone.\" \nBut things have a funny way of working out for Su-Man, and although she never actually made it into the dance school in the end, she was hired by a theatre company – after auditioning for them while waiting for her student visa to be cleared. After that, she spent the rest of her twenties touring around Europe appearing in all sorts of musical productions. \nIt was only then, in her mid-thirties, that Su-Man thought about venturing into skincare. She’d never really considered it as a career choice before, but she’d always had a passion for massage, ever since suffering a back injury when she was younger. \n\"I went to a Shiatsu (a Japanese version of acupuncture) master to fix the pain, and it hurt, but after six months all my back problems were gone. He told me my chi [aura] was blocked,\" says Su-Man. \"That’s how I got interested in touch and how it could heal.\" \nSo, while still dancing, Su-Man learned Shiatsu and pilates. \n\"Everything happened by coincidence, I never planned to be a dancer or a facialist. I didn’t want to go to school again, so I learned about skincare from a Japanese teacher in London and from another teacher in Taiwan when I went back to visit. It took over a decade to learn,\" she says. Actress Juliette Binoche \nStarting as a mobile beauty therapist, Su-Man used her unique Shiatsu-inspired approach to massage her clients – and her name soon made its way around the beauty industry. One day, actress Juliette Binoche asked her to be her personal facialist, and she’s been in demand ever since. \n\"Nicole Kidman once called me three times, but at that time I was touring with Juliette – she called me 'the best kept secret she didn’t want to share'.\" says Su-Man. \nNow, her client list ranges from Anne Hathaway to Freida Pinto, and she books up quickly when award season rolls around. Anne Hathaway describes Su-Man’s facials as ‘life-changing’ (Photo: Splash) \nHer facials became such a hit that her clients began asking for the names of the products she used. \n\"I didn’t use regular brands, because I was never happy with them – they were so often full of cheap oils and parabens,\" says Su-Man. \"I used my own ingredients, like plant and flower oils, to make everything fresh.\" \nAfter a while, she decided to launch her own beauty range, called Su-Man skincare, so that she could recommend people something she really believed in. \nNow, living in London with her husband and two daughters, 18 and 12, Su-Man still laughs at the road that lead her here. \n\"It’s funny how life can take you in so many different directions, but I worked for it,\" she says – and it’s true, she did.
