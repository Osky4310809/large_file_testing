The majority Republicans supported the measure, which now moves to the full Senate. \nCritics said the bill repeats the dangerous myth that more gun training will turn English teachers and custodians into experts at close-quarter combat. \n“I am going to be a kindergarten teacher and I don’t want to worry about a gun in my possession or one of my colleagues having a gun in their possession,” said Carly Dougherty, whose aunt was killed during the assault at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. \nBut the bill’s proponents said having school staff members take gun training will discourage someone from targeting a classroom. \n“My office is always fielding phone calls from schools and teachers who want to know how they can make the next angry, young man rethink his next move,” said Dudley Brown, head of the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners. \nThe districts with the policies say they are requiring the type of training routinely required of deputies and police officers. \n“People think we are just offering up guns for anybody on our staff to use, and that is not the case,” said Randy Underwood, a member of the Hanover School District school board in eastern El Paso County. \nHanover, which boasts an enrollment of 270 students, is now hammering out its policy that security will be provided by staff members with a conceal-carry permit who undergo annual training that meets school insurability standards. \nUnderwood voices the thoughts of rural school officials who say even the hint that some school personnel are willing to draw weapons to secure the safety of students will make a prospective attacker think twice before acting. \n“I think posting signs saying this is a ‘Gun-Free Zone’ has been a disservice and puts people in danger,” Underwood said. “It just makes a school a soft target.” \nBut Hanover Board President Mark McPherson said arming school teachers will be ineffective. \nA retired Army officer, McPherson was one of two school board members who opposed the idea when it was approved by a 3-2 vote in December. \n“I don’t think you can ask a teacher, no matter their training, to react to a situation where they have to decide whether to draw a weapon and kill someone.” McPherson said. “There is no way I could support something like this.” \nHanover’s move also alarmed Eileen McCarron, a retired educator who is with Colorado Ceasefire. \n“Throughout the day, teachers are in close proximity to students, in addition to accidents we are placing loaded weapons inches from individuals who have far less restraint than adults,” she said. “The idea of having teachers carrying loaded weapons in the classroom is ludicrous.” \nFleming School District , in Logan County, last year began allowing one or more of its employees to act as security officers and be authorized to carry firearms on school property. The district is training its educators with the help of a three-person committee headed up by sheriff’s personnel. \nFleming Superintendent Steve McCraken said the school officials involved are trained far beyond what is required by the Colorado School District’s Self Insurance Pool. The process includes a psychological evaluation, a voice-stress analysis and at least a week of active-shooter training. \n“This is something the district and the community have talked about for quite a while, and we think this is the best solution we came up with,” McCraken said. \nFleming has no local police department, and the sheriff is about 20 minutes away. Parent Carmen Vandenbark said the approach by the district, given its isolation, is the most practical. \n“It’s a very proactive approach and I’m very supportive of it,” said Vandenbark, whose children attend junior and senior high school. “In the case of an emergency, we know we can rely on a highly trained staff member.” \nBriggsdale, which boasts an enrollment of 180 in grades K-12, is about 35 minutes from Greeley and Fort Collins. Briggsdale officials felt especially vulnerable after the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012, when 20 children and six adults were shot to death by a gunman. \n“There was a six-minute response time,” Mondt said of the tragedy at the Connecticut school. “Just how long would it take for anybody to get out here to help should we have the same kind of attack?” \nBriggsdale started reworking its emergency plan and asks those staff members who sign up for extra security duty to hold a conceal carry permit, participate in training courses twice a year, provide proof they shoot 100 rounds at a certified range every month and complete tactical medical training. \nMondt concedes a gun attack is highly unlikely. Students and staff members face greater danger from a tornado or an occasional rattlesnake in the school parking lot, he said. \nStill, it pays to be ready for any emergency, Mondt said, and the school’s gun stance has been applauded by many. \n“Sure, there are some parents who are not excited about people having guns in the school,” he said. “But you’d also be surprised about how many schools, including private schools, churches and others who have called us, asking us how we got this done.” \nIndeed, there could be more than a dozen of Colorado’s 179 school districts with such policies, said Michelle Murphy, executive director of the Colorado Rural Schools Alliance. But the Colorado Department of Education does not keep track or require districts to let the state department know their security policies. \n“There is a great deal of interest around the state among school districts interested in protecting their kids this way,” Murphy said. \nWeld County Sheriff Steve Reams supports districts taking the initiative to provide for security. There are three school districts in Weld County that are arming their staffs. \n“Given the isolation of a lot of these places,” Reams said, “there is a huge potential for something really bad to happen.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:55:06.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
