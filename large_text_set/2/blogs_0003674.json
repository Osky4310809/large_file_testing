An announcement is expected to come on Tuesday. \nAs Waldstein notes, Teixeira is no stranger to the lifestyle, having guest hosted ESPN’s “Mike & Mike” sports talk show in 2014, made other radio appearances, and appeared on Showtime’s “Billions.” \nTeixeira, 36, retired after the 2016 season during which he hit a meager .204/.292/.362 with 15 home runs and 44 RBI over 438 plate appearances. He battled neck, foot, and knee injuries during the season, hampering his abilities. However, Teixeira certainly retired as one of the game’s better-hitting first basemen, cranking out 409 home runs, knocking in 1,298 runs, and compiling an .869 OPS across parts of 14 seasons with the Rangers, Braves, Angels, and Yankees. He was quite slick with the glove as well, earning five Gold Glove Awards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:03:59.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
