Â© Sketch by Pastor Glen Strock for the glory of Jesus Christ. By Jack Zavada Updated February 28, 2017 . \nKing David was a man of contrasts. He was single-mindedly committed to God, yet guilty of some of the most serious sins recorded in the Old Testament . \nDavid lived a frustrating life, first in the shadow of his brothers, then constantly on the run from vengeful King Saul . Even after he became king of Israel, David was engaged in almost constant warfare to defend the kingdom. King David was a great military conqueror, but he could not conquer himself. He allowed one night of lust with Bathsheba , and it had disastrous consequences in his life. \nAlthough King David fathered Solomon , one of Israel's greatest kings, he was also the father of Absalom, whose rebellion brought bloodshed and grief. \nKing David's life was a roller coaster of emotional highs and lows. He left us an example of passionate love of God and dozens of psalms , some of the most touching, beautiful poetry ever written. King David's Accomplishments \nDavid killed Goliath , champion of the Philistines, when David was only a youth and Goliath a giant and veteran warrior. David was victorious because he trusted in God for the victory, not himself. \nHe killed many of Israel's enemies in battle. \nDespite several opportunities, David refused to kill King Saul, God's first anointed king, who was pursuing David out of mad jealousy. \nHe became friends, like brothers, with Saul's son Jonathan , setting a model of friendship that everyone can learn from. \nKing David is included in the \" Faith Hall of Fame \" in Hebrews 11. \nDavid was an ancestor of Jesus Christ . Jesus was often called \"Son of David.\" \nGod called David a man after his own heart. King David's Strengths \nDavid was courageous and strong in battle, trusting in God for protection. \nHe was loyal to Saul, despite Saul's crazed pursuit of him. \nDavid loved God deeply throughout his entire life. King David's Weaknesses \nKing David committed adultery with Bathsheba. He then tried to cover up her pregnancy, and when he failed with that, he had her husband Uriah the Hittite killed. \nHe took a census of the people, willfully violating God's command not to do that. \nKing David was sometimes lax, or absent as a father , not disciplining his children when they needed it. Life Lessons \nHonest self-examination is necessary to recognize our own sin, then we must repent of it. We may try to fool ourselves or others, but we cannot hide our sin from God. \nGod always offers forgiveness for our sins, but we cannot escape the consequences. \nGod highly values our faith in him. Despite life's ups and downs, God is ever-present to give us comfort and help. Hometown \nBethlehem , City of David in Jerusalem.
