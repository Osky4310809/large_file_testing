George Faught and seeks to prevent abortions done because of a genetic abnormality or Down syndrome. Again, there would be no exception for victims of rape or incest. \nThat caused Rep. Cory Williams to ask his colleague if rape is the will of God. Faught responded, “If you read the Bible, there’s actually a couple circumstances where that happened and the Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but it’s a reality, unfortunately.” \nWilliams then questioned if incest is the will of God, and Faught brushed him off, saying he had the same answer, but that it wasn’t relevant. Williams argued that it was relevant, which is when Faught said this: \nIt’s a great question to ask, and, obviously if it happens in someone’s life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened. But, so you’re saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone’s life and can’t use anything and everything in someone’s life, and I disagree with that. \nFaught later sent the local NBC affiliate a statement that said, “Life, no matter how it is conceived, is valuable and something to be protected. Let me be clear, God never approves of rape or incest. However, even in the worst circumstances, God can bring beauty from ashes.” \nThe bill passed with 67 votes and will head to the Senate, but it is just one of many attempted abortion restrictions in the state. \n[image: screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
