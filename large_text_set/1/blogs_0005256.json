What it says about his economic performance can be summed up in one word: Lackluster.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the economy created a modest 156,000 new jobs in December, while the unemployment rate remained essentially unchanged at 4.7%.\nReuters, however, took this news as evidence that the economy is nearing full employment, and the White House boasted that it marks the 75 th consecutive month of job growth — \"more than two years longer than the next-longest streak.\" The current unemployment rate is as low as it was just before the recession hit.\nBut look at the job market in the proper context, and Obama's record is pretty dismal.\nConsider that in 2016, the number of jobs grew by 2 million. Sounds impressive, doesn't it? But the working-age population increased by 2.8 million.\nSince 2010, the population climbed by an average of 2.5 million a year. Job growth, however, has averaged 2.2 million.\nSo while Obama brags about 15-plus million new private sector jobs created since early 2010, what he leaves out is that the population of people who can work climbed by almost 18 million.\nNot only has the economy not been able to close the jobs gap opened by the recession, that gap has gotten wider during the agonizingly slow recovery and expansion since the recession ended in June 2009. (See the nearby chart.)\nBut what about the unemployment rate? Well, unlike previous economic expansions, the main reason the unemployment rate is down today is that a stunning 14 million have given up looking for work, and so no longer get counted as unemployed.\nThat can be seen by the sharp decline in the labor force participation rate, which was at 65.7% when Obama took office and is just 62.7% as he leaves it.\nHad those millions not given up searching for a job, the official unemployment rate would be more like 9% today.\nYes, some of this growth in the out-of-the-labor-force population is the result of the baby boom generation starting to hit retirement age, but not nearly all of it. Plus, a larger share of seniors are working today than when Obama took office.\nThe lackluster growth since 2010 explains a lot of things. It explains why incomes have been largely stagnant. It explains why so many people jumped onto the Social Security Disability Insurance program. It explains why the public has been so pessimistic about the economy. And it explains why the working class largely abandoned Obama and his chosen successor in November in favor of Donald Trump.\nThe question going forward is whether this sluggish job growth is a permanent fixture of the economy, or whether it's the result of bad public policy.\nOur view has consistently been that the economic recovery from the Great Recession could have been — and should have been — very robust. And that the only reason it wasn't is growth-choking policies imposed by Obama: Dodd-Frank, ObamaCare, tax hikes, huge new regulatory burdens.\nIf Trump manages to turn these policies around, we have no doubt that the days of mediocre job growth will be a thing of the past.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:22:25.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
