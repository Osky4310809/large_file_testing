Yiannopoulos, a political provocateur, resigned from his position at Breitbart today. \"Gee, sorry that book deal just went south,\" Todd said of Simon & Schuster's decision to pull Yiannopoulos' upcoming book . Chuck Todd, however, used this as an opportunity to say Yiannopoulos is not worth listening to and that free speech \"does not mean giving someone a free platform to spread hate or nonsense.\" \"You have some extra time on your hands this weekend to think, and we in the media have time on our hands to consider that free speech does not mean giving someone a free platform to spread hate or nonsense,\" Todd advised Yiannopoulos without naming him. Chuck Todd's full remarks: CHUCK TODD: Welcome back tonight, I'm obsessed with someone many people in Washington are talking about who's just not worth talking about. And I'm telling you right now, I'm not naming names. You want to troll for attention, pull a few muscles trying to become click bait, make yourself an alt-right hero, then knock yourself out. But, please, can we all stop paying attention to this nonsense? What's the point of giving time and space to someone who, as one conservative commentator put it, is just pointlessly provocative. When you're saying things just to get a book deal, and gee, sorry that that book deal just went south, and it's our job to sometimes stop listening. And no, it did not require nuance to understand what you meant when you endorsed adults having sex with 13-year-olds requires the rest of us to realize it's a bunch of nonsense and you're not somebody that's worth listening to. So now that the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) swiped back it's invitation to you to speak at the CPAC meeting, you have some extra time on your hands this weekend to think, and we in the media have time on our hands to consider that free speech does not mean giving someone a free platform to spread hate or nonsense. Even if it does mean more clicks. Related Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:27:58.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
