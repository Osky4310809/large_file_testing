The patient's not waiting any longer for anything to be started on their care,\" Kapadia said. \nThe physician may be on call, meaning he or she is speaking to patients from home. But the physician can still order blood tests and imaging, making real progress on the patient's case even though the patient may be sent right back out to the hospital's waiting room. \n\"So, then when they do ultimately get into a room, a lot more information is already back,\" Kapadia said. \"It saves them an hour and allows us to turn over the room faster and get that next patient into a room.\" \nWheeler says his use of Skype and other technology made his TeleHealth experience a smooth one. \n\"It was very comfortable and natural. Any way you can get out of a hospital quicker is always a great thing,\" he said. \"But you certainly want to get taken care of, and I felt like I got the attention I needed.\" \nDuke's pilot program ends in April, but the hospital has already identified it as a useful technology, so officials plan on expanding the TeleHealth Cart's use in emergency care.
