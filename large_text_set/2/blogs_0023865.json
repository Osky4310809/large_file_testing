From the epic Bang Bang Dare to his more recent video for Rustom , our man always goes all out. \nRanveer and Alia Bhatt are doing Zoya Akhtar ‘s Gully Boys soon. Varun Dhawan and Ranveer also share a friendship. So it makes perfect sense that Ranveer has contributed to Badrinath Ki Dulhania promotions. \nWhy is he a sardar in it though? Was Ranveer shooting for something or is this just Ranveer being Ranveer? :P \n— Ranveer Singh (@RanveerOfficial) February 26, 2017 \nLove this!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:10:59.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
