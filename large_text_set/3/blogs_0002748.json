Rams placed franchise tag on CB Trumaine Johnson, per source. Another player tagged before today's 4 pm deadline. \n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 1, 2017 \nAs perhaps the best player at his position on the market, Johnson was too expensive for the Rams to sign to a long-term deal, prompting them to use exercise the franchise tag option on him for the second season in a row.

McDonald could get overpaid \nThe tag comes with a 20 percent increase over last year’s nearly $14 million, which means the 27-year-old defensive back will make about $16.7 million this year. \nHad he hit the market, Johnson could have been looking at a significant deal. Spotrac listed his calculated market value for a four-years at $49,636,571, or $12.4 million annually. Related: Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson is a Top 25 free agent this offseason \nThe tag makes it clear that the Rams are going all in on defense this year, presumably with the knowledge that the unit will have to sustain them as they work out the various kinks and limitations on offense. \nThe defensive line is in great shape with Aaron Donald, William Hayes, Robert Quinn, linebacker Alec Ogletree and former safety-turned-linebacker Mark Barron. \nMaintaining Johnson in the secondary means the Rams have a real shot at putting together an elite unit under Wade Phillips in 2017.
