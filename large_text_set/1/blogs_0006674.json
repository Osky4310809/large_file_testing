As calls for change to the entitlement rules have intensified, acting Special Minister of State Kelly O'Dwyer said the government would soon act to \"streamline\" the system and make sure taxpayers are confident their dollars are being spent properly. The Coalition had already accepted in-principle 36 recommendations made by an independent review early in 2016. \"There have been 36 recommendations, probably the most significant of which is looking at what is parliamentary official business,\" Ms O'Dwyer said on Tuesday afternoon, committing to changes in the \"first half\" of this year. \"A clear definition of what official business is is obviously at the centre of the changes that need to be made and will be made by the government in order to give the Australian people confidence that their hard-earned taxpayer dollars are respected and they can have confidence in the system.\" Interpretations of \"official business\" to justify travel expenses have been at the centre of several notorious scandals, including former speaker Bronwyn Bishop's $5227 claim for a helicopter ride to a Liberal Party fundraiser in 2015 and, most recently, Ms Ley's travel to the Gold Coast. On the most high profile trip for which such expenses were claimed, Ms Ley - who has now stood down pending the outcomes of two reviews of her expanse claims - bought a $795,000 apartment at the popular holiday destination. She also charged taxpayers for two New Year's Eve trips that took in events with businesswoman and Liberal donor Sarina Russo - justified as \"business conversations\" - and has claimed for 27 flights in and out of the Gold Coast in recent years. The review in question - led by Remuneration Tribunal president John Conde - recommended clearer definitions between party political duties, office duties, electorate duties and personal matters. The review also urged changing the language from \"entitlements\" to \"work expenses\", explicitly banning the use of the Comcar chauffeur service for \"primarily personal\" journeys, bolstering the Finance Department's expense auditing capacity, extending a 25 per cent financial penalty on erroneous travel expense claims to all claims and more regular publication of expense reports. The government will simplify the existing system, which is currently governed by a patchwork of acts of parliament, independent determinations and executive orders. Fairfax Media understands the consolidation of this complex network into one piece of legislation is currently being drafted and will be dealt with promptly after Parliament returns. The government has so far acted on three Conde recommendations, including one which suggested giving a third electorate office to MPs representing the \"big six\" seats , covering more than 500,000 square kilometres. The government expanded this change, giving a third office to a seventh MP with a large rural electorate. Momentum for reform has been revived following the latest scandal, with Greens leader Richard Di Natale warning that the regular expenses flare-ups are helping to erode faith in democracy at a crucial point in history, fuelling populism and bringing Australia to a point where \"our democracy is in real trouble\". Acting Opposition Leader Penny Wong and shadow special minister of state Don Farrell said Labor has \"consistently made it very clear\" they would help to implement the Conde review's recommendations, criticising the government for failing to act sooner. Crossbench MP Andrew Wilkie and Senate powerbroker Nick Xenophon have also called for urgent amendments. Senator Di Natale said \"the most effective way of restoring a bit of faith in the political process is to establish a national anti-corruption watchdog\". Also known as a federal ICAC, the Greens have long campaigned for such a body to be introduced and party would want it empowered to advise politicians on their expense claims and audit if needed. \"So we can spend the next few days talking about Sussan Ley or we can talk about the fact that this is an ongoing, systemic problem that requires long-term change,\" the Greens leader told ABC radio. \"We've got people who are turning to these populist movements who offer nothing in terms of genuine and meaningful reform for the country. And it really is putting us in a position where, I think, our democracy is in real trouble. \"This is much broader than just an individual entitlements scandal. This is undermining faith in democracy. And we're at a very low ebb at the moment. Unless we start to get these institutions right, I fear for the future of the country.\" The focus on recent expense claims has broadened from Ms Ley to include four ministers charging taxpayers almost $7000 to attend Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's exclusive harbourside New Year's Eve reception at the close of 2015. Guardian Australia has also reported that former prime minister Tony Abbott charged taxpayers more than $3000 to travel to Brisbane for a trip that included attendance at former Liberal minister Santo Santoro's 60th birthday party. On Tuesday, Ms O'Dwyer refused to comment on Ms Ley's troubles, citing the ongoing investigations into the Health Minister's expenses, saying that \"the Australian people have high expectations in relation to parliamentary claims for work expenses\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T10:29:38.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
