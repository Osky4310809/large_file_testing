The company says it will release the Switch on March 3 for a price of $299.99 in the US (£279.99 in the UK and 29,980 yen in Japan,) more than analysts and gamers had been expecting. \nNintendo unveiled the Switch in October last year, revealing that the games machine would act as both a home console as well as a portable device. It will come with traditional “Pro Controller” for home use, and Joy-Con controllers that can either attach to the sides of the machine for true handheld gaming, or be removed to create a controller which can also detect movement like the Wii Remote.

The Pro Controller costs $69.99 (£57.50), additional Joy-Con controllers are $79.99, and a spare dock to use the Switch with another TV or monitor is $89.99. \nGames will be bought and played on small retro-style cartridges, and Nintendo has said that about 80 games are already in development — including a new Mario game called Super Mario Odyssey . \nOther details revealed that the console comes with 32GB of storage (extendable with a MicroSD card slot,) games will no longer be geo-locked, multiplayer online gaming will initially be free but later paid-for, and a smartphone app for social aspects of games will be revealed at a later date. \nWatch the full presentation below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T13:02:13.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
