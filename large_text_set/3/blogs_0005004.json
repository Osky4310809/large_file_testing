A new trailer teases guest appearances from Solange, Kim Gordon, Killer Mike, Big Sean, Usher, Big Boi, Kesha, and Ty Segall, who will apparently join Kurt Vile in playing a very squirrely version of himself on TV. Oh, and the trailer is soundtracked by Death Grips’“Hot Head.” Watch below. \nThe second season of Animals premieres 3/17 on HBO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T00:56:34.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
