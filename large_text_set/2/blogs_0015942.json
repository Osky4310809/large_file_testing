But Dallas also has a lot riding on the outcome of this trial. The city's political corruption has been well established in cases involving other public officials over the years; just how deeply is it rooted? Hows and whys: Looking back and ahead on John Wiley Price's corruption case before his trial \nPrice faces 11 counts of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud and income tax evasion. If convicted, he could face decades in prison and bring to a shameful end his reputation as \"Our Man Downtown,\" a moniker he's carefully crafted for more than three decades while representing southern Dallas County. \nPrice is accused of trading his political influence for nearly $1 million in money, cars and land. Fain and Nealy are accused of helping the commissioner secure and hide the bribes. All three have pleaded not guilty. \nA fourth defendant, Christian Lloyd Campbell, could buttress the government's case against Price. Campbell pleaded guilty in 2015 to helping funnel bribes to Price, with Nealy's help. \nAt the heart of this trial is whether Price and others have violated the public's trust. It's a trial that will see some of the city's most prominent business and political titans — from H. Ross Perot Jr. to former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk — take the stand, either as witnesses for the defendants, the government or both sides. Editorial: What Helena Tantillo's conviction says about the case against John Wiley Price \nWe should be prepared to hold all the appropriate parties, be they public officials or private actors, accountable for any criminal or unethical behavior. If, as some political observers have suggested, the government's case against Price and his co-defendants signals that corruption is a systemic problem in Dallas, we should all brace ourselves. \nIn many ways, this a pivotal moment — a trial that will shed light on the way Dallas does business. \nThe city has waited years for answers, from the time Price's office was raided in 2011, when he was indicted in 2014 and through two re-election bids, with Price maintaining his innocence throughout. \nWe are ready for the truth, whatever it is, to be known. It's time to let the evidence and facts speak for themselves. What's next? \nKey upcoming dates in the John Wiley Price public corruption trial: \nToday: Jury selection starts, and could run through Friday. Feb. 24 or 27: Testimony expected to begin, soon after a jury is seated. June 30: Prosecution and defense attorneys have agreed to wrap up the trial before this date.
