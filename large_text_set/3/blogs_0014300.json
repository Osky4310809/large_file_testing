Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nForget about the concession of another three goals, Pep Guardiola says Manchester City ’s problem was they didn’t attack enough in Monaco. \nHe was right. \nThe players’ instincts were clearly telling them, despite boss Guardiola ’s urgings to the contrary, that they had a two-goal advantage and to hold on to rather than to increase it. \nThey were caught between two mindsets — a normal footballing one and Guardiola’s idealistic one.

Leicester are transformed since sacking last season's hero Ranieri (Photo: Plumb Images/Leicester City/Getty) Read More Leicester boss defends Jamie Vardy after sent-off Samir Nasri's \"cheat\" jibe' \nManagers and players do fall out, but the single regrettable thing about what has unfolded at Leicester is that history might eventually downplay Ranieri’s role in one of the greatest club-football stories told. \nRight now, these players are sending out a message that says they won the title last season DESPITE Ranieri, not BECAUSE of him. \nThat’s sad. Will Leicester reach the Champions League semis? 500+ VOTES SO FAR NO WARNOCK'S NOT-SO-WISECRACK \nNeil Warnock has always been one of the most underrated managers in the game and has always had a tendency to let himself down now and again. \nWhen he said recently he did not worry about the sack because he would always get another job, Cardiff boss Warnock was right. \nThe context of his comments was Wigan’s dismissal of Warren Joyce just four months after he was recruited from Manchester United’s youth set-up. Cardiff boss Warnock will stay as popular as ever after his latest comments (Photo: Getty) \n“No disrespect but when Wigan appointed him, I was delighted,” said Warnock, whose Bluebirds were then battling with the Latics in the Championship's relegation scrap. \nAn underrated manager, yes. \nBut not hard to understand why some anagram-loving contemporaries know Neil Warnock as 'Colin'. STILL FAIRWAY TO GO FOR GOLF \nRory McIlroy is speaking his mind a lot nowadays. And it is brilliant. \nHe was not congratulating Muirfield on its decision to finally give up its men-only policy , but saying how it had been ‘obscene’ and that, when The Open returns there, he wouldn’t be having any cups of tea with the members, 20 per cent of whom still voted to keep women out. \nGood on him. \nPresumably and understandably, though, McIlroy - much younger then, and making his way - did not feel it appropriate to make any comment about Augusta’s refusal to allow women members which was still in force when he made his Masters debut in 2009. \nNot many golfers, if any, did. Golf has an even bigger 'ism' to deal with than the one highlighted at Muirfield (Photo: PA) \nAugusta relented in the summer of 2012 and gave the first female memberships to Condoleeza Rice and Darla Moore. \nRice is the former Secretary of State and Moore is a billionaire financier. \nMuirfield finally following Augusta’s lead is clearly a welcome, if ridiculously overdue, step. \nBut aspiring girl golfers from humble backgrounds should not be getting too excited. \nSexism in golf clubs has always been an issue. Elitism has always been a bigger one. Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T21:27:30.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
