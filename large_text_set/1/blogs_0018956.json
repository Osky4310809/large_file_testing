Don’t leave without: Getting lost in Lisbon’s beautiful tiled backstreets while scouting out the local artisan shops (the unusual ceramics make for perfect souvenirs). When the sun sets, immerse yourself in the city’s nightlife at the drinking parlours of Bairro Alto. Why it’s hot right now: Growing in popularity in recent years, Lisbon can now call itself one of Europe’s best city breaks, with some even naming it the new Berlin. The Madagascan Coast \nWhere to stay: The Anjajavy jungle hotel, where abundant wildlife meets discreet luxury, is made up of 25 rosewood villas with private decks overlooking the water. Look out for lemurs, chameleons, malachite kingfishers and hummingbirds in the surrounding forest. Don’t leave without: Taking a guided tour of the 450-hectare nature reserve, on foot, boat or wheels. Why it’s hot right now: If you loved Sri Lanka last year, then now’s the time to plan an exploration of Madagascar’s equally breathtaking landscapes. Oahu, Hawaii \nWhere to stay: Halekulani – which translates as “house befitting heaven”– is a dreamy escape on Honolulu’s Waikiki beach. It’s so chic that Vera Wang has even designed a suite here, with panoramic views of Diamond Head, the island’s volcanic crater. Don’t leave without: Tearing yourself away from the ocean for long enough to indulge in a Polynesian facial at the spa in Halekulani. For the adventurous, surfing on the North Shore is a must-try, while the cultured should pay a visit to Honolulu’s Museum of Art. Why it’s hot right now: Do paradise beaches, crystal-clear sea and seemingly endless blue skies ever go out of style? Alaçati, Turkey \nWhere to stay: Alavya, a former cinema converted into an exquisite 25-room hotel chock with antique Kilim rugs, rough-stone walls, Carrera marble bathrooms and eclectically-arranged artworks. Don’t leave without: Borrowing a bike and pootling around cobbled streets, or renting a car and driving to nearby Ephesus, the best-preserved classical Greek city on the Mediterranean. \nWhy it’s hot right now: A whispered destination for Istanbul’s well-heeled and in-the-know Europeans for a couple of years but the secret’s finally out: for a slice of authentic, bougainvillea-draped village life head to Turkey’s coast, and this tiny, wind-swept town. \nImage: Instagram.com/alavyahotel Cartagena, Colombia \nWhere to stay: Tucked away behind giant studded doors is perhaps the city’s most ambient spot: Casa San Augustin. Coral stone walls and 300-year-old frescoes add to the charm of this 30-room hotel, but it’s the courtyard pool built beneath the city’s original aquaduct that prompts an immediate intake of breath. \nDon’t leave without: Exploring Cartagena’s old town, where every step taken unveils a stunningly atmospheric colonial nook or cranny; booking a massage on the rooftop solarium, overlooking the brightly-coloured cathedral; or lounging in the library with a Colombian coffee and a refreshing Lulo cocktail. \nWhy it’s hot right now: Colombia is currently enjoying the middle ground between off-the-beaten-track and popular tourist destination. Many areas of the country previously deemed unsafe, known for its violent civil war, are now instead renowned for their vibrant culture and warm hospitality. Oman \nWhere to stay: For luxury, the beachside Al Bustan Palace Hotel (book a Legoon Room and dive straight from your private terrace into one of its decadent pools). For culture, the 198-room Al Bandar Hotel which, inspired by Old Muscat, is designed like a small village painted in shades of sand and ocher. Don’t leave without: Paying a visit to the awe-inspiring Royal Opera House and indulging in some retail therapy at Muttrah Souk, the city’s favourite market, where silver, incense, rugs and spices are all specialities. Why it’s hot right now: A hidden gem, Dubai’s lesser-known neighbour has resisted the trend of its close-by companions to build bigger and higher, meaning that it’s less touristy but just as luxurious. Buenos Aires, Argentina \nWhere to stay: Home Hotel in the relaxed Palermo Viejo neighbourhood is only a short walk from the city’s buzzing bars and restaurants, but a poolside cocktail in the peaceful garden is ideal for when you fancy an evening in. Don’t leave without: Sampling the city’s tantalising array of eateries. Tegui – hidden behind a graffitied wall in Palermo – is the best restaurant in Argentina and well worth a visit, as are the numerous steakhouses and wine bars that the country is famous for. Erdia and Dubie are cool local clothing brands to shop, while cutting-edge concept store Casa Cavia combines a florist, bookstore and perfumery – as well as restaurant. Why it’s hot right now: The colourful and romantic capital of Argentina has been capturing hearts for decades. With seductive 19th-Century architecture and famously vivacious nightlife (prepare to tango), there’s never been a better time to pay your first visit – or to return for another. Aarhus, Denmark \nWhere to stay: Carmel, a chic Twenties-style guesthouse, is set to be the city’s new hot spot when it opens its doors this summer. Don’t leave without: Making the most of the museums and galleries that Denmark’s second largest city has to offer (The ARoS Aarhus Art Museum should be top of your list). If you’ve rented a car, take the short trip to Mols Bjerge – one of the country’s four national parks. Why it’s hot right now: As the newly-appointed European Capital of Culture, this booming Danish city is no longer Scandinavia’s best-kept secret. Culinary prowess and well-being permeate the streets, right through from the gastronomic delights to the spacious cycling lanes. Tblisi, Georgia \nWhere to stay: Rooms Hotel’s Tblisi setting is in the charming Vera district, an urban oasis in the Georgian capital. Well situated for exploring the rich local culture and sampling the tasty delicacies, the hotel’s interiors are similarly inviting, marrying tradition and modernism. Don’t leave without: Admiring the architecture of Old Tbilisi, where spectacular buildings with latticework balconies appear to teeter on ledges, before stopping by the city’s famous hot, sulphurous spring baths for a soak. For shopping, spend a weekend day bartering at Dry Bridge market. Why it’s hot right now: The cobblestoned Georgian city is well known for the vibrant cultural scene that’s muddled in with The Old Town’s nostalgic charm. Plus, we’ve heard rumours that visitors are greeted with a bottle of wine at passport control.
