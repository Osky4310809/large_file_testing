I said I wanted to move closer to my parents, even though Blackburn is further from Wrexham than Birmingham. \nBut when all was said and done, I got my move – while Gold and Sullivan made a three-fold profit on the fee they paid for me. \nAlthough it is admirable for Bilic to make a stand and say Payet will not be sold, there is no point in keeping an unhappy player.

It happens all the time in football. I was once tapped up by two managers at the same time – one on the mobile and another on the landline at home. \nAnd if he had left in the summer, he could have remained a hero: Too hot to handle, too big for West Ham when European giants started flashing their chequebooks. \nBut now he is being vilified and crucified by West Ham fans. Luckily for me, social media hadn't come to the fore in 2002 because I'm not sure I could have handled the abuse, but West Ham supporters feel betrayed and I don't see any way back for him. \nThere have been a few cases of high-profile players wanting to leave their clubs but forcing their way back into the supporters' affections.

Well, if he wants to leave the London Stadium, I don't think he has gone about it the right way. Like I said, I should know because I've been there, worn the T-shirt and got hammered for it. Dimitri Payet in action (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nI downed tools and it got to the point where I was told to stay away from the training ground – but at least I was always available to play if needed. \nI've read comments from Hammers fans saying Payet should rot in the reserves because he only signed a five-year contract 12 months ago, but if West Ham went down that road, they would be cutting off their nose to spite their face. \nGet real, get rid – and make sure the £30 million-plus fee, which is not bad for a player who will be 30 in March, is spent much more wisely. \nYes, I was a disgrace – but the bottom line is that by forcing a move, I enjoyed my highest Premier League finish, played in Europe for Blackburn... and I made more money. poll loading Has Dimitri Payet played his last game for West Ham? 500+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T19:16:17.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
