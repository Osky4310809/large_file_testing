The conservative political commentator — an expert on the intricacies of race relations in the United States — threw her support behind the KGB Wednesday night before sending a vague tweet on Thursday that alluded to a number worshipped by white supremacists. Assange: It wasn’t the Russians or Putin! You know the Dem party has hit rock bottom when the KGB is telling the truth & the DNC is lying. \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) January 4, 2017 14! \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) January 5, 2017 \nCoulter is not unfamiliar with asinine outbursts on social media. She has even parroted legitimate neo-Nazi talking points . It’s hard for her to claim ignorance on the “14!” tweet — even though it’s obscure and lacks context. However, among white supremacists, the number 14 typically refers to a 14-word mission statement on white supremacy initially penned by a Klu Klux Klan member while in federal prison: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” Coulter’s subtext wasn’t lost on Twitter trolls, who were eager to welcome Coulter’s declaration of hate. \n@Mikel_Jollett @AnnCoulter What’s wrong with being a white nationalist exactly? — 1 9 1 6 (@PepeWillsItV3) January 5, 2017 @rasmansa @AnnCoulter We are awake and there is nothing you can do about it, pushed us to far Negro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:25:19.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
