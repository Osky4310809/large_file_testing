I knew nothing about automotive design or color and materials at the time but took the job anyway. My first day at work, I sat in a car with my boss and she explained every part of the car to me and then gave me Color and Trim responsibility for all our global small cars.

What’s your best time-saving shortcut life hack? \nI allocate time (as close to deadline as possible) to tasks that don’t have devastating consequences so I don’t meander and change my mind. I like to pack right before a trip, I will start packing 15-30 minutes before I have to leave for the airport... this gives everyone else anxiety. At work, I shift my schedule to come in extra early when the workload gets intense, so I have time alone without distractions. I will also block out hours on my calendar for creative work so it’s not interrupted by meetings. What’s your favorite to-do list manager? \nPen and paper. Besides your phone and computer, what gadget can’t you live without and why? \nI always have a sketchbook and pen for ideas; I love going back to sketches and notes. I prefer quality fine line black ink pens, and I buy them by the dozens because they are beautiful on paper, inexpensive, and travel well. What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What’s your secret? \nI keep a cool composure under pressure and stress. I thrive on challenges, conflict, and setbacks and it’s just an opportunity to figure out solutions and do things better. What do you listen to while you work? Got a favorite playlist? Maybe talk radio? Or do you prefer silence? \nI have terrible taste in music so I click random stations and playlists on Spotify or one my husband has compiled. What are you currently reading? What’s something you’d recommend? \n[I’m reading] Every travel recommendation or snippet on Mongolia in anticipation of my travels there this year. [And] Paul Beatty’s The Sellout. How do you recharge? What do you do when you want to forget about work? \nFor a quick break, I need fresh air and preferably crisp air but just some time outdoors will do. Advertisement Advertisement \nPlaying fetch with our puppy is also pretty good, his excitement is immediately gratifying and I don’t have to run around. \nSpending time in the kitchen also works for me, I like taking on tedious and exhausting recipes. What’s your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early-riser? \nI do not have the healthiest sleeping schedule, I’m usually in bed between midnight and 1am and up by 5 or 6am.
