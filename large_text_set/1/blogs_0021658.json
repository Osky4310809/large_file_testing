The album was a mixture of jazz-inclined production with introspective lyricism and today, we're premiering his new short film of the same name. Broad Shoulders, the film joins music from the album and a story of young, complicated love. The 13-minute clip takes place in Chicago and shows Taylor taking interest in an elusive young woman who he quickly falls for before finding himself needing to make a crucial decision for his future. The film is written and directed by Herron Charres. Taylor shared his hopes for the film through email: \n\"I hope that the film inspires other artists to consider what can be possible when it comes to visual content while also opening up fans to a new way of experiencing their work. Music has always been a huge inspiration for me, and with such great hipÂ­-hop breed in Chicago, it's an ideal environment to collaborate with different artists through this process.\" \nPhoto: Evan Brown", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:18:17.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
