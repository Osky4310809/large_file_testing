It also said consumer fraud accounts for less than one-tenth of 1 percent of consumer-to-consumer transactions.\nFor more on scammers, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nThe settlement will fund refunds for customers who were victims of scams, authorities said. It will also implement a comprehensive anti-fraud program to train agents to identify and stop transactions that result from fraud.\nBetween 2004 and 2015 Western Union collected 550,928 complaints about fraud, with 80 percent of them coming from the United States where it has some 50,000 locations, the government complaint said. The average consumer complaint was for $1,148, the government said.\nWestern Union reported revenues of $1.4 billion for the quarter that ended on September 30, 2016, according to a government filing. The company said it spent some $200 million a year on compliance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T07:11:15.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
