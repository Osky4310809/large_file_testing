But there may be a brand new addition to this year’s celebrations — green “Make America Great Again” hats. Yes, the POTUS is doing his best to ruin St. Paddy’s Day for the rest of us by launching a new line of hats in time for the big day on March 17. shop.donaldjtrump.com Seriously, though. Has Trump forgotten he is actually the president now and doesn’t need to keep campaigning or selling ugly merch? BRO, YOU WON. Either that or he’s trying to make a quick buck (and by that, I mean 50 quick bucks because the hat will cost you an absolutely outrageous $50. Form a line, guys!). However, in a hilarious twist, Trump and his team have made a pretty dumb mistake with the design of the hat. Capture the luck of the Irish with this Make America Great Again Hat. While supplies last! BUY NOW: https://t.co/TbqIm56aoY #MAGA pic.twitter.com/PCZLl7HXdD \n— Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) March 2, 2017 Have you worked out what it is yet? Here’s your last clue… shop.donaldjtrump.com You might think this gold shamrock on the back of the hat is a classy touch. But you’d be wrong — because it isn’t a shamrock at all. Shamrocks have three leaves, and the design on Trump’s hat is a four-leafed clover, which is not the symbol of Ireland. Fortunately, the mistake was picked up by people on Twitter, who relentlessly trolled the president for the completely avoidable error. Make America Smart Again! \n— Oracle Steve (@Steve_mjt) March 3, 2017 This sums it up. \n— Greg O'Meara (@gregomeara) March 2, 2017 “FAKE NEWS!” President Trump declares more fake news. Everyone knows that shamrock has four leaves not three as implied by troublemakers. \n— Jake M (@JmScania75) March 6, 2017 Seriously, the president’s team would have been fine if they’d just looked at the damn emoji first. @TeamTrump Delighted you got it wrong our great nation doesn't want to be associated with anything you stand for ☘️☘️ #irish #proud \n— Anne M (@AnneOGM) March 3, 2017 Irish people were NOT happy to be associated with the POTUS. @TeamTrump crass attempt2make money off the back of #StPatricksDay low!BTW shamrock look like this☘️not‍♀️cheap&nasty&nowt2do with #Eire Wait, were these made in China, too? @TeamTrump shamrocks got 3 not 4 leaves ,tell the Chinese factory they fucked up \n— Richard boyle (@rgpboyle_boyle) March 3, 2017 Awkward. So if you’re out celebrating St. Paddy’s Day and you spot someone wearing this hat, you can politely let them know about the mistake. Or don’t mention it all — just remember they’ve spent $50 of their own money to buy the ugly thing. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
