Man City vs Swansea \nSpeaking before the Nissan Super Sunday clash away at Manchester City, Clement insisted Leicester and Middlesbrough were now in the survival scrap along with Crystal Palace, Hull and Sunderland. \n\"I think we are on the right path,\" Clement said. \n\"That can change very quickly so we have to be very focused, work hard every day and not take our eye off the small details. Three wins in four games have lifted Swansea out of the relegation zone \n\"If we continue like that we will be competitive right until the end. \n\"It's a very different looking situation to what it was when I first came in at the start of January; 12 points and rock bottom and adrift. \n\"Not only are out of the bottom three, but we are level on points with Middlesbrough and Leicester, so it's six teams now. When I came in it was four teams, so the odds are improving. \n\"There's a lot of work to be done still. In 15 games, there's some twists and turns to be had for sure.\" Paul Clement took charge at Swansea at the beginning of January \nClement is seeking a third straight win on Super Sunday, but admits he faces an uphill task against a Manchester City side that thrashed West Ham 4-0 in midweek. \nHe says Swansea will need to be at their very best to stand a chance against Pep Guardiola's side. \n\"Here's another very challenging game,\" he added. \n\"Man City started the season well and had a bit of a dip in form, but seem to have got things back on track with that fantastic win at West Ham. Upgrade now and watch Man City v Swansea this weekend and get 8 Sky Sports channels! \n\"We have to go there with a very strong mentality to do the basics right. If we put in a performance, who knows what will happen? \n\"People might look at this fixture differently and I'm not sure if that's good for us or not. We'll go there and will be well prepared. \n\"If we face a Man City that are firing on all cylinders and are on fantastic form it will be very difficult for us, of course. \n\"But if we perform at a very, very high level and they have a bit of an off-day then then we'll have a good chance.\" \nFor more from Sky Sports' exclusive interview with Paul Clement, tune in to Super Sunday: Man City v Swansea from 12.30pm on Sky Sports 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:26:37.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
