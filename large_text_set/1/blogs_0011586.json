Reports Claim Trump Has Decided On ‘Mold-Breaking Pick’ For Secretary Of State \nGiuliani’s website, GiulianiSecurity.com, crashed several times Thursday, and was still down as of late Friday afternoon, Eastern time. \nExperts say the most glaring security flaw was the outdated version of Joomla! utilized on Giuliani’s website. More than a dozen security vulnerabilities have been identified in the four-year-old version of the free content management system. \nDan Tenter, founder of the security firm Phobos Group, said no apparent effort was made to safeguard the site from hackers.   \nTenter said he was able to pull “read me” files from Giuliani’s website that provided pertinent information hackers could use to compromise the website. \n“This is really, really, really basic — it barely even qualifies as security,” he told CNBC . “Those files give you all the information you need to do nefarious things.” \nQualys SSL Labs, a free online service that performs analysis on the security configuration of any public website, gave Giuliani’s website an “F” security rating.
