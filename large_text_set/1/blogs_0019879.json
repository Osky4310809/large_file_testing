It announced a new collaboration with developer Agens today for the release of Skate City.\nSee also: The best endless runner games for Android May 3, 2016 In a blog post announcing the game, Snowman co-founder Ryan Cash stated he has been a passionate skateboarder since he was 11 years old, and that Alto’s Adventure was very much influenced by the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game from the 1990s. Agens previously released a skateboarding-themed mobile game called Skate Lines , and it impressed the Snowman team so much that the two teams decided to partner up on this spiritual sequel, Skate City.\nA video posted by Skate City (@skatecitygame) on Jan 24, 2017 at 8:11am PST \n\nBased on the announcement trailer, along with footage exclusively found on the game’s Instagram account , Skate City will be a 2.5D side-scroller, with the player creating some cool tricks and moves with his board in a variety of different cities around the world, along with different times and weather conditions. That’s pretty much all we know about the game at the moment; there’s no word on a release date yet. However, the Skate City Instagram account is supposed to be updated regularly with new footage before it is released.\nIn the meantime, Snowman has some more future games it is developing with other partners. They include a platformer called Distant , in collaboration with Slingshot and Satchel, and Where Cards Fall , a 3D puzzle title in partnership with The Game Band. It will be interesting to see how Snowman’s partnership efforts will produce games that are just as good as Alto’s Adventure. Snowman is also working on a direct sequel to that game, called Alto’s Odyssey , that’s supposed to be released sometime in 2017.\nWhich upcoming game from Snowman are you most interested in playing?
