If that team can’t or won’t be Arsenal, he does want to apparently stay in London, which is where the Chelsea rumors come back into the picture. “I am happy in London and I hope to finish my contract at Arsenal.” “I want to stay in a winning team and keep playing in the same city. I want to play in a team that has aspirations. I’m 28 years old, I still have a lot ahead of me. I am a player who takes great care of himself.” -Alexis Sanchez; source: Goal via Metro Alexis might think age is just a number, but having now experienced 28 trips around the Sun, the clock is certainly ticking as far as any actual top teams might be interested in his services. He will have one year left on his contract with Arsenal at the end of the season; with contract talks continuing to not make much progress, he will be one of the hottest potential transfer targets in the summer.
