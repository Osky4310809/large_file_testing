F**k white people!\" The incident comes as the social media platform has been running an advertising campaign encouraging members to use its streaming application to share moments like \"hanging out with friends\" or \"when you see someone walking an animal that’s not a dog.\" The promotional push is attempting to compete with similar features on rival platforms like Instagram. © East News/ UPI Photo / eyevine Chicago Police Torture Whistleblower Tells About Life After Jail \nSome 16,000 people watched the disturbing 30-minute attack, prompting some to wonder why Facebook did not kill the feed, as they did during Korryn Gaines’ fatal 5-hour confrontation with Baltimore police in August 2016.

In many instances, though, when people share this type of content, they are doing so to condemn violence or raise awareness about it. In that case, the video would be allowed.\" Reem Suleiman of SumOfUs, a group calling for more transparency in Facebook regulation told The Guardian , \"I find it really hard to believe that not enough people reported it…I don’t want to speculate here, but we’ve had issues ourselves trying to get certain things taken down in the past.\" \nThe attackers, three of them 18 and the other 24, were charged with residential burglary, hate crimes, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.
