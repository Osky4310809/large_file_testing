Busted! • Business Blitz • PETA • Animal Rights • Animal Cruelty • Viral: Animals   \nWhat could have been a cute movie tugging at your heart strings has turned into a controversial little flick that just isn't connecting with viewers at the box office. \nA Dog's Purpose , mired in controversy over the film's mistreatment of dogs on set while shooting , came in far behind expectations this weekend at the box office, debuting to just $18.3 million from a little more than 3,000 theaters across North America. \nRelated: PETA Wants You To 'Grab A Pussy'… But Not A Dog! \nIn its place, Split — a sleeper hit directed by M. Night Shyamalan — came in first for the second straight weekend, taking in $26.3 million over the last three days and rising up to a two-week domestic total of about $78 million. \nIt's a good winner for Split , even if the other films opening this week were fairly light, but the real story here centers on A Dog's Purpose (pictured, above), and the Gavin Polone -produced flick that has been rocked after animal abuse allegations . \nFrom a financial standpoint, A Dog's Purpose cost just $22 million to make, so it's still on track to get its money back and the financials are good — but the social damage done to what should have been a very popular, family-friendly feature film, cannot be understated. \nNevertheless, Universal domestic distribution chief Nick Carpou , citing the demographics ( 56% female viewers ) and the high number of families that bought tickets, believes the film will end up doing just fine over the next few weeks: \n\"I'm very optimistic about [ A Dog's Purpose ] playing for weeks and weeks, especially in heartland and smaller markets.\" \nWe'll see about that! \nAnd as for other new releases, the only big news to report is Resident Evil: The Final Chapter , which came in fourth at the box office ( Hidden Figures stuck around — again — in third), and took in about $13.8 million from just over 3,000 theaters. \nWhat do U think, Perezcious readers — did you see A Dog's Purpose or any other film this weekend?? Will U ever be going to see A Dog's Purpose ?? \nLet us know in the comments (below)!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T00:40:38.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
