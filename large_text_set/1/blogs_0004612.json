Quarterbacks \nAgain, the quarterback group shows it's talent, but day two was not quite as good as day one in our opinion. Still Jake Fromm , Hunter Johnson and Tua Tagovailoa are all deserving of their high national rankings. In practice, we are judging just pure arm talent: accuracy, arm strength, consistency, and these guys have it. As far as how they handle a game setting, that is more on their game film, but these three can all throw the football. http://www.scout.com/college/football/recruiting/story/1742903-army-bowl... Running Backs \nA more non-descript day from these guys today. They worked on some trick plays and got involved in 7 on 7 some. Cam Akers and D'Andre Swift are clearly stud athletes, but the third guy, Ty Chandler , is a top 100 guy in his own right and in a week where Akers, Swift and the West backs have drawn a lot of headlines, Chandler, a Tennessee commit, has somewhat quietly had a very good showing. Wide Receivers/Tight End \nFlorida State commit D.J. Matthews was our top guy today. He is a fast route-runner who is simply a playmaker. He made a couple defenders look bad with his quick double moves. The Michigan commits, Tarik Black and Donovan Peoples-Jones continue to impress. Peoples made some athletic plays and Black is a smooth kid who creates separation. He had a near highlight reel catch over a defender but got it knocked away at the end. Henry Ruggs continued his good week. Michael Harley Jr. continues to be nearly unstoppable in one on ones with his quickness and speed. Jeremiah Holloman also had another good day. Tight end Cole Kmet may not have been quite as active as yesterday, but he still had a good showing. Offensive Line \nAndrew Thomas and Creed Humphrey were our top two and they made the overall East top five for the day, but Tedarrell Slaton was good yet again. He is very strong and stone-walled a couple West defenders. Ohio State commit Josh Myers had a much better day two. He had several impressive one on one reps working at guard. For the second straight day, Notre Dame commit Josh Lugg was very good. He is also working at guard at times. Netori Johnson and Kendall Randolph both had their moments during one on ones as well. Defensive Line \nJa'len Parks made our top five and A.J. Epenesa nearly made it. Epenesa, a five-star Iowa commit, bullied a couple of top offensive linemen on the West. He's athletic and also strong. He looks the part of playing early for the Hawkeyes. Aubrey Solomon was not as dominant on day two as day one, but was still good and had a couple strong moments in team 11-11 drills. Ohio State commit Chase Young was good in the scrimmage as well as one on ones. He is very athletic and quick. Oregon commit Rutger Reitmaier also had some good one on one reps using his strength and motor to win. Michigan commit Deron Irving-Bey continues to play well also. He showed some strength in bull rushing bigger West offensive tackles. Linebacker \nThis continues to be a really good group. Jacob Phillips has the body and athleticism of a future pro. Willie Gay is one of the fastest backers around and ran downfield with Najee Harris today and Tadarian Moultry is another really good athlete who runs with the best of them. Nate McBride , a Georgia commit, also did well today and had some great moments as well and was active on the day. Defensive Backs \nMichigan commit Ambry Thomas was in our top five. Hamsah Nasirildeen and Shaun Wade could have easily made bids for a spot as well though. Nasrildeen is a big kid, but has made a couple nice plays in coverage this week that make us think some of the linebacker talk is premature. Richard LeCounte , beyond the viral video, has been good. He is a good athlete who is very competitive. Penn State commit Donovan Johnson has shown his cover skills and had a nice pass breakup. Tray Bishop is another we've liked this week.
