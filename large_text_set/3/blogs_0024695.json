It states “Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power.” No, I don’t think ol’ Honest Abe was referring to rich people being asshats when he said that, but you can see how it might translate. \nWith that in mind, the good people of Reddit decided to share the worst cases of ‘Rich Kid Syndrome’ they’ve encountered, and it’s nothing short of blood-boiling. Stick around until the last few captions, it’ll be worth it. \n“Girl in my high school physics class offering her brand new iPhone to be destroyed in an experiment because ‘my dad will just buy me a new one’. She had it for like 1 week.” Sombodyprobably \n\n“Hey guys please help? Which car should I get, I want a lot but daddy will only buy me one.” That was posted yesterday on Facebook.” Valtran101 \n\n“A kid in my graduating high school class was very wealthy. His parents bought him a Land Rover when he was 16 and he crashed it into a school bus. “They bought him another Land Rover and he lost it street racing. Guess what? They bought him a Mercedes.” NordyNed \n\n“Dude would stand in a club and rip up bills of 10 euro yelling ‘this is nothing to me!’. Okay, how about just giving away beer instead of antagonizing anyone in sight.” owbro 2 \n“My cousin is just graduated from high school last year. His parents are big time real estate agents in our hometown, like they both probably clear $1 million a year easily. So my cousin goes off to college and gets busted for public drunkenness and resisting arrest his first semester. Gets expelled from school, starts bumming off his folks for money. His dad just bought him a brand new Range Rover last weekend as a “reward for learning from his mistakes and staying positive when the law targeted him.” NC_DE336 \n\n“Old roommate signed up for classes at the community college. Never. Not once went to class. Obviously failed. His mom got mad and over the phone he explained to her that the reason he failed was his car wasn’t good enough (2012 Ford which was fine) and needed a new one. So his mom buys him a brand new car (2016). He signs up for classes the next semester. And still ends up never going to class.” Throwawayiro \n\n“I saw a girl absolutely FUMING because the BMW she got as a high school graduation gift wasn’t quite the right color. I got a Chili’s dinner and a ‘gratz’.” Get_MEAN_yall 3 \n“Not me, but my scuba instructor told this story. Some rich family paid him a few thousand dollars to fly down and give private scuba lessons to them in the Bahamas. In Scuba, you have to demonstrate you can handle all the skills in the pool before they let you in the ocean. During the pool part, they got to the skill of clearing the water out of your mask, which is mildly unpleasant but not painful or even hard. They refused to do it. My instructor said if you can’t clear a mask you can’t be cleared to dive. They spent a few thousand on private Scuba classes, and wasted it all because they refused a pretty simple skill.” HarrysonTubman \n\n“Was a RA in college. One of my residents was a rich freshman from Rhode Island. He lives on an island and takes a ferry into town. Anyways, his first week, he asked if there was fresh water available in the shower. I didn’t understand what he meant, but apparently he didn’t like showering with city water and didn’t realize it was everywhere he went. I was so shocked and didn’t know what to say that I suggested he used water bottles to clean him. Yeah, he didn’t last long.” Elsani \n\n“Once when I was at a camp, me and a few other kids were playing a game. Kids from a different part of the camp came over and told us to leave. We replied that we were there first. One of them replied “yeah but does your dad have a helicopter.” P0litikz420 4 \n“My suite-mate freshman year of college would pay me, my roommate and his roommate to his chores for him every couple of weeks. He literally gave me $20 for making his bed.” frostyaznguy \n\n“Worked at Trader Joe’s while going to college (as did a lot of other people working there). One day while stocking the shelves with a co-worker, a father and his daughter were shopping next to my co-worker. I overheard the daughter ask “Daddy, what is she doing?” The father replied “Honey, that’s what happens when you don’t go to college.” My co-worker cried for the rest of her shift. The father was asked to leave. I’m can’t make many assumptions about his wealth but he definitely had the mentality.” DarthRusty", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:23:00.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
