Trump responded in his classic style, by denouncing the polls as \"rigged,\" via Twitter.\n\"The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before,\" Trump tweeted Tuesday.\nThe same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2017\nTwo polls came out with nearly identical numbers Tuesday, which perhaps lends some credence to the President-elect's complaint.\nA CNN/ORC poll Tuesday found that 40 percent of Americans approve of Trump's handling of the transition, while 52 percent disapprove.\nA Washington Post —ABC News poll the same day also had Trump's transition approval at 40 percent, with 54 percent disapproving. Naturally, the partisan split was extremely clear: 11 percent of Democrats approved, while 84 percent disapproved. On the flip side, 77 percent of Republicans approved, while only 18 percent disapproved. Independents leaned slightly against, with 42 percent approving and 50 percent disapproving.\nThe Post 's Aaron Blake fleshed out the numbers , comparing Trump's low approval rating to the high rates of previous presidents.\nPre-inauguration favorable numbers for the six presidents before Trump were all significantly higher than their share of the popular vote, while Trump's was below.\nIn early 2009, 79 percent approved of President Barack Obama's transition, while only 18 percent viewed it unfavorably. This was 26 percent higher than Obama's popular vote, at 53 percent. Even George W. Bush, who had the highest unfavorable rating (at 36 percent), still had a 62 percent favorable rating.\nThese polls might prove largely meaningless, however. Next to Obama's, the most popular presidential transition belonged to President Jimmy Carter. Seventy-eight percent of Americans viewed Carter's transition favorably, while only 9 percent said they had an unfavorable impression.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/election/2017/01/18/trump-dismisses-low-approval-rating-rigged-just-like-before/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/17/National-Politics/Polling/question_18440.xml?uuid=Ot64lNysEeaJAmEP5IZ5HA", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/17/heres-just-how-brutal-donald-trumps-pre-inauguration-poll-numbers-are-in-context/?utm_term=.b9c466cf2803", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/01/16/trump.2.pdf", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/821344302651555840"], "published": "2017-01-19T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T04:07:17.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
