Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \nIt appears that Trump was merely searching for more media outlets to add to his enemies list. Donald Trump tweets: The 'fake news media' is the enemy of the American people https://t.co/UYpqI3w42L https://t.co/9hJYc8MRPj \n— CNN (@CNN) February 17, 2017 \nTrump has been waging a rhetorical war against the media since the beginning of his campaign, and it appears that his goal is to exacerbate hostilities. He has called entire outlets “fake news” and assailed specific reporters while on the campaign trail. \nOne such altercation came when CNN reported that intelligence officials possessed evidence of Russians acquiring information damaging to Trump. The president and his allies went on an all-out assault on the news channel for weeks afterward. It doesn’t appear that he’s too eager to find common ground with the “enemy of the American people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:07:39.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
