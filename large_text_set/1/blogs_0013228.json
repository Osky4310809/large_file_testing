According to the docs ... the physical appearances are almost identical, \"Cole Train\" is the only black character, they both wear derby hats, wrist bands and have a front gold tooth.\nHamilton goes on ... he believes they somehow imitated his voice and implanted it in \"Cole Train.\" In fact, Hamilton says he hired a forensic voice examiner to compare his voice to CT, and they're indistinguishable.\nIt gets even weirder ... Hamilton is also suing Lester Speight , aka Terry Tate: Office Linebacker from vintage Reebok commercials, who's credited with the voice-over and portrayal of \"Cole Train.\"\nHamilton says Speight used to work with his wrestling company and they talked about creating a video game character. Translation: Speight stole his idea and passed it off to the makers of \"Gears of War.\"\nHamilton is suing for sales and profits, and that's a lot. The game's been super successful since 2006.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:05:50.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
