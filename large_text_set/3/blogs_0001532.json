The controversy erupted on February 21 over an invite to JNU students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid to address a seminar which was withdrawn by Delhi’s Ramjas College following opposition by the ABVP. The next day violent clashes broke out on Delhi University’s north campus between AISA and the ABVP, with both sides accusing each other of physical and sexual assault. \nJust a few days after the alleged stoning at Ramjas College, Gurmehar Kaur, daughter of the late Captain Mandeep Singh, martyr of 1999 Kargil War, had changed her Facebook display picture to one with her holding the placard saying, “I AM A STUDENT OF DELHI UNIVERSITY. I AM NOT AFRAID OF ABVP. I AM NOT ALONE. EVERY STUDENT OF INDIA IS WITH ME. #FIGHTBACKDU #STUDENTSAGAINSTABVP”. \nShe even pulled out of a protest march against the ABVP on Tuesday (February 28) and even left Delhi for her hometown Jalandhar. ““It’s not just my campaign, it’s a students’ campaign, I just happened to start it, people who believe in it will take it forward and are taking it forward,” she told FE Online. \nYou may also like to watch: \nBesides alleged death and rape threats, the DU girl was also trolled by many including celebrities like Virender Sehwag. The cricketer trolled her by posting a tweet saying, ‘I didn’t score two triple centuries, my bat did’. However, soon he claimed that his tweet was not intended for Gurmehar. He said that it was plain humor and people misconstructed it in a different way.
