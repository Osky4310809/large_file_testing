Joey Bada$$ took to Instagram to share his thoughts on his forthcoming album release, stating \"here is the last 2 years of my most critical thinking in physical form...go get that April 7th. (By the way 4/7 is officially the new global hip-hop appreciation day and I'm sure dot would agree).\" While Joey's album All-Amerikkkan Badass has been announced for a while, Kendrick Lamar recently added some fuel to the hype fire with his latest track \"The Heart Part 4 ,\" proclaiming we have till April 7th to get our collective shit together. \nClearly, something is brewing. April 7th looks to be a monumental day in modern hip-hop history, especially if K.dot comes through with a surprise album drop. It's also nice to see a lack of animosity, as both rappers seem equally excited, fueled by sheer love of hip-hop (and maybe a hint of competitive spirit). \nWhere will you be on April 7th, the newly dubbed Global Hip-Hop Appreciation day? And more importantly, which album would you be bumping first?
