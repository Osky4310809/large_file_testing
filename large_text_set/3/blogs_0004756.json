(IE) \nISIS has raised head in the Indian heartland now.The spread of ISIS is quick and from the time when it first waived its flags in Kashmir, it has reached Lucknow which is on the brink of closing in on assembly poll. Is it going to make this city another troubled place like the Kashmir valley? \nIn a major anti-terror operation carried out jointly by the anti-terror squad and Lucknow police, a terrorist was found holed up in a house and his accomplice was found outside somewhere. \nThe terror suspects had sneaked into the Thakurganj locality today. With the security forces, including the Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) men surrounding the area, a tense stand-off was on for more than two hours. With Uttar Pradesh in the midst of an extremely volatile Assembly elections, the security forces are fearing the worst and have prepared themselves to tackle all situations that may arise from this encounter. According to sources at the spot, there was gunfire going on with both parties exchanging fire. However, there are no reports of anyone getting injured. An explosion too has been reported on the spot. \nYou may also like to watch: \nPolice are questioning a number of suspects at the moment in an effort to find out the details about how and why the militant got into the city. The authorities are linking the militant to the explosion in the Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train in the morning today, where a mobile phone exploded, causing injury to as many as 9 people. \nThis definitely shows that the next target city may be Lucknow where the ISIS is spreading its wings. Anti-terror squad has flushed out the terrorist for now by firing stun guns, it is not clear when these will resurface again. The question is what is our political leadership doing about the ISIS?
