John Terry shows the world how it's done (Photo: johnterry.26/Instagram) Down the hatch (Photo: johnterry.26/Instagram) \nSure he is a fantastic footballer, especially considering the position he plays, but he is better known for his tremendous bravery rather than his silky footwork. \nPerhaps this is why the above clip of him copying Ozil - some may even say bettering Ozil - and performing some kick-ups with a piece of gum is so impressive. \nWe say it could be better because the original clip of the Gunners star only sees him do one kick-up before catching the gum in his mouth and smirking at the camera. Your turn, Mesut (Photo: johnterry.26/Instagram) \nAnd as you can see, Terry does a number of kick-ups. \nSure it is a little messy in that he has to chase the gum about a bit, and at one point he even seems to get a helping hand from David Luiz.
