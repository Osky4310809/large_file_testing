However, the new Acer Chromebook 11 N7 has been made to take more abuse than the standard versions.\nAcer says that it put the Chromebook 11 N7 through a ton of testing so it could meet the U.S. MIL-STD 810G military standard for toughness. The 11.6-inch Chromebook itself can take up to 132 pounds of downward force on the top cover, and it also has a reinforced case and hinges. The Chromebook can survive drops up to 48 inches thanks in part to its corner-shield structure and rubber bumper keyboard. The Chromebook has an anti-slip pattern on the rear to keep it from slipping. Finally, it has a new spill-resistant keyboard that can drain up to 11 ounces of liquid, in case you spill your morning cup of coffee on the Chromebook.\nInside, the 2.98 pound Acer Chromebook 11 N7 has an Intel Celeron dual core processor N3060 with a clock speed of 1.60GHz, 4GB of RAM and the choice of either 16GB or 32GB of storage. It also has a battery life of up to 15 hours.\nThe Chromebook 11 N7 will go on sale later in January with the starting price of $229.99.\nThis post was originally published on our sister site TabTimes.com .
