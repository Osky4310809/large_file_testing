(Photo: PETER MOUNTAIN, XXX UNIVERSAL STUDIOS HOME VIDEO) \nLove Actually 's famous cue cards sequence isn't the only iconic scene in the 2003 rom-com. Let's not forget Hugh Grant's dance sequence, where his Prime Minister character tells off the President of the United States before cutting loose to Jump (For My Love) by the Pointer Sisters . \nFor Love Actually 's TV reunion for \"Red Nose Day,\" which aired on Friday night in the UK, Grant revived his killer moves to remake the original dancing scene, to a more modern song: Drake's Hotline Bling . \nWhile the Love Actually reunion doesn't air until May 24 in the U.S. , viewers tweeted plenty of clips of Grant attempting his best Drake, for all of Twitter to see. Unfortunately, since Grant's character is over a decade older than he was in the original movie, a brutal fall down the stairs nearly cripples his routine. Hugh Grant is literally what's it's like when your naked and feeling free after the shower ðŸ˜‚ #comicrelief #loveactually pic.twitter.com/8825xYKCvW â€” Rume Ugen (@keepitfrank) March 24, 2017 \nBut Grant's greatest moment actually comes later in the special, where he delivers an updated version of the speech he gave to Parliament members in the original movie , one that's very timely today. \n\"When you became Prime Minister the first time, you were very optimistic,\" an onlooker asks him. \"You said that the power of good would finally win, that love actually was all around. Fourteen years later, do you still feel as upbeat?\" \n\"Obviously times for many people have grown harder and people are nervous and fearful. And it's not just in politics that things are tough. Usain Bolt has run his last Olympics, the Harry Potter films are finished, Piers Morgan is still alive,\" he jokes. \n\"But let's look at the other side of the coin. Metallica's new album is absolutely cracking,\" he continues. \"And on a deeper level, I'm optimistic. Wherever you see tragedy, you see bravery too. Wherever you see ordinary people in need, you see extraordinary ordinary people come to their aid...So it's not just romantic love that's all around. Most people still, every day everywhere, have love in their hearts to help human beings in trouble.\" â€” isabella misceo (@isabellamisceo) March 24, 2017 \n\"Good is going to win. I'm actually sure of it.\" \nBelow, see more clips of Grant's expert dancing.
