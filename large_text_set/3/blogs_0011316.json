My guess is the guys who played the game more enjoy it more. Mar 13, 2017 6:08 AM \nThe motivation is obviou$! epaminondas says: Mar 13, 2017 6:09 AM \nThere is no job I didn’t love doing I would have sustained 4 concussions doing. \nConsider the idea of losing your SELF at early middle age to 55- or 60. \nI am 67 I love watching football (of course I live in NE) and I recognize that there are a lot of folks in any field who do jobs they don’t love, but they are not burdened by measurable odds of physical harm, some of which is permanent every day they work. \n$20m is a LOT of money, but not enough to become damaged, and potentially unable to care for yourself, lose your personality, and end up being cared for by family. \nSo let’s recognize there are folks like Cameron, who may not be Gronkowskis of talent, but are PROFESSIONAL and able to make mature decisions. tonyinmd says: Mar 13, 2017 6:12 AM \nHe’s absolutely right. I’ve been friends with a few guys who have played a bit in the NFL that were alums of my high school and they know. \nThe money, the lifestyle, the fame, the women, the desire to support their family, the desire to leave a legacy…there are a lot of reasons, and simple love of football is far from the top in a lot of cases.
