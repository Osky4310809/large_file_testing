Check out the latest deals here . Guardiola keen on Kimmich reunion \nThere has been plenty of talk about what sort of summer overhaul Pep Guardiola might have in mind at Manchester City, and the Mirror reports that he has set his sights on bolstering both his defence and his midfield. \nIt says Guardiola could return to his former club Bayern Munich to sign Joshua Kimmich -- who can operate at full-back and in midfield -- having been \"put on red alert\" by his frustration at a lack of playing time this season. \nAccording to the paper, Guardiola \"wants at least two new full-backs and fresh options in central defence and midfield\" and rates Kimmich highly, having previously described the Germany international as a player with \"everything\" needed to become a force in the game. \nKimmich made 36 Bayern appearances under Guardiola last season but has seen his playing time drastically reduced under successor Carlo Ancelotti this time around. \nHe has played a full 90 minutes for the Bundesliga leaders only twice since October -- but the Mirror warns that Bayern would nevertheless be reluctant to consider letting him go. \nThat, it says, could mean City having to stump up \"a giant fee\" if Kimmich is to be reunited with Guardiola. \nThe City boss is also keen to work with Bayern's Juan Bernat again and could table a bid for another player who is also able to operate in defence and midfield. Conte looks to bring in spirit of youth \nChelsea manager Antonio Conte is looking to the future and aiming to bring two teenage prospects rated among Europe's best to Stamford Bridge, according to the Mirror . \nIt reports that Conte wants Rangers midfielder Billy Gilmour , 15, and 16-year-old Ajax forward Daishawn Redan to come to London. \nChelsea are \"closing in on a deal for Gilmour, who is rated as the best talent Scotland has produced for 20 years\" and has already tasted involvement at first-team level, the Mirror says. \nIt adds that they are prepared to \"spend big by youth football standards\" in order to stave off competition from Manchester United, Manchester City, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig for the two youngsters. Antonio Conte insists that Chelsea's future plans for captain John Terry won't be addressed until the end of the season. Tap-ins \n- Inter Milan are monitoring the situation of Poland international Grzegorz Krychowiak at Paris Saint-Germain with interest, Tuttosport reports. \nThe Italian outlet claims Krychowiak, who has failed to establish himself in the team since arriving from Sevilla last summer, could be surplus to requirements at the Parc des Princes -- and Inter are keen to strike a deal. \nIt says that deal could initially be a season-long loan move, with a permanent switch following later. \n- Wolverhampton Wanderers are still some way short of securing Championship football for another season, and that has encouraged interest from both Chelsea and Arsenal in their record signing Helder Costa . \nThe Birmingham Mail reports that the London clubs sent scouts to watch Costa -- who made his loan from Benfica permanent in a £13 million January deal -- as Wolves recorded a narrow win at home to Rotherham on Saturday. \nThe 23-year-old is represented by agent Jorge Mendes, who \"is believed to be talking up Costa to clubs at the top end of English football\" and feels he is now worth around £20 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T03:35:24.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
