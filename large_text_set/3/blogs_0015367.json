Keep it simple.\" That was the mantra, my then-fianc√© and I kept repeating while planning our Brooklyn wedding last May. Since we are in our 30s, most of our friends already were married, and we had heard tons of stories of the stress and complications that come with producing a one-day affair that is supposed to be, according to nearly everyone, \"the most important day of your life.\"\nI bet you can tell where this is going. It wasn't simple. Or stress-free. But we really did try to make it manageable: we kept the guest list down to just 50 people, and stuck to our budget by renting a city garden for the ceremony and booking a local restaurant for the reception. We did a lot of things ourselves, including making teacup candle favors.\nA couple months before the big day, a friend asked me who was doing my hair and makeup. Right. Hair and makeup. I hadn't thought of that. I'm someone whose makeup routine consists of wearing eyeliner and mascara about twice a week, and maybe a little blush if I really want to dress up. \"Doing my hair\" means remembering to brush it in the morning. So while booking hair and makeup is often at the forefront of most bride's wedding lists, it had somehow slipped my mind.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:50:52.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
