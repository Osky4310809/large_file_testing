Bollywood thrives on them, and we love making fun of others based on them. We all do it, and it’s okay as long as it doesn’t cross a line and go into offensive territory. I am a Bengali, and if I had a penny for every time someone cracked a Bong joke, I would have become the owner of the Boroline brand by now. However, there are some Bengali stereotypes that are so untrue that it makes our heads hurt whenever someone makes the mistake of uttering them around us. Stereotype: We snort roshogollas on a daily basis. Reality: We have lots of other delicious sweet dishes - from malai chom chom to nolen gurer payesh . Nevertheless, we don’t snort sweets on a daily basis; we are also afraid of getting diabetes, you know. Stereotype: We are obsessed with fish. Reality: We’ve grown up in largely non-vegetarian households, where fish happens to be a part of our meals daily. That doesn’t mean all of us love fish. Some of us can’t stand the smell or taste of it, while some of us adore it. We don’t have an unhealthy obsession with fish. Stereotype: All of our names end with an “O.” Reality: So, we have two vowels that sound like “ aw ” and “ aa .” Generally masculine names among Bongs tend to end with an “ aa ” sound, and feminine names end with the “ aw ” sound. It’s very similar to the “ ki ” and “ ka ” rule in Hindi. See, not that difficult to grasp, right? Will you now stop making fun of the way we pronounce our (and sometimes yours too) names? Stereotype: We talk about politics all the time. Reality: Any conscionable citizen should be aware of the politics of their own nation, if not the world. It affects our daily lives. But, that doesn’t mean we always talk about politics. If the conversation somehow ends up there, then it was just coincidence. Okay? Stereotype: We are all lazy. Reality: Yes, we love the ritual of bhaat ghum , AKA afternoon siesta post a rice meal. But, we do know how to prioritise when it comes to working hard at our jobs, and in life in general. Bengalis, and Bengal in general move at their own leisurely pace, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that! Stereotype: Our Hindi sucks. Reality: Please, tell me how many of you know a language other than Hindi or English? Most Bengalis know three languages, and if they have an accent while speaking them, then there’s nothing wrong with it. Actually, everyone has accents depending on which region in the world they live in. My Hindi is fine, so let me hear your Bengali now. Stereotype: We love it when some non-Bong says “ Ami tomake bhalobashi .” Reality: It’s an enriching and beautiful language. So, the next time a random celebrity says, “ Ami tomake bhalobashi ” in order to impress us, we will just casually look away, utterly unimpressed and chomp on some stereotypical roshogollas . Stereotype: We say “ ish ” at the drop of a hat. Reality: Thank you so much Sanjay Leela Bhansali for making “ ish ” the most abused catchphrase for millennial Bollywood fanatic. We do say it when we want to express a plethora of emotions – from disgust to embarrassment – but we don’t chant it all day long like a mantra. Stereotype: We are all super sweet, bhodrolok -type of people. Reality: Some of us can cut you with our sharp tongue. But, we don’t because we are polite in general. Just because we don’t believe in being unnecessarily obnoxious, doesn’t mean we can’t be when it is needed. Stereotype: We all have embarrassing nicknames. Reality: Okay, most of us do have daaknaams . But, some of us actually prefer being called by that name. It breeds a kind of tight bond, you will be envious of. Stereotype: OMG you guys OD on \" Robindrosangeet\" all the time!! Reality: We know, love, and appreciate our culture. Most of us had lessons in music while growing up and Rabindrasangeet was a big part of it. But, that’s not the only music we listen to, okay? Stereotype: We are Bengali, so we must all be from Kolkata. Reality: Many of us grew up in different cities all over the world. That doesn’t take away from our Bengali-ness even a little bit. Stereotype: We are obsessed with our food. Reality: It is only normal to find comfort in the kind of food you grew up with. Why judge us for it? Our food is super delicious on top of that. So, we have every right to be proud of it. Stereotype: We all think of ourselves as intellectual superiors. \nReality: Well, some of us just are. After all, we invented the word “ aantel .” So, deal with it. K, bye!
