Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester United target Antoine Griezmann is reportedly ready to turn his back on a move to Old Trafford - if the Red Devils fail to qualify for the Champions League. \nJose Mourinho's side currently sit sixth in the Premier League but are just two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal. \nUnited are unbeaten in their last 15 games in the top flight after an indifferent start to the season, closing in on the teams above them. \nBut Griezmann, who has an £85million release clause, will snub a switch to the Theatre of Dreams if United do not break into the top four, according to The Sun.
