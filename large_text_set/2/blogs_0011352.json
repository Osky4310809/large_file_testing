A rude one at that. The man, who called himself \"Tsim Booky,\" successfully got a Greek word meaning \"blowjob\" ( tsimbouki or œÑœÉŒπŒºœÄŒøœçŒ∫Œπ officially) on national morning news program, Sunrise .\nAnd people are impressed.\nSEE ALSO: One newspaper accidentally used photo of Alec Baldwin instead of President Trump\nThe unnamed cabbie from Melbourne may have taken down the serious tone of his strike against the Victorian state government's plans to deregulate the taxi industry and legalise Uber but seriously, if you felt you were facing potential financial ruin, wouldn't you want to stick it to the man, too?\nMelbourne taxi drivers are set to cause traffic chaos in Melbourne this morning, blocking the Bolte Bridge in a peak hour.

After all, Melbourne has the largest Greek population out of any city in the world, outside Greece. Look it up.\nfor those not aware \"Tsim Booky\" is a slang term for fellatio in Greek....
