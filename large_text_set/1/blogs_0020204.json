Uh-oh. \nTurns out the horses dragged your unconscious body to the beach and ate the deerskin tunic clean off your body. \nFortunately, public nudity is acceptable in 3500 B.C. Unfortunately, you are sunburned from head to toe, and the horses have marked your ass a warning to you and anyone else who tries mounting them. \nDamn. Riding is not as simple as you thought it’d be. \n“Tried to ride a horse, didn’t you? If you knew anything about 3500 B.C., you’d know that horses are much too proud to let another animal put its crotch on their back just yet,” says the 3500 B.C. baby. \n“Anyway, welcome to 3500 B.C. Beach.” Throw sand in the baby's eyes and go try something else on the horses. Explore 3500 B.C. Beach. Give up and pioneer the sewage system. \nAs you brush the sand off your sunburned genitals to explore 3500 B.C. Beach, a person riding another person gallops past you at 2 miles per hour, nearly knocking you back down. Become the first human to flip someone off. \nSuddenly, two more people riding people trot past you… \n…and then more! It’s a whole herd of humans riding humans. \nOne of the riders yanks on her person’s ears, sending them both flying into the air and over your head. They land and come to a halt when the rider pinches the person extremely hard on the eyes. Ask the baby how the hell these people learned to ride. \n“Ah, yes, I figured you might ask. Come, my beach-humiliated friend. I will introduce you to the Charles People Rider.” Who? \nJust as you and the baby turn to go find Charles People Rider, a man crawls up behind you and tries to straddle your back and ride you. Buck him off. \n“Ah! We have a stubborn one! Looking to do riding rather than be ridden, are you? I find that admirable. Hello. It’s me. Charles People Rider, the first human to ride another human like how a horse would presumably be ridden. I am also the common ancestor of every single Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee,” says Charles People Rider. \n“It has long been a dream of mine to ride a horse, but alas, the idea of jumping on a wild one is profoundly dumb and reckless. I’m a firm believer in riding in general, though, hence my students who just rode by you.” Sure, sure. \n“I’ll gladly pass all my knowledge about riding on to you so that you can become the first human to ride a horse—BUT, only in exchange for another uniquely human achievement that I can be credited as the pioneer of.” \nYou quickly come up with some other ideas that will change society forever so that horse riding can be yours. Give him the idea for physics. Give him the idea for civil law. Give him the idea for complex hydrology. Give him the idea for chile relleno. Give him the idea for the Pythagorean theorem. Give him the idea for wearing a hat in the morning to style your hair instead of using products. Give him the idea for the piano. Give him the idea for peanut butter. Give him the idea for putting olive oil on a little plate, mixing in some red pepper flakes, and dipping bread in it as a snack. \n“Brilliant! Thank you. That will now be my personal contribution to human progress. Okay, a deal’s a deal,” says First Rider. \n“The best way to get something to let you ride it is through GUILT AND SHAME. Only through breaking its spirit with GUILT AND SHAME can you reduce a creature’s self-respect so low that it pathetically accepts your crotch on its back whenever you demand it. \nThen, once it’s accepted your crotch on its back, KICK ITS SIDES to make it go, PULL ITS EARS to make it jump, and PINCH ITS EYES to make it come to a halt. Then you will have successfully ridden.” Cool, got it. \nBefore you leave the beach, you thank the 3500 B.C. baby for being nice to you by quickly thinking of the idea for heliocentrism and giving it to her. \nShe eats a handful of sand out of gratitude and bids you good luck. Return to the horses. \nYou’ve returned to the horses. Be more strategic this time: Pick one specific horse to break with GUILT AND SHAME so you can ride it. Pick a horse. Let one come to you. It will be more special that way. \nYou decide to stand by and let one come to you. \nNo immediate takers. Continue waiting for a horse to be interested in you. \nNothing yet. The horses barely acknowledge your presence. Continue waiting for a horse to be interested in you. \nA horse with a giant tumor dangling out of its rectum uses its two front legs to drag itself and the tumor in front of you. The herd seems to want nothing to do with this thing, which is made evident by the fact that they all keep kicking dirt on it. It desperately tries to offer you its fur to make pants out of by drawing a pair of shorts in the soil with its hoof and then pointing back at itself. \nYou think this may be the the horse you’re stuck with, until 20 seconds later, when the horse’s tumor pops like a balloon and the whole animal deflates into a puddle of former-horse. \nSo, still no takers. Continue waiting for a horse to be interested in you. \nAfter several hours of waiting, this miniature horse is the only one that approaches you. It tries wiggling between your legs so you can sit on its back. Ew, no. What the fuck is this? Uh, no, I'm going to pick a horse. \nOkay, which horse do you want to try and ride? Uh, the brown one…in…the…middle…of the other…brown ones… Uh, the brown one…that…is…screaming…\"NO\"…in a human voice… Uh, the brown one…behind…the brown one…that…has…brown hair…and…a…small mouth…on its…left cheek…so it looks like…it's always whispering…to someone on its left… Uh, the brown one…with the smile…that's nice and wide… Uh, the brown one…with one good hoof…and…two…bad ones…and one hoof…that's…actually…a…bird…with a horse hoof for a beak… Uh, the brown one…that…is very still…and…maybe…feeling…sick…and is also blind…and…laughing… \nOkay, which horse do you want to try and ride? Uh, the brown one…in…the…middle…of the other…brown ones… Uh, the brown one…that…is…screaming…\"NO\"…in a human voice… Uh, the brown one…behind…the brown one…that…has…brown hair…and…a…small mouth…on its…left cheek…so it looks like…it's always whispering…to someone on its left… Uh, the brown one…with the smile…that's nice and wide… Uh, the brown one…with one good hoof…and…two…bad ones…and one hoof…that's…actually…a…bird…with a horse hoof for a beak… Uh, the brown one…that…is very still…and…maybe…feeling…sick…and is also blind…and…laughing… \nYou picked a rotting horse corpse…you know a horse has to be alive for you to ride it, right? Pick again. \nYou’ve picked yet another rotting horse corpse…Dude, choose more carefully this time. Pick again. \nYou’ve picked a nice, smiling horse. With your new knowledge of riding, what are you going to do to break the horse’s spirit with GUILT AND SHAME? Get it to accidentally kill someone it loves. Form a deep bond with the horse instead. Becoming the first human to ride a horse is not worth it if it must be done through wanton cruelty. \nJust as you’re about to go find someone that means a lot to the horse so it’ll feel awful when you get it to kill them by accident, it turns and whinnies excitedly. Turn too. \nIt’s a man holding flowers. The horse approaches him and eats a few of the flowers, then affectionately rubs its neck against him. \n“Hi, I’m Ötzi. I see you might be about to try riding this horse. Cool. Before we discuss anything further, there are two things you should know about me: \n1) This horse and I harbor a deep connection. As deep a connection as a human and horse could have, I would say. It is a relationship forbidden by the herd and mankind, which only makes our bond stronger knowing that the whole world is against it. It’s not sexual in any way, but it is far more repulsive. \n2) I am absolutely terrified that after I die, someone’s going to find my dead body thousands of years from now and make a big deal out of it. Oh boy, that would be just about the worst. Allow me to elaborate.” Bingo. This guy will do. Nod your head and begin scheming in your head. \nThe horse has turned around to graze while Ötzi blabs on about being mortified of people in the future making a big deal out of his dead body. \nYou have an idea. Casually ask Ötzi to back up a bit. \n“Back up? Sounds good, not a problem. Okay, just to reiterate, if people in the future find my body one day, I hope they just cover it with dirt again and forget about it. Having people you don’t know pore over your dead body would be horrible. Do you agree?” Keep nodding and ask Ötzi to back up a little more. \nÖtzi moves back even closer to the horse. Almost there. Keep nudging Ötzi back and prepare to slap the horse extremely hard so it kicks this guy in the back of the skull and kills him. \n“Back up more? Sure, that’s fine. So, as I was saying, when I go, I want to be gone, not one bit of me preserved, bones and everythi—” Slap the horse. \nThe horse kicks Ötzi in the skull so hard that the poor guy’s eyes launch out of his head and rocket out over 30 feet in front of him. \nHorrifically, the hoof is driven so deep into the back of his head that it gets stuck in there and doesn’t come out until the horse uses its other hoof as leverage to yank it free like how people do when struggling to take off ski boots. It is a gruesome sight, to say the least. Become the first human to do jazz hands behind your back to celebrate. \nThe horse looks down to investigate what just happened, and as soon as it realizes, it audibly gasps, then begins shaking and vomiting. As you watch the horse rub its nose on Ötzi’s flowers and whimper, you can tell it truly felt something for this person. Jackpot. \nIt throws its head in the air and lets out a neigh of anguish. Click your heels, because this horse looks like it is about to be broken. \nGiven the turbulent relationship 3500 B.C. humans have with horses, this won’t be easy. \nStaring deep into the horse’s eyes, you take its hoof into your hand. Kiss the hoof, lay a wreath of flowers around the horse's neck, and blush. Give the hoof a handshake like business professionals would, lay a wreath of flowers around the horse's neck, and blush. \nThe horse seems to respond well. \nBuild on this great first step by complimenting the horse. Your eyes are pitch black and forever. You are a horse in every way that I care about. I'd be honored, not offended, if your horse teeth slowly sank into my skin. I respect you more than dogs, and only slightly less than my fellow man. \nAs you continue building trust with the horse, it shimmies and lies on its back in a vulnerable position to demonstrate how much it trusts you. Blow a raspberry on the horse. Give the horse a hickey on its neck. \nWhile you’re building this deep connection with the horse, the rest of the herd suddenly storms onto the scene and surrounds you. Quickly switch between blowing raspberries on the horse and sucking on its skin to give it a hickey to make the eternal bond between you grow faster so you can ride away. \nNot fast enough. The herd pushes your horse out of the way and organizes into a single-file line. \nLooks like this horse wants you to blow a raspberry on it, too. Oblige. \n…and this one. Oblige this horse with raspberries as well. \nSuddenly, Richard Wheel walks by as he’s on his way to retrieve his wheel after crushing a possum to make a brassiere out of it and sees you. \n“Wow. Not cool. I’m telling everyone in 3500 B.C. It’s to Horseless Hole with you, buddy.” Richard Wheel, I swear to you that this is not what it looks like. \nWelp. Thanks to Richard Wheel, everyone in 3500 B.C. thinks you interact with horses inappropriately. Sure, society wasn’t as put-together as it is today in 3500 B.C., but apparently putting your mouth on a horse was too taboo even for then. 3500 B.C. society then excommunicated you to Horseless Hole, where there are no horses but two bobcats without legs. Sadly, there’s zero chance of you riding those. \nYou failed to become the first person to ride a horse. Try again. Return to checkpoint. Start Over \nThe horse lays down and silently stares at the body, privately reckoning with what it has done to Ötzi, the human who fed it flowers, the human it trusted even more than it did any horse. \nYou did it! You broke the horse’s spirit. Now, it is ready to ride. Place your crotch on its back. \nYou’ve placed your crotch on its back. Now what? Trace the word \"go\" into its fur. Feebly gyrate your hips while snapping your fingers near its ears. Kick its sides. Pull its tail like how a lawn mower is started. \nHmm, that didn’t seem to work. The horse didn’t respond at all. Try something else. \nWhoa—you’re going! You’re on the horse, and it’s going! The wind is blowing through your unwashed 3500 B.C. hair, and the scenery is passing by in a blur. W ! W ! Holy shit holy shit holy shit fuck fuck fuck— \nOh no, look out—the first-ever human dog pile is happening right in the horse’s path. \nHopefully you remember how to control this thing. Make the horse jump over them! Wrap your arms and legs around the horse's torso and lift up. Pull its ears. Scream \"SKYWARD\" into its right ear, then \"NOW\" into its left ear. Trace the word \"jump\" into its fur. \nOh boy. That’s not how you’re supposed to ride. You are thrown from the horse. Sh t. \nYou were so close! Instead, when you fell off the horse, it kept running straight into the ocean, and some starfish ended up being the first to ride a horse instead of you. You also completely shattered your legs and are forced to use a wheelchair made with Richard Wheel’s goddamn wheel for the rest of your 3500 B.C. life. It is an utterly humiliating defeat. \nTry again. Return to checkpoint. \nYour horse jumps. \nYou land safe and sound and keep on riding and riding, all the way to 3500 B.C. Beach. Wowowowowow! \nCharles People Rider sees you from afar: \n“He is doing it! He is riding a horse! A horse has been ridden for the first time ever!” Give your mentor a knowing nod. \n“He rides! He rides!” shouts the 3500 B.C. baby in a show of support. Blow the baby a kiss in a non-sexual way. \nYou ride on, with one final objective on your mind. Richard. Fucking. Wheel. \nYou approach Richard Wheel on the horse at full sprint. \n“What?! You’re actually riding a horse?! Big deal. Wheels can’t die, but your horse will when I roll my wheel from the top of Horse/Family Bath Mountain and make pants out of them all—” Trample Richard Wheel and destroy his wheel. \nYou leave a trampled Richard Wheel and his now-destroyed circle in the dust. He experiences such a severe concussion that he forgets his idea for the wheel, so you steal the wheel from him. \nA 3500 B.C., paradigm-shifting invention twofer. Nice! Fuck you, Richard NOTHING! \nYou ride and ride, basking in your accomplishment. You get so caught up in the exhilaration of being the first person to ride a horse that you don’t even notice that you’re about to ride off a cliff. \nQuick! Make the horse stop! Pinch the horse's eyes. Trace the word \"stop\" into the horse's fur. Sit on the horse backwards so it knows to stop and turn the other way. Put your hands over its eyes to make the horse think it is time to go to sleep. \nYou come to a halt at the cliff’s edge just in the nick of time. \nCongratulations! You were victorious in becoming the first human to ever ride a horse. Plus, you also became the inventor of the wheel along the way! Sadly, Jesus is going to come along in 3,500 years and steal all the thunder from your incredible contributions to human advancement by inventing Christmas. Even so, you enjoyed living to the ripe old 3500 B.C. age of 24 years old and taught the world that horses are for riding, not just making pants out of, and that’s something to be proud of. Incredible. Start Over \nYou and the horse plunge off the cliff to your grisly deaths. \nCongratulations! Despite dying, you were still victorious in becoming the first human to ever ride a horse. People found the blueprint you made on your foot and carried on your legacy of riding horses instead of turning them into pants. Unfortunately, you aren’t alive to bask in the glory of this accomplishment, but it’s still something to be proud of. Plus, you also became the inventor of the wheel along the way! Simply incredible. Mankind is forever in your debt. Start Over", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:05:14.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
