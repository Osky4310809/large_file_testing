AFP \nPARIS, France — Iconic global monuments including the Eiffel Tower, the Kremlin, the Acropolis in Athens and Sydney’s Opera House plunged into darkness Saturday to mark Earth Hour and draw attention to climate change. \nMillions of people from some 170 countries and territories are expected to take part in the annual bid to highlight global warming caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas to drive cars and power plants. \nREAD: Palace hails Earth Hour 2017 ADVERTISEMENT \nThe event, which originated in Sydney, has grown to become a worldwide environmental campaign, celebrated across all continents. \nConservation group WWF, which organizes Earth Hour, said great strides had been made in highlighting the dire state of the planet. \n“We started Earth Hour in 2007 to show leaders that climate change was an issue people cared about,” coordinator Siddarth Das said. \n“For that symbolic moment to turn into the global movement it is today, is really humbling and speaks volumes about the powerful role of people in issues that affect their lives.” \nIn Sydney, many harborside buildings switched off their lights for an hour from 8:30 pm local time as the call for action began rolling out across the world. \n“I agree with the concept, 100 percent,” said student Ed Gellert, 24, in Sydney. \n“I think people probably avoid the fact that climate change is happening, so it’s good to see the city grouping together to support Earth Hour.” \nREAD: More Cebuanos switch off lights for Earth Hour 2017 \nFrom Australia, it moved westward through Asia, with Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbor going dark in solidarity while at Myanmar’s most sacred pagoda, the Shwedagon, 10,000 oil lamps were to be lit to shine a light on climate action. \nThe lights of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France’s best-known symbol, were switched off for five minutes at 1930 GMT and the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai, the world’s tallest building, also went dark for one hour. \nLondon’s Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament and London Eye giant wheel followed suit and were among 270 British landmarks that switched off. \nBerlin’s famed Brandenburg Gate and its City Hall also plunged into darkness as some 300 other German cities also took part in the event. \nIn Singapore, around 200 organizations, including buildings along the city-state’s iconic skyline, went black to mark the occasion. Organizers said about 35,000 people watched performances and participated in a “carbon-neutral run” which saw some runners in panda and tiger costumes to raise awareness of wildlife protection. \nAnd in Japan, Tokyo’s famed Sony Building in Ginza extinguished its bright lights to honor the occasion. \nThe event was marked throughout Africa, Europe and will also be observed in the Americas. \nHomes and businesses were also being asked to join in, and individuals could commit to the cause on Facebook. \nWWF said teams around the world would use Earth Hour this year to highlight climate issues most relevant to individual countries. \nIn South Africa, the focus was on renewable energy while in China, WWF said it was working with businesses to encourage a shift towards more sustainable lifestyles. Visible proof \nLast year, scientists recorded the Earth’s hottest temperatures in modern times for the third year in a row. \nNations agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit average global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial temperatures. \nThat is the level at which many scientists say humankind can still avoid worst-case climate outcomes in terms of rising sea levels, worsening droughts and floods, and increasingly violent superstorms. \n“Climate change is visible proof that our actions can have a ripple effect beyond physical borders,” Das said. \n“It is up to each of us to ensure the impact we create helps instead to improve the lives of those around us and elsewhere, at present and in the future.” \nEarth Hour does not collect global statistics on the energy conserved during the 60-minute blackout, with the event having a more symbolic intent.
