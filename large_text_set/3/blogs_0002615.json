Compare Gregorian calendar dates with the Jewish calendar. Also, learn important facts about each of the major feasts of the Bible. \nToday most western nations use the Gregorian calendar , which is a solar calendar. It is called the Gregorian calendar because it was established in 1582 by Pope Gregory VIII. The Jewish calendar is based on both solar and lunar movements. Since the Jewish day begins and ends at sunset, the holidays begin at sundown on the evening of the previous day. The New Year of the Jewish calendar begins on Rosh Hashanah (September or October). An easy way to calculate the Jewish calendar year is to add 3761 to the Gregorian calendar year. \nPaul said in Colossians 2:16-17 that these festivals and celebrations were actually a shadow of the things to come through Christ. And though as Christians we may not commemorate these holidays in the traditional biblical sense, as we discover the significance of each, we will certainly gain a greater knowledge of God's Word , an improved understanding of the Bible, and a deeper relationship with the Lord. \nThe Jewish name for each holiday is linked to more in-depth information. The Bible Feast name links to a detailed profile of each holiday from a Christian perspective, explaining the biblical basis, traditional observances, seasons, facts, and an interesting section revealing the fulfillment of the Messiah, Jesus Christ through each of the feasts. \nBible Feasts Calendar 2014-2018", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T02:52:09.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
