According to Sky Sports La Liga's official Twitter feed (h/t James Benson of the Daily Star ), the journalist ruled out a swoop for the Galacticos midfielder after he was linked with a potential move to the Gunners last January. Balague gave his assessment via Sky Sports La Liga: Sky Sports La Liga @revistadelaliga GB: \"My understanding is that Arsenal do not want Isco. They didn’t want him before and they don’t want him now.\" https://t.co/vD64bjUJAq https://t.co/JTQysktMlV 3/17/2017, 4:21:42 PM Tom Hopkinson of the Sunday People (via the Mirror )reported Arsenal \"would be one of the most desirable options\" for the Spain international after remaining on the fringes of the Real squad under manager Zinedine Zidane. However, Los Blancos value his talents at £25 million, but coach Arsene Wenger would only be prepared to pay £17 million with add-ons. But Balague's recent comments suggest the Gunners do not see the player as a viable option as they attempt to define their transfer targets for the summer. Here is the wizard in action: In other Gunners news, Arsenal are planning an approach to tempt Naby Keita to the Emirates Stadium in the summer. According to Sport Bild (h/t Joe Short of the Daily Express ), the burgeoning talent from RB Leipzig has caught the eye of the north London side, but they might have to pay an enormous fee of £26 million to land the 22-year-old. At the price, the youngster would become the Gunners' fifth-most expensive signing in history. Bayern Munich are also monitoring the Guinea international, and are \" keen to muscle in on any deal,\" per Short. There was cause for concern for the player's health recently after he fell ill, per Squawka News: Squawka News @SquawkaNews OFFICIAL: RB Leipzig have confirmed that Naby Keita is OK after collapsing following their game yesterday. He spent the night in hospital. https://t.co/ZYDtV39AMv 3/12/2017, 1:45:05 PM The midfielder has started 20 games in the Bundesliga this season, scoring four goals and creating seven assists, according to WhoScored.com . With Arsenal currently in disarray under Wenger and with the manager's future in the balance, per BBC Sport , it is difficult for the Gunners to draw up a comprehensive list of targets under the weight of such uncertainty. An incoming coach would want to assess the Arsenal squad firsthand and will want significant funds to approach world-class targets. Isco and Keita both have the technique to be considered players for Wenger's Arsenal, but if the Frenchman departs, the club could take a radical turn in its philosophy of buying.
