Maré opened in May 2015 while the Santa Monica location opened relatively recently in June 2016. The move leaves Midcourse with popular Westside vegan option Erven as well as the new Maré Silver Lake and Greenspan’s just-opened Fleishik’s , an already-bustling kosher sandwich shop on Beverly. Reached for comment last night, Greenspan confirmed that the first two Maré locations and his namesake grilled cheese restaurant have indeed moved in a different direction, with the final evening of service being last night. There’s no official word on who is going to be taking over the spaces just yet. Maré Silver Lake Wonho Frank Lee Among the trio, it is Maré Melrose that will be missed the most. The secretive back patio space was the first in a new run of all-outdoor restaurants around town, and remained until the end one of the most charming dining options in the city. Now that menu and mood has moved over to Silver Lake, and the Midcourse team jumping into new projects around town.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:22:31.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
