Save Google \nThe Google app is handy for finding all sorts of information you're hunting for quickly on both Android and iOS devices. Today, the company is adding a quicker way to browse information on entertainment, sports scores, nearby ATMs and more. Google is calling the new feature \"tappable shortcuts\" and it will be available on both apps and via its mobile website. \nA few of these tools will appear under the main search box on the app's home screen for quick access, but the full list is just another tap away. However, there are some options that are only available to Android users. That version of the app will tack on translate, nearby attractions, flights, hotels, internet speed test, currency converter and games like tic-tac-toe, roll a die, solitaire and other fun selections. Right now, Google says the so-called tappable shortcuts are available to users in the US and it didn't elaborate on when they might be available elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:36:46.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
