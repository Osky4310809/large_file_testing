I saw the original “It” when I was 12, right at the optimal time of my life for it to fuck me up the most. I was scared of rain, sewer grates, laundry hanging on a line, and especially clowns, for years. If you’re not familiar, the movie is about a clown that lives in the sewers and eats children. It’s based on a book written by that that lunatic genius Stephen King (fellow Mainer/psycho). Pretty crazy premise, but it did the trick. \nNew clown looks a little too dolled-up for me. Lots of lights and trickery, a little too modern. The simplicity of the 1995 clown was truly terrifying. \nPS- Other movies that scarred my youth: The Ring, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, Signs, The Shining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:49:52.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
