They are also alleging sexual harassment… \nLast Fall, the teen boy was standing in his underwear inside a locker room at Boyertown Area High School preparing to change for a physical education class. \n“He suddenly realized there was a member of the opposite sex changing with him in the locker room, who was at the time, wearing nothing but shorts and a bra,” the lawsuit states. \nThe boy, along with several of his classmates reported the incident to Assistant Principal, named as a defendant. \nThe teenage boy asked the assistant principal if there was anything that could be done to protect him from the situation. \nAs the boy got up to leave the office, the assistant principal allegedly told the youngster to again “be as natural as possible.” \nWhat? How could the parents of this boy OR this girl be okay with that? \nThe story goes on to say that parents weren’t even aware their children were allowed to change in front of each other. And get this: the boy was told saying anything about this again amounts to bullying someone who might be “gender fluid.” \nThe district told the boy’s family they had three options ONLY: change in the locker room with whatever gender is in there at the moment, go to the nurse’s office to change, or wihdraw and be home schooled. \nUnbelievable! How about boys in this room and girls in that one? It’s worked out pretty well forever. \nLike Fox News’s Todd Starnes states, this is a “radical sex and gender narrative being forced on every public school locker room in the nation” and “resistance to this perverse indoctrination seems to be futile.” \nI hope the school district loses this case and everyone responsible loses their job. This insanity needs to end. Buy our books!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T09:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:51:41.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
