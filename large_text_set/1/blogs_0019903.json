(Image by HOK) \nIt’s 248 miles between city halls in Kansas City and St. Louis, but on Thursday, the two seats of government in Missouri’s two largest cities were light years apart. \nFacing a similar deadline to put major issues before voters on the April 4 municipal ballots, leaders in the cities that bookend the Show-Me State ended up in two very different places. \nIn Kansas City, after two months of deliberate debate , the council voted unanimously to put before voters a 20-year general obligation bond worth $800 million to pay for a variety of construction needs in the city that have gone neglected for decades. Most of the money will go to roads, bridges and sidewalks. Some of it is for flood control, and the smallest amount will go to new and updated public buildings. Voters will have to decide whether to raise their property taxes — about $6 per year for the owner of a $100,000 house — to pay back the bonds. \nIn St. Louis, a committee of the Board of Aldermen was also debating issues that some hope to put on the April ballot. One would raise the city sales tax by one-half cent to generate about $20 million a year. Most of that money would go toward building at least part of a long-planned new north-south MetroLink line in the city. Some of it would go to neighborhood preservation or various crime-fighting measures. The second proposal would dedicate a business use-tax that would automatically rise if voters approve the sales-tax hike for a new downtown Major League Soccer stadium. The committee was also debating dedicating millions of tax dollars to a remodeling of the city-owned Scottrade Center, which the St. Louis Blues ownership says is outdated. \nThere was no vote in St. Louis. \nInstead, aldermen bickered for six hours, complaining righteously about just being given financial details on the soccer proposal on the day of the meeting. They lobbed insults over the March 7 Democratic mayoral primary, in which three of the aldermen are competing. \nIn the end, they walked out. No vote. Little meaningful discussion. \nFrustrated that his fellow board members wouldn’t do what the Board of Aldermen so often does — pass on massive tax giveaways with little debate or understanding — Ways and Means Committee Chairman Stephen Conway lashed out at Aldermen Scott Ogilvie and Antonio French (a mayoral candidate). \n“We’re not voting on whether this is good,” Conway said. “We’re voting to put it to a vote of the people.” \nThere seems little doubt that the proposals in their current forms, put together with little input from the aldermen, are not “good.” Debate could make them better. Rushing through massive financial commitments without public officials even knowing what they’re voting on is a recipe for disaster. \nBudget director Paul Payne, for instance, told Post-Dispatch reporter Mike Faulk that he isn’t sure the math on the soccer proposal — which seeks at least $60 million in city tax subsidy — adds up. \n“I don’t feel comfortable saying that’s a revenue neutral proposition given the numbers I’ve seen,” Payne said in an interview. \nSome transit supporters are concerned the sales tax increase doesn’t raise enough money to build the new north-south line, let alone maintain it. \nAnd, of course, the ever present issue of city-county division gets in the way. Nearly all public leaders in the region agree it makes no sense for city voters to bear the brunt of the costs of regional sports facilities, but in the absence of serious movement toward regional governance, that’s the situation in which the city finds itself. \nHere’s how Ogilve framed the issue on his Twitter feed: People of twitter, find me a City under 500,000 people that publicly owns & funds 1 regional convention center & 3 pro sports arenas. Go. — Scott Ogilvie (@ward24stl) January 19, 2017 \n“People of twitter, find me a City under 500,000 people that publicly owns & funds 1 regional convention center & 3 pro sports arenas. Go,” he wrote. Adding in another tweet: “Look anywhere across the country, and yes there is lots of public stadium ownership, but its done by Regional Authorities & regional taxes.” \nWhether the issues pushed by Mayor Francis Slay in his final couple of months as the city’s longest serving mayor make it before voters before his term is over is now an open question. Conway plans to bring his committee back to work on Monday, and aldermen could still get the Metrolink or soccer stadium proposals before voters in April. \nBut the dysfunction of the process that brought the city to Thursday should serve as a reminder for the next mayor and new aldermen of how broken the politics in St. Louis have become. \nIn December, when trying to build momentum for the soccer stadium proposal, then-Gov. Jay Nixon suggested St. Louis look to the city to its west for guidance. \n“Are we gonna let Kansas City keep whupping us?” Nixon asked. \nAfter Thursday’s events at two city halls, the question seems timely.
