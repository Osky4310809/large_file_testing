SNL/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nIt was another Saturday night. \nWhich, for \"Saturday Night Live,\" meant another chance to giggle and splutter at the government and all who sail in it. \nAfter President Donald Trump emitted tweets accusing, without evidence, former President Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones, SNL went to work. \n'This Saturday morning, while his nurse was at Temple, grandpa shuffled out of his room and got into his Twitter again,\" began Michael Che on the show's Weekend Update . \n\"Dude, you're the president of the United States and you're seeking legal advice on Twitter?\" Che asked. \nHe concluded that Trump was like the \"crazy dude on the subway yelling, 'they're tapping my phone, Schwarzenegger sucks, I can lick my own elbow!'\" \nThe segment also tweaked Vice President Mike Pence who, it was revealed this week, used a private AOL account for government business -- and it was hacked . \n\"Pence said he originally chose AOL because Hotmail was forbidden by his church,\" mused Weekend Update co-host Colin Jost. \nBut it wasn't just Trump's government and his twittering that vexed the comedians. Trump's sons were a target of tittering too . \nEric and Donald Jr. seemed confused as to whether their dad was still running the company, as well as the country. Oh, does it matter? \nAnd then there was Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He was the feature of a segment that's already No. 2 on the YouTube trending charts .
