It will be renamed the Office of Congressional Complaint Review.\n\"The OCE has a serious and important role in the House, and this amendment does nothing to impede their work,\" said Goodlatte, who sponsored the measure.\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who created the ethics office while House speaker following complaints that lawmakers were unable to effectively police themselves, said Republicans were eliminating the only independent body charged with monitoring their actions.\n\"Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\nThe move comes as Republicans who control both chambers of Congress are poised to repeal major portions of President Barack Obama's health and environmental regulations and enact a conservative agenda once Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n(Editing by Peter Cooney)\nRead the original article on Reuters .
