Markey said he would boycott the parade , too, unless the veterans council changed its decision, which he called “a stunning and inexplicable reversal.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “We all believed we’d moved beyond a time when the St. Patrick’s Day Parade was used as an occasion to exclude people, in this case veterans, from our community just because of who they are or who they love,” he said in a statement. \nAdvertisement Sponsors of the parade began to drop out on Wednesday as well. The supermarket Stop & Shop said it would no longer sponsor the parade, and Anheuser-Busch said it was “evaluating” its continued participation in the event. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Gay and transgender groups campaigned for years to be included in St. Patrick’s Day parades in Boston, New York and other cities. Organizers historically told gay and transgender people they could not march under their own banner but could march with other groups in the parades, which celebrate Irish heritage and were traditionally organized by Irish-American groups often deeply influenced by the Roman Catholic Church. When an L.G.B.T group marched in the New York parade with Mayor David N. Dinkins in 1991, spectators shouted epithets and threw beer bottles at them for nearly 40 blocks. The mayor told reporters the experience reminded him of marching in Birmingham, Ala., during the civil rights movement. “I knew there would be deep emotions, but I did not anticipate the cowards in the crowd,” he said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The conflict over the New York parade came to a head in 2014 when Mayor Bill de Blasio boycotted it — the first mayor since Mr. Dinkins to do so — over its ban on L.G.B.T. groups. Guinness, a leading sponsor of the parade, also cut ties that year. The first L.G.B.T. group marched in New York in 2015. Niall O’Dowd, the publisher of several Irish-American news media outlets, said some Irish-Americans in Boston objected to the participation of OutVets in 2015, but when the group returned in 2016 “there was no problem.” He compared opponents to L.G.B.T. participation in the parades to Japanese soldiers who refused to surrender at the end of World War II and kept fighting for decades from isolated positions. “This is just insane. This fight has been won. There’s no question,” he said. “Everyone thought this would be part of the usual historical progression, but now they’ve banned them again, which is extraordinary.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:04:20.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
