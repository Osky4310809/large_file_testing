A member of Jewish neighbourhood watch group Shomrim saw the sign with a red outline that traditionally denotes danger in British road signage and reported it to police.   #Shomrim reported to @MPSHackney and @HackneyCouncil this offensive 'Beware of Jews' sign which was fixed onto a lamppost in #StamfordHill pic.twitter.com/mj8AfQTSSu \n— Shomrim N.E. London (@Shomrim) March 14, 2017 \n“A lot of the time it will be more of a person-to-person kind of thing, or graffiti, which is more unprofessional. \n“The person who planned (this sign) has obviously gone to an effort to cause alarm and distress to local people.” \nLabour’s MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, said the incident amounted to “despicable, nasty behaviour that has absolutely no place in our community”. \nAs Breitbart Jerusalem has reported , a recent study shows anti-Semitic hate incidents are surging to record highs in Britain. \nThe Community Security Trust charity said there were on average more than three anti-Semitic incidents per day in 2016. \nIt said there were 1,309 incidents last year, a 36 percent increase over the year before. It is the highest total since the group started keeping records in 1984.
