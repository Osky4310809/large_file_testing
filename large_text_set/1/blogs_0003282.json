Another official described some of the messages as congratulatory. \nOfficials said this was just one of multiple indicators to give them high confidence of both Russian involvement and Russian intentions. Officials reiterated that there is no single intercepted communication that qualifies as a \"smoking gun\" on Russia's intention to benefit Trump's candidacy or to claim credit for doing so. \nIs a \"congratulations\" enough to prove Russia guilty? \nTrump, who has criticized the CIA for its history of inaccuracies, especially in the case of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, has doubted their conclusions every step of the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T04:43:04.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
