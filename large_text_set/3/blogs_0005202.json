Great tip with lining the pan, makes it so much easier.\" MY REVIEW justmbeth User ID: 1196484 219045 Reviewed Jan. 28, 2015 \n\"The kids declared this their new favorite homemade fudge. A cinch to make.\" MY REVIEW LeslieH User ID: 191346 215510 Reviewed Dec. 21, 2014 \n\"Creamy, delicious fudge. I would love to try to make this fudge with different kinds of chips and adding things in, such as vanilla chips and candy cane bits or oreo cookie pieces. Easy to make, but found that it thickens up quickly. If you have an extra body to spread it in the pan, it helps.\" MY REVIEW kckamargo63 User ID: 7981779 121751 Reviewed Nov. 3, 2014 \n\"Delicious and oh so easy!\" MY REVIEW hkkeener User ID: 2585785 121750 Reviewed Oct. 7, 2014 \n\"This is SOOOO good.

I was skeptical about the combination; but the addition of the pumpkin spice to the fudge gave it a unique flavor that was very good and a nice change from the usual fudge recipes. This recipe is very similar to one I have used for years and I always add a tablespoon of strong brewed coffee or a 1/4 teaspoon of espresso powder to my fudge recipes - you won't even know the coffee is there but it enhances the flavor of the chocolate .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T07:21:53.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
