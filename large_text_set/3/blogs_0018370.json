Revisiting the fun (note how we said fun) parts of your past is always interesting, and we decided to spice things up a bit by giving you a flashback of one of the biggest things while growing up in India - Bollywood. Here's a lowdown of all your favourite Bollywood celebrities, and what they were up to a decade ago. Shah Rukh Khan \nKing Khan was ruling the screen even a decade ago (obviously). The year 2007 was when he starred opposite newcomer Deepika Padukone, in Om Shanti Om , and he also gave us the super hit film, Chak De! India . Salman Khan \nSalman started the Being Human foundation a decade ago, coincidentally this was also the year that he spent a week in jail because of the Blackbuck hunting case. Career wise he starred in the Sonam Kapoor-Ranbir Kapoor launch vehicle, Saawariya , and the box office hit, Partner , with Govinda. Aamir Khan \nAamir Khan made his directorial debut this year with Taare Zameen Par , a film that won the Filmfare for Best Film and Best Director. He also celebrated two years of being married with wife, Kiran Rao. Akshay Kumar \n2007 was a great year for Akshay Kumar with four consecutive hits, Heyy Baby, Namastey London, Bhool Bhulaiyaa , and Welcome . Hrithik Roshan \nHrithik's eldest son, Hrehaan, turned one in 2007. The actor starred in Krrish , which won him the Best Actor awards at the Screen Awards and IIFA. He also made a guest appearance in Om Shanti Om . Ranbir Kapoor \nRanbir Kapoor made his debut in B-town in 2007 with Saawariya . Rumor had it that he was dating his then co-star Sonam Kapoor. Deepika Padukone \nThe superstar of Bollywood made her debut this year opposite King Khan. She and Nihar Pandya were a thing in 2007. Priyanka Chopra \n2007 was not a great year for PeeCee. Both her films, Salaam-e-Ishq ; A Tribute To Love and Big Brother proved to be box office duds. She definitely turned the box office prediction around in the coming years. Alia Bhatt \nAlia Bhatt was pretty much absent from the Bollywood game. She was all of fourteen, and a student at Jamnabai Narsee School in Mumbai. Ranver Singh \nRanveer Singh was also nowhere on the Bollywood radar. We are assuming he was busy prepping for his big release three years later. Kareena Kapoor Khan \nFor Kareena Kapoor Khan, 2007 was the year that she started dating Saif Ali Khan; the two (dubbed as Saifeena) were a paparazzi favourite. On the work front this was her most successful year with Jab We Met .
