Ecuador presidential election heads for runoff \nWith the country anxiously awaiting for the final results and the opposition pressuring for clarity, the electoral body on Tuesday said the results could not change, although it was waiting for all ballots to be counted before officially proclaiming a second round. \n\"No, it's not possible (that a second round is avoided), but we have to wait for official results to be 100 percent,\" electoral council president Juan Pablo Pozo told reporters. Key vote \nOpinion polls indicate Moreno may well lose a runoff in which supporters of other conservative opposition groups are likely to rally behind Lasso amid anger over an economic downturn in OPEC's smallest oil producer and a series of corruption scandals, potentially ending a decade of leftist rule in Ecuador. \nShould Ecuador move to the right with a second-round victory for Lasso, it would follow on the heels of Argentina, Brazil and Peru which have all swerved away from the left. \nSunday's election was a test of the legacy of outgoing president and Moreno ally, Rafael Correa, who is an outspoken critic of the United States.Correa is leaving office at the end of his term after 10 years in power. \nSome Correa supporters see Lasso as an elitist who might slash social programmes, and the ruling Country Alliance remains popular with many of the country's rural poor. \n\"We're going to win the elections just like we won the first round,\" said Moreno in a press conference earlier on Tuesday.
