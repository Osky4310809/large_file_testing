Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nNot only will Apple’s next-generation iPad Pro offer a larger screen with slimmer bezels , but it could also deliver a faster display refresh rate. \nCode from the latest iOS 10.3 beta hints at the ability to reduce an iPad’s refresh rate to 60Hz from a higher default setting. \nApple’s existing iPad lineup offers 60Hz screens, which are capable of displaying up to 60 frames-per-second. That’s enough in most cases, but there are times when faster refresh rates are better — like when playing games (especially in VR) or using Apple Pencil. \nLast August, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple was working on deeper stylus integration for its next iPad lineup, with “wider operating-system support” for Apple Pencil. \n“Apple has considered allowing users to annotate objects in many applications across the whole operating system, including in Mail, the Safari web browser, and iMessage, similar to what Samsung Electronics Co. offers on its Note smartphones,” reads the report. To enhance this, sources claimed the company would adopt faster display technology that “allows for smoother zooming, panning and scrolling.” Now evidence of this change has been found in iOS 10.3 beta code by developer Steve Troughton-Smith.
