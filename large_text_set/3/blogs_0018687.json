The theme of this year’s celebration is “Live Mouth Smart”. ORAL HEALTH WALK: Cross section of members of the Nigerian Dental Association, NDA, staff of Unilever Plc and other stakeholders during this year’s NDA Oral Health Walk to mark this year’s World Oral Health Day in Lagos. \nAddressing the participants, Oral Care Category Lead, Unilever Nigeria, Ibironke Ugbaja, said: “The oral health walk is part of Unilever’s vision to help millions of Nigerian families adopt the best oral health practices. \n“Since the launch of the Pepsodent Oral Health Schools programme in 2014, Unilever Nigeria has so far reached 2.5 million Nigerian children directly in over 3,500 public Primary Schools with products (toothpaste and toothbrushes) educational materials and a 21-days oral hygiene program, teaching them to imbibe the culture of brushing twice-daily using a fluoride containing toothpaste such as Pepsodent. Our goal is to reach 10 million children by 2020.” she explained. \nOn his part, the President, Nigerian Dental Association, Dr.Olabode Ijarogbe said: “The health work was part of efforts to prevent and check the spread of oral diseases.” \nIjarogbe further emphasized that “it is imperative that Nigerians brush twice daily, adding that, the annual health walk is one of the ways the association creates awareness about oral hygiene and its importance. \n“In this environment we discovered that the commonest oral disease that one can have is caries that is cavity in the mouth and any periodontal disease, disease affecting the gum and the supporting structures like ligaments. Once disease affects all these things, you start having pain in the mouth and swellings.” \nThe high point of the walk was distribution of sensitization materials, Pepsodent toothpaste and toothbrushes to commuters and residents within the neighbourhood covered by the health walk.
