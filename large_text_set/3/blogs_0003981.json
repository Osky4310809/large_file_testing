The event, held in Kings Cross, saw 18 newly outed startups pitch their wares on stage to investors, press and other actors in the European tech scene. \nBut before I give a run down of the presenting companies, including our top 3 picks, here’s a quick reminder of how EF works and what has made it a major player in the U.K. tech startup scene. \nFounded back in 2011 by Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford, the so-called “talent first” investor targets the best technical talent in Europe and beyond — both recent graduates and, increasingly, people already working at tech companies — and invites them to apply to its six-month program where they form teams and in turn found startups. \nThe EF program includes financial support in the form of a monthly stipend for living costs while founders find their co-founders and decide on an idea. This is then followed by £10,000 in pre-seed funding, in addition to office space, legal and administrative support, and mentoring and advice from the EF team and external entrepreneurs from the wider UK startup scene. \nUpon graduation from EF there is further support in the form of a £70,000 convertible note to help each company bridge the gap to a next funding round. \nIt is this “pre-team, pre-idea” approach that sets EF apart from other accelerators, while, as we’ve noted previously, the emphasis on technical talent is producing some very interesting results. \nEF’s biggest (albeit only significant) exit to date was Magic Pony, sold to Twitter for a reported $150 million and creating a huge return for EF itself and the 1-year-old startup’s other early investors. \nEF has also raised two funds of its own. Last year it announced its £40 million “Next Stage Fund” to add to the £8.4 million previously raised. \nThe new investment vehicle, which is majority backed by the UK taxpayer-funded British Business Bank and also counts LPs such as Imperial College, Sir Charles Dunstone’s Freston Ventures, and Isomer Capital, is charged with co-investing in graduating companies at the seed and Series A stage. \nSince 2011 EF says it has worked with 450 individuals to build over 100 startups that are now valued in excess of $500m, apparently. \nOn stage, Alice Bentinck, co-founder of Entrepreneur First, also revealed that cohort seven also sees a third of its teams having female founders, which, let’s just say, is a significant improvement on previous years. That’s something EF is working hard on, including via its sister organisation Code First: Girls . \nCommenting on EF’s 7th London Demo Day, Bentinck says: “This cohort represents one of our most diverse yet, in terms of ideas and industries that they are working within, and their collective backgrounds. There are over 20 nationalities represented in this cohort, eight of the founders are PhDs and across the group of 35 individuals, there have been over 60 academic publications and over 750 citations in papers. The ideas that the teams are working on, continue to set their sights on high ambitions. We have everything from predictive analytics for self driving cars, to real time product placement in video to disrupting large, archaic industries like the agriculture and oil sectors.” Our top 3 picks from EF7 London Demo Day Scalia \nScalia is building what it describes as a “unified product data platform” for the e-commerce industry. The — potentially, huge — problem it is setting out to solve is that 71 per cent of product listings are inaccurate, incomplete or just plain wrong. \nThat’s because there is no standardisation in data, in terms of product schema and definitions, and data format. \nThis, says the startup, is the root cause of brand damage on the supplier side, and retailer side, and leads to high product returns (because customers end up with incorrect orders being fulfilled). Lancelot explains the problems in e-commerce product data that Scalia is solving. #ef7 pic.twitter.com/MzZCmlKGeL \n— Entrepreneur First (@efLDN) March 7, 2017 \nTo solve this, Scalia’s data exchange platform uses machine learning to make product mapping simple, in addition to enriching existing data using computer vision for up to 17 data points. \nThe result is that the company aims to be the single source for product data. Or, more ambitiously, a “universal data layer for the e-commerce industry”. \n“Product standardisation doesn’t sound sexy, even if you put it in a French accent. But it’s unavoidable,” said the Scalia founder ending his pitch. Transformative \nTransformative is working on what it calls “predictive healthcare through deep learning”. They have created a patent-pending algorithm, dubbed cardioAI, that is able to predict the onset of sudden cardiac arrest, allowing for advance warning and preparation for intervention. Transformative are predicting sudden cardiac arrest, using deep learning to enable preventative interventions and ultimately save lives. pic.twitter.com/BFoa5V3zIy \n— Entrepreneur First (@efLDN) March 7, 2017 \nBased on the premise that predictive analytics is the key to improving healthcare, Tranformative’s AI-powered algorithm detects small changes in physiology, allowing for prior warning and advanced intervention for patients at risk. \nThe startup’s prototype claims a 91 per cent success rate at predicting cardiac arrest 4 minutes in advance of an incident. The aim is extend it to an hour in advance of an incident. Marble \n“By 2025, you’ll be able to hail a flying car,” opened the Marble founder, which, incidentally, marked the 100th pitch in EF’s history. \nAfter providing the caveat that ‘moonshot’ projects from the likes of Google are also working on flying cars and that they will need to cross major technical and legal hurdles, he described how the company is getting a head start by building autonomous electric aircraft for maritime surveillance. Marble, bringing us flying cars, is the 100th ever pitch at an @efldn demo day #ef7 pic.twitter.com/GYOw7CqIwR \n— Alice Bentinck (@Alicebentinck) March 7, 2017 \nSpecifically, these are designed as low cost, modular, aerospace-grade unmanned flying vehicles. Bonus: Observe \nAdmittedly, it was impossible to choose just 3 top picks from EF London cohort seven, so I’m sneaking in a bonus fourth pick: Observe is described as the world’s first AI automation platform for fish farms. \nThe idea is to replace a very manually intense process that comprises of using video footage and other sensors to maintain optimum feeding in terms of getting the fish as big as possible as fast as possible and as cheap as possible. \nOver feeding wastes food and lowers margins, while underfeeding means the fish don’t grow fast enough to be profitable. \nTo solve this, Observe uses computer vision and machine learning to simplify the feeding process on large-scale fish farms: how much to feed and when. \nIt has partnered with the leading grower of salmon, meaning the startup has “5 million fish to train our data sets on”. The ultimate aim is to make fish the most sustainable food source in the world. Or, in the founder’s own words, they’re going to “capture the market hook, line and sinker”. \nOh dear. \nIf any of EF7 or previous cohort members would like to stay in touch, I’m @sohear on Twitter or you can read how to pitch me here .
