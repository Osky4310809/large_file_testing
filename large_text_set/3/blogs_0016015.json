His pair of 3-pointers in the final two minutes lifted No. 3 seed Oregon from a three-point deficit to a 75-72 win over pesky 11th seed Rhode Island; and with 27 points — on 9-of-10 shooting — Dorsey notched his fifth straight 20-point game since the start of the Pac-12 tournament. \n“I was joking with him, 9 for 10 — how the heck did you miss that one shot?” said Oregon coach Dana Altman.” \nDorsey has emerged as one of the early stars of this tournament. He’ll run into a couple of others, Michigan’s Derrick Walton Jr. and Mo Wagner, when the teams meet next week in the Sweet 16 in Kansas City. \nBut first, Oregon had to get there. \nRhode Island, lifted by a surprisingly large and boisterous cheering section so far from home, led nearly the entire second half, by as many as 11 points. Their Rams’ shots were falling; most of the Ducks’ were not. Oregon kept committing turnovers. Rhody did not. \nBut Dorsey was the Ducks’ constant. He scored 13 of Oregon’s final 23 points, stepping up in place of a mostly cold-shooting Brooks, who finished 7-of-20 from the floor. Brooks was Mr. Game Winner for most of the 31-5 Ducks’ regular season, but since Dorsey caught fire at the start of the month his teammates say they have been looking for him more. \n— GoDucks (@GoDucks) March 20, 2017 \n“That’s all I’ve been doing these last couple games” said Dorsey. “My teammates have been having confidence in me and I’ve been knocking down the shots.” \nDorsey’s game-tying 3 with 1:47 left came after Jordan Bell grabbed an offensive rebound and kicked it to the hot shooter. \n“When he hit it,” said Bell, “I was like, ‘We got this.'” \nThey did, less than a minute later, after Jordan Pritchard got his hand on a Rhode Island pass and deflected it to Bell. Dorsey wound up with the ball just past half-court, dribbled for about 10 seconds, then pulled up from well beyond the arc for the deciding score.

He’s not just a scorer,” said Altman. “I thought for a while he locked in on his offense and we weren’t getting him the ball enough for a period in the season and that was my fault. \n“… That scorer mentality I want him to have, but defense and rebounding, when he focuses on those two he becomes a special player.” \nHe’ll need to be special again next week against the Wolverines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T12:59:46.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
