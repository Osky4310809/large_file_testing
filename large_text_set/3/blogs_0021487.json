Because it's looking more and more like even more concessions to the extremists are going to be necessary to get enough votes on this thing. Given the conservative obstinance, GOP leaders are quietly trying to figure out what it would take to get at least some of the Freedom Caucus onboard with the health care bill, which is supposed to come up for a vote on Thursday. \nChief deputy whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) spent a good amount of time on the House floor Tuesday talking with Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) about the changes HFC members want. And Meadows reported that McHenry was trying to figure out what it would take to get at least some of the Freedom Caucus to support the bill. \n“McHenry is doing what he does effectively well, and saying, ‘Is there something that can get you to yes,’” Meadows said. “And we’ve articulated that.” […] \nThe Freedom Caucus is now pushing for the elimination of certain minimum coverage standards mandated by the Affordable Care Act ― the so-called “Essential Health Benefits,” which are minimum services that insurance plans must offer, like hospitalization and lab services. Conservatives also have their sights on similar language in Title I of the ACA that constitutes a “Qualified Health Plan.” Eliminating those mandates would lower premiums because insurers could offer plans with huge gaps in coverage. \nThese are changes to the bill that can't be passed in the Senate under budget reconciliation, the process under which Ryan and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell have agreed up on to avoid a filibuster by Senate Democrats. The only way these could be passed in the Senate is if McConnell decides to completely blow up that chamber and do away with the rules. The House maniacs are always trying to blow up the Senate rules, and this is no exception. \nThere are potentially as many as 37 no votes on this thing, 15 more than necessary to defeat it. So now is the time to make Republican members' phones ring off the hook. It doesn't hurt to call Democrats, too, but Republicans are the ones who really need to hear from you. A failure this massive, and on the one thing that has held Republicans together for the past seven years, would do lasting damage to Paul Ryan's speakership and Donald Trump's presidency. \nThe House is scheduled to vote on Trumpcare on THURSDAY, MARCH 23. Even if you already called your member of Congress, do it again by calling the Capitol Hill switchboard at (202) 224-3121. Jam the phone lines, urge them to vote NO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:06:11.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
