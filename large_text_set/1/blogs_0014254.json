You laid it out when those former CIA people said these things about Trump, that he was a recruited agent of the Russians, and a useful fool, they started this in Trump’s mind,” he told Fox News’ Chris Wallace. “He knows the old adage, once a CIA man, always a CIA man. No one came out and said those people shouldn’t be saying those things. So then act two is the briefing when this dossier is put out.” \nHe continued: “I’ve lived in this world for 45 years where you get things and people make allegations — that is a garbage document. It never should have been presented as part of an intelligence briefing. As you suggested, other channels have the White House counsel give it to Trump’s incoming White House counsel. So Trump’s right to be upset about that. I think if you look at the real chronology and the nature of the battle here, those intelligence chiefs who were the best we’ve had, who are terrific and have done great work, made a mistake here. And when people mistakes, they should apologize.” \nTrump was thankful for Woodward’s comments and tweeted about the interview shortly afterwards.
