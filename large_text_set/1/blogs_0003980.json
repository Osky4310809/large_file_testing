In fact, Sarah Michelle Gellar has been chatting Buffy and what she learned from the iconic character and now we’re craving it even more, tbh.\nWhile we were devastated that Sarah Michelle Gellar didn’t remember as much Buffy trivia as we’d totally expected her to, it seems that playing the iconic role has rubbed off on the actress in some respects, be it with her fashion choices or honoring the character with cute anniversary messages .\nNow Sarah Michelle Gellar has been speaking further about the impact that playing Buffy had on her and it’s kinda profound. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter to celebrate the character of Buffy being made one of the publication’s 50 Favorite Female Characters , S.M.G. opened up about the impact that her vampire slaying alter-ego had on her.\n“[Buffy] taught me it wasn’t about being perfect; it was about trying the hardest to be the best you you can be,” she said. “I also loved how hard Buffy worked, as she had no typical powers most superheroes have. She had to train and work hard at her craft. Buffy reminded us that being different was not only OK but really cool — and at a time when most kids are trying to desperately fit in.” Tbh, we couldn’t agree more with all of this.\nContinuing, the 39-year-old actress said that she felt that with Buffy as a whole they were able to tackle some important social issues, too, such as “racism, identity, bullying, guilt, death, first love and heartbreak using the demons as metaphors for the demons we all experience.” \nWhile she didn’t say whether there would be more Buffy on the horizon, Michelle Gellar did say that she hoped that Buffy had found some respite.\n“The burden of saving the world a lot always weighed heavily on her,” she said,\n“so for her sake, I hope she is somewhere on a beautiful beach located far away from any Hellmouth.” In a way, we do totally wish Buffy well (we know she’s fictional but LET US LIVE). However, there’s also a part of us that hopes that she kept kicking butt and saving the world, too. Perhaps a reboot or reunion could shed some light on this…\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T15:06:52.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
