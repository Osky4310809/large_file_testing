Ava Wallace of the Washington Post reported the news. Thompson is the third player in the last two days to transfer, joining Marial Shayok and Jarred Reuter. All three players were part of the Cavaliers' rotation in 2016-17. Thompson averaged 6.2 points and 2.2 assists in 20.8 minutes per game, appearing in 33 contests. He started both of Virginia's NCAA tournament contests but saw inconsistent playing time for much of the season's second half. Having already forfeited one year of eligibility when transferring from Tennessee to Virginia, Thompson is in line to graduate and then be immediately able to play for his next school. NCAA rules allow players who graduate to transfer without losing a year of eligibility. Shayok was the Cavaliers' second-leading scorer, averaging 8.9 points and 2.4 rebounds per game. He had been a part of the team's rotation each of his first three seasons. Reuter received sparing playing time as a freshman but averaged 3.8 points and 2.2 rebounds per game in 2016-17, playing 10.8 minutes a night. “Marial and Jarred informed me today that they are leaving the Virginia basketball program and are looking to transfer to other schools,” Cavaliers coach Tony Bennett said in a statement Wednesday. “I thank Marial and Jarred for their hard work and contributions to our program, and wish them success in the future.” It's unclear what circumstances are leading to the players' exits. Virginia went 23-11, earning a No. 5 seed before losing to Florida in the second round of the NCAA tournament. While Bennett's system has rarely been an aesthetic pleaser, the players must have known the Cavaliers' stylistic tendencies when they arrived.
