ADVERTISEMENT \nThe Indonesian victims were identified as Hamdan Bin Salim, Subandu Bin Sattu and Sudarling Samansung based on the list provided by the Indonesian Police Attache’, according to Lt. Colonel Raphael Alano, the acting Westmincom spokesperson. \nThe fate of their three companions remain unclear, he said. \nGalvez said those rescued on Thursday were Esteban Janamjam, 49, of General Santos City; and Dulce Almers, 50, of Apo Beach in Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur, all of them male. \n“They were rescued in Indanan, Sulu. They were in captivity for two months,” Galvez said. \nHe said Janamjam and Almers were abducted on October 26 while fishing off Pangutaran Island in Sulu. \nGalvez said the Joint Task Force “Sulu“ (JTFS) was able to monitor the location of the kidnap victims and initiated actions by conducting a special operation. “Having caught the captors off guard, troops took advantage of the situation in rescuing the hostages,” he added. \nEsteban and Almers were ferried here for medical checkup and debriefing before they were sent home. \nThey were also provided financial assistance, according to Galvez.
