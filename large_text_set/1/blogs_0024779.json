The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days.\n2. Don’t worry about eating a lot during your period or PMS. It’s part of the cycle. Women actually eat the least when they’re ovulating. Nature has a way of balancing things out like that.\n3. The ovulatory period is approximately 14 days after the first day of your last period and can last up to 7 days. Ovulation is when your egg is made available for fertilization.\n4. If you want to get pregnant, having sex during your ovulatory period is your best bet. If you don’t want to get pregnant, avoid having sex during ovulation like the plague!\n5. Women are the horniest and most sexually active during the ovulation period of their menstrual cycle. It’s like nature is purposely fucking us over (at least those who don’t want a baby anytime soon).\n6. There are so many free apps available that help you keep track of your menstrual cycle. Download them! I use Clue.\n7. Vaginal yeast infections can be caused by an overwhelmingly amount of things: rough sex, diabetes, hormonal birth control, shaving, you name it.\n8. Moisture allows yeast to grow in the vagina. Let your vagina dry after you’ve taken a shower. Wear dresses or skirts during summer. Steer clear from the beach for a while, or bring a change of dry clothes.\n9. Peeing after sex is also a good habit to have. It helps prevent yeast infections.\n10. Cotton undies are better for your vagina than any other type of fabric. And sensitive fragrance-free soaps like Dove are best.\n11. If you want to get rid of hairs down there, you have a couple options. Shaving, waxing, or laser removal. It’s best to see a professional if you have a sensitive vagina. If not done properly, you could cause a yeast infection.\n12. Your first time will probably hurt. And might just be a bloody mess. Literally. The hymen is a thin membrane in the opening of the vagina that can actually break before you lose your virginity. It could break through fingering, masturbation, or even the use of tampons.\n13. Girls can cum. Get to know your body. In other words, masturbate.\n14. Get tested for Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Today.\n15. If you just started seeing someone, it’s okay to ask them if they’ve been checked for STD’s or not.\n16. STD’s can be transmitted through oral sex. Use a condom! Or don’t give any blowjobs until you know for certain the person you’re with is clean.\n17. The pill doesn’t protect you from STD’s! Condoms are the only birth control that protect you from STD’s.\n18. The birth control pill can come with side effects including: weight gain, mood swings, and depression. However, this doesn’t happen to everyone!\n19. On a more positive note, the pill can also clear up your skin and make your periods lighter.\n20. Some girls need to try up to three different brands of pills until they find the one that suits them best. Just because one set of pills made you feel shitty, doesn’t mean others will too.\n21. Never stop taking the pills mid-month (I made this mistake). If you’re unhappy with the current pills you’re taking, push through and complete the full monthly cycle. If you don’t wait the full month, you’re in for a hormonal roller coaster. Best of luck to you, your significant other, and your friends.\n22. There are plenty of other birth control options besides the more commonly known male condoms and the pill.\n23. If you’re not interested in the pill, you could receive a shot every three months at your gynecologist instead. Progestin, the hormone used in the shot, stops your ovaries from developing any eggs during ovulation.\n24. You could also decide to use an IntraUterine Device (or IUD) for birth control, which is a T-shaped object inserted into the uterus and has the highest overall effectiveness of any other birth control. Except abstinence, that is.\n25 . There are two types of IUD’s: hormonal and copper. The hormonal lasts either three or five years (depending on the one you get) and the copper one lasts up to ten years.\n26. The hormonal IUD’s (in some women) make your periods altogether disappear or at least much shorter than usual.\n27. The copper IUD is known for intense periods that last longer and cause more pain.\n28 . If you’re not liking how the IUD is making you feel, IUD’s can be taken out whenever you’d like.\n29. There is no correct amount of sexual partners. As long as you’re safe and nobody’s getting hurt, who gives a fuck?\n30. There’s really no right or wrong when it comes to sex. Explore and have fun, but always remember to be safe! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T05:01:43.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
