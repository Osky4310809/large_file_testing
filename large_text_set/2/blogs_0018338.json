Today they’ve got another new song along with news of in • ter a • li • a , their first album since 2000’s classic Relationship Of Command . As previously reported, the album was produced by Omar Rodríguez-López and Rich Costey (Death Cab For Cutie, Muse, Sigur Rós); its title is Latin for “among other things.” The new track “Incurably Innocent” is unmistakably ATDI — knotty, frantic, precise even as it threatens to go off the rails — although it does find Cedric Bixler-Zavala breaking out some strained hair metal bellows at its climax. The singer explains that it’s “a song about sexual abuse and being able to finally speak out.” Listen below. \nTracklist: \n01 “No Wolf Like The Present” 02 “Continuum” 03 “Tilting At The Univendor” 04 “Governed By Contagions” 05 “Pendulum In A Peasant Dress” 06 “Incurably Innocent”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:30:06.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
