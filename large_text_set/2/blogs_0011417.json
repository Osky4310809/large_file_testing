What character she is playing is still a mystery, a recent post indicates she will have her very own costume. \nNo name has been attached to Hatcher, but she will be playing the main villain for the rest of season 2. If you're going to go against Supergirl, you better have some armor, and Hatcher shared a glimpse of hers on Twitter ( via HeroicHollywood ). She shared an image with the caption \"Well I'm definitely gettin some love in the wardrobe room @TheCWSupergirl. Can't think of a more fun place to be.\" \nWell I'm definitely gettin some love in the wardrobe room @TheCWSupergirl .

By the time the designers are done, though, rest assured she's more than hold her own against National City's resident hero. \nYou can view the official description for the next episode of Supergirl below. \nWhen Mr. Mxyzptlk (guest star Peter Gadiot), a magical imp, shows up on Earth and declares his love for Kara (Melissa Benoist), she tries to let him down easy, thinking him harmless.

He and Kara argue over how to get rid of Mr. Mxyzptlk, further straining their relationship. Meanwhile, Alex (Chyler Leigh) and Maggie (Floriana Lima) celebrate their first Valentine’s Day together. \nStefan Pleszczynski directed the episode written by Jessica Queller & Sterling Gates. \nDistributed worldwide by Warner Bros.
