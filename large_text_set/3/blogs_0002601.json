She encourages her students to go for their goals and become something great, even if they arent interested in persuing a career in art.Ms.Day does so many extra things for her students because she cares about them and wishes the greatest out of them.Some of the most amazing things Ms.Day has done for us are:-Opening up opportunities to display our art at gallerys-Going out of her way to search for creative projects to partake in-Purchasing specific materials for her students with her OWN money instead of with her budget-Running and organizing our National Art Honor Society-Entering her students into highly competitive art competitions, such as the Vans Custom Culture contest-Running AP classes for her advanced students Without Ms.Day being full time at Catoctin, the art students are going to miss out on a lot of opportunity and encouragement to put themselves out into the world. She deserves to keep her full time position and that is the goal of the petition. We want to keep Ms.Day at Catoctin full time because she interacts with her students more personally than any other teacher, she opens so many amazing opportuinities for her students to grow, and most importantly she cares greatly about the kids she teaches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:06:24.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
