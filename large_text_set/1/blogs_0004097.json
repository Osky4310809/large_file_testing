The report noted that the e-mails could have been passed through middlemen. \nRussia also used state-funded propaganda and paid “trolls” to make nasty comments on social media services, the report said. \nMoreover, intelligence officials believe that Moscow will apply lessons learned from its activities in the election to put its thumbprint on future elections in the U.S. and allied nations. \nThe public report was minus classified details that intelligence officials shared with President Barack Obama on Thursday. \nIn an interview with The Associated Press after the briefing, Mr. Trump said he “learned a lot” from his discussions with intelligence officials, but he declined to say whether he accepted their assertion that Russia had intruded in the election on his behalf.
