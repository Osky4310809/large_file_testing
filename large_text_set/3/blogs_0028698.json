Burma says UN claims of crimes against humanity are ‘exaggerated’ \nLast week, a commission chaired by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, created at the behest of Ms Suu Kyi, presented interim recommendations to the government about long-term solutions to tensions between Rohingya and Rakhine Buddhists in Rakhine state. The recommendations included allowing journalists free access to the western part of the country. \nZaw Htay, a presidential spokesman, said Burma “cannot accept” the council's decision. \n“What the UN Human Rights Council did to us is totally not fair and not right under international practices,” Mr Htay said, citing a domestic investigation. “They should have waited and watched the correspondent country's investigation, and the result coming out from that,” and only then offer possible criticism of its work, he added. \nThe army launched counterinsurgency operations in Rohingya areas in northern Rakhine in October after the killing of nine border guards. UN human rights investigators and independent rights organisations charge that soldiers and police killed and raped civilians and burned down more than 1,000 homes during the operations. \nThe HRC resolution says the council's president will appoint the independent, international fact-finding mission, which is to provide an oral update on its work in the council's autumn session followed by a written report a year from now. Some countries including China, India and Cuba dissociated themselves from the resolution, brought by Malta on behalf of the European Union. \nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) praised the UN’s move. \n“This is crucial for ensuring that allegations of serious human rights abuses in Burma are thoroughly examined by experts, and to ensure that those responsible will ultimately be held accountable,” said Geneva director John Fisher. \n“Burma’s government should cooperate fully with the mission, including by providing unfettered access to all affected areas.” Pope Francis defends right of Burma's Rohingya Muslims to 'live their faith' \nHRW says approximately 120,000 Rohingya are displaced in Rakhine State as a result of violence in 2012. \nAbout 100,000 of them are in closed camps near Sittwe, the state capital, where they are living in squalid conditions, many of them in rice fields prone to seasonal flooding. \n“The violations occurring in Rakhine State threaten to undo Burma’s hard-won progress toward a more rights-respecting and democratic future,” added Mr Fisher.

Her office has cited “continued and escalating violence” in parts of Bu. In an interview with The Associated Press last week, Lee said she had been told “the situation is currently worse than at any point in the past few years.” \nReuters and Associated Press contributed to this report More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:24:56.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
