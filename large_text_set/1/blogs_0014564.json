PUBLISHED: 21:21, Tue, Jan 17, 2017 | UPDATED: 21:35, Tue, Jan 17, 2017 \nLib Dem leader Tim Farron was branded “anti-democratic” as he repeated his demand for a second referendum on the final deal and insisted “one option must be to retain membership of the EU .” \nThe row came as the Prime Minister ’s historic Lancaster House speech was welcomed by Leave campaigners and business groups. GETTY Tim Farron was claimed to be 'anti-democtatic' as he repeated demands for a second EU referendum Related articles Sturgeon told to take second independence referendum off the table \nBritish Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson described it as “an ambitious plan with the right priorities.” \nRichard Tice, co-chairman of Leave Means Leave was delighted that Mrs May had taken up his organisation’s main message that “no deal is better than a bad deal.” \nHe said: “We welcome her commitment to delivering the democratic will of the people and the tough position she has set out ahead of negotiations with the EU. \n“We share her vision of an ‘independent, self-governing Global Britain’ outside of the single market, without the restrictive elements of the customs union and no longer ruled by the European Court of Justice.” GETTY It came after Theresa May's highly anticipated Brexit speech earlier today \nLord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: “These are clear decisions and they are the right ones. Tim Farron and the other eight hapless Liberal anti-Democrats should wake up and get behind the huge benefits Brexit offers David Campbell Bannerman, Brexit campaigner and MEP \n“The government must preserve skilled migration in both directions while achieving a sharp reduction in migration from the EU for low skilled work.” \nLeave.EU founder Arron Banks warned that Mrs May needs to live up to her words and warned of a “Remainer coup” when the deal is put before parliament. \nThe billionaire businessman said: “With the promise of a parliamentary vote on her deal with the EU, May has opened the door to a Remainer coup. The House of Lords is a chamber of party political cronies, unfit for purpose.” \nMr Banks’ warning followed a briefing to journalists by Mr Farron who made it clear that he wants a second referendum and an option to stay in the EU. \nLeading an embittered Remoaner backlash, the Lib Dem leader said:“By conceding the half elected Parliament will have a vote she [the Prime Minister] has effectively conceded that Article 50 is revocable. \nHe went on: “We will argue that the best position of the British government is to make sure that your option is not a bad deal or falling out into outer darkness. \n“No Prime Minister who gave a monkey’s about the British people would leave those two options.
