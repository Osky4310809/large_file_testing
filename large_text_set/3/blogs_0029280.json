As with any good Shakespearian play, it precedes more drama ahead. \n“Act Two will involve the negotiations about the negotiations at EU level, with a subplot concerning the changes at domestic level to be introduced with the Great Repeal Bill. \n“Act Three will focus on the negotiations over the terms of the divorce, especially payments for the commitments the UK has already entered into. \n“Act Four may consider the framework for a future trade deal. Act Five will be the denouement, the unravelling of the plot, and the big reveal: the terms and conditions of Brexit.” What will happen about the EU exit bill? \nProfessor Iain Begg said: “One of the first and, probably, most contentious issues in the negotiations will be the size of the 'divorce' bill the UK will have to pay. \n“Some on the UK side believe it need not be anything at all, while the signals from Brussels suggest it could be as high as €50-60 billion. \n“Moreover, it is being argued by the EU side that unless there is progress on the money issue, other topics will be stalled. Failure to settle this thorny, if ultimately straightforward issue quickly could have a damaging effect on other elements of the negotiations.” What will happen to EU citizens? \nProfessor Jonathan Portes said: “Will Article 50 mean a quick end to the damaging uncertainty which hangs over millions of EU citizens living here and Brits abroad? Yes and no. \n“Politically, this should be one of the easiest issues to resolve; but the administrative and practical details are formidable. \n“Theresa May has made it clear she wants to end free movement, so a key question is whether immigration will be part of the negotiations at all. \n“The government knows the economic value of EU migration to the UK and ending free movement without other arrangements in place risks the UK losing not just low-skilled migrants, but nurses, care workers, bankers and researchers.” What will happen to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? \nDr Jo Hunt said: “The Prime Minister is committed to a 'whole UK' approach to Brexit, but as Article 50 is being triggered, the governments within the UK are divided. \n“Northern Ireland has no prospect of forming its own government, while in remain-voting Scotland and leave-voting Wales, their devolved governments' preference is for a soft Brexit. \n“These divisions at home will add an extra unwelcome dimension to the UK government's task ahead in Brussels.” What will happen to foreign policy? \nProfessor Richard Whitman said: “The UK is about to embark on its most significant diplomatic challenge in over four decades. \n“In the course of the next two years Britain's foreign and security policy will go through a period of extensive remodelling in which, paradoxically, the EU will be its central preoccupation. \n“The future relationship the UK negotiates with the EU will largely determine the prospects for the 'Global Britain' that the government has set as an objective for the UK's post-Brexit place in the world.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:23:24.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
