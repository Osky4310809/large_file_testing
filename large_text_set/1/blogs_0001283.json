Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool are sweating on the fitness of Daniel Sturridge after the striker limped off in the draw with Sunderland. \nSturridge was making his first start since October at the Stadium of Light and opened the scoring for Jurgen Klopp's men with a fine header. \nBut his afternoon ended on a sour note as he was forced off with 10 minutes to go. \nThe England striker went down clutching his right ankle and Jurgen Klopp confirmed he had taken a knock. \nIt is another blow for Sturridge , whose Anfield career has been severely hampered by injuries.
