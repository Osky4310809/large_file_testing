For its eighth development update, we get protagonist Miriam platforming her way through a town. It's an innocuous 30 seconds. \nBut, for some reason, I can't stand the way it looks, but I also can't quite put my finger on why that's the case. Are the jumping or running animations slightly off? Are the backgrounds too static? Does it have something to do with the shadows? Does it feel like Miriam's not interacting with the world she's traversing? I can't figure it out! \nIdeally, it won't really matter because this shouldn't necessarily be indicative of the final product. Bloodstained won't release until 2018 at the earliest. Whatever's weird here should be ironed out by then. You are logged out.
