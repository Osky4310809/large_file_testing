I’m having a bad day.” While it is perfectly acceptable and probably even encouraged to have some bad days, they’re no fun. Luckily, here’s a list of some (free ‘n easy) things you can do to conquer a bad day. Bad Day 1. Move that body \nIn the famous words of Nelly, “Move that body/Work that body girl/Twist that body/Shake it shorty.” Nelly knows what’s up. \nDopamine is a neurotransmitter produced naturally in your brain that plays a role in happiness and feelings of pleasure. The best way to produce more dopamine? Exercise. Although the last thing you may feel like doing is shuffling your legs along at 7mph or doing dumbbell curls in front of your fellow-gym-goers, sometimes you’ve gotta put mind over matter in order to feel better. And the gym isn’t your only option! Walk your dog (or your cat — they like it, I swear ) do some pushups on your floor, skip rope, or dance to your favorite song in your room by yourself. But close your blinds first. 2. Talk to your Mom \nShe pushed you out of her body voluntarily . She loves you unconditionally (even when you’re not very lovable). Your Mom is, arguably, the one person that loves you the most in this world. If you’re lucky enough to have a fab Mom that thinks the world of you, chances are she’ll have some words of wisdom for your Bad Day. Even if she can’t put a Band-Aid on the wound, she can at least validate the fact that you are loved today — and every day. And that’s enough to make your dark day a teeny tiny bit brighter. 3. Search “dogs in human clothes” on Google Images \nDogs in business suits. Dogs in graduation robes. Dogs in leopard underwear. You name it; someone has dressed their dog in it. 4. Eat chocolate \nYeah, yeah, I know… you shouldn’t turn to food when you’re upset. Emotional eating is bad and stuff. While this is probably true if you do it often, once in a while on a bad day you’re allowed to turn to chocolate. (Because I said so.) Chocolate will always be there for you when no one else is. Has chocolate ever talked badly behind your back? No. Has chocolate ever given you an F on an exam? No. Has chocolate ever broken up with you for another girl? No. Not to mention, it’s a proven fact that the chemicals in chocolate release feel-good endorphins that make you happy after consuming it. Science. 5. Enjoy a cup of joe \nSometimes I truly just don’t know how coffee does it. On the days I feel my worst, I make myself a cup or four of coffee and suddenly birds are chirping, my problems are lighter, the world is sparkling, my skin is glowing, my feet are dancing, and everything is okay again. 6. Put things in perspective \nSometimes it’s just all about how you re-wire your brain. Attitude is everything. Even if everything goes wrong, find one thing that went right that day, and focus on that. Realize that in a year, likely what you’re worked up about won’t matter as much as it does right now. This won’t affect you for much longer than today, and that’s important. Make the most of the day you have left. 7. If all else fails, distract yourself \nIt could be a new book you’ve been waiting to get your hands on, a mindless TV show (thanks, Kardashians), bingeing Grey’s Anatomy on Netflix, or playing computer games for six hours. Shifting your attention to something other than why you’re upset does wonders for your mood. After all, isn’t escaping your day all you really want to do when you’re having a bad one? So escape it — in a healthy way.
