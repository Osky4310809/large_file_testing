According to Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner, the president-elect has two \"landing teams\" assigned to federal agencies who are already looking for ways to cut the fat in government.\nThe cuts would target discretionary spending, not mandated programs such as Medicare or Social Security, the sources said.\nThe spending reductions are expected to be used to help pay for Trump's plan to boost the Pentagon's budget, tax cuts and some pet projects, potentially including the anti- immigration wall on the nation's southern border.\nThe teams also are looking at staffing cuts over four years through attrition, a hiring freeze and reorganization.\nThe plan is winning cheers in conservative, anti-tax and anti-spending corners in Washington that have long sought massive cuts in the bureaucracy.\nPresidents rarely cut spending, choosing freezes instead. In the meantime, federal spending has reached historic levels. Trump has picked a budget hawk, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, to head the Office of Management and Budget, a clear sign that spending cuts are a top priority.\nStill, Trump is likely to face a wall of opposition from Democrats and federal unions who consider much of the federal workforce on their side.\nNothing ever comes easy in Washington and Trump's plan will be no different. Every federal program has its champions in Congress and special interest groups to defend it. Every member of Congress have their own ideas on what programs should be cut and which should be saved.\nEven conservative Republicans have their pet programs. Getting to 218 in the House and 51 in the Senate on such an ambitious plan will be an incredible accomplishment if it can be done.\nThe key is that Trump will ignore the mandatory spending on entitlements, which make up about 60% of the budget, and concentrate on discretionary spending, which includes spending by the Pentagon. Since Trump has promised to increase military spending, there are no cuts to be made there. That leaves a paltry 16% of the budget dedicated to discretionary spending out of which Trump will try to wring a 10% cut in the overall $4 trillion budget.\nThis includes:\nExamples of other well-known programs paid for by discretionary spending include the early childhood education program Head Start (included in Housing & Community), Title I grants to disadvantaged schools and Pell grants for low-income college students (Education), food assistance for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), training and placement for unemployed people provided by Workforce Investment Boards (in Social Security, Unemployment and Labor), and scientific research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF), among many others. https://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/17/trump-looking-for-10-cut-in-budget-slash-20-of-federal-workers/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/section/immigration", "https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/"], "published": "2017-01-17T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:21:21.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
