You too? Good news! Now someone has done in it fully explorable, browser-friendly 3D. \nYou can check it out here . Built as a demo of Archilogic’s web-based architecture viewing platform, it should work without downloads/plugins/etc. \nThere’s a few easter eggs hidden in there for the fans — alas, Kevin’s chili stain is nowhere to be found. Be sure to tap the foot icon to actually wander around the office (using WASD/arrow keys) as opposed to the default birds eye view. \n(And yeah, diehards might argue that the model isn’t perfect — but, if we’re being honest, a perfect model isn’t really possible. Beyond walls getting pushed around for the sake of the shot, things shift around a bit from season to season, and this seems to be something of a mashup across multiple seasons; you’ll find Sabre boxes around the office, but Pam’s desk that comes in around that time is nowhere to be found) 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:35:12.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
