Jones Student Leadership Conference and MLK Day of Service, organized each January by the Center for Leadership and Service. \nThe day begins with interactive conference sessions on motivation and multiculturalism. \nThen the students help community organizations like the Knoxville Botanical Garden, Zoo Knoxville, and Keep Knoxville Beautiful that register for volunteer assistance. \n“There are these terrible stereotypes that our generation of college students is lazy, self-centered, apathetic, insatiable, etc.,” Albritton says. “But I think we are such a passionate, informed, connected group, and we have so much potential to be change makers. We are huge advocates for the causes and people we believe in.” \n“It’s important, though, to make sure we’re incorporating action into our advocacy,” she adds. “We should make sure that we’re following through with the projects we’re passionate about because we can make the change. We have that power.” \nOver its 15-year history, the leadership conference and day of service boasts participation from more than 5,600 students. \nTheir combined 11,200 hours of service are equivalent to approximately $258,000 in funding for the Knoxville community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:32:48.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
