During last year’s NCAA tournament Boston Globe sports writer Dan Shaughnessy was taken to task on Twitter by the Huskies faithful after posting that UConn was “killing (the) women’s game.” He later wrote “UConn women are so good they have stripped their sport of all drama.” Auriemma adamantly disagrees, saying after UConn advanced to last year’s Final Four, “The idea that Connecticut is hurting the game is absolutely absurd because, make no mistake about it, if Connecticut were not dominating the sport, there is so little enthusiasm and coverage outside of people who are passionate about the game, so the only way that the casual fan can be drawn in is by excellence and sustained excellence ... we should appreciate sustained excellence.” If the Huskies’ dominance is hurting the game, the fans sure aren’t buying it. There were 36.7 million live minutes viewed for last year’s women’s NCAA tournament, up 31% from 2015. Even the WNBA might be benefiting from UConn’s star power. Viewership on ESPN and ESPN2 increased by 11% last season when the UConn trio of Stewart, Jefferson, and Tuck went 1-2-3 in the draft. Stewart’s jersey was last season’s best-seller and helped the WNBA store increase sales by 30%. Stewart has become the face of UConn and of women’s basketball, just like another UConn great, Maya Moore, before her. Of the players that have been on the hardwood for the Huskies during the 111-game win streak, Stewart’s name shows up in the top five of just about every stat, but it’s kept in good company by the names of the “core four:” Collier, Nurse, Samuelson and Williams. “We have an opportunity to do it right now (to take ownership of the streak and the history). The streak, we’re a part of it. We didn’t do it all on our own. There was a lot of people who came before us to start the streak, and we are kind of carrying on that legacy that they left, and that’s something that we focus on every day,” Nurse said.
