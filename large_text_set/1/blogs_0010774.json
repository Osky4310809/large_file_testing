The latest promotion, which began today, is offering families up to $800 in pre-paid Visa cards if they move their lines to Sprint.\nBest Sprint Android phones If you are on another carrier and want to switch and get that extra money back, you can go to your local Sprint store and turn in up to four phones and lines, and then sign up each line for the company’s Unlimited Data, Talk and Text plans. Then you go to Sprint’s special offer site within 30 days of activation to register for the offer. Each line will get a $200 Visa pre-paid card in the mail within four to six weeks, so if you sign up four lines you can get $800 back.\nThis special promotional offer is for any activations made until February 2, so you have less than three weeks to take advantage of this offer.
