After an unspecified car crash while street racing, Dom meets the villainous Cipher ( Charlize Theron ), who manipulates him into betraying his family and working for her. \nWe know pretty much what happens next – Letty and the rest of the gang are now on a mission to recover Dom, and will travel everywhere from New York to the arctic Barents Sea to do so. Nearly the entire family is back for another adventure, including Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej Parker (Ludacris). \nFurious 7 baddie Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) is back, this time to assist his former enemies, while Frank Petty (Kurt Russell), Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) also return. The Fate of the Furious will be followed by two more films, with the ninth film going on the silver screen on April 19, 2019, while the tenth (and maybe the final) instalment will arrive on April 2, 2021.
