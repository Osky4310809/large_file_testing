Snap \nA spokesperson said that Thursday's updates will be available to a limited number of Android users first before they're made available to all Snapchat users \"soon.\" \nSnapchat parent company Snap Inc. is preparing for an initial public offering that could value its advertising businesses at between $20-25 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T01:47:31.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
