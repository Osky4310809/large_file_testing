The shares were sold as scheduled pursuant to Cook's predetermined trading plan. Cook retains 1,009,809 company shares worth over $121 million based on Apple's current stock price following the sale. A recent SEC filing revealed Cook was paid $8.7 million in 2016, which is $1.5 million less than he was paid in 2015 . The decrease stems from Apple failing to meet its own target performance goals for both net sales and operating income in 2016, resulting in senior executives receiving only 89.5% of their cash incentives. However, upon reaching his fifth anniversary as Apple CEO last year, Cook cashed in nearly $137 million in previously-awarded stock bonuses tied to both his tenure and Apple's performance under his leadership. Accordingly, after bonuses, Cook actually earned roughly $145 million last year, his biggest payout yet. Yesterday, Apple analyst Neil Cybart opined that Cook and his inner circle are \"doing what needs to be done in order to maintain Apple's relevancy,\" but he noted \"there is room for improvement.\" He called out sporadic Mac and iPad updates, and slow progress with Siri , as two blemishes among others in its product strategy. In attempt to add a bit of relative context to this subjective grading: • Product Strategy: A- • Public Face: A+ • Financials: B In related shareholder news, the world's largest asset manager BlackRock has increased its stake in Apple and now holds 6.1% of outstanding shares in the company, up from 5.7% a year ago. Its 322,683,504 shares are valued at over $38.7 billion based on Apple's current stock price. 24 minutes ago at 07:26 am A- for product strategy, A+ for public face, really???'AirPods (that are repeatedly back ordered because supply is super weak) are a runaway success' Pffft, puff piece report card, Rating: 4 Votes 18 minutes ago at 07:33 am Product pipeline/R&D has \"A\" grade? Who are we kidding? 3 year old design iPhone, overpriced MacBook Pro that is not Pro... Rating: 3 Votes 18 minutes ago at 07:32 am Product Strategy: A- Product Pipeline/R&D: A Based on what??? Its a complete secret if it exists. In my opinion he get a healthy pass, though that is cause he keeps bringing in the profits, so financials should be A for milking the existing product line and maximising profits. Though to give him an A- and A for words please. Rating: 3 Votes 17 minutes ago at 07:33 am Do you understand how supply and demand works? Nice gif, to substitute for an argument. Sure I do, I'm glad you are a SJW in defense of everything related to Tim Cook, an every day man, A lot of people in the world (I.e. All iPhone users) could 'demand' AirPods, but if Foxconn is only shipping/'supplying' 1000 units every few weeks, that's hardly success. That's a huge wedge between high demand and low supply, meanwhile the price isn't being adjusted accordingly in a traditional theoretical supply/demand chart, where they could be making hundreds and hundreds and capitalizing on the opportunity (i'm not faulting Apple for not price gauging and price discriminating, but this is what would follow in a closed model without taking into account any real world market factors), it is the static $159 it will be up until the day before gen2, Especially coming from a supposed supply chain guru CEO, this is weak. Same with 7+ in short supply, for months. And Touchbar macs, And Smart Keyboard with 9.7 pro launch.

Just get your act together and make the Mac great again. Desktops, laptops and peripherals (the ecosystem) need big time love. Don't go down in history as the guy who killed the Mac.
