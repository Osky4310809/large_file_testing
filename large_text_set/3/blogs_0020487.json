NBC intel reporter slammed for this take on #LondonAttack coverage Posted at 2:36 pm on March 22, 2017 by Doug P. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThere are over 20 casualties following a terrorist attack in London , and the story is all over the news and social media. This “intelligence and national security reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit” thinks widespread reporting about the story isn’t a good thing. Why? Here you go: I know it's a big story, but every time we freak out about a small-bore terror attack we play into their hands. \n— Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) March 22, 2017 \nWhat? \n— Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 22, 2017 Fatalities and injuries are not “small bore.” https://t.co/VOpu31VLdc \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) March 22, 2017 \nSuffice to say, not everybody agreed with Dilanian: @KenDilanianNBC No. Every time we let people into the country who hate our guts and want to kill us, we play into their hands. \n— DC Dude (@DCDude1776) March 22, 2017 Great.
