An engine idling stop system is standard for all variants. \nThe first model to be built on the company’s all-new Subaru Global Platform , the new Impreza is said to be a significant improvement over the previous-gen car in terms of NVH, driving dynamics and safety. \nThe new platform also comes with a longer wheelbase of 2,670 mm (+20 mm), and sees a change in the car’s dimensions as well. The Impreza now measures 40 mm longer on the sedan (4,625 mm) and hatchback (4,460 mm), 1,775 mm wide (-20 mm) and 1,480 mm tall (+5 mm). \nOn top of this architecture, the Impreza’s revised body fully incorporates the ‘Dynamic x Solid’ design philosophy that was flaunted on the Tokyo and Los Angeles concepts in 2015. \nNow featuring a cleaner look than before, the front end features the familiar Subaru grille with a single slat that runs through the logo. Just beside it, you’ll find halogen headlamps on the 1.6i variant (1.6i-S and 2.0i-S get steering-responsive, automatic LED units with C-shaped LED DRLs). All models come with front fog lamps. \nDown the sides, the base 1.6i gets 16-inch alloy wheels shod with 205/55 section tyres, while 17-inch units (with 205/50 section tyres) are unique to the 1.6i-S and 2.0i-S. The rear, meanwhile, is significantly altered, with new taillights that are sleeker in look compared to before. \nSimilar to other Subarus, they feature C-shaped lighting graphics as seen on the Forester and XV . As for other exterior items, power-folding door mirrors with LED turn signals, powered sunroof and headlamp washers are all found on all variants except the 1.6i. \nThe cabin also gets an overhaul here, with a new dashboard design (Japan-spec seen here) that is more angular and contemporary compared to the outgoing model. New items include the steering wheel, gear lever, switchgear and instrument cluster. Unlike other markets, the Singapore-spec Impreza comes with an electronic parking brake on all variants. \nThe main standout here is the touchscreen infotainment system, which is a 6.5-inch unit on the 1.6i, while the remaining two variants get a larger 8.0-inch one instead. Both systems come with Apple CarPlay integration, voice recognition command and the usual USB and AUX inputs. \nJust above that is a 6.3-inch multi-info display that shows information like exterior temperature, fuel economy and other vehicle functions. Higher-end ‘S’ variants have a ‘higher grade’ system, according to Motor Image. \nOn the 1.6i-S and 2.0i-S, equipment such as dual-zone automatic air-conditioning, keyless operation, rearview camera, power-adjustable driver’s seat, PIN code access (like on the Forester), auto dimming rearview mirror, aluminium pedals and multi-function steering wheel all come as standard. \nDespite all the differences between the variants, the comprehensive safety kit offered here – seven airbags (front, side, curtain and driver’s knee), Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC), Isofix child seat mounts, side door reinforcement beams, ABS, EBD and brake assist – is standard on all variants. \nHowever, the same can’t be said of driver assistance systems, with the 1.6i losing out on blind spot monitor, high beam assist, lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert. \nInterested? Well, we’ve been told the that this regular Impreza will not make its way to Malaysia, but it serves as a good preview of what the next-generation XV will be like. We’ve been told previously that Tan Chong’s Segambut plant, which assembles the XV and Forester, will be ready in time to handle the production of Subaru models that use the next-gen platform, including an all-new XV, so there’s that.
