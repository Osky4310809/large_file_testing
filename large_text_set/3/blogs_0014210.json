That feeling when you've reached the @ChampionsLeague Quarter-Finals. #LeiSev pic.twitter.com/Vp6Rnsujg9 — Leicester City (@LCFC) March 14, 2017 \n\"We went in to be competitive but I thought we were immense. We rode our luck at times but the character the players showed was immense and there for everyone to see. \n\"These players enjoy pressing from the front. The idea was to try and make it as uncomfortable as we could. We set the game plan out tremendously. \n\"Goals change games and Wes gets the first one and puts us in the driver's seat. — Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) March 14, 2017 \n\"[Schmeichel] is a great shot-stopper, when we needed him most he came up trumps. \n\"It'll be nice to pit our wits against someone else, we've just knocked out one of the best teams in Europe. Their credentials are there for everyone to see. As a club we can be immensely proud. \n\"The Champions League music ignites everyone and the crowd were terrific. It's only three games and somewhere along the line there might be a hiccup but I'll enjoy tonight.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:14:34.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
