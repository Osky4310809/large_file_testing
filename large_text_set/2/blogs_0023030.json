Chellew, 31, an 8-year veteran of the CHP died at 6:11 p.m. at UC Davis Medical Center, authorities announced at a 9:30 p.m. news conference at the hospital. \n“My heart aches on this terribly tragic day for the CHP as we have lost a hero, who swore a sacred and honorable oath to serve and protect the people of California,” CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow said in a written statement. “Please keep Officer Chellew's family, friends and the entire CHP family in your thoughts and prayers as they mourn his loss.” \nChellew was in pursuit of a fleeing motorcyclist eastbound on Fruitridge Road, east of Highway 99, when a collision occurred and he lost control of his motorcycle at 5:45 p.m. Wednesday just past Stockton Boulevard, the CHP said in a news release. \nThe officer suffered major injuries, and first responders “worked tirelessly” to keep him alive at the scene and en route to the hospital, Officer Tommy Riggin, a CHP spokesman, said. \n“Tragically, despite the valiant efforts of the paramedics and medical professionals, Officer Chellew did succumb to his injuries,” Riggin said. \nRiggin said Chellew was a husband and father. A bell ringing ceremony in the officer’s memory will be held Thursday morning at the CHP Academy in West Sacramento, he said at the news conference. \nChellew was assigned to the CHP’s South Sacramento Area Office, officials said. \nSome reports indicated that Chellew’s motorcycle struck a pole, but CHP spokesman Officer Michael Bradley said he could not confirm that or discuss any details, noting that officers were still conducting an investigation at the scene. \nThe area of Fruitridge Road and Stockton Boulevard remained closed to traffic for several hours, as the Sacramento Police Department and Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department assisted the CHP at the scene. \nChellew, whose parents had lived in Rocklin, graduated from the California Highway Patrol Academy in West Sacramento in 2009, according to a story that Rocklin’s Placer Herald newspaper published at the time. \nChellew was a 2003 graduate of Bear River High School in Nevada County, the newspaper said. He served in the Army for five years, attaining the rank of sergeant, before joining the CHP, it said. \nChellew’s father, Charles Chellew, was a captain and commander of the CHP’s North Sacramento area office, the newspaper said. \nChellew’s younger sister, Hanna Chellew, also graduated from the CHP Academy in 2009, the Roseville and Granite Bay Press Tribune reported when she completed cadet training.
