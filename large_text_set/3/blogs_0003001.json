Don’t pretend that you haven’t. For whatever reason, we can’t seem to help ourselves from giving any new electronic we buy a quick taste. With that said, you’re going to want to keep Nintendo Switch cartridges as far away from your mouth as possible. Unlike most electronics, these small SD cards have a repulsive taste. However, there is a good reason for it.\nNintendo sent a statement to The Verge ( who conducted its own taste test ) to explain the god-awful taste of Nintendo Switch cartridges. It turns out that it was a deliberate move on Nintendo’s part.\n“To avoid the possibility of accidental ingestion, keep the game card away from young children,” said Nintendo. “A bittering agent (Denatonium Benzoate) has also been applied to the game card. This bittering agent is non-toxic.”\nIGN’s Alanah Pearce also confirmed that the taste was by design… and that it is vile.\nOkay, so, turns out Nintendo Switch cartridges taste awful so kids won’t eat them. I, uh, just licked one and can confirm: TASTES BAD MAN.\n— Alanah Pearce (@Charalanahzard) March 1, 2017\nAs crazy as this all sounds, it makes perfect sense. Nintendo has always made its consoles, accessories, and games kid-friendly. It stands to reason that they would want to keep small children (and curious adults) from choking to death on the tiny Switch cartridges. That would make for some pretty awful press, after all.\nDoes the Nintendo Switch itself have this same horrible taste? I should be getting my system tomorrow when it launches. I’ll gladly take one for the team and give it a taste to see what happens. I’ll make sure to do it before breakfast just in case it has a disgusting taste. I sure hope it doesn’t because the console does look good enough to lick. Don’t judge me.\nWant to learn more?
