Now, YI has confirmed with No Film School that the model will be available on March 28 on their website, and on Amazon approximately mid-April. \nAlthough we were unable to confirm the action cam's price, a CNET author previously reported that the YI Technology CEO told him that it would be priced at $299 USD. If this is true, it must be causing some concern over at GoPro . \nYI has apparently surpassed GoPro again. \nYI Technology is cutting a broad swath with lots of new products—a drone, MFT camera and lenses, a dash cam—built from the ground up quickly and at rock-bottom prices. The company is best known as a GoPro action cam competitor, with the two companies leap-frogging each other in a spec war. YI has apparently surpassed GoPro again in some important aspects, most notably a maximum UHD frame rate (60fps), twice that of the GoPro Hero5 Black.

Given the lack of actual footage and hands-on third party testing, it's not particularly surprising that speculation and rumors have started to fill the void. \nWe—and GoPro, no doubt—are waiting with some anticipation for this spec-heavy camera to hit the market on Tuesday. Our biggest questions relate to image quality for UHD 60p, with a somewhat thin100Mbs max data rate, encoded in H.264. Also, we are wondering about potential VR support. \nFor more, check out YI's extensive product spec page .
