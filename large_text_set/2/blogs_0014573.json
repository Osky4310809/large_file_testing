They won’t show the crowd.” \nAs it were, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News did pan around and show the crowd just as Trump accused them again of never doing any such thing. \nWatch above to see all three networks call Trump’s bluff and show the size of the crowd in attendance. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:25:08.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
