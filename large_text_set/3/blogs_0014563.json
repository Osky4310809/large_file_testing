(Oliver Contreras/The Washington Post) \nThe winter storm is in our wake, but its effects on the region will linger into Wednesday morning. Overnight temperatures are forecast to drop well below freezing, to near 20 degrees, so slushy untreated roads and sidewalks will freeze solid. And then there’s the risk of black ice where previously cleared wet areas freeze. \nAll of this means the likelihood of school delays and maybe some closings. Anne Arundel County schools have already decided to delay opening. Follow this link for any new closing and delay announcements through the evening:   . \nSchool systems most likely to delay are those in areas that got the most snow and sleet, farthest to the north and west. Some of these schools could close. Even areas south and east of Washington could delay as icy areas from earlier today could refreeze overnight. \nFedCast \nWe think the federal government will be open for business and, more likely than not, opening on time. But if there are a lot of slick and hazardous areas when roads are assessed early in the morning, there’s an outside chance of a short delay. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:05:16.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
