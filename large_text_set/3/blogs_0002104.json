Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com)   1:22pm Only human: Actress, model, and beauty brand ambassador Liza Soberano also struggles with self-esteem issues. Philstar.com/Efigenio Christopher Toledo IV \nMANILA, Philippines — As an endorser of a global beauty brand, Liza Soberano feels the weight of the word \"beauty\" in her shoulders. \n“Yes, it is (a pressure to look beautiful) because I’m seen on TV and people look up to me. People also kind of draw confidence from me because for example, I’m a brand endorser, so I’m supposed to empower women to feel confident and beautiful about themselves. But sometimes, when you don’t feel beautiful, how are you able to do that, ‘di ba?” she pointed out in a recent conference. \n“There are times when you just don’t feel like you look your best. You look in the mirror and see imperfections. I’m pretty sure everybody can relate to that, especially us, women, we’re full of insecurities all the time… I do feel when I go out, I ought to look my best. But sometimes, you just can’t pull it off because it depends on what you’re feeling.” \nWhat makes her feel insecure? “A lot of things. My weight sometimes. It’s true! Seriously! Because the camera tends to make you look bigger, so sometimes, I look bigger than other girls on TV. When I have my period, especially, when I see girls who are so pretty, I feel like I’m not as pretty as them. Other international artists, they look so beautiful and perfect. Then it makes me feel like, ‘Why am I not like them?’” \nShe confided to Philstar.com that she sees a lot of imperfections in her face and body. \n“I find my eyes imperfect. Lahat naman tayo hindi symmetrical. There are times na hindi pantay ‘yung talukap ko. Sometimes, when I gain weight, nag-blo-bloat ‘yung face ko. It’s so hard to cover that up, especially when you’re taping or shooting a movie, ‘yun agad ‘yung nakikita. I have really small eyes and also my arms problem ko rin.”   \nShe thinks that her line in her latest movie, “My Ex and Whys,” which asks if she is ugly, has contributed to the movie’s success. “Maybe that’s why they watched the movie but also because the fact that it’s a Cathy Molina film, I think that’s a reason for people to watch the film. And of course, there are a lot of LizQuen supporters that’s why we earned that much on the first day,” she explained. \nWhen she is down, what does she do? \n“I always keep in mind why I started out in the first place. I have my best friends, my father, my brother…Good thing, I have a good set of people to make me feel happy. Of course, your energy level also shows and registers in your face. With the help of makeup, as well, some powder, some cheek tint,” the Maybelline New York endorser elaborated on how she makes herself feel and look beautiful. \n“I try to work out regularly, at least three times a week. I have a trainer that supervises my work out. But most of the time, I do yoga just to burn some calories. I don’t like dieting like I’m starving myself to lose weight. I still eat. I try to choose healthy food, but sometimes, I do like to indulge, because I don’t want to deprive myself from things that make me happy!” \nShe also takes cue from the characters she has been portraying. \nHer advice for those also having self-esteem issues? \n“Just be who you are all throughout. Just because society and everybody else ask you to, don’t let anybody dictate who you should be and don’t let anything stop you. Just believe in yourself, have the confidence to make it happen. Just because it is your dream, that’s enough reason for you to keep pushing yourself to strive to achieve those goals.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T11:52:27.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
