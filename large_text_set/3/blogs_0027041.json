The 18-inch blade reportedly went through his chest and exited his back before pinging against the sidewalk.\nChief Aubry said Jackson entered the police substation in Times Square after recognizing himself in security footage broadcast on the news Tuesday evening, telling officers: \n\"I'm the person you're looking for.\"\nPolice arrested the racist on a charge of second-degree murder, but the chief says they want to upgrade the charge to a hate crime, given Jackson made no secret he came \"to target male blacks.\"\nRelated: Women Dropping Domestic Abuse Cases In Fear Of Getting Deported \nThe army vet found Caughman, a homeless bottle collector with a penchant for taking photos of himself and celebrities, on the streets in Midtown, Manhattan when he plunged the sword he bought online into the defenseless man.\nAfter the assailant fled the scene, a bloodied Caughman stumbled two blocks to the Midtown South Precinct stationhouse. Paramedics rushed him to a local hospital, but he could not be saved.\nIn custody, Jackson told police he was a member of a white supremacist group and admitted to harboring deep hatred towards black men for years. The attacker, who just served over three years as a military intelligence analyst, reportedly told police he wanted to stab a black man, then grab a cop's gun and \"shoot some people.\"\nNeedless to say, this senseless act of racially-charged violence sparked a firestorm of social media outrage.\nCelebrities like Mindy Kaling took to Twitter to seek justice for the victim.
