She writes about everything from crime to transit problems — and occasionally about good news. More by Emily Babay Arrow icon \nPowerball tickets sold in South Philadelphia and Burlington County were among several recent big lottery wins in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. \nThe two Powerball tickets matched all five white balls drawn in Saturday's game (3, 7, 9, 31, and 33) but missed the Powerball of 20, falling just short of the $361 million jackpot. \nThe Philadelphia ticket was sold at Lil News Shack, located at 1502 Packer Avenue, Pennsylvania Lottery officials said. \nThe store gets a $5,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. \nThe Burlington ticket was sold at Wrightstown Wine & Liquor at 403 E. Main St. in Wrightstown, New Jersey Lottery officials said. \nAnother Pennsylvania ticket, sold in Allegheny County, won $2 million in Saturday's Powerball game. That ticket also matched the five white balls but missed the Powerball, and was purchased with the power play option. \nTickets sold in Rhode Island and Texas also won $2 million each, while Louisiana, Maryland, New York and Texas also had $1 million winners. \nNo one hit the jackpot, so the top prize for Wednesday's drawing rises to $403 million for the annuity, or $243.9 million cash. \nIn a separate lottery game, a Delaware County ticket won big over the weekend. \nA ticket sold at a Havertown grocery store split the $225,000 jackpot in Friday's Pennsylvania Cash 5 drawing by matching all five numbers: 9, 14, 16, 17 and 35. \nThat ticket was sold at the Acme locatd at 1305 W. Chester Pike, lottery officials said. It split the prize with a Lycoming County ticket; each winner gets $112,500. \nThe retailers each get $500 bonuses.
