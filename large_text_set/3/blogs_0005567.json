Really hard. Really, really hard. In the last 100 Cup races, there have been just 18 different drivers who have won races. And only 12 of them won more than one race in that period. Here are all 12 drivers with multiple victories in the last 100 Cup points races. Shanna Lockwood Shanna Lockwood-USA TODAY Sports 12 Kurt Busch, 4 victories Busch has been a consistent performer since joining Stewart-Haas Racing in 2014, winning at least one race each season with the team. None was bigger, of course, than his recent Daytona 500 triumph. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 11 Jeff Gordon, 5 Now an analyst with FOX’s NASCAR team, Gordon ranks third all-time in Premier Series race victories with 93. 10 Denny Hamlin, 5 Like Kurt Busch, Hamlin’s biggest victory came in the Daytona 500. In Hamlin’s case, he won the Great American Race in 2016.

Amber Searls Amber Searls-USA TODAY Sports 7 Dale Earnhardt Jr., 6 What’s impressive about Earnhardt’s total is it likely would be even higher had he not missed the second half of 2016 with a concussion.

Nigel Kinrade/LAT Photo USA 5 Kyle Busch, 9 In 2015, Busch missed the first eight Cup races of the year with serious foot and leg injuries suffered in a NASCAR XFINITY SERIES crash at Daytona. And he came back and won the championship anyway. 4 Kevin Harvick, 10 From the moment of his first test with Stewart-Haas Racing in late 2013, Harvick has been bad fast. He has won a lot of races and piled up tons of points with SHR. He won the Cup championship in 2014 and finished second a year later. © Russell LaBounty/NKP Russell LaBounty 3 Brad Keselowski, 11 The 2012 champ caught a break in winning at Atlanta, but it was certainly no fluke: Keselowski has been a top performer in recent years. Shanna Lockwood Shanna Lockwood-USA TODAY Sports 2 Joey Logano, 12 In the last 100 Cup points races, Team Penske drivers Logano and Brad Keselowski are the only teammates to produce double-digit victory totals. , LAT Images www.latphoto.co.uk Nigel Kinrade 1 Jimmie Johnson, 14 No surprise, right? There are many reasons Johnson is a seven-time NASCAR champion. The fact that he wins a lot of races is one of the key reasons he keeps adding titles. © John Harrelson © 2016 John Harrelson", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T19:42:09.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
