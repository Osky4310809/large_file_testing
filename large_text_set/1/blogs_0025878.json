Their single “Bad and Boujee” has been on your timeline, in the earphones of millions, and on your television. The release of their album Culture last Friday has led their status to grow to even bigger heights.\nWith the group originating in Atlanta, fans wanting the Migos to perform at halftime of Super Bowl LI has grown immensely naturally. This, because the Falcons are playing for their first Super Bowl title in nearly two decades against the NFL’s superpower, the New England Patriots . Lady Gaga is set to perform then, but a petition is calling for that to change , and has gained over 50,000 signatures.\nQuavo, one of the Migos, was all for it, as he told XXL . “I didn’t even know it was real. And people really got signatures,” Quavo said of the petition. “Let’s do it. We ready to fuckin’ perform. \n“Atlanta Falcons, and we got the Atlanta trio,” he continued, “We going to get our first championship with the album, it only makes sense.”\nOffset, another member added even more reasoning. “You got the greatest team, and you got the greatest team. We got the greatest song in America, we got the greatest album in America.”\nThe petition’s description says that because “two of the TRILLEST” hip-hop communities will be under one roof in Houston (those being Atlanta and Houston), the halftime act needs to change. No offense to Lady Gaga, she’s an excellent artist, but this would represent Atlanta and Houston better.\nWhile it would be amazing to have the Migos perform at halftime, there are a ton of other suggestions in this petition that are phenomenal : Rae Sremmurd, Gucci Mane, Goodie Mob, Ludacris and Jeezy as the pre-show, with Young Thug singing “Guwop Home” as the official anthem of Atlanta.\nBut perhaps the most brilliant suggestion was that Andre 3000 sing the national anthem with Erykah Badu. Could you imagine how awesome Andre 3 Stacks shredding the anthem with Erykah Badu would be? Even if they are exes! \nOn top of Migos for halftime, the author suggests Future performing “ March Madness ”, along with Outkast doing an Aquemini sampler and wrapping things up with Bun B and Jay-Z doing “Big Pimpin.’”\nListen, if all of this musical goodness were to happen on one night, the Super Bowl might have to take a back seat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:03:50.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
