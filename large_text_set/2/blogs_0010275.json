They got a tour from Rome-based journalist and culinary guide Katie Parla . \nRome's stops included Gabriele Bonci's celebrated Bonci pizzeria, which itself generated a bit of coincidental buzz last week after Parla wrote on her blog that Bonci will open pizza al taglio outlets in the United States. \nChicago's West Loop will be the first location this summer, and, she wrote, Philadelphia and New York are also on the list. \n(Put down the knife and fork, though. Rick Tasman, president of Bonci's USA expansion, told me by phone that no Philly location had been selected. In fact, he said, Bonci and partners want to open in Chicago as a \"proof of concept\" before expanding.) \nParla says she \"peer-pressured\" the crew to visit Campania. \"A lot of Neapolitan pizza is pretty lame and it's overrated, which was the experience they had when they visited in the past,\" she said. \nShe took them to her favorite spot in Naples, 50 Kalò di Ciro Salvo , where they had five or six pizzas. \nClassica margherita!!! #masteringpizza @katieparla @davejoachim @edandcamera \nA photo posted by marcvetri (@marcvetri) on Feb 10, 2017 at 6:25am PST \nAfter taking in views of Vesuvius, they drove out to Caiazzo, where they feasted on more pizza at Franco Pepe's shrine to la pizza , Pepe in Grani. \nThe man himself.... @francopepeingrani no words can explain this place. It's not a pizzeria...it's a filosofia. An unforgettable evening that brought tears to our eyes. Grazie di cuore! @katieparla @davejoachim @edandcamera #masteringpizza \nA photo posted by marcvetri (@marcvetri) on Feb 10, 2017 at 12:33pm PST \nDay Three had them back in Rome for such treats as the cacio e pepe pizza at Sbanco . \nPizza cacio pepe!!! Insane! @callegari.ste @katieparla \nA photo posted by marcvetri (@marcvetri) on Feb 11, 2017 at 6:41am PST \nVetri and Joachim's manuscript, a follow-up to Mastering Pasta, is due this summer for a summer 2018 release with Ten Speed Press. \nVetri's Instagram showed a photo of Mastering Pasta on sale at a shop at the Rome airport.
