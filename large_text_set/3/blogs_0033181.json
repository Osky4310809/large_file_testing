Everybody, out of the blue, had a pair of sparkling white shoes in their closets. Every second picture we saw on Instagram, was of someone showing off their new whites. There are so many good things these white G ods brought to our lives -the nostalgia of our PT shoes back in school, the official acceptance of shoes with a dress, letting go of the fear of wearing the same shoe everyday (because everybody else did the same!), and the discovery of the one shoe that ACTUALLY goes with everything. But as 2017 buzzed in, the IT people in fashion went vocal on how white sneakers were no more a trend. And while we appreciate their opinions, the news disheartened us. If not white sneakers, what was it going to be? Shrugging it off, we still pull out our white sneakers everyday because, let’s be honest, unlike Rose from Titanic we are not letting go. Good news is that our favourite B-town celebsseem to resonate the sentiment. Here they are, rocking their whites and giving us all the more reason to do the same! 1. Deepika's favourite Nike's! \n2. Alia and her different versions. \n3. Neha and her experiments. \n4. Anushka and her Stans! \n5. Kangana's can't-live-without Vans! \n6. Kriti has them all. \n7. Kiara can't keep herself from the Gucci.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-01T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:47:22.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
