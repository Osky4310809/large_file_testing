Maryam Nawaz's reply was also submitted in court today.\nThe Supreme Court proposed calling members of the prime minister’s family to examine whether they would abide by the stance they had taken on four London flats in their previous statements, on Thursday.\nThe suggestion came when Bokhari sought the court’s permission to refer to a number of interviews given by the prime minister, his wife and children on different occasions to highlight that every member of the Sharif family had taken a divergent stand on the ownership of the properties in London’s Park Lane.\nHowever, Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed said that calling the members of the PM’s family would come into play if the court decided to record their evidence in the Panamagate case, which it was not doing now.\nThe hearing has been adjourned until Monday, Jan 9.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T10:01:24.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
