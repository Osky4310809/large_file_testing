I’ll be there until the end of July.” \nAs far as we can tell, there is no character named “Beckett” among the Star Wars canon, although there was a a male Corellian smuggler named Bek Nataal who appeared in a single short story in 1995. The character of Garris Shrike first appeared in the Star Wars Expanded Universe novel “The Paradise Snare,” the first part of the Han Solo Trilogy books. He fits the description of a criminal mentor to a young Han, though its possible that the filmmakers gave him a new name to distance him from Shrike, or came up with a totally new character that just happens to have some similarities to Shrike. Either way, we expect Beckett to play a big part in the story since Harrelson will be on set for the entire shoot. \nThe movie will explore the duo of Han Solo and Chewbacca’s adventures before the events of Star Wars: A New Hope , including their early encounters with that other card-playing rogue from a galaxy far, far away, Lando Calrissian. \nPhil Lord and Christopher Miller ( The LEGO Movie , 21 Jump Street ) are directing the movie, with a cast that includes Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo, Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian, Thandie Newton, Michael K. Williams and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, with Joonas Suotamo ( Star Wars: The Force Awakens , Star Wars: The Last Jedi ) as Chewbacca. \nWritten by Lawrence and Jon Kasdan, it will be produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Allison Shearmur, Simon Emanuel, and co-produced by Kiri Hart, Susan Towner, and Will Allegra. Lawrence Kasdan and Jason McGatlin will executive produce. \nThe untitled Han Solo Star Wars Story will debut in theaters on May 25, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:04:48.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
