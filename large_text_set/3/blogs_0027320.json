Steve Nicol wraps up all of Sunday's Premier League action, with United and Spurs getting much-needed wins and Liverpool and City battling to a breathless 1-1 draw. \nYears before he took a full-time position as a European scout for Liverpool, Igor Gluscevic was massively influential in the club signing Dirk Kuyt -- one of its most loyal and hard-working players, who made 285 appearances during his time at Anfield. \nAfter a lengthy career that featured spells at CF Extremadura, Sevilla and Sparta Prague, Gluscevic retired at the age of 34 and took up a scouting role at Liverpool in 2008, monitoring players from the Balkans area before his decision to leave and become a football agent in 2011. \nBut prior to becoming an employee of the Merseyside outfit, Gluscevic first alerted Rafael Benitez, then managing Valencia, to Kuyt's talent when he was first emerging in the Netherlands. The Dutchman eventually signed for Liverpool in the summer of 2006 after Gluscevic's influence in the transfer. \nESPN FC caught up the former Montenegrin striker to reflect on his time working as a scout for Liverpool during a testing period. \nESPN FC: Even before you were working as a scout for Liverpool, you recommended a certain striker to Benitez. How did that happen? \nGluscevic: I was top scorer of Extremadura and my coach was Rafael Benitez, so I knew him from that time there. Dirk Kuyt, who played with me in Holland, was a young player and I called Benitez when he was in Valencia and told him to sign him. He wasn't able to do it because he was too young, while Valencia were winning championships and UEFA Cups. Valencia were too strong a team and the player was just 20. \nKuyt went from Utrecht, where we played together and scored 100 goals in three years, to Feyenoord, where they paid a small amount for him. After two years, Benitez moved to Liverpool and he called me back to ask me what I thought about Dirk Kuyt. That's how it started and I helped in communicating with the player and these things. When I was finishing my career, this was the connection to how I entered the club. I was important for Liverpool even before I started as a scout! \nESPN FC: What was your role at Liverpool like? Explain the day-to-day role. \nGluscevic: We covered different areas. Generally, players from the Balkans were very important in the past for European clubs and today I think there are like 150 players in top clubs from Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia and Bosnia. This was my role because there's so much talent from this region. I was concentrating on tracking certain players. \nWe had a lot of work. When there's a talent you have to cover him as soon as possible and report the certain qualities because many clubs are very present and if you're a bit too late then it's a pity. Day-to-day work was making analysis, watching games, watching different markets. Before the year we had certain positions that we were going to follow. \nESPN FC: There's much more to scouting than just watching the game and reporting back to the chief scout or manager, isn't there? \nGluscevic: I had a nice career -- I played in Spain, Holland and the Champions League with Sparta Prague -- and this [footballing] world was not new for me, I had 15 years, but scouting gave me the opportunity to learn to judge a player and what to concentrate on. Sometimes you had to make analysis of the player, but when such a player is from your region or when you know the family or friends then you are trying to make some, let's say, positive messages in order [for the player] to be closer to Liverpool and not some other side. Igor Gluscevic, not pictured, played a big role in bringing Dirk Kuyt, right, to Liverpool under Rafa Benitez. \nIt is definitely wide work, starting with the judging of quality. Like in the case of Dirk Kuyt, I was playing in China at time and I was communicating between the player and others in order [for Liverpool] not to pay more. \nESPN FC: Can you recall a number of players you looked at closely during your time at Liverpool? \nGluscevic: Stevan Jovetic was an interesting player for us in that moment, as well as Mirko Vucinic, who was later a player for Juventus. Those were young players coming from this region and were checking the possibility and the qualities, of course. You are proud when they make a good career later and reach a high level. But there are also a lot of players who left and we were too late. \nBenitez called me one time, it was about a certain player he wanted some information on. He called me and said: \"Igor, I don't understand the look of the player when he missed a chance. Is he angry? Is he disappointed? Does it matter for him?\" He was going into this detail and I was laughing and said: \"Rafa, come on. You are going into so much detail.\" \nIt was not easy to work with him, he was asking, asking and asking for many different types of information. But at the end of the day, I preferred this a lot and these details are very important in certain players when you have to spend millions. \nESPN FC: During your time at Liverpool, the club's ownership situation meant that Benitez's transfer budget was severely limited. In addition to that, Manchester United and Chelsea were able to spend rather freely. How difficult did that make your job? \nGluscevic: It was very complicated. We were always working below others. You couldn't come into a situation and say: \"OK, we are interested\" because the people would then make a much higher price because it's Liverpool. There was no money. Everybody thinks you are rich, but you aren't rich. \nToday it's not easy to find a player that's good and cheap. It was very hard because we are talking about Liverpool. There is talent, but talent that is not ready to play for Liverpool. A player should play at some other club with a good level and be the best in that league. You cannot bring in a player who is not making a difference in his own league or own club. \nESPN FC: Benitez obviously departed Anfield in 2010 and you left shortly after. Can you explain the reasons for you leaving the club? \nGluscevic: I kept on going but the feeling was different. I was there because I had pleasure, but Benitez left and Roy Hodgson came in as manager. And what is normal, Hodgson had very good contact with scouts but we were not his people. The communication was as fluid as it was with Benitez and I decided to make the next step. \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
