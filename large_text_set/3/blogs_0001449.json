You waited in line for 10 minutes to get a skim latte which made you late to work, but as you're walking into your building, you drop it, making the whole morning a waste. Apply the same feeling to the automotive realm and you're looking at a flat tire on a wheel that you can't seem to get off the car. It's stuck, and even tapping firmly around the edges isn't getting it loose (yes, the lug nuts are off ... right?). \nSometimes, even with all of the lug nuts removed, the wheel isn't ready to come off. There are a number of things that can cause this, none of them is very serious. Usually, it's just a matter of a build up of corrosion from the wheel being in place for some period of time. This corrosion between the wheel and the mounting surface of the hub can get pretty sticky, it's like a layer of glue that can really stick the wheel to the hub. To prevent this later, you can keep the inside of your wheels clean and painted, as well as the hub surface, or apply a thin layer of thick great before you remount your wheels. \ncontinue reading below our video How to Change a Tire Of course, first things first, you need to get your stuck wheels off! \nThere's a trick to freeing a stuck-on wheel that almost never fails. You already have the lugs removed, but now reinstall them leaving about 5 turns before they start to get snug. Now lower the car to the ground, get in and start it up. Drive back and forth 4 or 5 feet a few times. It's important to do this on a level surface in a safe area with zero traffic. It's also important to only drive a few feet back and forth. Never take a vehicle on the road with loose lug nuts, never! Once you've carefully driven back and forth a couple of times, your wheel should be much looser. Now jack the car up and test the wheel. It should be nice and loose now, ready for you to replace with your spare so you can move on down the road. \nSafety Tip: Don't try to loosen tight lug nuts when your car is jacked up with the factory tool kit jack, or even a small hydraulic auto parts store jack . A really tight lug nut can require a huge amount of force to remove, and once you get enough leverage to break the nut, you might accidentally knock the vehicle off the jack. Not only can you do some real damage to your car or truck, you could injure yourself badly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T14:56:00.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
