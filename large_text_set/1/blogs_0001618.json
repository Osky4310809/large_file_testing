Especially with the growing use of large screen smartphones and its included support with Android Nougat . However, a developer called Keep Away From Fire has come up with a nifty app called Screens that makes the process of launching two apps in split-screen mode much easier.\nSee also: Best productivity apps for Android May 11, 2016 \n\nScreens allows you to pick two apps on your phone or tablet that you want to combine together in split-screen mode. The app then creates a shortcut that can be tapped so that both apps are automatically set up for split-screen action.\nSo if you, for example, wanted to combine Slack with Microsoft Word for Android at once to get some document collaboration done with co-workers, Screens would allow that to happen.\nWhile Screens is freely available to download on the Google Play Store, the developer has also released the source code for the app on GitHub as well for app creators to work with. If you have already downloaded Screens, do you think it could be useful, or is this something that is not needed yet for Android apps? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.\nGet it at Google Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:23:49.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
