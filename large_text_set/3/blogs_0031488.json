Public transport will be free from 10am to help people get home. \nBusinesses have been asked to close by midday. \nA severe weather warning has been cancelled for central Queensland but flood warnings are still current. The warning now extends from just south of Rockhampton to the New South Wales border. \nAbout 150mm to 250mm of rain is expected. Parts of the Gold Coast hinterland have already received 250mm, a spokesman for the Bureau of Meteorology has said.
