There have been no discussions about who Caitlyn will or won't dance with, or if she will dance at all. I can't deal in hypotheticals and have no idea what any Trump aids hope happens. Of course, real question is if they danced, who would lead?\"\nHa! We have a feeling Tiny Hands couldn't keep up with the former athlete!\nRelated: Trump's 'A-List' Artists Defend Inauguration Performances! \nJenner's team went on to reveal the reality star wasn't invited by Trump, but will be a guest of the American Unity Fund — a nonprofit dedicated to advancing the fight for freedom and equality for LGBT Americans.\nA source close to Jenner said she sees the inauguration as \"an opportunity to represent and defend the LGBTQ community within the party,\" adding:\n\"Caitlyn sees this as a chance to bring attention to LGBTQ causes and she is committed to protecting human rights no matter the political party in power. She has no problem speaking out if Republicans fail to protect equal rights.\"\nWell, a misguided trans rights warrior is better than no trans rights warrior at all, right???\n[ Image via FayesVision/Dennis Van Tine/Future Image/ WENN . ] \nTags: caitlyn jenner , dance , donald trump , hillary clinton , kanye west , lgbt , politik , reality tv , transgender", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:02:59.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
