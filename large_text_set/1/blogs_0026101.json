Eddie Johnson appeared to fall ill at an event in Englewood on Friday, but police officials said he was talking and alert a short time later, and able to take himself to a hospital. \nJohnson was part of a news conference discussing new police technology at the Englewood District police station when he appeared to sway and stagger, seeming dazed, as Mayor Rahm Emanuel was speaking at the podium. \nEmanuel asked Johnson if he was okay, and helped him to a seat, and officials called for an ambulance. Police ordered media to leave the room immediately.
