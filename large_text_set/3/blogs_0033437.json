Your prankster friend might be planning to trick you and like always you will fall into his trap. Unless of course, you are the prankster! In which case, beware, world! Of course, you never know when friends and kin can and will strike and this day is one where everything is allowed – to surprise and generate a few laughs. That friend of yours, with huge spectacles who never looked out of his book, will also try fooling you with his intellectual jokes. Such is the charm of this day. Knowingly/ unknowingly we all celebrate this day every year and play our pranks on the gullible. But, what is April Fool all about? What it’s origin, history, and significance? \nWhy April Fool is celebrated is still a mystery though there are many theories around it. Some believe the origin of April Fool marks its association in Chaucher’s Canterbury Tales (1392), the Nun’s Priest’s Tale, where a rooster, Chauntecleer is tricked by a fox on April 1st. \nWhereas, others believe that April Fool’s Day was celebrated in the backdrop of changing seasons during springtime. It is also associated with the celebration of a Roman festival of Hilaria. Hilaria was known as Roman Laughing Day. Hilaria was a name given to any day or season of rejoicing. (Image: Pinterest) \nIt is believed that in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII presented a new calendar, named as Gregorian calendar, to move the new year from 1st April to 1st January, which marked the beginning of the new year. So, the tradition began when people continued to celebrate New year on April 1st because they hadn’t heard about the calendar change. These people were laughed at by those who knew about the calendar change. Sounds interesting? \nIn Dutch, the origin of the April Fool attributes to the victory of Dutch at Brielle in 1572. There is a metaphor used to explain this victory as “On the first of April, Alva lost his glasses.” \nAlthough it’s quite difficult to figure out the exact reason behind celebrating this day but to know that how people in the history associated happiness with this day is just awesome and intriguing. We don’t need a reason to crack harmless jokes and laugh aloud at it. Do we? So, how are you planning to celebrate your day tomorrow?
