Mike Flynn had the president’s full confidence just hours before he was forced to resign. (Photo: Fox News screen grab) \nThe counselor to the president explained her sudden absence from TV screens during an interview with Sean Hannity at CPAC Wednesday night. \n“I don’t think I have to explain myself. If I’m not going on TV, if I’m out with four kids for three days looking at houses and schools,” Conway said. “A lot of my colleagues aren’t trying to figure out how to be a mother of four kids, I assure you.” \n“I’m not sidelined. Somebody’s trying to stir up trouble.” (RELATED: Kellyanne Conway: Mike Flynn Enjoys ‘The Full Confidence Of The President’) \n“About five percent of what I’m asked to do in this role as special adviser to the president is TV. We don’t always need to be out there all the time. He’s confident because he is his own best messenger.” \nWATCH: \nConway said, when it comes to the media, there is “presumptive negativity” towards the Trump administration. \n“My grievance is full coverage,” Conway said. “We want the complete story told. President Trump has actioned 23, maybe 24 executive actions, but basically one of them has gotten all of the attention.” \n“There are such great stories to tell, facts and figures, that we just want to make sure are reaching people. It’s why so many people don’t like the president using Twitter, well too bad. He’s cutting out the middle man.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:33:24.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
