It's not yet over for Toure, we've got to get him back,\" Wilmots said. \n\"The Yaya Toure case will be one of my first missions. \n\"I've seen the last two games that he played for Manchester City in a defensive midfield position. He's always great, he's so good physically. \n\"I'll go see him, I'll talk with him.\" \nWilmots took a 'golden generation' of Belgium players to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016, where they were beaten by Wales, and the 48-year-old believes he has another stellar collection of talent available to him in his new job. \nArsenal's top teenage sensations \n\"I do not know much about the country, but I have a lot of information about the national team, and I was very interested in the national team,\" he said. \n\"They have a very good generation of players.
