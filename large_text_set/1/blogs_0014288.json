Newcastle splashed the cash to land Ritchie (Photo: Getty Images) New boy Gayle has had a fine season (Photo: The Chronicle) \nBenitez had a £30million transfer surplus after selling Moussa Sissoko to Spurs and Georginio Wijnaldum, but Ashley wants to return to the policy of buying young players with promise. \nHe has left managing director Lee Charnley in no doubt as to his wishes and former recruitment guru Graham Carr is set for a direct role in all future purchases. \nBenitez himself wanted just one new face during this window – he was looking for cover for Christian Atsu, who has departed on Africa Cup of Nations duty. \n“It’s not an easy window,” said Benitez.

We tried and clubs were telling us, ‘No, he’s not for sale,’ or ‘he’s £20m’.” \nIt now appears that Ashley is unhappy with the current way that the club’s recruitment is working. \nHe followed up his meeting at Birmingham with further instructions during midweek and is determined that his wishes are followed. poll loading Will Newcastle win the Championship? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:45:48.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
