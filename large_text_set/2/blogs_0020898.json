They are racist. They are sexist,” he said. “They hate the Constitution. They hate free markets. They hate pluralism. They hate everything and despite everything we believe in.”\nSchneider said that conservatives value individual rights, while the alt-right are “fascists” who “want big government control to impose their will on you.” He argued that “fascism is actually more akin to socialism” and said the alt-right is “not like anybody here.”\n“This specific group that has hijacked a once-decent term, they are not us,” he said. “The alt right ain’t right at all.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:54:21.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
