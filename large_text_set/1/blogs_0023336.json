But now we have a new sliver of information to salivate over until then. Today Star Wars Episode VIII was officially revealed as Star Wars: The Last Jedi .\nWritten and directed by Rian Johnson, The Last Jedi follows the end of The Force Awakens with Rey finally meeting Luke Skywalker. Some were speculating the fatalistic subtitle and red font spelled doom for the old master, leaving Rey the final benevolent Force user. It seems more likely than not this will be the dark Empire Strikes Back to Force Awakens’ updated take on A New Hope . However, Jedi is both a singular and plural term. So who knows what’s going to happen? Who knows what Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro and that hairy tuxedo alien are up to.\nNot that this will have any bearing on the movie’s quality, but something about “The Last Jedi” sounds kind of obvious/fan-fiction to me. Like “ The Force Awakens ,” it just seems like the movie is going out of its way to remind you of a famous Star Wars thing. Are the giant words “STAR WARS” not enough? Plus, the name is eerily similar to Transformers: The Last Knight , a movie coming out this year that will make as much money while being a lot worse.\nBut these are arguments for another time. Star Wars: The Last Jedi hits theaters December 15, 2017. It probably won’t be based on this book.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:38:52.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
