COME TO MAMA, YOU KINGLY WARRIOR. \nThe latest Game of Thrones teaser trailer doesn’t give away too much, though; it won’t premiere until July and it’s still a little too early to reveal much. Set to a version of the 1990 single “ Sit Down ” by the band James (so British), it’s our three warring factions headed to their respective chambers of rule: Cersei in the Iron Throne, Daenerys at Dragonstone, Jon Snow being the KING IN THE NORTH at Winterfell, pensive and troubled as ever.
