But this stuff is all planned.” \nAgain, a reckless politician chooses the fraught, popular perception of anarchists, conflating political anarchism with activists and others who employ the tactics of black bloc — dressing indistinctly and in all-black clothing to assumedly make individual identification difficult for authorities — usually in order to perform a purposeful criminal act like property damage. \nWith the premise for a rights-crushing law resting on wildly biased mischaracterizations — a tactic of broad-stroke language — politicians plainly seek to ensnare everyone not intimidated by the bill’s chilling language on planning. \n“Wouldn’t you rather stop a riot before it starts?” Kavanagh asked during a debate over Arizona Senate Bill 1142. “Do you really want to wait until people are injuring each other, throwing Molotov cocktails, picking up barricades and smashing them through businesses in downtown Phoenix?” \nBy appealing to the base emotions of fear and anger, these politicians have crafted a legal cage for the First Amendment — by further curtailing rights under the guise such acts of destruction weren’t already illegal. \nAnd that’s the catch — because myriad destructive acts are considered rioting under current law — politicians expanded the definition of rioting to include “actions that result in damage to the property of others,” the Capitol Times reports. \nKavanagh and other supporters of the bill believe — or at least publicly pontificate — on the imperative to protect property from even the possibility of harm, over the constitutionally-protected right to exercise free speech. They insist the law would help thwart malicious plans by a few truly rotten seeds, but the actuality is murkily-defined guidelines which can be easily exploited by authorities to further curb growing dissent . \n“I have been heartsick with what’s been going on in our country, what young people are being encouraged to do,” Republican Senator Sylvia Allen explained, adding that, although current laws do theoretically cover criminal damaging and the like, they’re impotent in practice. \n“If they get thrown in jail, somebody pays to get them out. There has to be something to deter them from that.” \nSenator Steve Farley disagrees with the Republican solution to deterrence, and admonished colleagues the law could equally target right-leaning protests. For example, Farley explained, a Tea Party protest against property tax, for which organizers obtained appropriate permits and planned accordingly has as much potential to go south as any other given demonstration. \n“And one person, possibly from the other side, starts breaking the windows of a car,” Farley said, reiterating not every participant in a planned protest actually supports the cause. \n“And all of a sudden the organizers of that march, the local Tea Party, are going to be under indictment from the county attorney in the county that raised those property taxes. That will have a chilling effect on anybody, right or left, who wants to protest something the government has done.” \nBecause the proposed legislation misunderstands the dynamics of disturbances, Senator Andrea Dalessandro explained, politicians backing it appear to be motivated by something other than fears related to the general act of protesting. \n“I’m fearful that ‘riot’ is in the eyes of the beholder and that this bill will apply more strictly to minorities and people trying to have their voice heard,” Dalessandro cautioned. \nSenators expectedly voted along party lines on whether constitutionally-protected demonstrators should be considered on par with mafiosos, with the resultant 17 to 13 count sending the legislation to the House — and one step closer to becoming law. Share uglyamerican \nFTP could lose me and other people on this one. Our present crop of protesters is far more violent and prone to riot and destroy property than the people who used to just march down the street chanting slogans, When they destroy property like that and cause all kinds of disruptions and problems the cost for all that is passed on to the rest of the people through insurance premiums and government rebuilding programs. Tearing down the town because they are angry about something does not come cheap for rebuilding and they should have to pay for it! Hell yes, the state should seize their assets and throw their childish asses in jail! And that is what this law you are calling “Draconian” is all about.“You break it you buy it” is a good policy anywhere because peoples livelihoods often depend on the things they think they should be able to tear up because they disagree with Trump or the police or anyone else. I don’t care what you are protesting. If people burn or loot my store and I am going to want somebody to pay for it, preferably the people who did it. Many of us old-timers used to call that “personal responsibility” and it should damn sure come back into style. IceTrey \nWhat about rioters after their team wins the big game? It’s not a protest so the law doesn’t apply? Tmoney \nRed Summer, Matewan, Draft Riot during the civil war, Kent State ect. How many protesters or rioters have been killed or killed anyone in the last two years or more? Your comment seem like Alternative facts or feelings that things are much worse, when they aren’t. If you want to talk about taking responsibility, what about a political, economic, and judicial system that screws over millions of Americans? Are they not culpable as well? JoeMurica \nLet me tell you something buster, as a veteran Marine who served this country and to defend the rights and freedoms of constitution. I for one will not stand by and allow this to go on with out organizing my own protest against such an assinide law!! Unless I misread something that you wrote, you sir are not just an ugly american but un-American and you sir should be picked up and shipped out of this country and dropped off somewhere more suitable for you such as North Korea, Iran, or Saudi Arabia where you don’t worry about people exercising the freedom of speech. There are already laws on the books to go after and punish those individuals involved in violence, property destruction etc. And if you want to increase the penalties for those individuals fine, but how dare you support a bill that would make it illegal for those who wish to plan to and peacefully go out to exercise one’s first amendment rights. If someone wishes to organize a peaceful protest for whatever reason whether its about police brutality or to support anti abortion policies, gun rights or just protesting political corruption, No one should nor are they able to be responsible for the actions of an agent provacator or some dumbass anarchist who engages in violence or destruction. This law will be shot down in a heartbeat by the courts. Which makes it very tempting for someone like me to plan and organize a peaceful protest on the steps of the Statehouse there in Phoenix against this very piece of legislation should it become law. It would be the easiest way to get rich after suing the state for a clear violation of the 1st amendment. aliswell \nIt specifically targets violent “protestors” (rioters), not peaceful protestors. However, I still think they need to go back to the drawing board on this one. agrosuramerica \nThis is MISINFORMATION! It is for individuals that are RIOTERS!!, NOT peaceful protesters. ..AZ Senate Passes Bill To End Paid Defiance, Allowing Police To Now Seize Assets Of Rioting Liberals ……….. https://conservativedailypost.com/az-senate-passes-bill-end-paid-defiance-allowing-police-now-seize-assets-rioting-liberals/ Social", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:14:04.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
