Patriots fans, look away at all costs.\nNew England quarterback Tom Brady appears to be celebrating his insane Super Bowl comeback and enjoying the NFL offseason by recklessly cascading down ski slopes and horrifying Patriots fans everywhere. If indeed it's him â€” but why would he post it if it wasn't?\nSEE ALSO: Players and coaches react to Candice Wiggins' controversial claims about the WNBA\nBrady's latest Instagram ostensibly shows the 39-year-old absolutely eating it on a big jump, then Quote: s a skiing scene from \"South Park.\" For Patriots fans who want their aging, four-time MVP quarterback to play for a few more years, this video is terrifying.\nThe wipeout looks pretty bad, but considering he posted it on Instagram , Brady likely came out unscathed.\nIf you french fry when you're supposed to pizza, you're gonna have a bad time! Trust me!!!\nA post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady) on Feb 23, 2017 at 6:45am PST\nBrady is a freak athlete, a robot designed for immortality and eternal Super Bowl domination.\nIt's surprising Brady would risk injury on the slopes, considering his obsession prolonging his 17-year career. As detailed by a Sports Illustrated piece last week, he maintains an absurdly strict diet and workout regimen, one refined for years to keep this touchdown machine on the football field.\nWithout Tom Brady, the Patriots don't win Super Bowl LI . New England fans would probably rather have him in one piece if the team hopes to repeat next year.\nBONUS: BMW and LEGO collaborated to create the concept hoverbike of our dreams", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ26HsGB635/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Js5MUMgV.m3u8", "http://mmqb.si.com/mmqb/2017/02/15/tom-brady-montana-part-2-nfl-patriots-peter-king", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Js5MUMgV.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-24T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:30:10.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
