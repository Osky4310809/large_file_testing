Marvel Well, comic co-creator Brian K. Vaughn will be a consultant on the show and is pretty excited about the cast, explaining :\nI’m so excited for fans of the comic to watch this perfect cast of amazing actors, all of whom embody the spirit of their characters more than I ever could have imagined. The Executive Producers are Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, who helmed many of our favorite teen shows ever including The OC and Gossip Girl . So we can assume much of that experience with drama and angst will carry-over into Runaways and we couldn’t be happier.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:22:32.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
