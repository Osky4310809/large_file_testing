Having recently attended the international media ride for the Street Triple 765 RS in Catalunya, Spain, pricing for Triumph’s three-quarter litre naked sportsbike – which comes with Showa BPF front fork and Ohlins rear suspension – is RM66,900 . \nSitting a little down the Street Triple Range is the 765 R LRH which comes at a retail price of RM58,900 . LRH stands for low ride height and the 765 R LRH does away with the premium suspension and two themes of the RS’ multi-function LCD, but comes designed for riders short in the inseam department. \nIn the pipeline is the entry-level to Triumph’s Street Triple range, the 765 S, which is expected to be priced below the RM50,000 mark. If this indeed happens, then the Yamaha MT-09 will see some stiff competition this year, as will the Ducati Monster 821 and the MV Agusta Brutale, which go up against the 765 R and 765 RS, respectively. \nOn the Modern Classics side of things, the 1,200 cc Triumph Bonneville Bobber can be had at a price of RM74,900 for monochrome paintwork and RM75,900 for the two-tone colours. The Bonneville Bobber is an extension of the T120 range of retro-styled machines, and gives the rider a custom motorcycle out-of-the-box. \nFurther down the range are the Bonneville T100 and T100 Dark , which retail at RM63,900 for the Jet Black colour scheme to RM65,900 for the dual colour schemes. Mimicking the look of the 1950s Triumph Tiger and Thunderbird, these classic-looking machines come with all mod cons, including ABS and traction control. \nAlso in the list of 2017 Triumph models to be released in Malaysia is the Street Cup , a 900 cc cafe racer, at RM65,900 . Bookings are now being taken for Triumph Malaysia’s new 2017 models at its Petaling Jaya flagship store, branch in Johor Bharu, Johor, or its dealer branches in Georgetown and Bukit Mertajam in Penang, as well as Kuching, Sarawak and Kota Kinabalu, Sabah.
