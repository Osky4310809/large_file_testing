The song was released fresh off the back of the 2017 Grammys, where Bey absolutely slayed a live performance of “Love Drought” and “Sandcastles”, alongside picking up several awards including Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade . DJ Khaled’s Major Key lost out to Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book for Best Rap Album, but Khaled ensured he stayed winning by featuring music’s biggest power couple on a track “He’s been waiting his whole life” to make.\nDJ KHALED \"SHINING\" FT @Beyonce & @S_C_ #GRATEFUL pic.twitter.com/u5x4AlAv1J \n— DJ KHALED (@djkhaled) February 13, 2017 \n\nThe artwork for the single features DJ Khaled’s recently born son, Asahd Tuck Khaled. Jay Z notably references 21 Savage, “21 Grammys I’m a savage n*gga”, and unleashed some bars which have been argued as being indirect Drake disses ““I know y’all ain’t out here talking numbers, right? I know y’all ain’t out here talking summers, right?

You can watch Beyonce and all the best of the action from the 2017 Grammys here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:20:43.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
