But now the swath of Los Angeles that spans from Western Avenue on the east to parts of North Fairfax on the west, is experiencing a new culinary revival. The neighborhood's oldest, most institutional hangouts, are cherished with a new appreciation for nostalgia, while brand new spots emulate the old with fresher, more innovative flavors. All the while, L.A.'s most celebrated chefs continue to keep the bar high with some of the nation's best restaurants right here in Hollywood. \nHere are some of our favorites: \nProvidence The only thing fussed over more than the guests at Providence is the fish. Chef Michael Cimarusti’s obsession with sourcing the highest quality, most sustainable seafood is obvious in every bite. He cherishes each piece, using gentle cooking techniques that coax the flesh, leaving melt-in-your mouth texture along with revelatory flavor combinations. Co-owner Donato Poto glides through the dining room overseeing the attentive service team. When the time comes, he gracefully prepares tableside Santa Barbara prawns. After many courses of Cimarusti’s creations, a serious-faced fromagier pushes a large, glass enclosed cheese cart in front of you. Desserts are whimsical and live up to everything that came before them. 5955 Melrose Ave., Hollywood. (323) 460-4170, providencela.com. Burnt cucumber pickles with summer squash, hearts of palm, blossoms and buttermilk at Gwen. Heather Platt \nGwen Brothers Luke and Curtis Stone’s glimmering luxury meat haven on Sunset Boulevard proves once again that Chef Stone does not rest on the laurel’s of his celeb status. The in-house butcher shop coexists with a lavish dining room where guests can see meat carcasses hanging in clear view. The slightly more appealing spectacle at Gwen is Chef Stone himself. The tall Aussie can be seen preparing the five course tasting menus in an open kitchen, often sporting barbecue goggles on his head. Several menu items are cooked over an open flame, giving the room a wonderfully smokey smell that adds extra anticipation to the restaurant's main draw: meat. 6600 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 946-7512, gwenla.com . Martini at Musso and Frank Heather Platt \nMusso and Frank While many newer establishments attempt to emulate vintage Hollywood glamour, Musso and Frank actually embodies it. After opening on Hollywood Boulevard in 1919, the wood-paneled and leather booth-lined restaurant has been feeding movie stars, locals and tourists for almost a century. Fortunately not much has changed since then. And though actually ordering throw-back menu items like grilled lamb kidneys with bacon, calf’s liver steak or a smoked tongue sandwich would be only for the the novelty of it, other classics like gooey Welsh rarebit, lobster thermidor, and a variety of steaks and chops are safe bets. And nothing beats drinking a well-stirred martini while nestled in a cozy booth where Humphrey Bogart likely once sat. 6667 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 467-7788, mussoandfrank.com.

Rosas, who has worked previously at Thomas Keller’s Bouchon and Marcel Vigneron’s Wolf, recently took over for chef Tim Carey who is now at Lost at Sea in Pasadena. The menu format at Papilles matches the bistro’s interior: small and simple, yet thoughtful and refined. The regularly changing, seasonal three-course prix fixe offers first course starters like carrot ginger velouté, romanesco salad and heartier mains like braised beef cheeks or a pork loin with sweet potatoes. At $38 per person, it is a steal. And just when the little unlikely bistro couldn’t seem any more charming, Santos Uy’s selection of natural old-world wines validates the meaning of the restaurant’s French name: tastebuds. 6221 Franklin Ave., Hollywood; (323) 871-2026, papillesla.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:45:30.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
