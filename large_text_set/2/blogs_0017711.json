Masked men threw rocks at police, set cars on fire and robbed businesses. \nPolice responded with gun fire to quell the unidentified rioters. \n“Police fired at the rock throwers, but missed,” police spokesman Tony Lagerkrantz told public broadcaster SVT . \nOne business owner was assaulted while trying to keep rioters out of his store. A total of three people were injured in the riots but no arrests were made, according to police . \n“They were punched at and kicked at and had to seek medical attention,” said SVT News reporter Valentina Xhaferi. \nThe situation calmed down around midnight. Rinkeby is located in one of the poorest areas of the Swedish capital. “It sucks, it’s like living in a ghetto. I’m ashamed,” Rinkeby resident Alejandro told SVT. \nThe riots follow a heated debate surrounding immigration in Sweden sparked by Trump’s remarks Saturday at a rally in Melbourne, Fla. \n“You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” Trump said. \nThe Swedish embassy in Washington, D.C., requested an expiation from the White House over what Trump was referring to. \nTrump later explained his remarks were in reference to a segment Friday on Fox News show “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” \nCarlson interviewed filmmaker Ami Horwitz about his documentary on how Sweden’s generous refugee stance has affected the country. Horowitz claimed a surge in crime has occurred in recent years, which Swedish authorities say is an exaggerated portrayal.
