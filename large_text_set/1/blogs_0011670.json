Whether it's a pair of kicks, a perfume, a gadget, or even a food item--each of our selections will be closely scrutinised and then brought to you, without any (paid-for) filter. We'll write about what we believe in and what YOU will actually benefit from. What is it? \nTom Ford Noir De Noir EDP How much is it? \nRs. 18,950 for 50 ml Who is it meant for? \nThe confident man who’s particular about his signature style. More about it... \nTrust me (as the self-proclaimed spokesperson for womankind) when I say that there’s nothing more appealing than a man who smells like a million bucks (barring one who’s well-read, that is!). Which is why it’s not only crucial, but undeniably relevant that you not substitute your perfume with some cheap shit. That, my man, will hold you at no good stead. \nWhile I do not believe that unabashed vanity is the answer, I wholeheartedly vouch that a man who knows where to spend his money (smartly) is one for the keeps. Including the shoes and perfumes he decides to own. \nThe Tom Ford Noir De Noir is one of those indomitable finds that oozes confidence, above everything else. The lovely trail it leaves behind is reminiscent of a groomed gentleman, with an almost tactile richness. The patchouli, oud, saffron, truffle and moss are blended in a haze, though the red rose note shines, with a base sweetness that’s imparted by the vanilla. \nNoir De Noir is not meant for any average Joe. It needs to be carried off with elan and only if you’re confident in your skin. \nI’d totally recommend this buy for date night, or if you have something special coming your way (an award of achievement maybe!). Special things always deserve special occasions, right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T08:38:38.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
