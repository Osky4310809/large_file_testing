Among the speakers was Philadelphia Fire Department Deputy Commissioner Gary Loesch. \n“I reiterated a little bit about how I have to deal with the families after a tragedy within hours, and that was my main point is that we can never forget the families,” Loesch said. “A memorial like this keeps them in our minds and shows them that they are not alone and we are always thinking about them.” \nAfter the mass, a procession passed a couple of fire trucks making its way to four plaques imbedded in the sidewalk outside the church honoring four firefighters who died in 1899. \n“This is the 10th year for this memorial,” Loesch said. “It honors the four firefighters that perished during an 1899 fire here, but it also honors all the firefighters and first responders who put their life on the line every day.” \nMayor Jim Kenny was among those who placed flowers with black ribbons on the markers.
