Picture: Robert Pozo \nMs Hanney said the P & C was aware providing airconditioning would be expensive but was determined to raise the money. \n“The problem we have is not just providing airconditioning. The school’s whole electrical system would need replacing to accommodate airconditioners,” she said. \n“We’ve got several of our regular fundraising activities planned and we’re looking at applying for a few grants.” \nCampbelltown state Labor MP Greg Warren said many Campbelltown schools went without airconditioning each day. \n“The problem is the electrical systems, the cabling, grid and switchboards, at many of these schools aren’t able to handle putting airconditioning in,” he said. \n“It would be costly but I think it needs to happen. \n“The government boasts about a $4 billion surplus but that’s a great thing when you’ve got kids sweltering away in classrooms while we’re expecting them to learn.” \nDocuments obtained under freedom of information by Mr Warren’s office showed that across the Macarthur region there is a backlog of maintenance work of more than $31 million, with $10 million in the Campbelltown electorate. \nAccording to 2016-17 information obtained by Mr Warren’s office, the maintenance backlog in Campbelltown would is over $9 million with just $822,000 funding planned for the electorate. \n“One of the most important things we need to do is have our infrastructure in place at our schools,” Mr Warren said. \nAccording to the figures obtained by Mr Warren there is about a $14 million backlog in Macquarie Fields with $1 million pledged for 2016-17. \nIn Camden, a $6.5 million backlog had almost $700,000 in funding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:20:29.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
