Former Secretary of State John Kerry was out of work for about a month before landing a new job at his alma mater, Yale , where he will teach a course as well as host presentations called “Kerry Conversations.” The new program, called the Kerry Initiative, was announced today by the university’s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. “Secretary Kerry is going to teach school,” said Jim Levinsohn, director of the institute, home of the new program. “Students are going to show up, and that’s going to be John Kerry in the classroom.” Mr. Levinsohn said Mr. Kerry’s class, a seminar open to students across the university, will start in the next academic year. The “Kerry Conversations” will feature Mr. Kerry in discussions with world leaders, Mr. Levinsohn said. Another component of the initiative will involve the appointment of Kerry Fellows — both undergraduate and graduate students — who will assist Mr. Kerry’s research, Mr. Levinsohn said. \nAdvertisement Mr. Kerry, 73, a former Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential nominee, has deep ties to Yale, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1966.
