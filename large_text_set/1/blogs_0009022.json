Sure, we all have to wait almost an entire year to get our fix, but director Rian Johnson was nice enough to give us just a little bit of info about his project. He spoke with USA Today and revealed five things to get your mind moving about what exactly Episode VIII will be like. 2 \nIt’s already got a title \nWe’re all wondering what will come after The Force Awakens , but according to Johnson, it’s been known for a couple of years now. “It was in the very first draft I wrote,” he said. Don’t get too excited, though. You’re kidding yourself if you think he’s going to give it away. All he had to say about it was “All in good time, my friend.” Great, thanks. 3 \nEpisode Viii is going to be fun \nJohnson described his thoughts on the new film: \n“I want it to be a blast and to be funny and to be a ride the way The Force Awakens and the original Star Wars movies were.” \nMaybe BB-8 will have us rolling in laughter… I’ll see myself out. 4 \nWe’ll learn more about the characters of The Force Awakens \nSince the film will pick up right where Episode VII left off, we’ll be graced with the presence of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). \n“I wanted to know more about each of them, and that doesn’t just mean information or backstory,” Johnson said. “Figure out what’s the most difficult thing each of them could be challenged with now — let’s throw that at them and dig into what really makes them tick by seeing how they handle that.” 5 GIF \nRey’s relationship with Luke Skywalker is strong \nWe all remember the ending scene where Rey delivers an old lightsaber to Luke, and the new film will explore that relationship a lot further. \n“Both not knowing what’s going to happen and also having a lot of expectations in her head about how this is going to go,” Johnson says. “It very much feels like what we all go through in adolescence, the dawning of this new chapter of our lives.” \nFamilial themes will be key in the new film, and will be “a huge part of especially Rey’s character, something that was a really powerful part of her setup and something I really wanted to dig into with this.” Advertisement 6 \nLuke Skywalker’s character will genuinely be what fans are looking for \nFans have been dying to know what’s going on with Skywalker ever since he graced the screen in the last film, and the director said, “I’m approaching it with a take that I hope feels honest and real and is going to be interesting to folks and make sense.” \nSeeing as there are 338 days left before the premiere, these teases only add fuel to the fire of anticipation. But hey, it’s something.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T04:37:10.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
