Obstinate. — OptaJean (@OptaJean) March 25, 2017 \nHoltz's men enjoyed a moment to savour in the 34th minute when Joachim calmly sent Lloris the wrong way from the spot after Matuidi's clumsy challenge on Christopher Martins. \nBut Luxembourg were brought back down to earth within three minutes, Da Mota's mis-timed slide tackle bringing down Sidibe for a spot-kick, which Griezmann converted. \nFrance made an uninspiring start to the second half and suffered the blow of losing Sidibe to an injury just past the hour mark, with Lyon veteran Christophe Jallet on in his place. \nSchon had to be alert to deny Griezmann soon after as France tried to increase their advantage in the final quarter of a lacklustre showing against a side with one point to their name. \nIt was credit to Luxembourg that the game entered the closing stages still in the balance, as a home crowd sensed the possibility of a shock. \nBut Giroud's header from debutant Benjamin Mendy's left-wing delivery put paid to those hopes and Mbappe almost announced himself on the international stage in style, but saw his shot tipped over.
