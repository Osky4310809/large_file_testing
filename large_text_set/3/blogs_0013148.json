On Thursday, the Canadian company, which makes premium-priced parkas and winter jackets, will become the first luxury goods company to go public in three years. It will trade under the GOOS symbol and intends to raise approximately $237 million from the markets. The company has priced its shares in the $14 - $16 range. The latter price will set a valuation of $1.71 billion for it.

It’s $1,000 a piece parkas are worn by Hollywood celebrities, sportsmen, and musicians like Drake. The company reported revenues of C$290.8 million for the fiscal year ending March 2016, an increase of 38.3 percent from 2014 figures. It sold 70 percent stake to private equity firm Bain Capital in 2013 to finance expansion plans. The cash infusion came in handy to purchase a 45,000 square foot factory outside Toronto after the company ran out of inventory during the 2014 holiday season due to high demand. The Bain stake has also helped the company open four e-commerce stores in North America and Europe and its first retail stores in Toronto and New York. \nCanada Goose derives less than one-third of its sales from outside its home region. In its next growth phase, Canada Goose is targeting customers in Germany, Italy, and Scandinavia. Among risks listed in the prospectus are the company’s lack of diversification in product categories (it is focused on the premium outerwear category) and economic downturns. \nIn an interview with Bloomberg , Allen Adamson, founder of a brand consultancy, said Canada Goose “had legs” as an international brand. “I’m sure they’ll be selling as many Canada Goose coats in Berlin as Manhattan,” he said. However, the same article quotes Bruce Winder, a Toronto-based retail analyst as saying that the company was trying to “have their cake and eat it too.” According to him, Canada Goose is sacrificing its exclusivity by expanding too quickly. “When you do that, there’s a danger that the brand ends up diluted,” he said, pointing to Michael Kors Holdings Limited ( KORS ) as an example.
