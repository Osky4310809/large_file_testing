By Jeffrey Matulef Published 17/02/2017 \nGame developer veterans John and Brenda Romero (Doom, Wizardry) have released a new game made with their 12-year-old son Donovan Brathwaite-Romero. \nIt's called Gunman Taco Truck and it's out now, for free, on iOS and Android . \nThere's also a Steam version of it for Â£8.99 that came out two weeks ago. \nSet in a nuclear post-apocalypse, it's about the world's last Mexican and taco vendor making their way to Winnipeg by slaughtering mutants and shredding road signs to collect the meat and scrap they leave behind. You'll then use this to upgrade your taco truck and serve food to your customers at various rest stops along the way. Originally designed by a nine-year-old, the game has a PEGI rating of 12+. \nThe main mechanics are split into two mini-games. The simpler one is when you're on the road and shoot all incoming threats and road signs to protect oneself and collect the materials left in their wake. \nThe more complex part is actually making the tacos. Here you'll have to quickly remember recipes and make the various meals ordered. By pleasing your customers you'll gain money to buy gas, more ingredients and better gear for your truck. It's effectively a resource-management roguelike then. \nDespite what one may think based on its origins, young Donovan did a lot more than simply come up with the premise as he's credited as its designer and one of its coders. \n\"The game was designed by Donovan Brathwaite-Romero and completed as a family project,\" John Romero said in the game's announcement. \"Following a coding lesson, Donovan pitched the idea of the game to his parents, John and Brenda Romero, when he was nine. They liked the idea so much that they decided to make its development a family project. Over two years and lots of fun have gone into making Gunman Taco Truck an unforgettable experience, and the realisation of Donovan's dream of making a video game. Donovan has been learning how to code for the past three years.\" Sometimes we include links to online retail stores. If you click on one and make a purchase we may receive a small commission.
