He said the decision was based on the findings of a panel set up by the school authority to investigate the students’ riot. \nHe said the recommended punishments, as approved by the Minister of Educa-tion, were made by the Expanded Management Committee of the College to sanction the students based on their level of involvement in the riot. \nNo death was recorded during the fracas, but school property and a police van were destroyed by the students.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:32:16.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
