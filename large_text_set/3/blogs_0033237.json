It all began when West designed a prom dress covered in reversible sequins, with white on one side and gold on the other.\nA video of the dress went viral earlier this week, thanks to the mesmerizing footage of the dress changing from pure white to glistening gold. In addition to capturing the interest of the Internet, it appears that West’s dress even garnered some celebrity approval from none other than Miami royalty, rapper Trina, who posted about the dress on her Facebook page .\nSee the dress change colors for yourself below.\nTHE INFAMOUS GOWN BY YOURS TRULY … thank you @theshaderoom This means so much to me .
