Robert Ace Barbers said yesterday. \n“She puts the blame entirely on the erring mining companies. Her people at the department should share the blame and responsibility,” Barbers said. \n“I urge Secretary Lopez to turn her attention to the contributing factors for these environmental violations. I am referring to the corrupt Mines and Geosciences Bureau under its former head Leo Jasareno, the dismissed DENR undersecretary,” he added. \nBarbers said despite being fired by President Duterte, Lopez retained Jasareno as consultant and head of the team that audited mining companies. \n“Mr. Jasareno knew all too well that the violations and the destruction of the mountains and pollution of rivers did not happen overnight. They took place during his watch as head of the mines bureau, but he turned a blind eye,” he said. \nLopez has ordered the closure of 21 mines in Zambales, Eastern Samar, Dinagat Islands and Surigao provinces and the suspension of seven others for destroying mountains and watershed, and polluting rivers.   \nSpeaker Pantaleon Alvarez has supported Lopez’s order. \n“I support Secretary Lopez. I think she’s doing the right thing. I myself am against destructive mining. We have to protect the environment for our people and future generations,” he said. \nHe admitted that hundreds of mining workers would lose their jobs with the closure of the mines. \nHowever, Alvarez said mining activities have not enabled people to improve their lives. \n“Look at Caraga (Agusan and Surigao provinces, and Dinagat Islands). It is still one of the poorest regions in the country. When rains pour and there is flooding, it is the poor in Caraga and other mining areas who suffer,” he said. \nAlvarez said he doesn’t know the businessmen and politicians who own the mining companies Lopez has ordered closed. \n“To me, whoever own these companies, what we have to consider is the destruction of the environment and its effect on the people and their communities,” he added. \nBayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate, chairman of the House committee on environment and natural resources, said mining firms should be required to pay for the damage their activities have caused on communities, and to rehabilitate the mountains and rivers. Mines’ closure welcomed \nTribal group Cordillera Peoples Alliance (CPA) welcomed DENR’s closure of 23 mining operations including Benguet Corp. (BC), saying it was long overdue. \nAlthough the Lepanto Consolidated Mining Co. is among those recommended for suspension, the CPA is pushing for the closure of this firm for allegedly destroying the people’s lands and polluting and silting the Abra River and its tributaries for the past 80 years. \n“The over 100 years of BC’s open-pit mining in Itogon has flattened whole mountains and removed entire villages from the land surface. After exhausting the gold ore, the open pit in Itogon is now abandoned as the company has shifted to other economic ventures like water privatization, small-scale contract scheme and housing,” the group said. \nAccording to the CPA, which has been organizing community groups when BC was operating in Benguet, the company denuded the pine forests of Itogon, Baguio, Tuba and Tublay. \n“When they ran out of timber, the mining company expanded their logging to Bobok in Bokod.” \nApart from denuding the forests, the company also allegedly ruined the groundwater system of Itogon. \nBC reportedly polluted surface water channels and land surfaces aside from destroying watersheds and groundwater systems. \n– With Artemio Dumlao", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:29:12.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
