Verification: Is PTAD playing politics with pensioners’ income? On 9:28 pm In Viewpoint by adekunle Comments \nIt is most disheartening when government spends public funds on frivolities amidst one of the toughest economic downturns Nigeria has ever witnessed. The proposed verification of Nigerian pensioners in the Diaspora by the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) falls into this category. \nDuring a recent courtesy visit to Mrs. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Foreign Affairs (SSAPFA), the PTAD Executive Director Sharon Ikeazor announced plans to verify the details of Nigerian pensioners in the Diaspora as a step towards ensuring they receive their entitlements as and when due. \nAdmittedly, this exercise is not a bad idea in theory. But in practice, it is a needless waste of scarce financial resources, time and manpower; especially when it is more or less a duplication of the functions of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). \nLast time we checked, the NIMC is charged with establishing, operating and managing the National Identity Management system. As specified in the NIMC Act 2007, it is mandated to carry out the enrolment of citizens and legal residents, create and operate a National Identity Database and issue Unique National Identification Numbers to qualified citizens and legal residents. As of 2016, the NIMC had registered 9.5 million Nigerans on the national database, 1 million of whom had received their e-ID cards. What other credentials would an agency tasked with this responsibility need to prove it is equal to the task at hand? \nPTAD, on the other hand, is charged with addressing pensioners’ complaints on issues such as non-payment, short and irregular payment of pensions, and is certainly not as qualified as the NIMC to verify the identity of pensioners home and abroad. \nI think PTAD has to do a much better job of convincing Nigerians that the proposed exercise is not a ploy by members to enrich themselves in foreign currency, especially in light of the government’s attempts to tackle corruption in the public sector. \nRather than commit scarce resources to this exercise, PTAD should rather focus on advocating the cause of pensioners, most of whom are owed upwards of a year’s pension arrears without any hope in sight. Take the case of Alhaji Hassan Lemu for example. \nA former Principal Private Secretary to the late Premiere of Northern Nigeria, Sir Ahmadu Bello, he made headlines recently for being denied his statutory pension benefit for over six years. \nCurrently ill, the 86-year-old had been visiting the pension office in Abuja to make complaints but had always been assured that payment would commence soon, until he got too ill to make the trip. This sad experience is shared by thousands of pensioners whose stories we may never get to read. Ideally, PTAD should be more concerned about issues like this rather than another exercise in profligacy when the masses are suffering. \nHowever, recent developments do not indicate that PTAD is inclined to toe this path anytime soon. Already, it has reportedly dropped 15,600 pensioners off its payroll on claims that they lack Bank Verification Numbers (BVN). This is inexcusable and can only be construed as a tactical attempt by PTAD to ram the verification exercise down pensioners’ throats and make a strong case for the proposed verification exercise. \nEven if the exercise is approved for the sake of argument, how about the others conducted for Nigerians in the Diaspora that gulped so much resources and manpower that have turned out fruitless? Recall that in 2015, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) engaged the services of Online Integrated Solutions (OIS) to establish stations for data capture and generation of BVN for Nigerians in America, South Africa, China, India, the UK and United Arab Emirates. OIS was tasked with capturing the necessary data for online transmission to the Nigeria Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS), which would in turn generate BVNs and communicate same to customers within 48 hours. \nThereafter, customers were expected to forward their BVN to their banks for linkage with their accounts. Unless the exercise was fraudulent in the first place, why not engage the services of OIS yet again rather than start the process afresh on a jaunt that will take PTAD staff to over 180 countries while government is struggling to pay pensions with the excuse that funds are lacking? \nMy take is that in these trying times, we have to cut cost as much as possible by leveraging established structures to achieve our short and long-term objectives. We must ensure the budget for this spurious exercise has been vetted and approved by relevant authorities and is not buried under mountains of obscure items that will remain unverifiable for years to come. \nThe question is, does NIMC have infrastructure to enrol Nigerians abroad remotely? If yes, why is this not being taken advantage of? If no, why are funds to be used on this fresh PTAD exercise not channelled into equipping NIMC to carry out its statutory responsibilities on an ongoing basis for the benefit of all? \nNigerians have had it with wasteful spending of available resources while they struggle to make ends meet. We must quickly decide if this verification exercise is worth more than the lives of teeming pensioners who faithfully served the country in their prime but are now being subjected to untold rigours to get their entitlements. \nOchuko Akpobome is an Asaba-based public affairs analyst adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:42:29.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
