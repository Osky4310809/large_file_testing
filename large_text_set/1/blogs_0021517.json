(Twitter Photo) A federal judge has issued an emergency stay that halts part of President Donald Trump’s 90-day ban on U.S. immigration by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nRepresentatives of the ACLU and other organizations that challenged the executive order are tweeting from the courtroom that they’ve won a national stay against Trump’s executive order. The suit was filed on behalf of two Iraqi men who were detained at JFK Airport despite having visas that would ordinarily allow them to enter the country.\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly reportedly allows valid visa holders who have landed in the country to remain, impacting an estimated 100 to 200 people detained at U.S. airports. It comes a day after Trump signed the executive order, preventing citizens of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Libya from entering the U.S. for 90 days.\nAmid protests at airports across the country , tech leaders have been speaking out against Trump’s ban. The tech industry relies heavily on highly skilled immigrants for key engineering roles. Microsoft said 76 employees were impacted by the new restrictions. Google said more than 100 employees were impacted .\nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky said the company was offering free housing to people impacted by the order.\nAirbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US. Stayed tuned for more, contact me if urgent need for housing\n— Brian Chesky (@bchesky) January 29, 2017 \nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who was hoping to build a metaphorical bridge between the White House and Silicon Valley, also spoke out against the ban.\nMany people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T04:35:55.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
