Manchester United train ahead of Watford clash Wednesday, 8th February 2017 PHIL JONES didn't appear to take part in Manchester United's training session today ahead of the Watford match this weekend. 1 / 15 Manchester United train ahead of Watford clash “We are still alive in four competitions” Ander Herrera \n“We are still alive in four competitions,” he said. \n“That’s what this club is all about – titles and trophies. Of course the Premier League, for everyone, is the most important and the one the people like the most. \n“We are playing well and want to be in the top four as soon as possible. \n“We will not be 100 per cent happy if we finish fourth because we want to finish as high as possible, but the minimum is that we have to be in the top four and fight for the rest of the trophies. \n“Last season was not our best season. We finished fifth but we won the FA Cup which is very good. \nGETTY Ander Herrera has developed into a key midfielder for Man United this year \nGETTY Jose Mourinho expected Man United to challenge for the title this year \n“This year we started by winning the Community Shield which again is good for the club. Now it is time to get more trophies. \n“It is true the Europa League offers another door into the Champions League but we want to get it through the league. \n“And I cannot lie, for our fans, it would be special to finish above Manchester City and Liverpool. But they are very good teams and it will be very tough. \n“We believe in our qualities and that we can do it but we have to respect them as well because they are very good teams. Liverpool are not playing in any other competitions so they will be very focused on the league.” \nUnited have not conceded the title but Herrera accepts runaway leaders Chelsea – who were the last team to beat them in the League when they hammered United 4-0 in October - deserve to be out in front. \nHe added: “Every game has been difficult but the game that we deserved to lose clearly was at Chelsea. \n“So far Chelsea has been the best team. They are very compact. They are very difficult to beat and they have been clear in the things that they have to do. I think they deserve to be first, to be honest.” \n*Ander Herrera was speaking as United and its official timekeeper TAG Heuer unveiled their first offical special edition watches at Old Trafford.
