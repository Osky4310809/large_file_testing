Oscar is joining former Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas (inset) at Shanghai SIPG \nCosta, who is in line for a new £200,000-a-week contract with the Londoners, said: \"Yes, yes. I was about to leave. \n\"I was about to... but, well, I’m happy here as well and that’s that. \n\"I had the possibility to go to Atletico, because of a few things — the family, the life I have there... but not because of Chelsea, because, here, there’s a lot of love with the supporters, with the people, so I’m very happy. I'm very content. \nWatch — Diego Costa amuses himself by inflicting pain on a pal: Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T00:53:41.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
