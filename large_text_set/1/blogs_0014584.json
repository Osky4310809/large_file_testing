To comply with racing regulations, a full roll cage has been added, plus the car gets upgraded suspension, Pirelli tyres and brakes as well. \nIn terms of performance, the Tesla race car will hit a top speed of 250 km/h but it is the acceleration that makes it interesting. The 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) sprint is completed in just 2.1 seconds, while the 0-96 km/h (0-60 mph) is done in around two seconds. That makes it much quicker than the standard car in Ludicrous mode, which does the latter in 2.5 seconds. \nThe EGT will comprise of 10 teams and 20 drivers, with seven European circuits scheduled in its inaugural season, including Paul Ricard, Barcelona, Assen, Estoril and the Nurburgring, as well as three non-championship races in the Americas. Each race weekend will feature a 20-minute practice session, 60-minute qualifying, a day race (60km) and a dusk race (60km).
