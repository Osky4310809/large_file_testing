By Patricia Lourdes Viray   3:20pm In this Feb. 13, 2017 photo, Philippine Sen. Leila de Lima takes her seat during a session in the Philippine Senate in suburban Pasay city, south of Manila, Philippines. Philippine justice secretary said Friday, Feb. 17, 2017, criminal charges have been filed against the opposition senator allegedly receiving money from detained drug lords in a move that can lead to the arrest of one of the president's most vocal critics. De Lima has denied the charges as \"political persecution\" by President Rodrigo Duterte's administration. AP/Bullit Marquez \nMANILA, Philippines — Detained Sen. Leila de Lima described President Rodrigo Duterte as a \"ruthless king\" during his term as Davao City mayor following the reported killings of drug suspects in the city. \nIn a handwritten letter, the senator explained how nothing concrete came out from the 2009 probe of the Commission on Human Rights regarding the so-called Davao Death Squad (DDS) and the accountability of Duterte. \n\"The simple answer is — There were no Matobatos and Lascañases back then. And the city of Davao was then and perhaps still is under the spell of their ruthless king,\" De Lima said. \nDe Lima added that investigators are being regarded as \"enemies\" and \"intruders\" into a kingdom engulfed by a false sense of peace and order. \n\"I pose the question now — Is the entire country, even after hearing the harrowing testimonies of Matobato and Lascañas, be just like Davao City?\" the senator asked. \nThe detained senator also slammed her colleagues for ridiculing the statements of Matobato and Lascañas, who are both self-confessed members of the DDS. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nShe said that senators prefer to believe the testimonies of drug convicts, such as Kerwin Espinosa and Ronnie Dayan, even if their statements have \"glaring inconsistencies.\" \n\"It is tragic that our society's norms of what is right and wrong have been shattered in favor of a reign of lies and deceptions,\" De Lima said. \nDe Lima is currently detained at the PNP Custodial Center at Camp Crame after being arrested for drug charges filed against her in connection with her alleged involvement in the proliferation of the illegal drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T11:30:40.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
