Mason, a senior, averaged 20.9 points, 5.2 assists and 4.2 rebounds per game while leading Kansas to an Elite Eight appearance. His combination of leadership and efficiency on both ends made him the prohibitive favorite. Mason was the only unanimous selection to the Associated Press' All-America first team earlier this week. \"I love the kid and I think he knows how I feel about him, but I've never been more proud — not that he's won a postseason award—but he's done everything that he's supposed to do,\" Kansas coach Bill Self told Jim O'Connell of the AP. \"He's been a great teammate, he's been tough as nails, he's worked his butt off, he's loved by everyone in the academic departments, graduated, and to see him reap these benefits after putting in so much time is an unbelievable honor.\" Few was likewise considered a no-brainer winner for Coach of the Year honors after leading Gonzaga to a one-loss regular season and the first Final Four appearance in school history. The Bulldogs play South Carolina on Saturday night for the right to play in their first title game. \n\"I desperately want it for this group of guys,\" Few said before beating Xavier, per Eamonn Brennan of ESPN.com. \"I desperately want it for everybody who has played at Gonzaga...But my legacy is going to be about other things, at least as far as I'm concerned.\" \nFew is the first coach in Gonzaga history to win the AP's yearly honor. He is the second coach from a non-Power Five conference to win in the last decade (Wichita State's Gregg Marshall, 2014). \nMason is likewise the first player in Kansas history to win Player of the Year, which has been handed out since 1960-61. He's the first Big 12 player to win the award since Blake Griffin (Oklahoma) in 2008-09.
