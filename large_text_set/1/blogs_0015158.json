Firstly, I wouldn’t want that to happen.\" \nDepending on who you ask, World War III is imminent. And while there's a lot of talk about hacking, and biowarefare these days, I've got some unfortunate news. Wars are still largely fought by people: people like you and I. Interestingly enough, people like you and I do not seem especially keen to join in this hypothetical war. Or so we discovered when we wandered around Melbourne asking people on the street. Mael, 25 \nIf WWIII Started Tomorrow, Would You Defend Your Country? Well, that's hard because I'm half African, half Australian so it depends on who the world war is between. If it's between Africa and Australia, I might just stay out of it guys. \nWhat if it wasn't a physical war but... a cyber war? We're talking about drones and hacking? That sounds fun, it doesn't sound too dangerous. Controlling money electronically and throwing it around sounds cool. Sure, I'd be down—I'm a bit of a geek. \nWhat would your ideal role be in this cyber war? Oh, definitely hacking. I'm into building computers and into Linux and stuff. I pull computers apart and putting them back together again, but I think I blew the motherboard last time. Laura, 27 \nIf WWIII broke out tomorrow... ...Has it not already? Isn't it a couple of days away? \nPotentially. Would you defend your country? No. To quote Meryl Streep, \"violence incites violence.\" We're never gonna be any better than we were before if we keep repeating the same mistakes, so I wouldn't fight. \nWhat if you could have another role within the war? Well, I'm a writer so I couldn't help in the sense of saving lives, but maybe I could work in communication. Someone said to me, \"what if you had the option to work for Trump. Would you take it?\" I mean, it could make a really big impact. You could be the really good person inside a really bad thing. \nSo you'd work for Trump? No, I don't think I could handle that. Aimee, 20 \nIf WWIII Started Tomorrow, would you defend your country? I'm studying nursing, so I'd go be a nurse in the army and help that way. I probably wouldn't fight because I'm not for violence. I'm not for government expenditure on military violence either. \nBut you're still happy to get involved? As long as I don't die. I mean, it depends on how far I have to go too. I'm up for a little bit of a risk. I guess even if you've got the red cross, on the battlefield you'd probably still... die. \nQuite possibly. What scares you the most about a potential World war? People dying. And historic buildings being bombed. And the animals. Think of the animals, people! Navkaran, 22 \nIf WWIII started tomorrow, would you defend your country? What a horrible question. Firstly, I wouldn't want that to happen. But of course, if it happens, as the youth we can raise our voices and question why there's a war in the first place. \nSo you wouldn't enlist? Not for my country, no. If I took part it wouldn't be to defend my country—we'd have to fight for all of humanity. Mei, 20 \nIf WWIII Started tomorrow, would You Defend Your Country? Yes, I think so. \nIt's my country, It's Australia. \nHow would you help during a war? I'm going to become a pharmacist, so I'd want to protect and help the wounded. \nThe pay would be pretty good for a pharmacist in a war. Money really wouldn't matter at that time. I'd just want to protect the people. \nWay to make us feel bad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T12:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T08:21:43.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
