According to ESPN.com , Kelsey—who coached Winthrop the last five seasons—asked to be released from his contract Thursday. Winthrop announced Kelsey will remain the team's head coach later in the day. ESPN.com noted UMass announced his hiring Wednesday. \"For personal reasons, I have asked the University of Massachusetts to allow me to be released from the offer I accepted to be the head men's basketball coach,\" Kelsey said, per ESPN.com. \"To be clear, this decision is entirely personal and in no way an assessment of the commitment UMass made to me personally or to the resources available at UMass to have a nationally-recognized program.\" UMass athletics director Ryan Bamford responded with a statement, per ESPN.com: \"Again, his reasons were personal in nature. I know that the unforeseen circumstances surrounding his decision were not in our control.\" Minutemen forward Zach Coleman and guard DeJon Jarreau responded to the change of circumstances on Twitter: Zach Coleman @zcole_14", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:01:45.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
