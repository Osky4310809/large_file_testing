Rec Photo by Ian Walton/Getty Images Despite the best efforts of Chelsea loanee Mario Pašalić to help AC Milan in their quest to recover their glory-days, the historic Italian club are still struggling to make an impact in the Serie A. However, that is all set to change next month, sort of, as the the Rossoneri are the latest club slated for a takeover by Chinese investors, just like their arch-rivals Internazionale were recently as well. This injection of money into Milan's pockets has apparently reignited interest in several transfer targets, one of whom is Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fàbregas, at least according to a report from Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport (via Football Italia ). Fàbregas had been on Milan's radar for months, if previous rumors were to be believed. And despite Cesc’s consistent denials, it would appear that he remains an \"ideal acquisition\" for them. The funds from the new investors could also put Milan in the hunt for three potential Chelsea transfer targets as well, including Arsenal's Alexis Sánchez, Manchester City's Sergio Agüero and Real Madrid's Álvaro Morata. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport (via Metro ), these three strikers comprise Milan's shortlist for the summer. While the new money is yet to arrive — the takeover that has been subject to multiple delays over the last few months, with the latest deadline pushed out to March 3rd — Milan are hoping to be a force to be reckoned with once again. We are in for another very interesting summer transfer window, that much is sure.
