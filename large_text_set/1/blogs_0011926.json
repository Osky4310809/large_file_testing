The province of Ontario, which already has the highest hydro rates in North America, will be especially hard hit, as Kathy Katula told Trudeau . \nKatula told Trudeau, “I feel like you have failed me, and I’m asking you today to fix that. My heat and hydro now cost me more than my mortgage.” \n“I make $50,000 a year Mr. Trudeau and I am living in energy poverty,” Katula said with tears in her eyes. \n“I’m asking you, Mr. Trudeau, how do you justify to a mother of four children, three grandchildren, with physical disabilities, and working up to 15 hours a day, how is it justified for you to ask me to pay a carbon tax when I only have $65 left in my pay check every two weeks to feed my family?” she asked. \nAt a news conference in Peterborough, Ontario, on Friday, Trudeau was asked by reporters if a carbon tax would stall economic recovery. He responded by saying “putting a price on carbon will promote growth and create jobs.” \nTrudeau, who may have broken the federal Conflict of Interest Act when he vacationed with billionaire and Muslim spiritual leader the Aga Khan last Christmas, continues to deny the significance of the story. \nHe downplayed the growing scandal — dubbed Kahngate — by saying, “Canadians are talking to me about issues that are relevant to them.” \nFollow David on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T19:11:49.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
