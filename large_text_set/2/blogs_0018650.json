The man delivering the beatdown is a name you may recognize–Yusaf Mack.\nMack is a 37-year-old former professional boxer who came out as gay back in 2015 after a video surfaced of him participating in a gay porn. Initially, Mack denied his involvement, claiming he was drugged and woke up on a train with cash in his pocket, totally oblivious to being in the porn. His denial was likely fueled by the fact that he is a father of TEN and engaged to a woman at the time. But, after being threatened with a lawsuit, he admitted to be a willing participant. Since he came out, Mack has been an outspoken advocate for gay rights, talking openly about getting involved in a transgender relationship.\nMack’s lifestyle hasn’t sat well with some, namely this Philadelphia barber who has consistently been trolling Mack online about his sexual orientation. The LA Clippers barber, Hector Echevarria, was delivered a healthy dose of street justice after Mack stormed into his shop and beat the piss out of him.\nCheck it out below:\nLawsuit #YusafMack beats up Internet troll in Philly barbershop pic.twitter.com/CSq2LJACPp \n— Chop Shop (@ChopShop702) February 20, 2017 \n\nAfter beating Echevarria to a pulp, Mack then takes a jar from the barber’s shelf and bashes it across his head, which is not seen in the video. Paramedics arrived at the scene and Echevarria told them that he may have broken his ankle.\nEchevarria has not filed a lawsuit yet, but took to Twitter to do what he does best: troll.\n“I rather have a video of some beating me up then a video of someone seeing me take a dick up my ass any day.”\nDude is living on borrowed time.\n[h/t Rolling Out ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:37:44.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
