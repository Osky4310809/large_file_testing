But it could also jeopardize food safety.\n\nThe USDA is a sprawling department with 29 agencies that oversee agriculture, water systems, and nutritional programs, like school lunches and food for women and infants. Its nearly 10,000 employees are spread out across 4,500 locations, and is still lacking a leader under Trump. The president’s pick, former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.\nView this image › \nKristen Wyatt / AP \nID: 10718142 Women and children who need nutrition assistance might have a harder time accessing it under Trump’s proposal. The budget would cut $200 million in aid to WIC — which provides food vouchers for low-income pregnant women, nursing moms, and young children. There’s also no mention of the country’s primary cash assistance welfare program, Head Start, which helps preschool children in low-income families — raising questions as to whether these services would exist under Trump’s administration.\n“The administration’s proposed cuts to nondefense discretionary spending would touch on programs and services that many Americans turn to every day,” the Center for American Progress said in a statement.\nView this image › \nMeals on Wheels, Wikipedia \nID: 10718153 Meals on Wheels, which is funded by federal grants, is also on the chopping block. The small, but well-known program helps feed the poor, elderly, and veterans. Last year, it delivered 220 million meals to 2.5 million seniors, and more than 500,000 veterans, across the country.\n“We can’t spend money on programs just because they sound good and great,” said Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, on Thursday.\nAnother program deemed ineffective by the Trump administration: the $200 million McGovern-Dole International Food for Education program. The program estimated that it helped feed more than 2 million people in developing countries in fiscal year 2016. The administration said that “it lacks evidence that it is being effectively implemented to reduce food insecurity.”\nFood for Peace, which works to reduce hunger and malnutrition in developing countries, is also absent from the proposed USDA budget. “The White House folded that program into the budget for the State Department, which includes the US Agency for International Development,” Agri-Pulse notes . The State Department budget would also be reduced by 29% and has no mention of Food for Peace.\nWhile Trump didn’t cut funding for the Agriculture Department’s food safety and inspection service, the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects about 80% of US food, is still up in the air. Trump has proposed slashing the Department of Health and Human Services budget by 18% and shifting its funding from appropriations to user fees.\n“He will fully fund meat inspection but would cut research on agriculture and food safety,” said Patty Lovera, assistant director at Food and Water Watch.\nLarge budget cuts to the FDA could mean imported foods aren’t inspected as thoroughly and lead to delayed food safety act, the Safe Food Coalition said.\nUnderfunding the FDA could mean imported products aren’t inspected as thoroughly and potentially jeopardize food safety programs, the Safe Food Coalition said.\n\nBill Marler, a food safety attorney who worked on a slew of food-borne illness cases, said the budget was worrisome because it leaves funding for the FDA up in the air.\n“Trump is really cutting the department that controls the FDA, which means we could see cuts that would impact how safe our food is,” Marler said. “There is no long-standing constituency for food safety.”\n\nMarler added the cuts could lead to an increased occurrence of food-borne illnesses.\n\n“We need more inspectors given we’re importing an increasing amount of food, he said. “We don’t want to go back to battling constant food-borne illness outbreaks.”\nPrograms that help supply low-income and rural communities with basic needs like heat, food, and health would also lose funding or be eliminated. Trump would eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps people pay their heating bills, the Community Services Grant, which fights poverty, and the Water and Wastewater loan and grant program , which helps fund water infrastructure in communities with less than 10,000 people.\n\n“This political vision reduces services that protect our health and that we rely on every day,” said Jim O’Hara, director of health promotion policy at Center for Science in the Public Interest “People would really suffer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T04:26:43.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
