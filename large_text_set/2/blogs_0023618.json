If the information is correct, the fifth-generation of the popular family-oriented SUV – which was spotted testing in Thailand – will debut in the Land of Smiles as early as the end of March, ahead of the 2017 Bangkok International Motor Show. \nWhat’s more, the new CR-V is rumoured be offered there for the first time with a turbodiesel – a 1.6 litre i-DTEC four-cylinder engine introduced on the previous generation’s facelift , developing 160 PS at 4,000 rpm and 350 Nm of torque at 2,000 rpm. Unlike the CR-V’s other engines, which make use of a CVT, the diesel will likely soldier on with the same nine-speed automatic transmission as before. \nAside from the diesel, the new CR-V should also be offered in Thailand with the same petrol engines as the United States. These include a 2.4 litre naturally-aspirated mill that churns out 184 hp at 6,400 rpm and 244 Nm of torque at 3,900 rpm, along with a 1.5 litre VTEC Turbo unit producing 190 hp at 5,600 rpm and 243 Nm of torque from 2,000 to 5,000 rpm, slightly higher than the one in the Civic. \nCompletely redesigned inside and out, the new CR-V is even more practical than before, with a longer wheelbase – 2,660 mm vs 2,620 mm – providing the car with a more spacious cabin. New features include LED head- and tail lights, an Active Grille Shutter, an optional powered tailgate with handsfree opening and a new seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. \nThe new CR-V also adds the option of Honda Sensing driver assists, including Collision Mitigation Braking System, Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), Road Departure Mitigation, Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). However, it is unclear if all these features will be offered in ASEAN markets. \nCloser to home, the new Honda CR-V is likely one of the four cars that Honda Malaysia plans to launch this year. Do you think there will be a market for a diesel model over here? \nGALLERY: 2017 Honda CR-V", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:52:38.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
