This is Meizu’s third-gen fast charging solution, and it actually uses the high-voltage direct charge method. Meizu’s mCharge fast charging method was quite fast as it is, but Super mCharge takes things to a whole new level it seems, read on if you’re interested. \nSuper mCharge is actually using the field-leading 11V/5A charging connector which offers a maximum power of 55W. So, what does this mean? How fast is this charging method? Well, according to Meizu, Super mCharge can fully charge a battery in just 20 minutes. The company even compared their new fast charging method with drinking a cup of coffee, as it’s just that fast, according to Meizu. Let’s get a bit more technical, shall we. Super mCharge actually utilizes the Charge Pump Principle, it applies only 2 groups of conversion circuits to directly output half of the voltage. Now, if Meizu is to be believed, this will increase charging efficiency by 9 percent to 98 percent, and also means you’ll get stable charging performance. While using Super mCharge, battery temperature doesn’t get too hot, it doesn’t get hotter than 39 degrees celsius, which is yet another positive when it comes to Super mCharge. \nSuper mCharge comes with the reduced heat-dissipation and current, and an upgraded data cable which is capable of supporting 160W, all this in order to ensure stability and durability. Meizu had conducted a number of tests when it comes to Super mCharge, and the company says that a 3,000mAh ATL battery retains over 80% of its capacity after over 8000 charge and discharge cycles using Super mCharge. The company also added the following: “Super mCharge is not only the fastest charging technology, but the safest one of all”. The company did not say when can we expect this tech to be included in their devices, but we’re guessing that their upcoming Meizu PRO 7 flagship will ship with Super mCharge. This is just a guess, as the company did not release any specific info, as already mentioned, we’ll make sure to report back as soon as they do, though.
