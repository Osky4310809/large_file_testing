(Spoiler alert: she is still dearly in need of a good stylist!)\nTo promote the upcoming film, Paramount Pictures staged the above prank at a real appliance store in White Plains, NY, to see what unsuspecting shoppers would do when Samara climbed out of a TV right in front of them. To issue a slight caveat here, there’s probably at least a decent chance that the whole thing is faked, since you’d have to assume a big movie studio like Paramount knows that it’s not a good idea to go grabbing at random people who could very well have heart conditions and/or weapons on them (which would both be bad).\nHowever if you’d care to suspend disbelief, then go ahead and enjoy a bunch of people getting the absolute daylights scared out of them as they think they’re just going about their everyday business shopping for a new TV. Hey, that ought to teach them for attempting to shop local!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T19:26:06.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
