Ben Sasse (R-NE) said Franken’s discussion of arbitration had been compelling, “but I don’t see exactly how that applies to the judge sitting in front of us.” He said that was a matter that should be handled through legislation. \nKlobuchar pressed the nominee on the unanimous Supreme Court decision issued Wednesday that required schools to provide better services for special education students. The ruling rejected a standard set by Gorsuch on the appeals court in 2008, in which he ruled that a Colorado school district didn’t have to pay for the private school tuition of an autistic boy. \n“A student offered an educational program providing ‘merely more than de minimus progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all,” the Supreme Court ruled. \nKlobuchar told Gorsuch that requiring educational standards to be merely more than \"de minimus,” or minimal, creates more of a ceiling than a floor for students. \nGorsuch said that he had followed precedent in his ruling, and questioned that Klobuchar would suggest that he and other appeals judges were out of the mainstream in their legal reasoning. \nLater in the day, Klobuchar also questioned him about antitrust issues, though Gorsuch, who has taught antitrust law, was somewhat circumspect on the topic. When she asked him if the court had made antitrust enforcement too difficult, and what he said in his classes about it, Gorsuch said that he tried not to expose his students to all views on antitrust issues so that they could make up their own minds. \n“I believe that’s an important function as a teacher, not to be a doctrinaire but to be challenging,” Gorsuch said. \nHe did acknowledge the problems of courts making antitrust enforcement too difficult, saying they would lead to a lack of competition that produced higher prices and lower output, and praised the original federal regulations in that area for still being vital today. \nAdditionally, Klobuchar asked how he taught a 2008 controversy regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s criticism that a report by the U.S. Department of Justice on cracking down on monopolies was too favorable to big corporations. \nGorsuch said he tried to expose his students to all the learning that’s available and that his course was comprehensive and one of the more difficult classes at the law school. \n“So you don’t want to weigh in on this debate?” she asked. \n“Oh senator!” he said. “There’s no way you’re going to get me to weigh in on this debate.” Minn.
