We are hopeful that many more will still return as soon as practicable,” he added. \nHe also reiterated that the government would not spare any effort to reunite the girls with their families. \n“I salute the fortitude of the distraught parents. As a parent also, I identify with their plight. Days turned to weeks, weeks turned to months, months turned to years, and today, it is 1,000 days. The tears never dry, the ache is in our hearts. But hope remains constant, eternal, and we believe our pains will be assuaged. Our hopes will not be shattered, and our hearts will leap for joy, as more and more of our daughters return. It is a goal we remain steadfastly committed to,” the President stated. \nHe commended all who have been in the vanguard for the recovery of the girls, both nationally and internationally, adding: “Someday soon, we will all rejoice together. Our intelligence and security forces are unrelenting, and whatever it takes, we remain resolute. \n“Chibok community, Nigeria, and, indeed, the world, will yet rise in brotherhood, to welcome our remaining girls back home. We trust God for that eventuality.” He said", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T14:14:03.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
