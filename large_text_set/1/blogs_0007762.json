When asked if everyone were available, the only exception he noted was forward Mindaugas Kuzminskas, whom he said was sick all day.\nWhen the Knicks and Pelicans played Dec. 30 in New Orleans, the Pelicans threw everything at Kristaps Porzingis and fared well. The Knicks’ 7-foot-3 Latvian forward shot 8-of-20 and scored 21 points. Good for some, but not him.\n“Let’s be realistic. He missed some shots that he normally makes. What you try to do is just try to make it as tough on him as you possibly can,” said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who heaped praise on the second-year player, drawing the oft-used parallel to Dirk Nowitzki.\n“He’s really, really a good player. I mean he’s really a good player, and he’s just going to keep getting better and better,” Gentry said of Porzingis. “The thing I like about him is that there’s a toughness about him that makes him even that much confident, and I think right now, the only thing he’s missing, he’s going to get stronger, and when he’s going to get stronger, he reminds you of a guy in Dallas, a lot of a guy in Dallas who was pretty good in this league and still is.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T03:22:33.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
