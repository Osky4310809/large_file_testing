In total, 344,187 Lego bricks (17 colours) were used to build the vehicle, which took 222 hours to design and 1,833 hours to build. \nChevrolet also took the time to set up an entire product page on its official website, where you can find additional details about the Batmobile. For instance, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) is USD48 million (RM214,344,000) and under the hood, there’s a 60.2 litre V100 engine with 20,000 hp. \nPlenty of equipment available on the vehicle that is touted as being “perfect for a night out saving the town,” with stud shooters, a flaming rocket booster, fully-articulating wheels and sextuple exhausts being standard. \nThere are even practical features such as Parallel Park Mode, built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity, as well as Teen Driver Technology, the latter of which helps new drivers (like Robin) by automatically turning on advanced safety technologies like Automatic Nerd Alert, Side Batwing Conversion and X-Ray Vision Camera.
