Patricia is a much better candidate – so lets hire the guy from buffalo that sucks! Great job spanos! Jan 12, 2017 8:06 PM \nGood luck to A Lynn. He’s going to need all of it. sdboltaction says: Jan 12, 2017 8:06 PM \nWhat a joke. Shouldn’t expect anything else. Jan 12, 2017 8:09 PM \ngood tickets still available to ALL game . come see your favorite team play the chargers. Jan 12, 2017 8:10 PM \nWill they introduce him with a LA Dodger cap at his press conference? lol lightninglucci says: Jan 12, 2017 8:12 PM \nI’ve been begging for a defensive-minded coach forever now. Man, this team is consistent on the disappointment. nic3roc0123 says: Jan 12, 2017 8:14 PM \nI’m not even a Chargers fan and I dislike Spanos EXTREMELY. Wasted Philip Rivers career, the hiring of AJ smith, the Marty firing, and moved the team away from a loyal fan base. \nI know how it feels to have a bad owner Bolts fans, I deal with Woody Johnson, there should be qualifications to buying an NFL team. 3menandablog says: Jan 12, 2017 8:14 PM \nYou move to a city that doesn’t want you and immediately hire a coach not in demand? \nThat is so Chargers. So cheap. \nJust sell the team. 30 years have proven you’re not good at this. Jan 12, 2017 8:14 PM \nGlad to know Chargers are still cheap even in LA realfootballfan says: Jan 12, 2017 8:18 PM \nI was on board with Buffalo going the direction of a Jim Johnson disciple since that form of defense gave Brady problems in his first Super Bowl loss. Then, the reports emerged of McDermott bringing Leslie Frazier with him, and now Lynn and Gus Bradley, who is supposedly his DC choice, look a whole lot more appealing. TheAfterParty says: Jan 12, 2017 8:20 PM \nGotta hand it to Lynn..RB coach to offense coordinator to full fledged head coach. Thats a pretty sweet rise to the top.
