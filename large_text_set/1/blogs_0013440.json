Christopher Steele (Photo: Internet unknown) Read More Jeb Bush forced to deny he hired firm to compile 'dirty dossier' about Donald Trump \nIts 35 pages, published by news website Buzzfeed, is made up of 16 separate reports. \nA friend of Steele, who does not want to be named, says he sold them in instalments at $15,000 (£12,300) a time every three weeks to anti-Trump Republicans looking for dirt on the tycoon in the run-up to the presidential nomination. \nThe pal added: “He was just a hired gun. His motive was money and he knew which side his bread was buttered.” \nTrump has strongly denied claims in the documents, said to be based on Russian Secret Service information, that Moscow has “cultivated” him for years and shared intelligence with him – and that Russia’s FSB agency has footage of him with hookers at the capital’s Ritz-Carlton hotel. \nOn Friday he branded Steele a “failed spy”. \nNow the ex-spook, who fled his £1.3million Surrey home as the story broke, is said to be in hiding from Russia’s notorious Department 13 hit squads.

Last night historian and intelligence author Nigel West said Mr Steele was a target because of his links to Alexander Litvinenko – the Russian dissident who died in London in 2006 after Russian hoods poisoned his tea with deadly polonium-210. \nFormer MP Mr West first met Steele at a Nato intelligence conference at an RAF base in East Anglia. He was so impressed by him he later introduced him to his wife as “the real James Bond”.

But as his reports also contained allegations of corruption, he needed to approach a law enforcement agency to cover himself. So he handed his dossier to the FBI who passed it up the US ­intelligence chain until a summary landed on Barack Obama’s desk. \nPosted undercover to Moscow by his secret service masters in the 1990s, Steele had been an expert at compiling CX – the name given to reports ­exclusively for the Chief, or C as the head of MI6 is still traditionally known.

But what surprised Steele’s friends in the business is that the Trump dossier fell so short of standards. \nOne said: “It was very amateurish and nothing like the quality of CX. The trouble is Chris didn’t meet the original sources. He could no longer go to Moscow and relied on intermediaries.” \nTrump has angrily denied the dossier’s unverified claims as “fake news” and berated American media for repeating them. Republican Senator John McCain got hold of the report in November and passed it to US intelligence chiefs, who briefed outgoing President Barack Obama and Trump. \nDefector Boris Karpichkov, a former KGB major, said he does not believe the substance of the Steele dossier. He added: “It is of such poor quality. But he is partially right when he claimed Russians have cultivated Trump for years.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:03:02.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
