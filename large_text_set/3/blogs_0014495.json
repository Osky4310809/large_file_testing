Little did she know the diagnosis, a “death sentence” as she saw it, would alter her existence in unimaginable ways, beginning with a hike up the world’s highest free-standing mountain.\n“Oh my God, I wanted to pass out, it was complete shock and complete, utter fear,” Jakubauskas told The Post of her 2012 multiple myeloma diagnosis. “All I thought was: I’m going to die.”\nJakubauskas, now 53, had furiously Googled her symptoms – extreme rib pain on both sides — before that oncologist’s ominous discovery in her blood work. It turns out that bone pain is a common symptom of multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells that amass in bone marrow and form tumors throughout bones in the body.\n\n‘I lived a very healthy lifestyle and there was no reason for me to get anything like this – not that there’s a reason for anyone to get cancer – but this particular one was just so bizarre.’\n“I had gone to four different doctors and I just had a complete physical and nobody was detecting it,” she said. “They were just telling me it was an inflamed muscle. And it was very painful and I was very tired, and I thought maybe I was just feeling down and depressed or something. But I just could not settle for: ‘This is nothing and take a Tylenol.’” A doctor near her home in Sag Harbor, New York, then determined her blood results were “all over the place” and sent Jakubauskas to an oncologist.\n“And that’s what it was,” she said. “I lived a very healthy lifestyle and there was no reason for me to get anything like this – not that there’s a reason for anyone to get cancer – but this particular one was just so bizarre.”\nThere were an estimated 30,330 new cases of myeloma diagnosed in the US last year,representing 1.8 percent of all new cancer cases in 2016, according to the National Cancer Institute. A total of 12,650 people died from the rare cancer, accounting for 2.1 percent of all US cancer deaths. And while no two patients are alike, less than half (48.5 percent) of people diagnosed with myeloma survive five years or more after being diagnosed.\nJakubauskas was raised in a home where her parents smoked, but she never picked up the habit and claims even prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke wouldn’t have caused her diagnosis.\n“Yeah, this is an exposure cancer, I am 100 percent sure,” she said. “I must’ve gotten this from using [weed killer] in my yard. I am convinced.”\nJakubauskas’ next stop was Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she started induction therapy and had a bone marrow aspiration, a procedure to take a sample of the soft tissue from bones in her back. She then spent four days in the Manhattan hospital receiving her initial chemotherapy treatments while Hurricane Sandy pulverized the US, Canada and the Caribbean.\nApril Jakubauskas and four other multiple myeloma patients pose atop Mount Kilimanjaro. April Jakubauskas Of all the wicked yet healing treatments and procedures to follow, Jakubauskas said the bone marrow biopsies were the most painful. She called the experience the “most painful thing you ever want to experience” and suffered through it seven or eight times, she said.\nShe later underwent two stem cell treatments – one using her own regenerative cells to put her in remission, another using a donor from Germany. But a nurse’s suggestion that she look into doing a hike with the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation would prove to be almost as impactful.\nJakubauskas filed that possibility away until last year when she attended a Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation gala at Manhattan’s Chelsea Piers in October.\n“So I’m in there and I’m speaking with people who work for the foundation and I told them my history and they said: ‘Would you be interested in joining a team to climb Mount Kilimanjaro to raise funds and awareness for cancer?’ I said absolutely, sign me up, not realizing what I was in for.”\n\n‘It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.’\nJakubauskas began training immediately, focusing on leg exercises, endurance trials and walking long distances. At 19,341 feet, Mount Kilimanjaro was an extremely imposing feat for anyone, let alone someone with zero mountaineering experience. “It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life,” Jakubauskas said after finishing the eight-day climb last month and returning to the US last week from Germany, where she met the once-anonymous stem cell donor who literally saved her life. “I had panic attacks from just being up there because I felt so trapped being up there. There’s really no way down and they don’t have any kind of service to come get you.”\nJakubauskas, who climbed as part of a 14-person team that included four other myeloma patients, recalled passing memorial plaques on the mountain, marking where previous climbers met their end on the Tanzanian peak.\n\n‘I would get up at night and stare at the stars, and it was absolutely incredible.’\n“I just prayed and had so much hope that I was going to get better and get through this huge ordeal of healing my body and getting this cancer out of me,” she said. “And I brought that onto my hike, as far as having so much hope. It was so grueling but I just kept my focus and took one step at a time.” Nights were particularly rough, with temperatures dropping so low that three layers of clothing, two pairs of socks and a “mummy-like” sleeping bag provided little relief. Still, natural beauty abounded at every turn, Jakubauskas said.\n“I would get up at night and stare at the stars, and it was absolutely incredible,” she said. “It was also pitch black and frightening and there was no way down unless I was carried by a porter.”\nApril Jakubauskas meets her stem cell donor Katrine in Cologne, Germany, after last month’s climb. April Jakubauskas As if conquering the highest peak in Africa wasn’t enough emotional healing, Jakubauskas then met her fiancée Shannon in Amsterdam before making her way to Cologne, Germany, where she met the woman, Katrine, who underwent painful stem cell removal procedures to give her a new chance at life years earlier.\n“It was surreal,” she said of the meeting. “She’s now my family – I now have her immune system. I don’t have anything of my family’s immune system in my anymore. I even have her blood type. All of her is going through my body, killing whatever cancer I had and giving me a whole new life.”\nJakubauskas isn’t the only one whose life has directly benefited from climbs up some of the world’s tallest peaks. Since launching in January 2016, the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation has raised more than $950,000 during ascents of the Grand Canyon’s Bright Angel Trail, the Machu Picchu’s Inca Trail and Mount Kilimanjaro.\n“The incredible will and determination of the climbers, not only on their epic climb of Mount Kilimanjaro, but also in their daily fight against multiple myeloma, is an inspiration to all of us at the MMRF to continue to work even more urgently to advance new breakthrough treatments for patients with this still incurable disease,” MMRF CEO Paul Giusti told The Post in a statement. “Funds raised through their tremendous accomplishment will fuel our efforts to bring multiple myeloma patients breakthrough treatments that precisely target the unique features of their cancers.”\nNow in complete remission, Jakubauskas balances the oppressive, constant fear of cancer recurrence with her next goal: a trip to Nepal to hike villages near Mount Everest.\n“It was not that long ago that I was completely poisoned with chemotherapy to wipe out my system and look at me and how my body has come back,” Jakubauskas said of her view from the other side of the mountain. “You can put your body through so much abuse and it will come back. Look at me – I’m here.”\nApril Jakubauskas approaches the Mount Kilimanjaro summit at sunrise.
