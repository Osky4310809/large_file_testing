The show ran from 1997 to 2001, and is still in syndication on Nick Jr. if you’re looking to invoke some serious nostalgia. But even though we loved those weird colorful little critters, one of our favorite characters was the Sun Baby. Recently, the actress who played Sun Baby revealed her identity , and honestly, she still kind of looks the same !\nWho could forget that absolutely adorable little giggling sun ? How’d she get up in the sky ? Where were her parents? According to The Sun (appropriately enough), the cartoon-like baby in the sky was a very real Jess Smith, who was chosen to play Sun Baby while being weighed at the local hospital.\nSmith told the Sun, “My mum took me and it just happened to be the same time that the producer of the old series had come in and wanted the hospital to get in contact with them if they’d seen any smiley babies.” And lucky for Smith, she was a very smiley baby. Curios of what the sun baby from Teletubbies looks like now? Well here ya go #telletubbies #jesssmith \nA post shared by Rj Brown (@rj_brown88) on Mar 5, 2016 at 1:46pm PST \nIn 2014, Smith told Daily Mail that she revealed she was Sun Baby during an ice breaker game she played with friends at Canterbury Christ Church University. Each person had to share something about themselves that others might not know already.\n“I thought I may as well tell them as I’m going to be spending the next three years with them,” Smith told Daily Mail. “My mother is really chuffed.” \n& Posted by Jess Elizabeth Smith on  Sunday, February 26, 2017 \nJust last month, Smith attended The Teletubbies 20th anniversary party in London. She’s still just as smiley as ever!\nGetty Images / Barcroft Media “Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby,” Smith wrote in her Facebook post. “I still have a baby face. I haven’t changed much either. I am still giggly.” We’re glad that Sun Baby is just as happy now as she was 20 years ago!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T03:15:51.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
