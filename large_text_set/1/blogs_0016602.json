Details are still scarce, but the chairman of Fox did suggest that an official pilot order could be coming within the next few weeks. \nNow, 20 th Century Fox’s X-Men producer Lauren Shuler Donner has offered another clue about the mysterious X-Men project. The reveal came while discussing how the new series will be related to the X-Men film series. NEXT: X-Men Producer On Possibility Of More TV Spinoffs \n“ Matt's is much more a part of just the world in terms of there are mutants, mutants are hated and there are Sentinels -- though very different from what we've seen before,” Donner tells IGN . “You feel like you're here in the X-Men world. With Legion , we're our own universe. It gives Noah the freedom to do what he wants to do. Because we play with so many different timelines, and we rebooted and not really rebooted and all that, we felt like, OK, we're going to throw it out there and hope the fans accept it.” \nIn addition to a sense of what fans should expect in terms of continuity, Shuler also confirmed that the mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels will be a part of the series. The Sentinels are villains that will fit in perfectly with what we know about Nix’s series so far, which is that it will be based on an underground movement of mutants living at a time when of great persecution and prejudice. \nThe Sentinels are classic X-Men villains that were featured in the 2014 film X-Men: Days of Future Past . The Sentinels in the film were giants that, in the future, learned to evolve to mimic the mutant abilities of those they hunted. \nMore X-MEN TV: New X-Men TV Spinoff Announced / New Legion Sunset Teaser Reveals a Pyrokinetic Love Connection / New Legion Teaser Image / New Legion Trailer / Legion In X-Men Comic Books / Who Is Legion? / Jemaine Clement Joins Legion / Legion Producers Talk X-Men And Marvel Universe Connections / How Legion Could Fix X-Men Continuity \nDonner also says that the Sentinels in Nix’s series will be different than those we’ve seen before. This makes sense, as giant CGI monsters are probably difficult to replicate on a television budget. The Sentinels in the Marvel Comics Universe weren’t always giant. The first models introduced were roughly human-sized, so it is possible the television versions will be more in line with their earliest counterparts.
