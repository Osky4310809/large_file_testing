Occasionally, though, this can backfire. Not all gorgeous compacts, tubes, or jars have quality formulas inside. However, as fans of both mermaid-inspired prints and nourishing lip treatments, we were immensely satisfied by Tarte's Quench Lip Rescues — and the brand just launched four new amazing shades. \nIn case you haven't tried this product before, each hue has a different, darling tube with different aquatic themes such as seahorses, starfish, and coral (which makes them both collectible and easy to find in an overstuffed makeup bag). Inside each is a superhydrating lip balm that leaves your pout with a subtle tint, glossy sheen, and refreshed sensation. \nFor Summer 2017, Tarte has expanded its color offerings to include coral, warm buff, clear, and (our favorite) a punchy cherry red that would look fantastic when donned poolside. See them for yourself — as well as the original four hues! — and shop them when you read on.
