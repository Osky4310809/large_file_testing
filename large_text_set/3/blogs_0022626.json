This month, those feelings are especially acute, since we’re losing Buffy the Vampire Slayer , The X-Files , and the original seasons of Arrested Development but replacing them with Mystery Science Theater and Bill Nye .\nIf you’re mid- Buffy rewatch, we regret to inform you that you only have until April 1—just over a week—to finish. The same goes for The X-Files , Firefly , The Princess Bride (which you do have time to squeeze in one more watch), all the Superman movies, Roswell , House , Angel , Arrested Development ‘s non-Netflix seasons ( according to Polygon ), and more. You could probably squeeze all of Firefly into a week. Just saying.\nOn the other hand, we’re gaining the new Mystery Science Theater 3000 on April 14 ( which just released a trailer ), Bill Nye Saves the World on April 21, Wynonna Earp season one on April 1 ( we had recaps of this one! ), The Get Down: Part 2 on April 7, Kubo and the Two Strings on April 8, The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass (seasons 1-3) on April 22, Queen of Katwe on April 25, Dear White People season one, and more. We can only hope that some of these will dull the pain of losing access to some of our most beloved series.
