We’ll have fun but as always we draw attention to social issues that are impacting the community,” he said in a press release. \nThe event was originally started by hometown favorite rapper Young Dip. During a 2014 interview with his local FOX2 Now St. Louis news station, he doubled down on the notion of unity, especially in the wake of the turmoil in Ferguson, which stemmed from unarmed teen Mike Brown being shot to death by a police officer. \nState of Emergency 4 can be streamed exclusively on REVOLT.tv and REVOLT TV, March 14th at 8:00 p.m. EST/5:00 p.m. PST. \nCheck here for REVOLT TV listings in your area.
