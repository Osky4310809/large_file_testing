If other people leapt to that conclusion without me indicating that it was, that hype is external to what we did.” Also Read: How MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Obtained President Trump's 2005 Tax Return \nThe MSNBC host found herself fielding broadside attacks from viewers and colleagues following what was supposed to be one of the biggest scoops of her career. Maddow served as a facilitator for the reporter who broke the story, David Cay Johnston, who obtained two pages from Trump’s 2005 tax return. The document showed Trump earned $150 million in 2005 and paid $38 million in income taxes that year. \nThere are still no official numbers for how many people tuned in to the program but the show is expected to have done well. \nLess than 90 minutes before her show was about to air, Maddow set off a media frenzy when she tweeted that “we’ve got Trump’s tax returns.” A later tweet clarified she only had a couple of pages from one year’s returns. \nBut even that did little to squash expectations with Maddow’s name trending on Twitter for hours. Also Read: Why Does the Leaked Donald Trump Tax Return Say 'Client Copy?' \nDespite all the hype, Maddow’s big moment got off to a rocky start. The hour-long special was slammed by viewers and media observers for not delivering the goods, with some comparing it to Geraldo Rivera’s 1986 televised event featuring the opening of Al Capone’s vault. The special ended with a stunned Rivera finding little more than trash and debris. \nMaddow drew anger from some viewers for her 20-minute introduction — a lengthy explanation of why the story was important. \n“My priority is to get the story right and put it into proper context, and explain the weight of it and why it is important,” Maddow said. \nThe fact that her big scooped was leaked before the special even aired doesn’t seem to bother her either. \n“This is a super interesting first window into his finances, and the question of his finances is a legitimate scandal,” she said. \nDespite snagging what was supposed to be a major coup, reaction to the special the following day was less than stellar. The Chicago Tribune’s headline read: “ Rachel Maddow takes conspiracy theorizing mainstream with Trump tax returns ‘scoop’ ,” while the Washington Post went with, “ Rachel Maddow’s not-so-big reveal of Trump’s tax returns .” Even MSNBC’s sister network, CNBC, did not mince words, proclaiming that “ Donald Trump just got a nice victory, thanks to, of all people, Rachel Maddow .” \n“I don’t really care,” Maddow said. “It is funny to me that a president would spend this much energy and political capital to keep secret his finances and his taxes specifically and simultaneously would want to brag about how much money he made. If that’s really what he wants the story to be, he can release all of his taxes and we can all glory in his immense wealth.” 9 People Stopped at Airports Under Trump's Travel Ban (Photos) \nOn Jan. 27, President Donald Trump signed an executive order restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. The ban is now tied up in courts, but Trump has announced plans for a new ban. \nThe first travel ban affected about 90,000 people . Here's an introduction to eight of them. \nMuhammad Ali Jr. \nLegendary boxer Muhammad Ali's son and his mother were stopped by immigration officials at the Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. \nCNN \nKhalilah Camacho-Ali was let go after showing officials a photo of her and her then-husband Muhammad Ali, but Muhammad Ali, Jr. was questioned for an hour and 45 minutes, according to the Los Angeles Times. \nWe can't say conclusively why the Alis were stopped, but the family's lawyer said that the officials kept asking Ali Jr. about his religion. (The elder Ali is pictured here with President George W. Bush, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom.) \nHameed Khalid Darweesh \nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked for over 10 years as an interpreter for the U.S government in Iraq. \nAccording the the New York Times , Darweesh was detained at JFK airport for about 19 hours before he was allowed to enter the U.S. \n“What I do for this country? They put the cuffs on,” Darweesh told the Times. \nA 5-year-old boy \nA 5-year-old boy was detained for a few hours at Washington Dulles International Airport. \nAccording to the Independent , the boy is a U.S. citizen who lives with his Iranian mother in Maryland and was traveling with another family member at the time. \n“To assume that just because of someone’s age and gender that they don’t pose a threat would be misguided and wrong,” said White House press secretary Sean Spicer. \nAreej Ali \nThe 33-year-old software developer, a green-card holder, was detained in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and again in Los Angeles. She said she was returning from her sister's wedding in Sudan. \nHer family found a lawyer who noted that the ban did not apply to people with green cards, according to the Daily Bulletin. \nFusion \nMazdak Tootkaboni and Arghavan Louhghalam \nThis husband and wife are associate professors at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and both are permanent residents of the United States, but are Iranian in nationality. \nAccording to the Guardian , the two professors were coming back from a conference in France when they were stopped at Boston's Logan airport and questioned for four hours before being released. Getty \nSidd Bikkannavar \nThe U.S.-born Muslim scientist says he was detained under President Trump’s travel ban and forced by border agents to unlock his NASA-issued phone. \nBikkannavar is an employee at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and was coming back from a trip in Patagonia when he was detained. Patagonia is a region in Argentina and Chile -- neither of which are among the countries covered by the travel ban. YouTube \nKhanon Mahindokht Azad \nAccording to the Guardian , Khanon Mahindokht Azad is a 78-year-old Iranian grandmother who visits the U.S. every now and then to see her kids -- who are U.S. citizens. \nAfter 27 hours of being detained at LAX, she was finally allowed into the country.
