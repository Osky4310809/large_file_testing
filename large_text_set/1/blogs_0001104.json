Hey, the Mannequin Challenge made it to outer space, and the Soulja Boy Challenge made it to Chrissy Teigan and John Legend’s bathroom! Now we are graced with the Demi Lovato dance challenge , but it’s not what you think.\nDemi might not actually even be aware of the viral web trend , and she’s not even the singer of the song that the dance is set to. Oh, kids these days., That would be the mega-talented 16 year-old rapper named Kandi Reign whose song about Demi Lovato has lit the fire to this trend and it’s, well, .\nHere’s Kandi’s video that started the whole phenomenon:\nRocking her signature afro puffs and face mask, Kandi and her friends break it down to her song whose lyrics are simply (but oh-so powerfully), “I feel like Demi Lovato.” Reign goes on to rap more about her goals-worthy confidence and self-love, and obviously people can’t get enough of it since now it seems everyone feels like Demi Lovato.\nLIT! @iameily and her sis @iamalexus killing my #DemiLovatoChallenge WHO NEXT?
