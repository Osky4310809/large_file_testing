Philstar.com/File photo \nMAGUINDANAO, Philippines - A jobless man on Friday chopped off his wife’s arm with a machete and hanged himself dead after the hacking frenzy in Datu Odin Sinsuat town. \nChief Inspector Achmad Alibonga of the Datu Odin Sinsuat municipal police said responding policemen tried but failed to revive the 31-year-old Landy Paulino, who hanged himself from a tree in their yard using a nylon rope. \nAlibonga said Paulino has been restive after his wife, Lenny, an overseas worker, arrived on Monday and has since been urging him persistently to account for all the money she remitted from abroad. \nTheir neighbors in Barangay Awang in Datu Odin Sinsuat said the couple repeatedly quarreled over monetary issues early on. \n“The suspect could not explain to his wife where he spent the money sent to him monthly in the past two years,” Alibonga said. \nOn Friday, Paulino arrived home so drunk, pulled out a sharp machete hidden in their kitchen and hacked the left arm of his wife.
