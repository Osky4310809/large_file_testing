The rules come into force on March 25. \nRelated: How to keep your laptop safe \n\"It's clearly a policy decision from the United States and we as an airline operating in the United States have to comply with what the government of the United States wants... Of course it's hugely disruptive but Emirates is very resilient in dealing with disruptions in our organization,\" Clark said. \nSimilar restrictions announced by the U.K . on Tuesday do not apply to Emirates or Dubai airport.
