With time set to expire he instead threw the ball to an unprepared Daxter Miles who missed badly, giving the Bulldogs a 61-58 win to advance to the Elite Eight over West Virginia. \nCarter dribbled out most of the final 37.9 seconds left in this game on his own without finding an open look or creating for a teammate. He’s just a college kid giving all he can to pull off the upset, but it came back to bite him. \nCarter finished with 21 points, a game-high, including three second-half three-point shots, but will have to remember this ugly finishing sequence all summer. \nWest Virginia’s pressure defense had finally hit Gonzaga in the second half of a close Sweet 16 game. The Bulldogs, owners of KenPom’s No. 1 spot, escaped the wrath of mid-major skepticism though, despite missing 11 free throws out of 32 attempts.\nPrzemek Karnowski was huge for Gonzaga to get back into things with 13 points on 6-of-8 shooting, better than the nine- and 10-point performances in the opening two games. He had help from Johnathan Williams’ 13 points after a tough shooting night from leading scorer Nigel-Williams Gross, who scored just 10 points on 2-of-10 shooting. Williams hit a go-ahead three with 52 seconds to go which proved the dagger.\nThe Mountaineers did what they do best, forcing a typically steady Gonzaga team into 16 turnovers, and had the Bulldogs where they wanted them despite 16-of-60 shooting all game. But extremely poor clock management and a late-game heroic fail cost West Virginia. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:39:31.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
