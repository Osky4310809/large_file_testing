I thought Jamie added something to us when he came on, both with his pressing and with his runs in behind. \n\"We've got individual players who will play better than they did. \n\"There are times when you know you're going to win the game and you maybe don't hit the levels some of the players did against Germany.\" \nDefoe's recall for a first cap since November 2013 came after injuries to Harry Kane, Daniel Sturridge and captain Wayne Rooney, and Southgate praised the 34-year-old for his input around a largely youthful squad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:20:59.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
