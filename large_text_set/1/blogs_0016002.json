(Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports) 3 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPITTSBURGH – Hands at his sides, palms facing outward and feet splayed at 45 degrees, Antonio Brown pranced through the locker room as if he’d just found the end zone. Beaming his signature smile while joking with Pittsburgh Steelers teammates after Wednesday afternoon’s practice, the all-pro receiver hardly looked like someone who’d violated his team’s inner sanctum just three days earlier. \nBut 90 minutes later – after getting a haircut that was posted to Snapchat – a contrite Brown struck a different pose in the Steelers’ media room while making his first public comments since live-streaming Pittsburgh’s victorious postgame locker room (and coach Mike Tomlin’s not-intended-for-public-consumption remarks) on Facebook Live following Sunday’s playoff win at Kansas City. \n“I absolutely regret the Facebook Live situation,” said Brown, who also posted an apology on Twitter Tuesday night. “Total distraction to the organization, total distraction to my teammates, obviously disrespect to my coach. I’ve got the utmost respect to our coach, so I totally regret that.” Ben Roethlisberger: Antonio Brown locker room incident 'water under the bridge' \nBrown, who was knocked out of last season’s playoffs after being concussed by an illegal hit from Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, also offered an explanation. \n“Just got carried in the way moment,” he said. “I live with that moment from last year of not being to play in the divisional game, not being able to make the trip with the team, so I was a little bit genuinely excited in that moment.” \nBrown would not reveal details of any punishment he faces and wouldn’t disclose his recent discussions with Tomlin or quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, calling them “top secret.” Tomlin also refused to address the incident further Wednesday. \n\"I've said all I'm going to say on that,\" Tomlin said in his news conference. Tom Brady, Bill Belichick swat down talk of Patriots' distractions \nBut Brown admitted being shaken by Tomlin’s pointed criticism to open a Tuesday news conference and observation that continued distractions can get even a player of Brown’s caliber a one-way ticket out of town. \nStill, he maintained the incident won’t give him any extra incentive to perform well in Sunday’s AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots. \n“I’m a professional,” said Brown, who leads all players with 232 receiving yards in the postseason. “It all starts with taking care of the business, and I’m excited to keep the business booming this weekend.” \nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis . \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL divisional playoff games Facebook Posted!
