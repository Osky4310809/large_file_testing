READ MORE: A day-by-day look of the fall of President Park Geun-hye \nThe question was - would they do it? Would the constitutional court judges remove a sitting president for the first time in South Korea's young democratic history? \nThey had plenty of seemingly good reasons: The overwhelming majority of public opinion in favour of impeachment; the risk of prolonged civil unrest if they restored her to power; the admission by Park's lawyers that she had passed sensitive documents to her friend, Choi Soon-sil, but only for limited advice on presentation. \nPark's lawyers had also argued, though, that the actual evidence amassed by the opposition was not sufficient for impeachment, if judged solely on its value. And she had not resigned ahead of the verdict, scotching a persistent rumour. \nSo there was still more than an element of doubt. \nBut when the ruling came it was conclusive. Park Geun-hye had abused her power, the judges unanimously agreed, by helping Choi coerce millions out of giant corporations, and allowing her undue influence over and access to state affairs. \nHer impeachment was upheld. Supporters of South Korean President Park Geun-hye weep during a rally opposing her ouster on Friday [AP] The next chapter \nAmong her supporters there was wailing, talk of resurgent communism, of national security disaster under a presumed liberal presidency to follow. And there was violence, as some tried to storm the court. Several were injured; two protesters died. \nFor the crowd that has come to represent mainstream opinion, though, this was a day to relish. Over 19 Saturday nights they'd gathered in their tens or hundreds of thousands to demand her ouster. \nTonight, as I write this from our bureau, I can hear them celebrating victory. South Korean President Park permanently dismissed from office \nAnd so presumably, and bizarrely, can Park Geun-hye. She's defied expectations that she would be immediately thrown out of the Blue House – her childhood home during her father's rule, as well as her official residence during her own. \nAn aide told reporters security arrangements around her private home had not been finalised. \nBut one thing is clear wherever she is: She is no longer president, and no longer has immunity from prosecution. \nThat is likely to be the next chapter of that extraordinary story. \nIt won't be one that I report. This was my last day as Al Jazeera's Seoul correspondent. I'm moving to the Jerusalem bureau. It was quite a way to finish. \nMy successor will have the (sometimes mixed) blessing of a near-ceaseless stream of news, and the unqualified good fortune of a fantastic cameraman and producer to help report it.
