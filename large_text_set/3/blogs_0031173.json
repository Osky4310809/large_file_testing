Losing these players will be an addition by subtraction. Can‚Äôt wait for the draft. Mar 27, 2017 8:29 AM \n‚ÄúThe Cowboys lost both starting cornerbacks in Brandon Carr and Morris Claiborne‚Äù \n>implying that‚Äôs a bad thing anonymousnevermindfishdeath says: Mar 27, 2017 8:39 AM \nSounds like the Jones‚Äôs are over confidant of their drafting skills. Elliot was a ringer, Dak wasn‚Äôt even the player they wanted. I hear Revis island is looking to relocate üòâ nnagi says: Mar 27, 2017 8:44 AM \nYou would think by now that the Cowboys would have learned to manage their cap better‚Ä¶how they never have cap space coupled with years of mediocrity is baffling 6ball says: Mar 27, 2017 8:47 AM \n. Their method is madness. Drafting a bunch of ‚Äúnot ready for prime time‚Äù rookies and throwing them to the wolves, on the big stage, in a super high expectations Dallas is insane. In today‚Äôs complex NFL it is a rarity when rookies step in a get the job done from day one. Good QBs can make life a living hell for inexperienced secondary people. . Mar 27, 2017 8:50 AM \nMaybe they plan on Romo playing on the defensive side of the ball for them. cowboyinpawleys says: Mar 27, 2017 8:52 AM \nI liked Church. I think they would have kept him but the price got too rich. Carroll is equal to Carr & Claibourne could never stay on the field. If they can execute the draft the Cowboys will be OK on Defense. gogreenbiotch says: Mar 27, 2017 8:53 AM \nI hate to say it, but the Cowboys really aren‚Äôt that far away. If any team could use a move up into the top 10 to grab a serious impact guys it‚Äôs the Cowboys. An impact player in the secondary or on the dline and if they can be healthy on defense that team will be good again. The strength of that team is in the oline and they‚Äôre not getting younger. If I was them I would go for it‚Ä¶ mikespillane337 says: Mar 27, 2017 8:54 AM \nSo plan B is draft replacements that have not played in the nfl.Good plan,just like my plan of quitting my job and hitting the lottery.Not hitting the lottery first and quitting my job. RegisHawk says: Mar 27, 2017 8:55 AM \nTranslation: We have to spend big to re-sign our offense in the upcoming years, so we need to have our defense on rookie contracts.
