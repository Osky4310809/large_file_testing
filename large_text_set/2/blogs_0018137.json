The agency announced the discovery of the planets orbiting the nearby star TRAPPIST-1 at a press conference earlier this afternoon, with details published in the science journal Nature shortly thereafter. These 7 Earth-sized planets were seen by @NASASpitzer around a nearby, ultra-cool dwarf star called TRAPPIST-1: https://t.co/G9tW3cJMnV pic.twitter.com/Z6gvaH96Tz — NASA (@NASA) February 22, 2017 \nNASA describes TRAPPIST-1 as an “ultra-cool dwarf star,” which, besides sounding like a compliment you might give to Peter Dinklage, means that it burns at a lower temperature, and therefore will last about a thousand times longer, than our sun—approximately 10 trillion years, according to Vocativ. This, plus the likelihood that all of the planets could potentially have liquid water and six of them have masses similar to that of Earth, the odds are good that some sort of life has developed in the system, or at least on one of the three most habitable planets at its center. Better odds than those of life developing in our solar system, actually. \nIf and when we do develop the technology to come visit our friends—at least, we hope they’re friends—in the TRAPPIST-1 system, we’ll encounter six planets bunched so close together that neighboring planets appear as shining orbs in the sky next to a gigantic sun, sort of like the two moons on Tatooine : NASA/JPL-Caltech Image: NASA / JPL-Caltech \nCombine that with the fact that the TRAPPIST-1 system is exactly 12 parsecs (approximately 40 light years) away, according to Nature , and it seems like Han Solo should be emerging from hyperspace bragging about a new shortcut he found by going around a black hole cluster any minute now. If not, we’ll just have to wait until NASA finishes its James Webb Space Telescope, the high-tech successor to the Hubble telescope, so it can spy on our newly discovered space neighbors. Around a nearby, cold, small star we found 7 rocky Earth-size planets, all of which could have liquid water - key to life as we know it. pic.twitter.com/C2JWjDfBdK", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:24:16.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
