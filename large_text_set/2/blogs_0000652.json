I consider myself a dog person, but I could see myself warming up to a kitty, so to hear about this 7-year old Boxer named Suzie, who loves taking care of kittens so much that she wanted her own, you have to wonder if there’s anything better in life than stories like this. \nThe answer is no. No there isn’t. 2 Instagram/suzie_and_kushi \nSuzie’s mom is Kelly Hartman, and she’s a dedicated foster mom for local shelters. She usually brings home tiny kittens in need of some love, and Suzie jumps right in to take care of them like they were her own puppies. \nShe’s a dedicated caregiver and is so incredibly gentile with them. She’s even got her own Instagram of her shenanigans with the kittens. 3 Instagram/suzie_and_kushi \nEvery time Hartman comes home with a cat carrier full of mewling, meowing kittens, Suzie’s right in there trying to comfort them and corral them. It generally takes the kittens 24 hours to get used to the big Boxer, then they’re inseparable. Even to the point that the kittens like Suzie better than their human foster mom. 4 Instagram/suzie_and_kushi \nEventually though, the kittens are adopted and have to go to their new, and forever homes. But she noticed that it would make Suzie sad, and understandably so. So after seeing how much Suzie loved and cared for a batch of kitties, she decided one of them should stay – a one-eyed cat named Kushi. \nKushi came to the Hartman home a year ago, with a severe issue. One of his eyeballs was infected and swollen due to an untreated illness. Eventually it had to be removed and while rehabbing, the kitten got along with Suzie so well that Hartman fell in love with him as well. \nWhen it came time to go back to the shelter to find a home, Hartman couldn’t bring herself to let Kushi go. 5 Instagram/suzie_and_kushi \nShe knew she’d regret it if she let this cat, who’d suffered and found healing through a loving home, go. So she adopted Kushi as a friend for Suzie and the two couldn’t have been more happy. \nAs soon as Kushi became a member of the family, he started caring for every new foster kitten that came through the home, and they cycle repeated itself. \nWhile Suzie was back to her normal self, Kushi was acting sad and withdrawn when the kittens had to go back to the shelter, so Hartman decided to adopt a new companion for him.
