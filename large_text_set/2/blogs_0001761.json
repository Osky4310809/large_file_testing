This also makes it more difficult to give passengers the right, simple options on ticket machines. \n“Working with Government, we’re determined to overhaul the system to cut out red tape, jargon and complication to make it easier for customers to buy fares they can trust, including from ticket machines.” \nLianna Etkind, public transport campaigner at the Campaign for Better Transport, welcomed plans to simplify the “horribly complicated” fares system, but called for the introduction of “long overdue” part-time season tickets. \nShe also urged rail companies to protect station staffing levels, as ticket vending machines “cannot replace trained, visible members of staff”. \nRail minister Paul Maynard said: “Rail passengers must be able to trust that they are getting the best possible deal every time they travel, and we are working closely with industry on a set of actions to improve fares and ticketing for passengers over the next 12 months. \n“The ticket-buying experience is all too often complicated and hard to navigate and I welcome this initiative. “We want a more modern and passenger-focused fares and ticketing system which takes advantage of all the benefits of new technology.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T09:57:53.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
