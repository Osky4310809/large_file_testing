Trump has put the bust of Winston Churchill back in the Oval Office. The bust was seen as the president signed some executive order after being sworn in as the 45 th president of the United States.

Trump has returned the bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office. pic.twitter.com/LmhkQvfRpt — Micah Grimes (@MicahGrimes) January 21, 2017 Obama had moved the bust to the White House residence during his first few days in office and later installed separate busts of Martin Luther King Jr. and President Lincoln in its place.\nA spokesperson for British Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed last week that Trump had personally asked if England would loan the bust of Churchill to the U.S. once he took office. \n\"The Prime Minister is happy to loan the Churchill bust to the White House and will be delighted to view it on display when she visits this Spring,\" the spokesperson said. \nWhen Obama removed the Churchill bust, he said it was not meant to take a swipe at the United Kingdom. Regardless, he’s gone. Obama is out.
