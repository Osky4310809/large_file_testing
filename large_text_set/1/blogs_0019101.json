More by Nick Vadala Arrow icon \nPhiladelphia has the largest proportion of adults who never have been married among the 10 biggest cities in the United States, according to a new study from The Pew Charitable Trusts . \nPew pulled census data from 2015 for the study, and found that nearly 52 percent of Philadelphia’s adults have never been married. In 2005, the previous census, that number stood at 43 percent, meaning that the share of never-married adults in Philadelphia has been increasing. \nBroken down by gender, 54 percent of men and 49 percent of women reported never having been married. \nDespite Philadelphia’s stand-out numbers among the 10 largest US cities when it comes to marriage, the trend of never-married adults is in line with trends seen in the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates (and populations of at least 350,000). On that list, Philadelphia comes in fourth overall for its proportion of never-married adults, behind Detroit, Baltimore, and Milwaukee, which are not among the top 10 most populous cities. \nOther cities, by comparison, had much smaller never-married populations. In San Jose, for example, 35 percent of adults reported never having been married, while 38 percent of San Antonio’s adults said the same. Nationally, the proportion of never married adults is 34 percent, according to the study.
