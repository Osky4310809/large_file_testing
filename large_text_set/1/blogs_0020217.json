But as you get ready to head down to the Capital for this historic event, it’s important to make sure that you’re fully prepared. Organizers estimate that as many as 200,000 people will participate. Considering the crowds, you don’t want to get held up at a security checkpoint or get stuck in an endless line to buy your Metro card. So consult the guidelines on the Women’s March website , and keep checking the weather forecast. As of now, it’s expected to be 55 degrees the day of the march. There’s a 10 percent chance of rain, with high humidity predicted (this is after all, D.C.) Below, everything you need to pack—as well as what you aren’t allowed to bring. \nBags You may not bring a backpack in unless it is translucent, uncolored, and no larger than 17x12x6 inches. So unless you have a really niche backpack that fits these constraints, opt for a small tote or cross-body bag. All bags, including purses, cannot exceed 8x6x4 inches in size. All bags and backpacks will be subject to random search, and each marcher is permitted only one such bag. Any medical supplies that you may need, including breast pumps, must fit inside your bag. Marchers can also bring one clear plastic 12x12x6-inch bag for a meal. You should be sure to pack food of some form for the day. As per the above, if you are arriving in the morning and staying the night, make sure that you have time to drop off any luggage beforehand. If you are flying, be sure, too, to bring a small carry-on instead of checking a suitcase. Public transportation is likely to be clogged everywhere, and it will be easier to navigate without an unwieldy item. If you are traveling by bus, you may be able to leave items on board, but this is not guaranteed. \nOuterwear Bring a winter jacket. The forecast may be mild but you will likely be outside for a very long stretch of time. Make sure your jacket is waterproof and has a hood, in case of rain. It should also have numerous, decent-sized pockets, considering the bag limitations. Ideally, bring a jacket that you can tie around your waist in case you get too hot. \nClothing Dress in layers. A light fleece, exercise shirt, sturdy leggings, and a good pair of socks should do the trick. Bring an extra pair of socks with you if possible. \nFootwear Wear good running shoes or hiking boots—just make sure that whatever pair you choose is well broken-in. Consider wearing insoles as well. \nAccessories Pack a light hat, scarf, and gloves. A bandana is also always good to have on hand. \nLarger Items If you are bringing a child, you are allowed to bring a stroller, but smaller ones are recommended. Items such as canes are allowed. Flags and signs are of course also allowed, but flag poles, and wooden posts for signs, are not. Once you get inside the rally area or march route, you cannot bring in bikes or folding chairs. \nOther Be sure to pack multiple portable phone chargers, water, cash, your ID, Band-Aids, and sunscreen. If you can, try to arrive with a Metro card. Optional items include change for payphones, ChapStick, sunglasses, and hand-warmers. Finally, if you care, bring toilet tissue and hand sanitizer for the porta-potties. You’ll most likely be glad that you did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T04:40:05.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
