Close Stellar Timelapse Captures Sun Setting Over Wellington Shores UP NEXT VIDEO Stellar Timelapse Captures Sun Setting Over Wellington Shores \nThe Economist Intelligence Unit's Worldwide Cost of Living Survey covered 150 cities, with Wellington climbing 26 places since last year's survey and Auckland 22 places. \nThey now rank equal with Shanghai, China's most expensive city, and just behind Sydney and Melbourne in 14th and 15th respectively. \n\"The rise of Australian and New Zealand cities up the ranking is to be expected, given that both countries' currencies have appreciated in value in the last year or so,\" survey editor Jon Copestake said. \n\"This movement is in sync with a number of other Asian cities, which have come to dominate at the top of the ranking.\" \nAuckland and Wellington's dramatic jump up the rankings was behind only Brazil's Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which jumped 29 and 27 rankings each. \nWhile Brisbane and Adelaide also climbed higher up the list, Aussie rankings are still lower than five years ago when Sydney and Melbourne were among the world's top 10 most expensive cities. \nSingapore heads the list for fourth year running, while Hong Kong and Zurich were the second and third most expensive cities. Auckland and Wellington are swiftly becoming more and more expensive places to live.
