Advertisement - story continues below \n“Was there a flash of light, did you hear the explosion?” asked CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D’Agata. \n“It was a loud blast,” said Zebari. “I fell down on my side.” \n“I knew what it was because seconds earlier the soldiers started shouting, ‘drone, drone, drone,'” he continued.

That’s the point about going in there,” he said. What do you think? Comment below and share. Scroll down to comment below.
