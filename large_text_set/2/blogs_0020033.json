Kim's Birkin collection can't be beat. The one North painted is so special. The West's Christmas decoration game is on point. I wouldn't mind decking my house out like hers next year.\" Kendall says Kim is one of the smartest people she knows (Photo: Splash News) \nThe sweet comments will no doubt cheer the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star up as she has had a rough six months, having been robbed at gunpoint in Paris last October. \nThe mother-of-two opened up about her ordeal on the family's E! reality show and her mother Kris Jenner feels that was \"very therapeutic\" for the star. \nShe said: \"When we started filming again and getting up and running, you know obviously Kim was around because we all practically live together on the street. And we started filming and what was coming out of that was very therapeutic for her, I think. To just explain to us and walk us through. \n\"She just thinks that it might bring some awareness. You know, it's changed the way we live our lives and just the way we take care of our kids and our grandchildren. So it's been a process. I locked all the doors and changed the locks cause I'm afraid.\" Kim has had a tough time lately (Photo: GC Images) \nKris finds it \"upsetting\" to watch the footage back and admits she wants to cry whenever she thinks about what happened to her daughter. \nShe added: \"I was watching it and I was balling - balling when I saw it. \n\"And I just saw some of it. I couldn't even watch the whole thing it was so upsetting. It was such an upsetting time and something so awful happened to somebody you love so much. And it's just like it chokes me up every time to think about it. \n\"No one can get through the first few minutes without getting hysterical. Like, I get choked up just thinking about it and talking about it. But its remarkable to listen to her tell the story and she does that ... moment by moment.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:59:56.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
