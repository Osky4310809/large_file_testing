Count us in. #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/B6mhFiUx1T \n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 8, 2017 \nIf you’ve ever played any version of the tabletop game, Settlers of Catan , you know how addictive (not to mention rift-causing) it can be. Apparently, Kristen Bell and husband, Dax Shepard are no strangers to Catan , and are really hardcore about their game nights.\nWhile being interviewed on the Golden Globes red carpet, Bell and Shepard revealed that, rather than going to any of the myriad after-parties last night, their big evening plans involved onesies and Settlers of Catan , which sounds like the perfect evening to me (especially if you were to add wine). What was hilarious is that, at first, the Golden Globes interviewers looked like they thought the couple was kidding. When it was clear they weren’t, it’s like they didn’t even know what to do. Like, how do you not go to the Golden Globes after-parties? Very easily when you have someone you love with whom you can also play Settlers of Catan .\n“If anybody knew what was up, they’d all be going to play a game night as well,” says Bell, speaking nothing but truth. The couple then becomes the textbook example of “adorkable” when competing to describe what the game is like to the interviewers who are amazed that such pretty people in designer clothes can, in fact, be this deliciously geeky. Then again, we’ve seen them be adorkable a bunch of times before this, like the time they filmed a music video for Toto’s “Africa” while actually on vacation in Africa last year:\n\nTrue to their word, Bell and Shepard were back at home not long after the Golden Globes playing Settlers of Catan , though they apparently couldn’t wait to get onesies on before starting to play. But they did post a photo to Instagram as promised:\nLet the after party begin. @daxshepard @goldenglobes @settelersofcatan #GoldenGlobes #settelersofcatan \nA photo posted by kristen bell (@kristenanniebell) on Jan 8, 2017 at 8:21pm PST \n\nAnd lest you think these two are posers who were just geeking it up for the cameras (PS – no one actually does that), check out this Catan -related post from a week ago, when they celebrated Shepard’s birthday “the only way [they] know how”:\nCelebrating @daxshepard ‘s birthday the only way we know how. Trying to once and for all figure out if it’s wheat, corn or the illusive pineapple. #catan \nA photo posted by kristen bell (@kristenanniebell) on Jan 2, 2017 at 3:39pm PST \n\nGod, I love these two. Bless them and their nerdy love.\n(via The Daily Dot , image via screencap)\nWant more stories like this?
