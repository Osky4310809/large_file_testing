Not only has the president-elect struggled to find a single (genuine) celebrity to perform, but also a growing number of Democratic congresspeople are declaring they will not show up at his swearing in on Jan. 20.\nFollowing Trump's harsh words on Saturday about Representative John Lewis of Georgia, Democrats from across the country are taking the symbolic step of refusing to attend.\nThe president-elect accused the civil rights icon of being \"all talk and no action or results\" after Lewis criticized Trump on NBC and said he would be skipping the inauguration.\nSEE ALSO: People are fuming over Donald Trump's comments about John Lewis\nPolitico reported that as of Saturday afternoon at least 16 House Democrats have publicly stated they will not go to the inauguration. There are 194 Democrats in the house, but the boycott movement appears to be growing as the politicians share on Twitter their passionate reasons for not attending.\nPosting a picture of Lewis alongside Martin Luther King Jr., Mark Takano of California said he could not attend.\n\"All talk, no action.\"\nI stand with @repjohnlewis and I will not be attending the inauguration. pic.twitter.com/z8Q0wA9OPK\n— Mark Takano (@RepMarkTakano) January 14, 2017\nHe was joined by Yvette Clarke of New York, Judy Chu of California, Nydia Velazquez of New York, Mark DeSaulnier of California and Ted Lieu of California, who all shared their decisions on social media. Lieu said in a statement that Trump has attacked \"Gold Star parents, veterans such as John McCain and now civil rights icon John Lewis.\"\n\"For me, the personal decision not to attend Inauguration is quite simple: Do I stand with Donald Trump, or do I stand with John Lewis? I am standing with John Lewis.\"\nI will NOT attend the inauguration of @realDonaldTrump . When you insult @repjohnlewis , you insult America.\n— Yvette D. Clarke (@RepYvetteClarke) January 14, 2017\nAfter much thought, I have decided to #StandWithJohnLewis and not attend the inauguration.\n— Judy Chu (@RepJudyChu) January 15, 2017\n. @repjohnlewis is a national hero and I stand with him! I also am not attending inauguration given the tone of @realDonaldTrump 's campaign\n— Rep. Nydia Velazquez (@NydiaVelazquez) January 14, 2017\nIt is with a heavy heart and deep personal conviction that I have decided not to attend the #TrumpInauguration on January 20, 2017.\n— Mark DeSaulnier (@RepDeSaulnier) January 14, 2017\nMr. Lieu's statement on why he won't be attending the Inauguration of @realDonaldTrump READ HERE: https://t.co/tx94zqE4rp\n— Rep.
