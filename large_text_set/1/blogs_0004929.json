The government has thrown a lot of people into the labour market just as the entire business community at the border town will also be affected by this singular act.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:29:23.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
