De Pecol flawlessly outscored a Michigan woman in the female Guinness World record category, who journeyed the whole world in three years and three months. \nAside from making social media drool over her overly begrudged angles of Instagram photos showing picturesque sites of each country, De Pecol, who hails from Connecticut, traveled with a hearty mission as an ambassador for International Institute of Peace Through Tourism. She met and dialogued with mayors and ministers and promoted her organizations via “peace through sustainable tourism.” READ: US woman set to be ‘fastest person to travel all 196 countries’ \nLikewise, as part and parcel of her “ Expedition 196, ” she stored water samples from each country for the Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation. \nWith over 255 flights and five passports stashed with colorful stamps, De Pecol juggled from two to five days in each country. “I personally love finding new, inspiring things, places, culture, environments in countries around the world that are in need of tourism,” De Pecol told Forbes . Funding and visa applications were also an obstacle to her lifetime odyssey, as De Pecol saved up to $10,000 (P500,000) from working odd jobs and acquired $198,000 (P9.9 million) from sponsors. \nTo spare herself from mountainous accommodation fees, De Pecol used social media platforms to promote her eco-hostels to let her in without charge.

Also, the culture is very unique, the landscapes are beautiful, the food is delicious and the music is some of my favorite in the world.” Today, De Pecol is preparing to visit the seventh continent, Antarctica, and soon after, she will release a documentary and book about her amazing travels.
