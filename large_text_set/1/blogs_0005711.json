Lego’s new robotics kit lets you get building for a lot less money.\nJust a month late for your geeky Holiday gift-giving needs they’ve unveiled Lego Boost . It offers a good deal of the Mindstorms experience at a fraction of the cost. Lego Boost will hit store shelves with an MSRP of just $160.\nThat’s a pretty sweet deal given what you (and your kids, provided you have any and you’re willing to let them play with your new high-tech bricks) can create with them. Pay no mind to the 7-12 age recommendation on the box… all good geeks know that’s just a guideline.\nA few of the possibilities Lego pitches are a functional 3D printer, a brick-built homage to Johnny 5, a playable electronic guitar, a playful little kitty robot, and even a tiny factory that actually builds little Lego models .\nThe Boost box, complete with choking warning… because science is always more fun when there’s danger involved!\nSo what’s inside the box? The most important part is the Move Hub, which packs motors, sensors, a light, and Bluetooth LE connectivity to make your creations come alive. Lego also throws in a color and depth sensor, an encoded motor, and more than 800 other pieces so you can build to your heart’s content.\nYou can’t build an amazing robot without amazing software. Lego’s not new to this sort of thing, so they’ve had the foresight to provide a slick, Scratch-like interface that lets you create complex code with drag-and-drop ease.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:36:02.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
