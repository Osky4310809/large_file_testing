They have to come clean about it,” the NDP leader said Friday.\nOn Thursday, WikiLeaks released three CIA tasking orders detailing their plan to closely monitor 2012 French presidential candidates, including current President Francois Hollande and current first-round frontrunner Marine Le Pen.\nCanada is listed along with New Zealand, Great Britain, the United States and Australia in a section indicating which countries are assisting with the “HUMINT” or human intelligence aspects of the operation. Those countries make up the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance.\nMultiple government departments declined to answer questions regarding what role Canada played in the CIA operation.\nDepartment of National Defence senior communications adviser Ashley Lemire told the National Post: “The Government of Canada does not comment on leaked documents.” The Communications Security Establishment of Canada and Public Safety Canada sent similar statements by email.\nRelated United States asked Canada to help spy on candidates during 2012 French election: WikiLeaks The documents detail information the CIA wanted, including private strategies of the candidates, as well as information on potential schisms and alliances between key players within the parties.\nIn 2013, documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that Canada had spied on Brazil’s government in an attempt to get information related to mining and energy — two areas in which Canadian and Brazilian companies often compete. The incident caused diplomatic strife between Canada and Brazil, with Mulcair saying at the time it gave Canada “a black eye in the world.”\nMulcair pointed to the 2013 Brazil example on Friday, highlighting that since that alleged spying based on leaked documents turned out to be true, these leaked documents should also be taken seriously.\n“Canadians don’t expect their government to spy on our closest allies, especially when it involves their own domestic elections. There’s nothing more sensitive than that, as we’re observing right now with the allegations in the U.S. election,” said Mulcair.\nThe documents contain only a single reference to Canada, making it unclear what parts of the CIA efforts Canada may have been involved in.\n“Without further documents, there’s no evidence of impropriety, but there also isn’t any evidence of a lack of impropriety,“ said Christopher Parsons, a researcher focusing on privacy and surveillance at the University of Toronto’s Citizen lab.\nParsons says the fact that Canada was listed under the human intelligence section means the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) was likely involved. He says it’s possible CSIS was sent the report but didn’t participate in any activity.\nCSIS did not reply to multiple requests for comment.\nWith files from Marie-Danielle Smith, National Post \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:27:41.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
