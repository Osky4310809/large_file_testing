Republican Senators and FCC members say it's unnecessary and harmful to ISPs. \nInternet service providers could have an easier time selling their customers' data thanks to a Senate vote on Thursday that overturns a Federal Communications Commission rule requiring ISPs to get permission before selling consumer browsing history and other data. \nThe Senate voted along party lines to repeal the rule, with 50 Republicans voting yes and 48 Democrats rejecting the measure, Reuters reports . It was unclear when the measure will be up for a vote in the House of Representatives, although President Donald Trump is likely to sign it if it's successful there. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was overturning a regulation that \"makes the internet an uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition, innovation, and infrastructure investment,\" according to Reuters. The Internet and Television Association, a trade group made up of Comcast and many other ISPs, also hailed the vote. \nThe move comes after the FCC, now headed by Trump-appointed chairman Ajit Pai, blocked a rule put in place by the previous administration that would requires ISPs to obtain opt-in consent before sharing sensitive data like Social Security numbers, geolocation, health information, and web browsing history. Pai announced earlier this month that the FCC would stay the implementation of the new rule, describing it as \"not consistent\" with the privacy framework of the Federal Trade Commission. \nIn a joint statement following Thursday's Senate vote, FCC commissioner Mignon Clyburn and FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeney, both Democrats, condemned the legislation.
