They came out against any plan by Trump to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and warned that it could ratchet up tensions with the Arab world.\n“It is very important for us all to refrain from unilateral actions,” EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said. “We hope that there can be reflection on consequences of any move that is taken,” she said.\nAlthough Trump had made similar statements about NATO during his election campaign, his recent comments still came as a bit of a surprise since his choice for defense secretary, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, stressed his support for the NATO military alliance in his U.S. congressional confirmation hearing last week.\nTrump’s views, in an interview published Monday with German daily Bild and The Times of London, contradict Mattis, Steinmeier said.\n“If one compares the positions of the designated president and the future foreign and defense ministers, then one can’t discern a common foreign policy line among the new U.S. government,” he said.\nThere have even been fears the U.S. military commitment to Europe would wane under Trump. A German newspaper group reports that Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite has urged Trump to continue meeting the U.S.’s financial obligations toward the alliance.\n“Since World War II, the presence of U.S. troops has been a prerequisite for rebuilding the continent, safeguarding peace and ensuring security,” she told the RND network of some 30 German papers.\n“We expect continuity from the new U.S. administration. Trump must maintain this leadership role, to ensure security, stability and peace,” she was Quote: d as saying.\nTrump indicated he was indifferent to whether the EU stays together or not, a sharp break from the Obama administration, which encouraged British people to vote to remain in the EU in the June referendum.\n“I believe others will leave ... I do think keeping it together is not gonna be as easy as a lot of people think,” Trump said in the interview.\nThe British exit from the EU would “end up being a great thing,” he said.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it’s “very good news that the United States of America wants to do a good free trade deal with us and wants to do it very fast.”\nTrump was less kind to German industry officials, saying car manufacturers including BMW could face tariffs of up to 35 percent if they set up plants in Mexico instead of in the U.S. and try to export the cars to the U.S.\nSuch tariffs would make the American auto industry “worse, weaker and more expensive,” Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s economy minister, told Bild.\nGabriel suggested Europeans should exhibit more self-confidence in dealing with Trump. “We’re not weak and inferior,” he said.\nWhatever his goal, Trump’s comments were strong enough to make him the talk of the town in European capitals.\n“It is clear that we are discussing this issue all the time,” Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek said at the EU meeting in Brussels.\n___\nGrieshaber reported from Berlin.
