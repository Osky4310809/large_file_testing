Because he o, who wouldn’t want to see them all dolled up, holding hands and just being generally adorable? It’s fine though. Perry and Orlando attended the Vanity Fair Oscar party on Sunday night and were clearly the cutest couple there.\nBecause that’s just what happens when they’re together in a room full of other humans . At the star-studded party, they took a sweet photo together, which makes their lack of red carpet appearances totally OKAY. Katy rocked a sparkly bronze Jean Paul Gaultier gown, along with Lorraine Schwartz and Ofira jewelry and Jimmy Choo shoes. Bloom wore a dapper black tux, because well, duh. \nDave M. Benett/VF17/WireImage/Getty Images Perry arrived at the event with her friend w riter Derek Blasberg, and they happily took photos together on the carpet. \nAnd we don’t blame them — they both looked super glam. \nDavid Livingston/Getty Images The party was full of huge stars and fun times, at least according to the pictures we saw. Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Mahershala Ali, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Jason Statham, and James Corden are just some of the big names who attended the party.\nWhen you don’t have a reason/an invitation to the actual award ceremony, the next best thing is clearly an invitation to one of the glamorous after-parties.\nPerry posted this hilarious pic after a night of fun: A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Feb 27, 2017 at 12:01pm PST \n“Last night was wild!” she wrote. “Even I woke up with an #Oscar! (harharharhar)”\nTBH, the parties seem like they were way more fun than actually sitting through over three hours of awards and speeches. But then again, we’re suckers for drinks and party food (and Oscar the Grouch figurines).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:15:19.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
