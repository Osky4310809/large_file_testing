This is still “Grey’s Anatomy,” meaning pretty much anything can happen. \nBut the actor who plays Alex — aka 46-year-old Justin Chambers — said something that sounds pretty darn hopeful to Alex and Meredith shippers in a recent Entertainment Tonight interview from PaleyFest.

I think friends can become lovers like that, that’s possible too. \nYES! Yes, that is the exactly the kind of answer I want to hear. Thank you, Alex! Giphy \nBut then, he went on to say, \nI’m very comfortable with them being platonic — like brother and sister, and friends. I think that suits them better. \nNo, that is less of the answer I want to hear. \nGood thing he went on even further to say, \nBut hey, who knows? Nobody knows how things go, you know? I was friends with my wife before we started dating. \nOK, OK, that’s better! Friends first is a very solid way to start a relationship! \nUnfortunately, he went on still further to say, \nThey have been friends a long time though. Alex and [Meredith] have come up together and I don’t know, [it’d be] a little weird, but anything is possible. \nSo, ignoring all that dumb brother and sister stuff he said, it at least sounds like it could be a very real possibility that the great ship Merlex will finally leave the dock! ABC \nApparently (unfortunately), Chambers is actually rooting for his character and Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington) to get back together. \nChambers said, \nI’m excited to see what happens with him and Jolex. I think they really love each other. I know they have a lot of obstacles to go through, but it will be interesting to see what conflicts, fires they can put out. Merlex and then Jolex, we’ll see what happens. \nOK, whatever Alex. I’ll just keep Merlex as endgame in my heart. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
