Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States despite a series of scandals, controversies, and protests against his administration. But, as they say, the show must go on. The menu for the inauguration luncheon, which will be attended by Trump, his family, and associates after the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, will include Maine lobster, chocolate soufflé, and multiple California wine pairings. “The inaugural luncheon provides an opportunity for members of both parties to come together and, in the same spirit of all our Inaugural events, show the world how uniquely American we are in our peaceful transfer of power,” Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., chairman of the Congressional Inaugural Committee, said in a statement. The full menu includes Maine lobster and gulf shrimp served with saffron sauce and peanut crumble; Angus beef with dark chocolate and juniper jus; and chocolate soufflé with cherry vanilla ice cream. The wines were specifically created by California vintners to complement the flavors of the meal, but Trump will not be partaking in the wine and Champagne pairings as he is a teetotaler.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:07:08.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
