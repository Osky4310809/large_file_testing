Don't forget @TheDemocrats effort to incite violence at Trump rallies https://t.co/uTBFGhI0Kh\n— Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) ID: 10614718 Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader, said, “That is an absurd and obscene statement.”\nThe Anti-Defamation League also questioned Trump’s reported remarks.\n“We are astonished by what the President reportedly said. It is incumbent upon the White House to immediately clarify these remarks. In light of the ongoing attacks on the Jewish community, it is also incumbent upon the President to lay out in his speech tonight his plans for what the federal government will do to address this rash of anti-Semitic incidents,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of ADL, said in a statement.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Scaramucci/status/836608285562269696", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/836608285562269696", "https://t.co/uTBFGhI0Kh"], "published": "2017-03-01T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:13:09.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
