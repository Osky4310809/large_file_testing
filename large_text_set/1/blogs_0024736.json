The event starts at 7 p.m. ET and can be seen on a number of cable providers, but the WWE is also giving fans a chance to watch Royal Rumble live online without having to pay at all (a link to the streaming video can be found below).\nAs always, there are plenty of rumors surrounding Royal Rumble and the potential surprises. The WWE finds a way to sneak a few surprise entrants into the 30-man battle, and Forbes speculate that recent Hall of Fame inductee Kurt Angle could be one this year.\n“Angle is arguably the biggest available free agent who hasn’t recently wrestled for WWE, and of all the countless former WWE stars out there, there is no one who would make a more substantial impact than Angle would upon his return to the ring. He has revealed that he signed a contract that will take him through WrestleMania 33, opening up the possibility of an in-ring return during that span.”\nThere is plenty of other speculation about possible entrants, from some other recent WWE superstars who have moved on to new ventures all the way to an unlikely former WWE participant — now President Donald Trump.\nAnd there are already some hints from the WWE that this year’s Royal Rumble could have a surprise winner.\n“Although I could easily pick names like The Undertaker, Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, Braun Strowman, Randy Orton and Dean Ambrose, I’m going off the beaten path a little here,” Philly.com writer Vaughn Johnson noted. “Triple H said in a recent interview that the outcome of the match would be one that no one expects, which tells me none of the names I just mentioned will be the last man standing.”\nFans who watch Royal Rumble 2017 live online will see more than just the main event. There will also be a WWE championship match between AJ Styles and John Cena and a WWE Universal title match between Roman Reigns and Kevin Owens.\nWWE Royal Rumble 2017: Best Finishes For Roman Reigns Vs. Kevin Owens https://t.co/CfpGzhRuMV \n— Kwyatt Invest Group (@KwyattIG) January 29, 2017 \nAnd there will also be a WWE Raw Women’s championship between Charlotte and up-and-comer Bayley.\nEverything I'm not, made me everything I am. #RoyalRumble @WWE pic.twitter.com/h5mM6OHN4i \n— Bayley (@itsBayleyWWE) January 28, 2017 \nJohnson predicted that this match could be one of the most interesting ones of the night, with the WWE unlikely to strip the title away from Charlotte but still giving some kind of storyline to Bayley, who appears on her way to stardom.\n“The match should be good, but I don’t see Charlotte losing the title just yet. I also don’t see her flat-out beating Bayley, so I’m thinking that the champion will find some nefarious means to retain,” he wrote.\nThere will be plenty of ways to watch Royal Rumble live online through the WWE Network. The app is available through phones and tablets as well as Playstation 3 and 4 and Xbox One and 360. Viewers can also watch the WWE Network through Tivo, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, and Apple TV 3 and 4.\nBut here’s the best part — those who want to watch Royal Rumble 2017 live online through the WWE Network will get to see it for free.
