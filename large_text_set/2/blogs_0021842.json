They say that if you voted for Donald Trump, you’re a threat to the university community,” read the remarks. “But the real threat is silencing the First Amendment rights of people with whom you disagree.” \nShe added that the Department of Education should not control students’ decisions more than they do themselves, per the remarks, saying she wants students, parents, and communities to be in power. \nMs. DeVos is one of several speakers in the Trump administration to address the conference’s annual meeting.
