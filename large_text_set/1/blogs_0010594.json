Ayer received a letter from Washington Republican Rep. Dave Reichert Wednesday asking him to review the painting that was a winner of the Congressional Art Competition from the district of Missouri Democratic Rep. Lacy Clay. \nReichert noted the painting violated competition guidelines by showing “subjects of contemporary political controversy or a sensationalistic or gruesome nature,” which is not allowed. \nThe painting, “Untitled #1” created by St. Louis high school student David Pulphus, shows police as pigs shooting at protesters in a black St. Louis neighborhood. \nAccording to a spokeswoman for Reichert, “The Speaker’s office has informed Congressman Reichert that the Architect of the Capitol has reviewed Congressman Reichert’s letter and made the determination that the painting is in violation of the House Building Commission’s rules and will be removed Tuesday after the federal holiday.” \n“The Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity to celebrate the creativity of students in every corner of our country – and visitors from around the world see their talents on display when they walk through the halls of our Capitol,” said Rep. Reichert in a statement. “However, with any competition there are rules, and these rules exist for a reason. This painting hung in clear defiance to those rules and was a slap in the face to the countless men and women who put their lives on the line everyday on behalf of our safety and freedom.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:56:20.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
