I was so down, being away from home for so long and all I wanted was one of his cuddles. \n\"This surprise was more than I could have ever asked for. Completely in shock and over whelmed to finally see him again after so long. \n\"I absolutely adore this boy with everything I have in me. I'll never be able to put it into words. I love you so much. Hardest thing was saying bye again.\" Leigh-Anne in action (Photo: Getty Images) Gray during his day job (Photo: REUTERS) \nIt isn't the first time the pair have cooed over each other at a music event during their nine month whirlwind romance- after Gray supported Leigh-Anne at the Brit Awards. \nThe Clarets hit man celebrated Little Mix picking up their awards along with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who is going out with Perrie Edwards. \nGray is in his debut Premier League season - but is closing in on double figures after netting eight times in 23 appearances.
