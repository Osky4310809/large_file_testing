Ever. \nThat was back in 2015 during an under 20s clash between Wests Tigers and Penrith. Martin was leading the former while a younger Cleary was making his NYC debut for the latter. He was 17 years old. \nMartin can’t recall the specifics of that day, only that his Tigers scraped home with the win. \nCleary can remember the occasion a little better. \n“That was my 20s debut actually,” Cleary tells foxsports.com.au . \n“He (Martin) got me a beauty.” Nathan Cleary with the ball at Penrith Panthers training.   \nA two-year age gap meant Martin and Cleary never squared up in their junior grades. \nThat one NYC game was the only time they laid eyes on each other until Martin arrived for pre-season training at Penrith a couple of months later. \nAnd while that fateful day is mostly fuzzy in Martin’s memory, he remembers the first impression he had of that unknown Panthers debutant. \n“I can’t remember what the score was but I remember playing against him,” Martin said of Cleary. \n“He was a gun back then too. He’s always been good.” \nOn Saturday night the young halves will finally get the chance to play alongside each other. \nCleary and Martin will line up at halfback and five-eighth respectively when Penrith takes on Parramatta in a trial at Pepper Stadium. Te Maire Martin in action during a recent trial game at Belmore Oval. Pic Jenny Evans   \nFate has kept them apart for too long. Martin played just six games in his rookie season before a shoulder injury cruelled his 2016 campaign. \nCleary replaced his mate in the side, but even when veteran Jamie Soward left the club mid-season the young halves couldn’t get a gig together. \nInstead, coach Anthony Griffin threw Bryce Cartwright in to form a combination with Cleary. \nIt’s been a long wait. \n“It will be exciting, finally getting to play alongside each other,” Martin said. \n“He leads the team around quite well which makes my job easier, and I sort of chill out on the edge and ask for the ball when I want it.” \nCleary admits while the pair have spent plenty of time together over the past 12 months, there’s no telling how the partnership will transfer to the field. \n“I think the first trial and the first few weeks might be a bit rusty, just trying to polish things,” Cleary conceded. \n“At training it works pretty well ... he works his magic with his running game, I try to direct the team a bit more and let him and Moyza (Matt Moylan) get the space they need.” \nCleary has never been afraid to punch above his weight. \nHe was 17 years old when he made his 20s debut, and just 18 when he was thrown into the NRL side last year. \nYou wouldn’t know it watching him on the footy field. Ask anyone at Penrith and you’ll hear of the teenager with the head of a 30-year-old. \n“Nath is really good for a young bloke. He directs the blokes around well,” veteran hooker Peter Wallace told foxsports.com.au . Nathan Cleary talks to Matt Moylan.   \nCleary and Martin have played just 21 top grade games between them. They’ll be the least experienced halves pairing in the NRL come round one. \nThe advantage is having Wallace and Moylan — both with Origin and international experience — completing the spine at hooker and fullback respectively. \nWallace is confident the spine will gel soon enough. \n“We’ve got a real good understanding between the three of us who played last year, and T’s (Martin) come in and getting better and better,” Wallace said. \n“Things are clicking well.” \nWhich is scary considering how well Penrith went last year with a makeshift playmaking combo. \nTheir first choice should be a beauty. \nyou live in Queensland?
