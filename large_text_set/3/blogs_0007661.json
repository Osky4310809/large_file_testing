Get   ISIS Responds to Donald Trump ‘Muslim Ban’ Executive Order [PHOTOS] Published Updated 11:56 am EST, January 28, 2017 91 Comments By Heavy Terror Watch 30.4k Share Tweet Follow President Donald Trump banned nationals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the United States on Friday. The Islamic State responded with anti-U.S. propaganda. The new ban would be for the next 90 days and coincides with a pause in the the admission of all refugees to the United States for the next four months. The order also calls for a review of the suspension of the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows travelers from 38 countries to re-new travel authorizations without an in-person interview. The full executive order is titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States.\" The entire text can be read here on the official White House website. Above is one the examples of response by ISIS, which shows a boy giving the \"ISIS salute,\" also known as the \"tahwid.\" According to Foreign Affairs: \"When ISIS militants hold up a single index finger on their right hands, they are alluding to the tawhid, the belief in the oneness of God and a key component of the Muslim religion… But for ISIS, the symbol is more sinister than a mere declaration of monotheistic beliefs. As Salafi jihadists, members of the group adhere to a fundamentalist interpretation of tawhid that rejects non-fundamentalist regimes as idolatrous. In other words, the concept of tawhid is central to ISIS’ violent and uncompromising posture toward its opponents, both in the Middle East and in the West.\" Heavy is an independent news organization.
