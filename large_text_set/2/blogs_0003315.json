Gorsuch, 49, comes with an Ivy-league pedigree — he attended Columbia, Harvard and Oxford — and a conservative track record as federal appeals court judge. He is also a former clerk to two Supreme Court justices: Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, who would be his new colleague on the High Court.\nHere are four cases that illustrate Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy:\nContraceptive mandate\nGorsuch, in a pair of well-known cases, sided with Hobby Lobby’s and Little Sisters of the Poor’s argument that their faith made it impossible to comply with the Affordable Care Act’s requirement to provide health insurance that covers contraceptives.\nHobby Lobby’s owners argued the mandate forced them to do something that was against their deeply held religious convictions.\nGorsuch agreed: “As the Greens explain their complaint, the ACA’s mandate requires them to violate their religious faith by forcing them to lend an impermissible degree of assistance to conduct their religion teaches to be gravely wrong,” he wrote in a concurring opinion.\nThe 10 th Circuit 5-3 ruling was later backed up by the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision. The case is considered to be among the highest profile challenges of the ACA.\nAdministrative law\nWhile lower in profile than rulings on abortion, gun rights or First Amendment challenges, Gorsuch has — in the view of some legal experts — hinted at a major shift on how courts approach administrative law.\nRight now, the Supreme Court has held that courts should defer to a government agency’s interpretation of a law unless such a view is unreasonable. Gorsuch has said the world would be just fine without this concept , known as Chevron deference .\n“ There’s an elephant in the room with us today. We have studiously attempted to work our way around it and even left it unremarked. But the fact is Chevron and Brand X permit executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers’ design,” he wrote in a concurring opinion in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch.\nReligion in public places\nIn a biting dissenting opinion, Gorsuch contends that a three judge panel erred in ruling that memorial crosses erected alongside public roads in Utah amount to a “government’s endorsement of Christianity.”\n“So it is that we must now apparently account for the speed at which our observer likely travels and how much attention he tends to pay to what he sees. We can’t be sure he will even bother to stop and look at a monument before having us declare the state policy permitting it unconstitutional,” Gorsuch wrote in American Atheists Inc. v. Davenport. He disputed the the notion that the crosses were unconstitutional, in part, because a reasonable observer might not be able to see the names on them as they sped past.\nGorsuch, in this case and others, argues relying on standard of whether a reasonable person would conclude that government is endorsing a religion leads to too many instances of finding a problem when one isn’t there.\nInternet sales tax\nGorsuch concurred with a unanimous three judge panel late last summer that upheld a Colorado law requiring retailers who do not have a physical presence in the state to notify their customers what they owe in taxes.\n“If anything, by asking us to strike down Colorado’s law, out-of-state mail order and internet retailers don’t seek comparable treatment to their in-state brick-and-mortar rivals, they seek more favorable treatment, a competitive advantage, a sort of judicially sponsored arbitrage opportunity or ‘tax shelter,’” Gorsuch wrote in a concurring opinion in Direct Marketing Association, Inc. v. Brohl.\nThe case centers on a 1992 Supreme Court ruling, which barred states from requiring online retailers to charge sales tax. In the intervening years, the amount of money states lose in revenue from customers — many who have no idea that they owe anything —has only increased. Congress is considering competing bills on the subject.", "external_links": ["https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/chevron_deference", "http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/01/potential-nominee-profile-neil-gorsuch/"], "published": "2017-01-31T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:33:18.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
