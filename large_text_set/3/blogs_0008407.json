And when youth restiveness is addressed in this manner, it will bring about the much desired improvement in crude production which invariably will in turn enhance foreign exchange revenues accruing to the Federal Government of Nigeria.” \nOther demands by HOSTCOM, include the approval of licenses and permit to deploy latest technology in collaboration with foreign technical partners in the areas of effective and optimal gas utilization, gas flare elimination, waste to zero and other green and renewable alternatives. \nThe group also called on the Federal Government to grant approval for the construction of massive crude and petroleum products storage facilities, averaging 500,000 metric tonnes, in at least five states of the oil and gas producing communities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T10:25:57.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
