We now know that Nebula (Karen Gillan), returns from the first film, alongside a new golden villain called Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki).\nThe scary Ayesha is seen in the clip sitting atop a throne, promising to “cleanse the universe” of weaknesses like fear, jealousy, and betrayal.\nThat’s not all. Another big reveal comes towards the end of the clip, when Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) gets a surprise visit from an older man (played by Kurt Russell) — who is actually Peter’s long-lost dad.\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 stars Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, Elizabeth Debicki, Kurt Russell and more, and hits theaters on May 5. Watch the new trailer above.\nIn other news, Microsoft announces a $10 per month Netflix-style games pass for the Xbox One.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T11:31:57.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
