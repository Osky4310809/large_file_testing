Barton holds his head after his altercation with Rhead \nBarton was involved in a flash point during the second half with Rhead, which provoked widespread criticism on social media. \nWith Lincoln preparing to take a corner, Barton made a nuisance of himself as he attempted to mark Rhead. The midfielder appeared to tread on the Lincoln man's foot, however, Rhead brushed it off and didn't react. The Burnley midfielder (left) clashes with Lincoln City's Nathan Arnold \nBarton then continued to harass Rhead and seemed to deliberately run into his arm from behind before falling to the ground holding his face like he had been struck by the visiting player. \nA clearly frustrated Barton then clashed with Lincoln midfielder, Terry Hawkridge, as the game edged towards full time and received a yellow card for the incident after appearing to slap Hawkridge in the face. \nThe Burnley midfielder took to Twitter after the match to explain his antics. Wasn't trying to get the Big Man sent off. It was my job to front screen and disrupt him. Was trying to get back in front of him. (1) — Joseph Barton (@Joey7Barton) February 18, 2017 Tried to duck under his arm and he moved it back and hit me on the head. Contact is part of the game, no problem with that. (2) — Joseph Barton (@Joey7Barton) February 18, 2017 Unlike their player saying he was kicked on the floor and also the one who jumped and held his face as if he'd been struck. (3) — Joseph Barton (@Joey7Barton) February 18, 2017 \nBarton's conduct didn't dampen the spirits of the 3,210 travelling Lincoln supporters. whose focus now shifts to Sunday's quarter-final draw.
