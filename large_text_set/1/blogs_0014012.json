Nearly 100 inmates died in riots earlier this month in prisons in the states of Amazonas and Roraima. \nThe violence inside Alcacuz jail began on Saturday afternoon, when members of one of the powerful criminal organisations present in most Brazilian jails attacked rivals in a separate wing. \n\"We could see the heads ripped off'' three of the killed prisoners, said Zemilton Silva, coordinator of the prison system. 'Many have died' \nExplosions and gunshots could be heard from outside. \nMajor Wellington Camilo, commander of the Rio Grande do Norte state prison system, said police would wait until the morning to enter the compound. \n\"Many people have died. But we simply cannot get into the prison now,\" he said. \nNo prisoners had escaped, he added. \nDozens of relatives have gathered outside, waiting for information. \nRiots are not uncommon in Brazil's overcrowded jails, which are largely controlled by powerful criminal gangs. \nBut the scale of the violence this year has put pressure on President Michel Temer to address the problem. \nAfter the Amazonas prison riot, the government announced plans to build five more high security jails and to create new intelligence units to try to curb the power of the gangs behind bars.
