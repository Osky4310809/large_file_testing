Sadly, for many people, they are no more than farm animals who are used for our benefit – for milk and for meat. Little do those people suspect what incredible animals cows really are when they have the opportunity to show their true character. When living in good conditions, feeling safe, and surrounded by love, cows turn out to be pretty much like … giant dogs. They love playtime, running around with their four-legged friends, and getting as many pets and belly rubs as possible! \nEsperanza the sweet cow in this video is a great example of exactly that. After long years spent in dairy industry, she was rescued by Santuario Igualdad Interespecie , a rescue and sanctuary in Santiago, Chile, whose mission is to save animals from all kinds of exploitation. \nSince her arrival at the sanctuary, Esperanza’s caretakers have done everything to show her that she is loved, safe, and that nothing like what she had experienced before will ever happen to her again. Needless to say, she gets all the attention and pets she wants, not only from her caretakers but from her new animal friends as well! This is truly the proper life for a cow. \nClick here to visit Santuario Igualdad Interespecie’s website. You can support the sanctuary by making a donation . Want to read more posts like this?
