Grandmother married to British man for 27 years is deported from UK \n“Her husband John - my brother - is seriously ill and Irene is his sole caretaker. Without her to look after him, we’re all worried for him, and to rip apart a family after 30 years of happiness seems so unfair.” \nShe added: “Her whole life is here in Britain. It would be heartbreaking for us all to see her go.” \nA Home Office spokesman told the BBC: \"All applications for leave to remain in the UK are considered on their individual merits and in line with the immigration rules. \n\"We expect those with no legal right to remain in the country to leave.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:34:50.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
