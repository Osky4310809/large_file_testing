Isioma Osubor \nThe above schools are the cream, but she has settled for the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), reputed to be the best in the world for engineering studies. It is acknowledged that getting admission into MIT to study engineering is a feat that is usually the preserve of persons with exceptional academic brilliance. \nExceptional academic brilliance \nReports indicate that it is seldom that Africans find placements into MIT, but that this year, only two Africans scaled the hurdle of exceptional academic brilliance to be found worthy of placement in that institution, and our own little Miss Isioma Osubor is one of them. \nWhile Isy was in year nine, she enrolled for SSAT examinations and attained the full scores. Subsequently Cranbrook Schools in USA identified and offered her both admission and scholarship to complete her secondary education. \nBesides being an all ‘A’ student, and the highlight of gaining outstanding university admissions, other icing on the cake for Isy includes the obtaining of SAT full score as well as full scores in Mathematics and Chemistry SAT single subjects. She also holds a Gold Medal in UK Mathletics Maths competition. Before 17 years, she was College Resident Adviser, Co-chair of the Model United Nation, Chairperson of the Maths Association, and member of the Cranbrook basketball Team. \nHowever, despite the above high academic achievements, she needs sponsorship to enable her to fulfill her dream of attending MIT and becoming an engineer so that she can make a contribution – according to her, in “making the world a better place”. \nMr. Osubor, her father, given his present circumstance as a retiree is using this medium to appeal to Nigerian philanthropists, and in particular the able governor of Delta State, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa to assist with her fees currently estimated at $67,000 per year. \nIsioma Osubor’s dream to leave the world a better place must not be allowed to die for lack of money to attend MIT. Helping her out will confirm us indeed as a country of “Good People, Great Nation”. \nMr. Abiandu, a journalist, sent in this report from Asaba.
