As fans across the country celebrate the outcome of the win, the alt-right has gone ahead and termed the victory a triumph of the “White race.” \n“The Karl Marx of the Alt Right” and co-editor of AltRight.com, Richard Spencer took to Twitter to hail the Patriots’ win just as he has, in the past, used Nazi-inspired language to “ Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!” at an Alt-Right conference in November last year. \nThe Sunday win was so close to the president of the National Policy Institute — a white supremacist think tank — that he went on a Twitter rampage calling out all who were ridiculing the Patriots during the initial part of the game in Houston, Texas, and praising Brady and coach Bill Belichick ’s performance as the team made a spectacular comeback after being down 28-3 late in the third quarter. \n“A Patriots victory is a victory for the #AltRight,” tweeted Spencer, while posting images of President Donald Trump, who had said the Patriots would win by eight points against “the other team” as he spoke with Bill O’Reilly in an interview aired on FOX before the game’s coverage. \nWhen a Twitter user pointed out to Spencer that Brady’s own wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen is an immigrant who hails from Brazil, the alt-right leader, very matter-of-factly, stated that she is a “white Brazilian,” pushing his white supremacist beliefs forward. \nSpencer also posted a number of other tweets along the same lines, including a picture of Brady in front of his locker in the dressing room, which revealed a red “Make America Great Again” cap, a signature Trump campaign item. \nHere are some other racially-charged tweets that were posted or re-tweeted by Spencer in wake of the Patriot’s win: Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:15:07.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
