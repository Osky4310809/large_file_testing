The two had spent the weekend watching basketball, having pizza and going to church. Then, she went missing. \nKing said the next time he saw her, she was being sexually assaulted on Facebook live while 40 people watched, until a teenager had finally alerted him to what was happening.

She’s pulled toward the bed,” King told the Chicago Tribune . “There were adults who saw this. None of them had the wherewithal to say, ‘Hey, I gotta call someone.'” \nThe girl’s mother, Stacey Elkins, filed a police report on Sunday when she’d gone missing. \nChicago-based activist Andrew Holmes ultimately took the video to the police station, where her mother was shown screenshots and identified her daughter as the girl in the video. \nElkins told WLS the look on her daughter’s face was “just pure fear.” \nThe girl was finally spotted by police on Tuesday morning at 7:45 am, then taken to the hospital and reunited with her mother. Her cheeks were puffy, and her lip was busted, according to King. Twitter \nFacebook told the Tribune that if someone had reported the video earlier, it would have been taken down faster. \n“Live video on Facebook is a new and growing format. We’ve learned a lot over the past few months and will continue to make improvements to this experience wherever we can,” the company said in a statement. \nKing believes the girl’s attackers are a part of a group of “thugs” called the “beam team,” who have previously terrorized this particular neighborhood. He said his “life’s mission” now is to stop these kids from doing the same thing to someone else’s child. \nHe added, “As a society we have to ask ourselves, how did it get to the point where young men feel like it’s a badge of honor to sexually assault a girl … to not only do this to a girl, but broadcast it for the world?” A Way Out: Helping Domestic Violence Victims Reclaim Their Lives [INSIGHTS] To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
