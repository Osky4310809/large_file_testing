True stories of mothers' love that reaches beyond life and death \nThere is no denying that mothers have profound connections with their children, connections that go deeper, perhaps, than our current understanding. Sometimes this can extend into the realm of the psychic and even transcend the boundary between life and death. Here are some true stories of a mother's care told by the sons and daughters who experienced them. And the final story is of my own mother's message from beyond, which I received in 2012. \nMOTHER'S WORRIED CALL \nIt was January, 2000. My mother had died in December, 1999. I had been living with a man for about two months. We checked into a cheap motel . He left for a job at around 9:50 p.m., leaving me alone for awhile. \ncontinue reading below our video Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time Back then, you had to pay up to $30 to have your phone in the room turned on. There was no way we could afford it. \nCome 10 p.m., the motel phone rang. I looked at it and was scared. I answered it on the second ring. \"Hello?\" I said. \nI heard lots of static. The voice on the other line said, \"Hello?\" It sounded just like my mother! \nAgain I said \"Hello?\" \n\"Hello?\" the voice repeated in a worried voice. I clearly recognized my mother's voice when she was worried. She said hello again, and the static became worse. Her voice faded out, still saying \"Hello.\" But it was the worry in her voice that got to me. I was in trouble emotionally. \"MOM!\" I yelled! Finally the static became so bad I could not hear her anymore. \nI hung up the phone, then picked it up a minute later. The dial tone came back clear as a bell. Two seconds later, the phone went dead. I truly believe that was my mom. She was trying to communicate with me. She was one heck of a mother. -- Jenny \nMOTHER'S GHOST VISITS BABY \nThis story took place in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 1925. My mother was 13 years old at the time. She lived with her sister and her mother. Her married (other) sister, after giving birth to her first child, developed a serious infection, which required her to remain in the hospital for treatment. The baby was being cared for by my grandmother and my mother and aunt. \nOne evening, my aunt and grandmother went to the hospital to visit my aunt; my mother stayed at home to care for the baby. It was a warm and still September night with no wind or bad weather. The baby was sleeping and my mother was doing her homework. \nSuddenly, the window, which was open, began to rattle strongly and the baby began crying uncontrollably. My mother tore pieces of paper from her notebook and packed them between the window and the window frame in an effort to stop the banging. There was no wind that could have caused this. She then held the baby and tried everything possible to calm him, to no avail. \nShe looked at the clock and it was 9:45 p.m. When my aunt and grandmother got home, the next door neighbor said that she received a phone call from the hospital for my grandmother (my grandmother didn't have a phone in her home). My grandmother called the hospital and was told that my aunt had died shortly after my grandmother and aunt had left from their visit. The time of her death was 9:45 p.m. \nDid my aunt stop to visit her baby after she died? We'll never know, but this story really did happen. - Chris \nMOTHER'S FINAL MESSAGE \nThis took place in Columbus, Ohio. One day in May, I came into work and a friend, knowing I had an interest in \"spooky stories\", pulled me aside to tell me what had happened to her during the time she had just been on leave, handling her mother's funeral arrangements. \nMy friend Celia and her daughter Doris had gone back to her recently deceased mother's apartment to get the clothes and shoes for the funeral home to dress the lady for her viewing. Her mother had just purchased a very pretty, deep purple dress, and Celia decided to choose that to take to the funeral home. However, she couldn't find any matching shoes. \nCelia called her sister, very upset that she and her daughter had gone through the whole place, knowing the shoes were there, and couldn't find them. They finally decided to just use the shoes their mother had when she entered the hospital: flat, dark tan shoes. \nCelia and Doris gathered the clothing and were ready to leave when Doris received a text message. Celia asked who it was from. Doris sent a text back asking who it was, since she didn't recognize the number. Then she brought the phone over to her mother to see the message: \n\"The shoes weren't in the closet. Don't worry. I will borrow some from a friend.\" \nThere was never any reply to the \"Who is this?\" response Doris sent. And then Celia realized that the last four digits of the phone number the message came from were 0525 -- the date of Doris's birthday: May 25. -- Karen \nNext page: Mom's Saving Voice, and more.
