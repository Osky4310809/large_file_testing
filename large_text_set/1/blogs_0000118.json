All Rams assistants have been told they are free to seek other employment @nflnetwork \n— Michael Silver (@MikeSilver) January 2, 2017 \nThe presumption here is that the new Rams coach will bring in an entirely new staff — so there is no guarantee that any of the coaches will have a job waiting for them next season. \nIt would be surprising to see the Rams get rid of Fassel considering the special teams unit has been so dominant. \nMike Waufle has also done a fantastic job with Aaron Donald and the Rams defensive line. Aaron Donald had what could be his last position group meeting with Rams DL coach Mike Waufle today. \"A little heart to heart conversation.\" \n— Jack Wang (@thejackwang) January 2, 2017 \nMeanwhile, you’d have to assume Fassel was given the interim coaching gig because he was one of the coaches that the organization planned to keep with the team. \nOffensive coordinator Rob Boras and defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, however, are almost certainly not coming back for next season.
