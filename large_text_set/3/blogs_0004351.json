One year after their wedding, Joe Manganiello wrote Sofia Vergara a book for their anniversary, and it sounds like the most amazing gift ever. That’s right, not only are Joe and Sofia two of the hottest celebs in TV and movies, they’re also basically the cutest couple ever. The pair began dating in the summer of 2014 , and they tied the knot November 21st, 2015. So when their first anniversary rolled around , Joe had to do something super special.\nJoe Manganiello wrote Sofia Vergara a 40-page book celebrating their love story. Dimitrios Kambouris / Getty Joe told Cosmopolitan UK ,\n“ I wrote her a book as a gift for our first anniversary. It was about how we met, as well as our courting, and was about 40 pages long…I love my wife a lot.” \nClearly, he loves her a lot because that book must have taken some serious time to write. But when we see how in love these two are, we totally understand that Joe wouldn’t do anything less for Sofia.\nTheir romance started as a perfect love story, so it’s natural Joe would want to write it down. Ethan Miller / Getty Just look at the way Joe looks at his stunning wife. Joe explained that when he heard Sofia was single, having recently split from Nick Loeb, he immediately grabbed onto his chance. He got in touch with one of Sofia’s Modern Family co-stars to make this love story happen.\nHe explained , “I got her number from Jesse Tyler Ferguson, then flew to New Orleans to take her on a date.”\nDan MacMedan / Getty That’s right, he flew across the country for their first date. SWOON! We’re so happy that this magical, happy beginning led to such a fabulous couple. And we can’t wait to see what their next romantic chapter brings!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:49:54.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
