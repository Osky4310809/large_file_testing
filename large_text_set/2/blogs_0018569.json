Temple Run 2: Top 10 Tips and Cheats You Need to Know Published Updated 1:50 pm EST, April 17, 2015 1,346 Comments By Elton Jones 21.8k Share Tweet Follow \nThose infinite runner games are a big hit these days in the mobile gaming space. Everywhere you look, you’ll spot someone on the train/bus having a good ol’ time with some type of mobile game. The one game you’ll probably catch folks playing a lot is Temple Run 2 . We know some of you gamers out there can’t get enough of this fast-paced running game, so we’re going to make sure you do your best while you’re playing it 24/7. These are the top 10 tips/cheats that you’ll need to know for Temple Run 2 . 1. Get Yourself Some Free Coins Before You Start Running \nBefore you even start running into the wilderness of Temple Run 2 , make sure you nab some free coins first. To do that, head into to the in-game app store and select “Get Free Stuff.” Now its time to get your social media connection on! “Like” the game on Facebook, follow it on Twitter and you’ll end up nabbing 250 extra free coins. Another bit of free in-game goodies that you’ll make sure you wanna grab is a free gem. All you have to do to nab that gem is to just do the whole Facebook like thing. Congrats on getting some coins and a free gem before you even started playing! 2. Take to The Air Before As Soon As You See Cliff Hangers \nCliff Hangers can be literal heart stoppers. It’s never unusual for someone to totally freak out as soon as they see these tough-to-navigate looking areas. Stay calm as soon as you see one safe that’s completely absent and one side that’s still intact. Here’s a good tip – when you spot a cliff hanger, jump. While you’re still in the air, lean towards the safe side of the cliff hanger you’re currently dealing with. During some of the faster stage runs, your reaction time to Cliff Hangers won’t be on point as much. Just go ahead and jump to the safe side instead of running into them. Save yourself the frustration. 3. Place A High Priority on Improving The Right Upgrades \nThose upgrades are what’s going to be the difference between getting a super high score or a saddening final score. Once you’re at the upgrade menu, make sure to spruce up your coin upgrades first. Secondly, you should pay attention to the score multiplier increases and pickup spawns upgrades. Getting these upgrades to a higher level will aid you in getting more coins, higher scores and those all-too-helpful power up’s during the tougher stages. If you’re one of these folks that wants to keep your eyes on the trail, make sure you throw a lot of points into the coin magnet ability. The shield duration and boost distance upgrades aren’t super integral to your stage completion, but try and give them some attention anyway. 4. Just Keep Your Mine Cart Tilted If You Want To Win \nThose underground cart portions of the game are some of the more interesting parts of this sequel. While they may be fun, they’re also pretty hard to master. Do like us and just keep the cart tilted to the right direction if you wanna have a higher success rate. It might sound crazy, but this method works better than just getting ready to tilt as soon as you feel like the time is right. While you’re in the cart, try and aim for the gems that are easier to obtain. Those hard-to-reach gems are hard to reach for a reason. Once you get good enough at these mine cart sections, then go on ahead and pick up those hard-to-reach gems. Just keep your eyes peeled for those sudden forks on the track and those entirely missing tracks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:24:58.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
