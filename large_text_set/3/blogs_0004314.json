The Volvo S90/V90 (172 points), Citroën C3 (166 points), Toyota C-HR (165 points) and the Nissan Micra (135 points) completed the list of ECOTY nominees. \nA total of 31 vehicles were nominated for the 2017 European Car of The Year award, with seven finalists selected before a panel of 58 jurors cast their deciding votes. The Peugeot 3008 SUV takes on the mantle from the Vauxhall/Opel Astra, winner of the 2016 ECOTY award. Recent ECOTY winners also include the VW Passat (2015), Peugeot 308 (2014) and VW Golf (2013). \nWhere Malaysian interest for the second-generation Peugeot 3008 is concerned, the SUV is slated for arrival on our shores in the second quarter of this year – very soon, then. As before, petrol is the way to go with the French marque’s SUV, with a 1.6 litre THP and six-speed automatic transmission pairing expected. \nPricing for the 3008 is yet to be confirmed, however it can be expected to move upwards from the RM158,888 commanded by the facelifted, previous 3008 SUV . Even if it does turn out to be more expensive than before, the 3008 SUV will bring sharper looks inside and out compared to its predecessor, with the latter being notably more premium in appearance than before. \nThe driver gets a high-resolution, 12.3-inch screen as the instrument cluster, while an eight-inch touchscreen on the centre console takes care of infotainment duties. Meanwhile, although Malaysian specification is still yet to be known, available equipment for the 3008 includes a panoramic sunroof and a hands-free tailgate, with a 10-speaker Focal Premium sound system and a Driver Sport Pack optionally available. \nGALLERY: Peugeot 3008", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:28:47.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
