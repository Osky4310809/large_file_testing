If there is a disagreement, he goes to his mother’s apartment in Brooklyn.” \n“Both [his and her] families are hoping they will reconcile,” the Post also reported. \nAnthony Weiner, whose sexting was first exposed in 2011 by Andrew Breitbart, was exposed again in 2013 for more sexual conversations. \nWeiner was also caught last August for sending a photo of himself in his underwear to a woman with his child sleeping beside him in the photo. \nFor that, Abedin announced she was going to separate from her husband. \nAllegations also surfaced last year that Weiner may have been having an online relationship with a 15-year-old girl. \nFinally, the emails referenced in James Comey’s letter to Congress in late October that may have changed the outcome of the election were found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:21:13.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
