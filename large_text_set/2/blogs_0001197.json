She proved as much tonight during an appearance on “Hardball with Chris Matthews”, when she demonstrated just what “alternative facts” really are. \nOn hand to discuss Presidential Power, Conway was naturally called upon to defend Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban against citizens of several majority-Muslim nations. Conway did so by reminding viewers of an earlier, devastating terror attack in Bowling Green, Kentucky committed by two citizens of one of the countries covered by the ban. \nThe only problem? The attack never actually happened.

Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered.” \nAs it happens, that was brand new information to people, since, as we said, no such attack ever happened. Cue Twitter, which had a field day mocking both Conway, and the fictitious “Bowling Green massacre.” \n“Thank you, @KellyannePolls for reminding us about the famous Bowling Green Massacre, which occurred on February 30th at 13:00,” said “Adam Ruins Everything” writer Mike Drucker. \n“Who taught Kellyanne Conway history,” asked TV writer Aaron Fullerton. “Betsy DeVos?” \nSee some of the more hilarious tweets below.
