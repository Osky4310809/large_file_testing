I want you to watch this video:\nIf you have been a devoted reader of my Buddhism pieces, you have already seen this, so don't give the punchline away to the rest of the class.\nMost all of you seeing this naively -- not aware of what is going to happen -- will have seen the little basketball exercise, and very few of you will have seen the moonwalking bear. Hell, I know what is happening and without consciously doing the Zen thing I still get sucked in. The point is that perception is altered by our thinking. One of the goals of Buddhist meditation is to make us aware of this -- not stop it, because we can't, that's the way we're built, but to be aware of it.\nThe furor about the Trump presidency has gotten to the point that people are literally (and I don't mean figuratively literally, I mean literally literally) seeing and hearing things that aren't there, just as in the video.\nThe truly glaring example this week was the succession of articles about Trump \"lying\" about a terrorist attack in Sweden. It's been widely reported, even on the one paragon of truth in American politics, PJ Media.\nThere's only one problem.\nIt didn't happen.\nOddly, to most of the press, that doesn't even seem to matter.\nLet's go to the tape: Here are Trump's actual words at the Florida appearance.\nHere's the actual transcript :\nYou look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.\nTrump didn't say anything about a terror attack in Sweden .\nHe mentioned \"last night,\" referring to a report on Tucker Carlson's show the night before, but all he actually said about Sweden? \"They're having problems.\"\nNow, let's look at what was reported:\n\" Donald Trump made up Swedish terror attack based on Fox News story \"\nHere's a Quote: from the story:\nFormer Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt tweeted: ‘Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound.’\nHere's Huffing Post:\n\" Donald Trump Appears To Make Up Sweden Terror Attack \"\nAnd amusingly, their subtitle:\n\"It didn't happen .\"\nAnd lead paragraph:\nPresident Donald Trump falsely suggested at a Florida rally Saturday that Sweden had suffered a terror attack the previous night.\nThen life got even funnier, as HBO and the Daily Beast unintentionally played the old kids' game \"Telephone\": John Oliver aired a segment mocking what he thought he heard Trump say, and the Beast wrote up what they heard Oliver say:\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/20/trump-trance-media-sure-it-heard-sweden-comment-trump-never-said/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/a0QcrR5dTOo", "http://metro.co.uk/2017/02/20/donald-trump-made-up-swedish-terror-attack-based-on-fox-news-story-6459840/#ixzz4ZG908jD1%0A", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KB_lTKZm1Ts", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-sweden-terror-lie_us_58a8f397e4b045cd34c263d3", "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/national/read-full-transcript-trump-rally-speech-florida/DeDCpoNEKLQmWcIKndWB0M/"], "published": "2017-02-21T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:26:34.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
