The official also left open the option of appealing to a federal district court, without involving the Supreme Court. \nAccording to NBC News, the administration has been working on a new executive order since several days before the Thursday decision by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, upholding a federal district judge’s restraining order on the travel ban. \nTrump’s executive order banning US entry for refugees and others from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days has been protested nationwide for weeks. It has also enjoyed support in some polls, though often only by a plurality. \nVia RT .
