You might think that some budget-conscious travellers would welcome the arrival of the new no-frills designation, which offers the lowest fares but strips away flyers’ ability to select their seats, bring full-size carry-on bags onto the plane and earn elite qualifying miles. They might, except basic economy doesn’t actually bring lower fares than the ones already available. Ben Schlappig was the first to note this on his popular \"One Mile at a Time\" blog. Mr Schlappig looked at fares on a Minneapolis-Denver route before and after the introduction of basic economy. (On February 22nd United began offering basic economy only between its seven American hubs and Minneapolis; other routes in the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean will follow.) Prior to the rollout, he found that standard economy fares on this route started at $173. When the “new” fares became available, the basic economy seats began at $173. The old-style standard economy fare, meanwhile, had increased by $20. “United claims that this new option provides a ‘lower-fare option’ than before,” Mr Schlappig wrote. “But that’s simply not true.” At first, a United spokesman told Gulliver that the similarities between the old economy and the new basic economy prices was probably just down to chance. “Whether they look similar to what the other prices were, I’m not sure,” he said. “It’s not like we just moved one category down.” He couldn’t comment on United’s specific pricing mechanisms, but added, “It definitely could be a coincidence.” That seemed a stretch. The fares were exactly the same for all Minneapolis-Denver flights on that day, and Mr Schlappig found that “this is true across various markets”. But then Gulliver got another call from United, this time from Scott Wilson, the carrier’s vice president for e-commerce and merchandising, who cleared everything up. Sort of. Mr Wilson says that legacy airlines such as United have been scrambling to stem the flow of price-conscious flyers to ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines. These operators offer the most basic service for the lowest fares. The solution the legacy airlines settled on was basic economy, sometimes derided as “last class”. Delta began testing basic economy as far back as 2012 and refined the concept in 2015. Last year American Airlines and United both announced thay they would be following suit. But before the airlines finalised their basic economy offerings, they still had to compete with the ultra-low-cost carriers. And so they quickly cut their fares. “What airlines can’t do as quickly,” Mr Wilson says, “is adjust the product they associate with those fares.” That, he says, is what is now happening: United is cutting its services on the new basic economy to match the already-slashed fares. To airline executives, this is only natural—after all, Spirit and Frontier already offer reduced services in exchange for their lower prices. Still, it feels to many like a bait-and-switch. Mr Wilson says that Mr Schlappig misread United’s stated intention, which was never to make basic economy cheaper than economy already was. “He’s correct in calling out that it’s the same price, but he’s incorrect in saying that we ever said that basic economy would be lower than the currently available price points,” Explains Mr Wilson. “We very consciously never said that we were going to introduce lower prices.” The trouble is that United seemed happy to let that ambiguity go unchallenged. The airline’s press release this week, which announced the rollout of basic economy, featured the sub-heading “New product will provide a lower-fare option with most of the same inflight services and amenities that are available with standard Economy.” It’s not unreasonable to read “lower-fare” and think that the fare will be, well, lower. Airlines can’t legally discuss their pricing strategies with one another, but it is likely that United's last-class competitors are doing exactly same thing, says Mr Wilson, matching ultra-low-cost carriers’ pricing first, then their product second. Flyers, meanwhile, have been taught a valuable lesson: when it comes to airlines, best always to read between the lines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:00:26.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
