that is behind the Trump dossier is linked to a secret campaign aimed at undermining the Magnitsky Act, a law that places sanctions on Russian criminals and is vehemently opposed by the Kremlin, The Daily Caller can report. \nThe main proponent of that law, a London-based American businessman named Bill Browder, tells TheDC that Glenn Simpson, the head of Fusion GPS, the company behind the Trump dossier, is a “professional smear campaigner.” \nAccording to Browder, Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, is working with a former Russian counterintelligence officer named Rinat Akhmetshin to destroy the Magnitsky Act, which is named after Browder’s late lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, and was signed into law in Dec. 2012. \n“Glenn Simpson knowingly spread false information on behalf of people connected to the Russian government to try to protect Russian torturers and murderers from consequences,” Browder alleged in a phone interview with TheDC on Friday. \n“Glenn Simpson’s job was to knowingly and dishonestly change the narrative of how Sergei Magnitsky came to die from murder to natural causes, and to change the narrative that Sergei Magnitsky was a criminal and not a whistleblower,” said Browder. Bill Browder.Getty Images/ AFP/ Bertrand Guay \nSimpson and Fusion GPS were linked to the anti-Magnitsky effort last month. Politico reported then that Fusion GPS acknowledged that it was hired by the law firm BakerHostetler to dig up dirt on Browder. BakerHostetler was in turn working on behalf of Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman who has had $14 million in company assets frozen under the Magnitsky Act. \nIn his book “The Red Notice,” Browder writes that Magnitsky was tortured for months in a Russian prison in order to elicit a false confession that he and Browder were engaged in fraud. The lawyer died on Nov. 16, 2009 after being beaten by Russian guards in his prison cell. \nSoon after his friend’s murder, Browder began lobbying American lawmakers — Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin and Arizona Sen. John McCain, in particular — to pass a law that would provide a mechanism to punish Kremlin-linked Russian criminals. The effort paid off in Dec. 2012 when President Obama signed the Magnitsky Act into law. \nSimpson’s work to undermine a bill opposed by the Kremlin adds another layer of mystery to the Trump dossier story. The 35-page document, which was published by BuzzFeed on Tuesday, includes unverified information alleging that Russian intelligence officials have blackmail material on Trump. \nThe author of the dossier was identified on Wednesday as former MI6 officer Christopher Steele. Steele, who operates a private intelligence firm based in London, reportedly paid Russian contacts to provide information about Trump. \nAs The New York Times reported, a major Republican donor hired Fusion GPS in Sept. 2015 to dig up dirt on Trump. But as Trump ascended to the GOP nomination, the donor backed away from the project and Fusion GPS found a Hillary Clinton supporter to continue the project. \nFusion hired Steele seven months ago, The Times reported. The former spy eventually shared his dossier with the FBI and the British government. Meanwhile, Fusion GPS appears to have shopped the dossier around the Washington D.C.-based reporters around the election. \nPolitico appears to have referenced the dossier in its report last month, stating that Fusion “also discussed information with journalists about Trump and his associates’ ties to Russia.” A BBC reporter also reported this week that he was provided the dossier by the firm just before the election. Russian President Putin attends his annual end-of-year news conference in Moscow REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \nBrowder has accused Simpson, Akhmetshin, BakerHostetler and others of failing to register as lobbyists under the Lobbying Disclosure Act and the Foreign Agents Registration Act. He also says that the lobbying disclosures that have been filed are incomplete and misleading. \nHe lodged a complaint with the Justice Department on the matter in July. \nThe complaint notes that Akhmetshin and Katsyv earlier this year created a Delaware-based non-profit called The Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF). Browder alleges that the organization serves as a front to surreptitiously lobby against the Magnitsky Act. \nAkhmetshin and HRAGIF have filed lobbying disclosure reports with Congress. But the disclosure forms state that Akhmetshin was lobbying for “foreign adoption reinstatement.” \nAdoption cases are linked to the Magnitsky Act because of Putin’s response to passage of the law. The autocrat, a former KGB officer, enacted a ban against American citizens adopting Russian children. \nThought adoption was the reason that Akhmetshin and others gave for their lobbying work, Politico provided independent confirmation that the Magnitsky Act was the true focus of the campaign. \nThe website reported that a lawyer for BakerHostetler briefed congressional staff on a repeal of the Magnitsky Act. In another article , Politico reported that in May, Akhmetshin visited the offices of California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican who at times has defended Putin and the Kremlin. Akhmetshin’s visit came a day before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs was set to consider a bill that would expand the Magnitsky Act on a global scale. \nAkhmetshin acknowledged to Politico then that he is a former Russian counterintelligence officer. The ex-spy did not respond to TheDC’s request for comment for this article. \nNot much is known about Akhmetshin, who was affiliated with GRU, Russia’s main intelligence directorate. A longtime Washington, D.C. lobbyist, he was accused in a 2015 lawsuit of hacking into the computers of International Mineral Resources. The company at the time was involved in a $1 billion lawsuit with EuroChem Volga-Kaliy, a Russian fertilizer company. \nAs for Simpson, Browder alleged in his DOJ complaint that the reporter’s anti-Magnitsky push involved digging into his deep network of journalistic contacts. \nIn his DOJ filing, Browder claimed that four journalists with the Financial Times, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal all confirmed “that Glenn Simpson has been hired by Prevezon to lobby for the anti-Magnitsky Campaign.” \nTheDC was unable to independently verify that Simpson contacted the reporters on the issue. \nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the status of Browder’s complaint. Fusion GPS did not respond to requests for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:05:29.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
