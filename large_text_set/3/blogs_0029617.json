We focused on Itsekiri culture in the first two editions but have decided to expand the scope to reflect the sociological reality of Warri as a melting pot of people from different parts of Nigeria, hence our chosen theme, ‘Culture for peace and unity. \n“Our objective is to utilise the cultural festival to unite the various ethnic groups residing in Warri, which is a microcosm of Nigeria, thereby engendering an atmosphere of peace which is a prerequisite for economic and social progress. A peaceful and prosperous Warri will be beneficial to all, including the residents, Delta State and, indeed, Nigeria.” \nTagged ‘Warri World Cultural Festival,’ the event is slated for three days and will feature regatta/floats and cultural performances by representatives of the various ethnic groups residing in Warri, as well as a Miss Culture Beauty Pageant, where participants will be assessed on their culinary and cultural abilities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:07:26.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
