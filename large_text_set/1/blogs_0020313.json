I was concentrating on the players I could use.” \nThe justification was clear – even though Dejan Lovren and Matip have paired up well in the heart of defence this season, it would have been a risk to rush the former Schalke man back into the side. \nYet the exact same was done for right back Nathaniel Clyne, who returned after missing games against Manchester United and Plymouth, although it was unclear how long he had been training for in preparation for the Swansea game. \nUpon closer inspection, Klopp’s team selection suggested he was concerned with how his side would match up – picking a conservative midfield trio of Jordan Henderson, Emre Can and Georgino Wijnaldum. \nThat meant Adam Lallana started in the front line, removing him as a key creative cog in the middle of the park. \nFrom midfield, the England international has scored seven goals and assisted six, from everywhere else on the field he has contributed to just one goal. Always take the position info with a pinch of salt, but why would you play Lallana anywhere other than midfield based on this? pic.twitter.com/K84wxfXVhf — Andrew Beasley (@BassTunedToRed) January 22, 2017 \nIt’s a key cog in the machine that is removed simply because of Sadio Mane’s absence at the African Cup of Nations – with the winger set to miss the crucial game against Chelsea as Senegal progressed through the group stage. \nKlopp knew Mane would be missed and could have had a replacement lined up to come in as soon as the January transfer window opened. Instead he trusted the depth and quality in his squad and it has cost him. Senegal's Sadio Mane has been sorely missed by Liverpool. Source: AFP \nSince Mane departed, which has also seen Roberto Firmino pulled out of position due to Philippe Coutinho’s injury, Liverpool have recorded just one win – a 1-0 win against League Two Plymouth in an FA Cup replay. The loss to Swansea just confirms their struggles and again highlights the defensive issues that have gone unsolved. \nNOT JUST KLOPP – THE HISTORICAL PROBLEM \nHope was rising that this would be a legitimate title chase for Liverpool, something they did in 2008-09 and 2013-14 but ever-so-rarely since their last league success in 1990. \nThe difference between the two ‘nearly’ seasons? \nIn 2008-09 under Rafael Benitez, Liverpool were the top scorers and yet conceded just 27 goals. That is the same amount the Reds have conceded in 22 games this campaign. \nBut in 2013-14, the goals against tally blew out to 50. Yes, under Brendan Rodgers Liverpool scored over 100 goals for the first time, but their inability to dig in an grind wins was what cost them in the end. Brendan Rodgers’ sides struggled defensively. Source: Reuters \nSince Benitez left, amid internal club turmoil with star players being sold to pay off mounting club debt under owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett, Liverpool have conceded on average 45.8 goals per season. \nSignings to rectify the problem have included, at left back, Paul Konchesky, Jose Enrique and Alberto Moreno. That Milner has now made the role his own sums up the issue. \nWhile at the heart of defence, ‘next big things’ Sebastian Coates, Tiago Ilori, Danny Wilson have all departed while stopgaps Sotirios Kyrgiakos, Kolo Toure and Ragnar Klavan were never going to be the quality required to shore things up. \nSteven Gerrard says Virgil van Dijk is the solution. But given the money spent on Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren, some would have to question Liverpool’s recruitment strategy in bringing in elite defenders. \nFor now, with Klopp adamant he doesn’t need to act in January, the return of Matip will have to suffice.
