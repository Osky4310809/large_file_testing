Dan Kitwood/Getty Images \nLondon is set to be battered by strong, gusty winds as forecasters issue a severe weather alert for commuter towns south of the capital. \nParts of the south east could see gales of up to 70mph while more coastal areas are set to be hammered with winds of more than 80mph as stormy weather sweeps the UK on Friday. \nMet Office weather experts told the Standard it is as yet “uncertain” how badly the storm could affect London – but added the capital could certainly see some “unsettled weather”. \nPower cuts and delays to travel have been warned for western England, Wales and parts of the south east as part of a yellow weather alert put in place for 6am on Friday. \nThe strong winds could also cause flooding, bring down trees and damage buildings, forecasters warned. \nThe gales are set to last until just before midnight on Friday – but the Met Office said more updates could come within the next few days. ⚠️Potential for very strong winds for parts of England & Wales on Friday. Gusts of 60 to 70 mph in places & over 80 mph in exposed areas⚠️ pic.twitter.com/PIhv5AiXAi — Met Office (@metoffice) January 31, 2017 \nThe stormy weather across the UK follows weeks of freezing temperatures and heavy fog which blighted flights from London’s airports. \nThe Met Office said: \"At the moment, there remains a lot of uncertainty over the locations most likely to be affected and the timing. \n\"A national severe weather warning for wind has been issued for Friday but at this stage, because of the uncertainty around the level of impact it could bring, the storm has not been named.\" Fog in London: 23 January 2017 Fog in London: 23 January 2017 1/20 \nWestminster: The Houses of Parliament looking eerie on Monday morning.
