Published Updated 5:28 pm EST, March 2, 2017 1 Comment By S.M. Walsh 1.4k Share Tweet Follow \nTonight, ABC will be airing a special, When We Rise , in place of Grey’s Anatomy. But don’t worry, our favorite doctors will be back next week at their usual time for an all-new episode. \nNext week’s episode is titled “Civil War”, and the synopsis reads: “A grueling trauma case is complicated by hospital politics. Meanwhile, Amelia confronts her feelings regarding Owen; and Meredith finds herself stuck in the middle as Nathan and Alex butt heads over a patient.” \nSo where did Grey’s leave off? Last week, Alex finally came back to Grey Sloan Memorial for work, and Meredith agreed to come back to the hospital, too. Alex’s first day back was, well, heavy. He was assigned to a mother-to-son kidney transplant, but things quickly turned dramatic when the boy’s father showed up to the hospital uninvited. \nWe soon learn that Cynthia (the mom) is a victim of domestic abuse at the hands of her husband, and Jo tells Owen to ask the man to leave. But… it all gets worse. Cynthia’s second kidney fails and the doctors need to give Chris a kidney. Turns out, the husband never actually left, and he overhears the conversation. He says he wants to give up his kidney to save his son, putting the doctors in a moral dilemma. Do they save Chris with a kidney from his father, who abused his mother? Ultimately, they do use the father’s kidney, but Jo secretly sneaks into the OR to convince him to donate it anonymously and never admit to his wife or son that it was his kidney. \nAnother (maybe not-so-secret) secret that was revealed? Arizona and Eliza Minnick are together…ish. They’ve been meeting in the parking lot, hiding their steamy romance. Oh, and everyone seems to love to vocalize their disdain for Minnick in front of Arizona, which makes for an interesting juxtaposition. \nDon’t miss a new episode of Grey’s Anatomy, which will return to ABC on March 9 at 8 p.m. ET.
