Just like you might pick up a bottle (or six) of read-made Starbucks coffee at the grocery store, you can now do the same with Dunkin’.\n“We are delighted…[to bring] ready-to-drink Dunkin’ Donuts coffee to the refrigerator cases of grocery, convenience stores and mass merchandisers, as well as inside Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants, across the United States,” Dunkin’ Brands Chairman and CEO Nigel Travis, explained in a press release. “Our research has clearly shown that ready-to-drink coffee consumption is a separate occasion from the purchase of our restaurant-brewed iced coffee. That same research also shows that having a ready-to-drink coffee product builds brand loyalty. We strongly believe that this product launch is good for customers and for our franchisees.” It’s also good for our coffee consumption. Often times we’re just NOT by a Dunkin’ to grab a coffee, so this ready-to-go bottle is the next best thing.\nDunkin’ Donuts actually sent the four new coffees to HelloGiggles, and in the name of journalism (and coffee) we tried them all. HelloGiggles After some scientific taste-testing (i.e., poured all the coffees into different cups), we’re pleased to announce that this coffee is GOOD. It tastes just like a regular iced coffee you’d snag in-store at Dunkin’, minus the ice and the actual trip to Dunkins.\nJust know, these aren’t exactly the healthiest thing for you. Each bottle has around 290 calories and a whopping 48-49 grams of sugar. But on the bright side, 45% of your daily calcium intake!\nYou can pick up these bottles now in-stores and at Dunkin’ locations across the country. Happy coffee!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:43:34.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
