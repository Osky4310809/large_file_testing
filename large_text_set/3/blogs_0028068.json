It came with a defensive pressure that forced Wellington (22-8) into 26 turnovers. \n“Any basketball player can play defense, but if you have heart and you want to play defense you can play defense,” Lutheran East coach Anthony Jones said. “That’s what we’ve been all year.” \nThe Falcons (20-7) took that identity while Burge sat out the first few games following his transfer from Shaker Heights. \nA year ago in Canton, Lutheran East lost its regional final to eventual state champion Cornerstone Christian. Jones stood in a hallway and promised himself and his players that they would be back — and reach Columbus. \nHe just didn’t expect it to happen like this. \nStarting point guard Alex Heath left the school for Cleveland Central Catholic, but Burge and Maurico Tate arrived late in the summer. A busy offseason for Jones, who doubles as the athletic director, included finding Lutheran East a home in the Lake Erie League beginning next season and running his hoops program. He did it with just six players for summer league. \n“I was willing to start this year 0-17,” he said. “Our schedule was tough, but I knew we had to be battle-tested to be here.” \nWins and losses came, and Lutheran East’s record dipped to 12-9 with consecutive losses just before the postseson. Tate said that is when this team began to show a finished product. \n“We knew what we needed to do to win big games,” he said. “We jelled together and became a family.” \nTate scored just six points Saturday, but the 6-foot guard grabbed eight rebounds and had two steals to lead a stingy defense. Senior Justin Motley added three blocks to protect the rim with his 6-8 frame and counter Wellington’s size. \nDustin Harder and Noah Berry led Wellington anchored the Jaguars’ attack. Harder, a 6-9 senior, had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Berry, a 6-7 junior, supplied seven points and nine boards. They gave Lutheran East early trouble and a 15-4 deficit. \n“Anytime you can hold a very athletic and strong team to 43 points is saying a lot,” Wellington coach Artie Taylor said. “We found our struggles vs. their pressure. No matter what we did, it threw our rhythm off.” \nThe Falcons climbed back with an 11-point run. They the lead for good in the third quarter and held off the Jaguars down the fourth-quarter stretch. \nThat included the last 3:19 without Burge. \n“I didn’t know he had his fifth foul,” Tate said. “He walked out of the game and I was like what are you doing.” \nBurge had four steals as part of that Lutheran East defense. The Falcons’ lead slipped to just three points in the final minute, but Travis Sanders ’ free throws with 15 seconds to go clinched victory. \n“I had faith in my guys,” Burge said. “From the bench I had energy clapping them on. I had faith.” \nThis marks Lutheran East’s second state championship. This time, it didn’t come via forfeit. \nThe school reached the 2005 title game and lost, but Columbus Africentric later forfeited the game and its season for use of an ineligible player. 9-0 Lutheran East run to tie it at 15, 5:45 2Q.
