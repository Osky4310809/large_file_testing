Salguero reports that Jordan weighs about 275 pounds and can’t run as well as he used to. \nNot only is Jordan lacking explosion, but is apparently dealing with some sort of non-football issue that team officials declined to discuss. \nDefensive line has been an area of focus for the Dolphins this offseason, with the team signing defensive ends Andre Branch and William Hayes, and adding Cameron Wake to a two-year extension. \nShould Miami cut Jordan, they would recoup around $3 million in cap space.
