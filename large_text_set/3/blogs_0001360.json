(Photo: Orlando Jorge Ramirez, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMEXICO CITY — Phil Mickelson does not panic. \nShirt-sided to a tight pin? He'll show off with an eye-opening flop shot. Have a forest of trees between himself and the flagstick? He'll find an opening somewhere. Three-putt? There's the next hole to make up for it. \nHe's an optimist to the nth degree. There's no shot he can't hit, no shot that scares him. Aggression has cost him over the years but over the course of his career it has made him who he is — the second best player of his generation. \nNor does Lefty mope. He picks himself off the floor, dusts himself off and forges ahead. These characteristics have served him well over the years, as most any other player would have been devastated by so many heart-crushing defeats during their career. To hear the man with 42 PGA Tour titles and five majors on his résumé talk the past few months, you'd have a hard time believing he hasn't won since the 2013 British Open. Heck, Tiger Woods has won a tournament more recently than Mickelson. \nAt 46, he's still a kid at heart and says he's in his best shape in decades. He's not blowing smoke when he says some of his best golf is ahead of him. He still goes big all the time and still finds a way to figure it out. \nSo when his longtime bagman Jim \"Bones\" Mackay showed up Friday for the second round of the WGC-Mexico Championship looking like one of those characters from The Walking Dead , Mickelson didn't freak out. Bones was ill from a stomach flu or food poisoning, and his prospects of making all 18 holes of the Club de Golf Chapultepec weren't looking good. \nA backup plan was at the ready — Phil's brother, Tim. \nThe younger Mickelson, the former golf coach at Arizona State, took over when Bones had to call it a day on the 13th hole (Mickelson teed off on the 10th) and became the first caddie other than Bones to carry his brother's bag since 2012. \n\"And of course we proceeded to make a bogey so I'm sure someone said, ‘First hole he ever caddied, bogey,'\" Tim Mickelson said with a smile. \nWell, a birdie came on the next hole. And two more came on the inward nine and Mickelson signed for a 3-under-par 68 to move to 7 under through 36 holes. He's on the first page of the leaderboard, trailing leader Rory McIlroy by 2. \nMORE COVERAGE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:42:48.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
