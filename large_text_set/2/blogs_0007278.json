We are ready.” Seven News: Beaches closed as the Gold Coast sizzles 0:32 \nRelief from the heat is hard to find on the Gold Coast, with beaches closed due to rough conditions. Video: 7 News February 10th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Lifestyle/ Seven News: Beaches closed as the Gold Coast sizzles \nThe heat will drive tens of thousands of people to the beach but authorities warn big swells have made it dangerous. \nSurf Life Saving Queensland state operations support co-ordinator Jason Argent warned swimmers to stay between the flags, due to strong currents and a powerful swell pounding the coastline. Health experts warn Queenslanders not to be complacent. \nThe unusual February weekend will result in temperatures more than 10C above average around the southeast, central and western parts of the state. \nRecords are set to tumble when severe heatwave conditions hit areas from Gladstone down to the border and out to Goondiwindi. media_camera Norwegian students Inga Ness, 21, and Silje Skjelsvik, 22, at South Bank. Picture: Claudia Baxter \nThe Queensland Ambulance Service and QHealth have advised residents to keep hydrated with at least two to three litres of fluids a day. \nThree students were hospitalised and five treated for heat-related incidents in Brisbane yesterday. \nQAS executive manager Lachlan Parker urged residents to stay indoors, in the comfort of the airconditioning. \n“It’s not the day to mow the lawn,” he said. \n“We are expecting this weekend to be busy. \n“Heat-related illnesses have the potential to be life-threatening and may include heat stroke.” \nQHealth chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said the heat could affect even the young and fit. \n“Everyone is at risk,” she said. “It’s important to not go out and do any strenuous exercise in the hottest part of the day.” \nTemperatures are expected to soar even higher tomorrow, with Brisbane forecast to sweat through a top of 39C, 43C in Goondiwindi and 47C in Birdsville. \nNO SWEAT OUT WEST IT may feel like “hell on Earth” but many outback residents are unfazed by warnings of up to 10C above average temperatures. “This is not hot,’’ said Cloncurry cattle king Andy Daniels at his homestead on a three-and-a-half million acre empire. “We don’t even break into a sweat out here until it starts to crank into the mid-40s.’’ Yesterday’s 38C heat was far from the highest temperature recorded in “The Curry”, which posted Australia’s hottest day on record when the mercury soared to 53.1C in 1882. media_camera Jillaroo Taylah Armstrong cools off in the trough at Farm Paddock near Hughenden.

It has also unleashed a plague of locusts. “These bloody grasshoppers are everywhere,” Ms Armstrong said.
