It's FREE and always will be! \nNo one likes spiders in the home, but we’re often told they are important for keeping the insect population in check. That’s why when I was young and found any spider in the home, my mom always told me not to kill it. The irony was she was terrified of them, so I’d have to find a way to pick it up and throw it out without harming it. Our lives would have been so much easier had we known this handy solution. \nYou can make your own natural spider repellent to spray around the home that will repel them naturally without killing them and without using dangerous chemicals. \nThere are several smells that spiders really don’t like. Peppermint, citrus/oranges, and vinegar are among them. \nTo make the spider deterrent, mix peppermint essential oil in water. You will also want to add a surfactant (like a dishwasher liquid) to keep the watery mixture from beading when sprayed. \nIf you don’t like the way mint smells, you can try using orange or lavender essential oils or vinegar instead. \nWatch the video below for the full recipe and some other handy tips for keeping spiders out of your home.
