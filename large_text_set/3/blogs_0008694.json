Because Disneyland continues to roll out things that make us go, “please, take our money, thank you,” you will soon be able to snag a delicious churro LITERALLY covered in gold.\nIf you listen closely, you can hear Instagram getting excited about this. A post shared by Alan77 (@sanseijedi) on Aug 28, 2016 at 4:19pm PDT \nThis year, Pirates of the Caribbean (the ride) is celebrating it’s 50th anniversary . The classic attraction first opened in Disneyland back in 1967 and has been delighting guests ever since who take to the high seas for some swashbuckling adventure (History time! The attraction was not an opening day attraction for Disneyland, and the same ride wouldn’t open in Disney World until 1973. The movie came out in 2003. The more you know .)\nIn celebration of this, New Orleans Square is getting a little makeover (just like Fantasyland received for Beauty and the Beast ) and the whole area is getting a fun pirate twist. This means, more pirate-themed food, entertainment, and merchandise. Also, gold dusted churros because WHY NOT?\nStarting on March 17th — one day before the official anniversary of Pirates — the churro cart in New Orleans Square will start selling these delicious, fancy churros, for a few doubloons. Or, $4.25.\nChurros are already pretty golden (and delicious) but just the thought of snagging one of these treasures has us pumped.\nA post shared by Tinkerbell (@tinkerbelldl) on Mar 13, 2016 at 3:39pm PDT \nA post shared by Alan77 (@sanseijedi) on Jan 17, 2016 at 3:39pm PST \nA post shared by Angel Kim (@theangelk66) on Sep 7, 2013 at 6:37pm PDT \nThese GOLDEN churros will only be around for a limited time, so if your dream is to eat a golden churro while watching the fireworks, better act fast if you want to capture that moment for Instagram. Golden churros don’t turn up every day, you know.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:01:30.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
