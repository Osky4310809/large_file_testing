Bartlett is ranked among the top 100 juniors in the country after a strong summer-league performance. Brown batted .342 with 17 doubles and 35 RBIs last year as a Spider. \n\nOH MY GOD, IT’S THE NCAA’S THEME MUSIC!! \n\n\nGod I love this so much. There is nothing and I mean NOTHING better than a super villain. A bad guy who just does not give a single fuck about anything except pure evil and destruction. Who doesn’t care about common sense or rationality. Someone who just wants to see others suffer. Someone who just wants to watch the world burn. And that someone is, always has been, and always will be the NCAA. \nCould not be happier that they are just flat out embracing it. Not fighting it, not defending themselves, not arguing their case. No sir. Just evolving (some might say devolving) into suspending college athletes and directly affecting their careers for playing fantasy football. \nKILL EM! \n\nNCAA rules state: \n“You are not eligible to compete if you knowingly participate in any sports wagering activity that involves intercollegiate, amateur or professional athletics, through a bookmaker, a parlay card or any other method employed by organized gambling. Examples of sports wagering include, but are not limited to, the use of a bookmaker or parlay card; Internet sports wagering; auctions in which bids are placed on teams, individuals or contests; and pools or fantasy leagues in which an entry fee is required.” \n\nWho needs a “case by case” basis? Rules that are put into place to stop players for throwing games or betting on their own teams or heading to Vegas on a gambling bender…why wouldn’t those same rules to apply to 20 year old kids drafting Cam Newton to their fake football team like 9.9 billion other Americans then Venmo’ing their buddy the commissioner 50 bucks to play in fake games? \nGotta be consistent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T17:18:47.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
