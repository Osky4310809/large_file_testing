But it’s the combination of first class-spec rear seats—heated, cooled, and massaging thrones that recline almost flat—and a convertible top over the back to reveal the stars in all their glory that make this machine perfect for making love anywhere on the face of the Earth. Photograph courtesy of Mercedes 2/6 Photograph courtesy of Ferrari Ferrari GTC4Lusso \nFerraris are sexy … but their low rooflines and snug, racecar-like interiors mean they’re not particularly good places to have sex. The one exception: the GTC4Lusso. With room for four and the boxy proportions of a shooting brake (a.k.a. a two-door station wagon), this Ferrari has more than enough space inside for the occupants to give into the carnal impulses the car’s sultry lines inspire.

The new Panamera Sport Turismo, however, is the first one to bridge the gap. Yes, it’s Porsche’s first wagon, but any worries that it might take after the terminally uncool likes of the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser vanish at first sight of its aerodynamic lines. And to seal the deal: It’s the first Panamera with a standard rear bench seat. Photograph courtesy of Porsche 4/6 Photograph courtesy of Chrysler Chrysler Pacifica \nQuit it with the eye-rolling. The Pacifica may not be sexy by most traditional metrics, but it’s jammed with features big and small that make getting laid that much more convenient. Both second and third rows of seats stow into the floor, creating a massive open surface to spread out (in more ways than one). Twin 10-inch entertainment screens in the first row’s headrests mean his-and-hers porn isn’t out of the question. And if things get messy (or if you just wanna get weird) … the Pacifica even offers a built-in vacuum cleaner.

Throw down a thick blanket, and a pickup’s bed serves equally well—and that’s where the Ridgeline separates itself from the rest of the truck pack. The tailgate swings both ways ( rimshot! ), making entry and exit easy. Fill the in-bed trunk with ice, and it becomes a perfect cooler, so a fresh drink is never far away. And the Ridgeline even has a system that transforms the bed walls into speakers—perfect for blasting mood music.

Until that day, however, the best place for comfortable road-going sex will be in the back seat of a Bentley Mulsanne piloted by a tight-lipped British chauffeur. With one of the nicest interiors in the automotive realm, a ride smoother than freshly-churned butter, and a massive back seat that offers a champagne cooler and a pair of crystal flutes to drink from, there’s no classier place to make babies at highway velocity than the rear of this massive luxury sedan.
