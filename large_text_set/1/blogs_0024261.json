The London edition of L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele will open at 125 Church Street in Stoke Newington on February 3. \nSo, why all the excitement? Well, because there is good reason to believe that it serves no less than the best pizza in the world. \nThe original family-run restaurant opened in Naples in 1870 and is widely regarded as the city’s best by locals. And given Naples is the heartland of pizza, and its people know a thing or two about what makes a good one, surely this puts it in good stead for being the best in the world. The best pizza in London - Top 10 The best pizza in London - Top 10 1/10 Lardo, Hackney \nThis Hackney Central restaurant churns out superlative crisp-based pizzas from its shiny mirror-clad oven, which also acts as a focal point in the industrial-style space. British-made charcuterie is also a high-point, so why not combine the two – try a pizza topped with spinach, egg and strips of melting lardo. 2/10 Homeslice, various locations \nThere are two buzzy Homeslice sites in central London, in Covent Garden and Fitzrovia. Some off-the-wall toppings may put off purists, but clever combos and a blistering hot oven ensure the end results really do work – even a goat shoulder and savoy cabbage number. Devour them whole or by the slice, while working your way through the oversize bottle of red placed on every table (you only pay for what you drink of it). 3/10 Santore, Clerkenwell \nA hefty proportion of the clientele always seems to be Italian at this old-school Clerkenwell local, and that’s got to be a good sign. The signature order is pizza by the metre, made with varying toppings along the stretch – you might want to bring a couple of friends to help polish it off though. For something different try the i panuozzi, a ‘pizza sandwich’ that has the same toppings but double the dough. 4/10 Addommè, Streatham \nThe sourdough pizzas at this teeny restaurant next to Streatham Hill station boast gloriously squidgy, salty bases and fresh full-flavoured toppings. Particularly friendly service makes it even more of a draw. 5/10 Sourdough Saloon, Bow \nSet within the Lord Morpeth pub, this eatery serves a host of traditional Neapolitan style pizzas, all made with its namesake sourdough that renders the bases exquisitely chewy, springy, salty and savoury tasting. Purists look away now: on Sundays you can even get a roast dinner pizza. 6/10 Pizza Pilgrims, Soho \nWith two restaurants in different corners of Soho, brothers James and Thom Eliot have come a long way since their days as street food traders. The Neapolitan-style pizzas here are soft and doughy with a plumped-up crust and a rich tomato base – try the ‘nudja variety if you’re feeling spicy. 7/10 L’Antica Pizzeria, Hampstead \nThe team behind this bustling neighbourhood pizzeria use traditional Caputo flour imported directly from Naples and ferment their dough for over 24 hours before it goes in the oven. The extra air inside means that the bases puff up quickly, making them lighter and airier. The pizzas are all named after famous Italians – try the Sofia Loren topped with tomato, mozzarella, artichokes, black olives, courgette, aubergine, parmesan, basil and olive oil. 8/10 Franco Manca, various locations \nThere are soon to be a whopping seventeen branches of Franco Manca throughout the capital, from Soho to Southfields and Covent Garden to Chiswick. Despite its size, the slightly sour, salty chewy Neapolitan base which made such an impression at the original Brixton Market branch remains, as do the simple but well-sourced toppings. The original Brixton branch is still the best, hence we’re putting this in the south London category. 9/10 Santa Maria, Ealing \nIf authentic Neapolitan pizza is your thing, then you’ll struggle to find a better spot than Santa Maria this side of an EasyJet flight. It’s run by Neapolitans Angelo and Pasquale who are so fanatical about their pizza that they’ve been known to turn away those who just order salad – but why would you do that? Stretchy pizza bases are pleasingly chewy and laden with fine Italian produce. Try the Santa Bufalina topped with tomato, buffalo mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil – a fine example of less is more. 10/10 Bravi Ragazzi, Streatham \nPizzas that Neapolitans would hold dear to their hearts are served at this small Streatham spot – and it’s all about the base. Light and air-filled, it’s crackingly crisp on the outside but chewily moist within. Simple but could quality toppings complete the package. \nWhat’s more, Italian experts have named it \"the Sacred Temple of Pizza”. \nIt is also the restaurant where Julia Roberts, playing Elizabeth Gilbert, fell in love with pizza in Eat Pray Love, for whatever that’s worth. The best pizza in London – from sourdough to by-the-slice \nIn all its 147 years, the restaurant has stuck to just one site. Until now, that is. \nThe team have installed a 2300kg pizza oven in their new Stokie home and assembled a team of pizza pros in a bid to recreate their perfect pizzas in the Big Smoke, where the concise menu will be based around margherita and marinara pizzas as well as rotating specials. \nOver in Italy the pizzas sell for as little as four or five euros, but pricing for London has not yet been revealed. Still, it's got to be cheaper than a flight. \nAs in Naples, the London restaurant will be predominantly no reservations however lines are now open for tables of six or more.
