For her big duet date with Metallica, Gaga called on her go-to makeup artist Sarah Nicole Tanno for another show-stopping take at the shimmery eye makeup that sparkled in the LED light reflections during her Superbowl 51 halftime show last weekend. To get the statement shadow look, Tanno colored in Gaga's lids with a suede red eye shadow (Marc Jacobs Beauty Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner in (Fine)Wine 47), but didn't stop there. For a more dramatic makeup move, the makeup pro drew the shadow and winged-liner combo (created with the Marc Jacobs Beauty Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner in Blacquer 42) out past her eyes in a rounded shape—blending outwards towards the singer's temples.

And once all that pink was in place, Tanno drew out black eyeliner flames (again, using Marc Jacobs Beauty Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner in Blacquer 42 ), jazzing up the fiery whorls with sparkly jewels ranging in shades of pink to red. Bottom line: This look is far from simple. It's sick .
