Pumpkin slipped him June’s number, and the guy called to ask her out on a date. \n“He can be our new step-daddy,” Alana said. It all seemed too good to be true for June, and, in fact, it was. The guy told June it looked like she had “lost weight in the upper area,” and that she looked “really great” at the ice cream shop. “Guys like breasts,” the guy said before adding that he found “curvy” women attractive. \n“But I like a big d--k, but I don’t say, 'Hey do you got a big d--k,'\" June clapped back before walking out on her creepy date.
