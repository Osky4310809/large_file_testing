Perhaps Google will find a manufacturer for the Pixel and Pixel XL follow-ups and seek out another for taimen.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com While no details are known at this point, Droid-Life is in the belief the codename hints at the device being larger compared to the devices we saw from Google last year. When the Nexus line still existed, the Nexus 6’s codename, shamu, was a hint at the device’s large size.\nEarlier this year, a report claimed Google was working on three Pixel devices , including a more affordable model. It’s unclear if taiman is related to that previous rumor.\nEliminate the bezels Hearing Google is working on a larger smartphone is tantalizing for fans of the Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. However, if the device looks anything like last year’s Pixel and Pixel XL, hopefully Google can work on eliminating the bezels, much like LG and Samsung are doing with its devices.\nWe’re still several months away from seeing what Google has planned, but it’s clear the company is working on exciting updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:19:18.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
