It said the new order would address complaints from a three-judge panel that parts of the order were unconstitutional. \n“Rather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the Order and replace it with a new, substantially revised Executive Order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns,” the brief states.
