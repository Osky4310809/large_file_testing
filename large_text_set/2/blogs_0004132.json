We were so naive. We didn’t know a thing about drugs. We didn’t know what to say or do or how to help. We just wrapped her up and took her to hospital and begged for help. \n“The doctor didn’t even look us in the eye. ‘There’s nothing we can do,’ she told us. We just wrapped Emma up and brought her home again. \n“We stayed up all night talking and, the next morning, were so naive that we thought we had sorted it out. We lost her that night.” Murder victim Emma's mum remembers the first time she revealed she was a drug addict (Photo: Daily Record) \nDespite their hopes, in the months that followed, their youngest daughter – her big sister Karen had died of cancer two years before – failed to break her addiction. \nMargaret said: “I blamed myself. I still blame myself. I couldn’t see past my own sadness to see Emma’s. \n“I made my grief for Karen all mine. No one could be hurting as much as I was. Nobody could be as heartbroken as I was. And Emma was – I just couldn’t see it. \n“Maybe she would have spoken to me about it if I had been there for her. \n“I didn’t try to help her until it was too late, after she was told there was something that could take away her pain and she took it.” Mum Margaret says she blames herself for her tragic daughter's death (Photo: Daily Record) \nAfter leaving home, Emma stayed close to her parents despite her battle against addiction. \nMargaret said: “She would phone every day, sometimes twice or three times a day, just to talk, asking if I had been baking or what we were having for dinner. \n“Willie went to see her every Wednesday and I’d go and get her on a Saturday or Sunday and drive her back here for a meal. \n“I’d peep my horn outside and she would come to the window brushing her teeth and holding up a finger, saying she would just be one minute. \n“But, later on, when I was waiting for her, sometimes she wouldn’t come out.

I’ll be all right next week, I promise, I promise.’ \n“I saw her on the Sunday before she disappeared just before my mum’s birthday and she gave me a bunch of daffodils and a card for my mum. She wrote, ‘Love you, gran, as always, your Emma.’ \n“My mum had it pinned up on her wall beside her bed until the day she died. \n“Emma said, ‘Tell dad I love him and will see him on Wednesday.’ But on Wednesday, when Willie phoned, he couldn’t get an answer.” \"Every day, it breaks my heart,\" Emma's mum says as she opens about her killing (Photo: Daily Record) \nThe couple did not know their daughter had been forced on to Glasgow’s red-light streets to feed her addiction. \nMargaret said: “After she disappeared, an officer asked us if we knew Emma frequented the city centre and we said, ‘Well, yes, she used to go to this shop or that shop.’ \n“But that’s not what he meant at all, not at all. We had no idea.” \nIn the five weeks before Emma’s body was found, Margaret and her husband drove all over the city looking for her. \n“We drove everywhere, day and night, around and around. \n“If you saw someone with blonde hair, tied back, you used to think, ‘Could that be Emma?’ \n“I knew it wasn’t, of course. You know your own child from whatever distance but you were clutching at straws, grabbing at nothing. \n“Willie never, ever gave up hope and was always sure we’d find her. But I think, in my heart, I always knew she was gone. Emma’s body was discovered in woods near Roberton, Lanarkshire by a dog walker \n“It didn’t stop me looking but I just knew inside.” \nThe discovery of Emma’s body in woods near Roberton, Lanarkshire, in May 2005 and the murder investigation that followed took a terrible toll on her family. \nMargaret added: “It was very hard. We had so many different emotions but there was just an awful sadness that Emma had been taken away from us because, through it all, we had never doubted she was going to come home eventually.

I don’t want to cause you and daddy any more bother, any more pain.’ \n“She still called us mummy and daddy, sometimes mother if she had fallen out with me. \n“But Em always told us, ‘I’ll be coming home.’ But she never did. It breaks my heart. \n“Every day, it breaks my heart.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T17:46:01.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
