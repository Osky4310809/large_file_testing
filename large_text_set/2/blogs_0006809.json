(U.S. Navy/MC1 Chris Williamson) \nOKINAWA, Japan - Amphibious transport dock USS Green Bay (LPD 20) departed White Beach Naval Facility, Okinawa, Feb. 2 after embarking elements of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). \nGreen Bay arrived in Okinawa on Jan. 30 after departing from Sasebo, Japan, Jan. 25 for a multi-month patrol in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. \nWhile in Okinawa, Green Bay on-loaded more than 600 Marines from the 31st MEU, along with 65 vehicles and approximately 855 tons of equipment during the three-day period. \n\"Our mission aboard Green Bay is to support the Marines,\" said Capt. Nathan Moyer, Green Bay commanding officer. \"Together, as a 'blue-green' team, we will seamlessly integrate in several training events to maximize our combat readiness. At the same time, we will provide stability throughout the region by participating in exercises with partner nations.\" \nGreen Bay is scheduled to participate in Cobra Gold. The crew and embarked Marines are preparing for the multitude of evolutions which will accompany that exercise. \nExercise Cobra Gold, the largest multilateral exercise in Asia, has taken place annually for more than 30 years. Cobra Gold 2017, the 36th version of the military exercise, will bring together more than two dozen nations to address regional and global security challenges and to promote international cooperation and stability within the region. \nGreen Bay and the 31st MEU will focus on the ability to plan for and execute multiple amphibious missions, to include humanitarian assistance and non-combatant evacuation. \nBefore arriving in Okinawa and throughout the patrol, Green Bay has been working on its material condition of readiness and making sure the Marines feel a part of the Navy and Marine Corps family. \n\"The crew fully understands the priority of supporting our Marines,\" said Moyer. \"Throughout our period of transition from Sasebo to Okinawa, we have been building our tempo and level of enthusiasm so that when we operate with the Marines, we are already prepared to support in every way.\" \nGreen Bay is part of Amphibious Force 7th Fleet, the Navy's only forward-deployed amphibious force, headquartered at White Beach Naval Facility, Okinawa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:35:49.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
