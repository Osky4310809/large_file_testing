Lots of people watched and Tweeted, and celebrities, of course, were no exception. Not surprisingly, for the most part, they weren’t into what PEOTUS had to say: Lock him up \n— Michael Carney (@carneymichael) January 11, 2017 did anyone else notice that the trump white house logo is basically the “no entry” symbol? pic.twitter.com/mzI522T1Bb \n— Michael Carney (@carneymichael) January 11, 2017 so the tactic is just to blame the media for everything? \n— Andy Cohen (@Andy) January 11, 2017 Trump is brilliant deflector. Answers not one question. \n— Andy Cohen (@Andy) January 11, 2017 RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS \n— Andy Cohen (@Andy) January 11, 2017 So odd how Trump constantly projects: he hates “fake news” (which contributed to his win), and “Nazis” (who openly supported him in his run) \n— Chelsea Peretti (@chelseaperetti) January 11, 2017 Trump is a chronic ORIGINATOR of fake news, such as Obama’s birth certificate obsession/lunacy and all the other lies he tells w no regard \n— Chelsea Peretti (@chelseaperetti) January 11, 2017 It’s like watching a float in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. \n— Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 11, 2017 He could also still run Trump Steaks, bankrupt a casino and an airline while while ripping off students and not pay his contractors. https://t.co/bDr0tqyy2B \n— Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) January 11, 2017 He wants us to know he is vindictive & it’s working well4 him. Astonishing the people who r known 4 speaking out NOT speaking out. Crushing \n— Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) January 11, 2017 I’ve never seen anything like this press conference as long as I’ve been alive. We are in dark waters. \n— Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) January 11, 2017 The “anti-Hollywood” candidate ended his press conference with his TV CATCHPHRASE. So if I’m ever Pres, I get to end with “What the deuce”? \n— Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) January 11, 2017 We are truly in the golden age of irony \n— Will Arnett™ (@arnettwill) January 11, 2017 I think Trump is gonna beat Hillary. \n— Trevor Noah (@Trevornoah) January 11, 2017 This trump press conference feel more like a mandatory school assembly than a press conference.
