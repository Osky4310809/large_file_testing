First, Too Faced's Jerrod Blandino posted a picture of holographic smears on Instagram with no explanation. Now, the Kat Von D glitter swatches that appeared on Kat Von D Beauty's Instagram feed yesterday has our minds racing. A video showed the tattoo artist's arm covered in some of the most shimmery bright colors we've ever seen from the cruelty-free company. The caption didn't give us any helpful hints at what it could be. All it said was \"When you're lucky enough üôèüèΩ to sit in a product preview meeting with @thekatvond and @katvondbeauty VP of Product Development @nmcg30 üôÄ üôÄ üôÄ.\" Personally, my first thought was they've 100 percent gotta be some kind of metallic liquid lipstick. Companies like Urban Decay , Huda Beauty , and Anastasia Beverly Hills have recently created their own version of the latest lip trend, as well as my personal favorite, the limited-edition ones Lancome . Also, the swatches have that wet look of liquid lipstick , right? Von D already teased a gold shade of the Everlasting Liquid Lipstick called Gold Skool with the big reveal video a couple months ago, so my guess can't be that far off.

Remember when the Urban Decay Moondust Palette went liquid for the holidays last year? I happen to be particularly loving the new Stila Magnificent Glitter and Glow Liquid Eye Shadows at the moment, and these swatches kind of look like bright, neon versions of those. Either way, in the words of @darkangel5777 in the comments, \"@katvondbeauty, i'm just going to xfer my direct deposit to yours! üòπ\" Same. You can watch the video below and make your own guesses.
