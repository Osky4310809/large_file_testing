Emma Watson may be having a few. \nThe English actress still tagged as Hermione-from-the-Harry-Potter-films, was reportedly the original choice for the box office dominating, awards guzzling smash, La La Land , but played herself out of contention. SHARE Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The wrong Emma? Instead of Emma Stone it could have been Emma Watson starring in the hit La La Land Photo: Getty \nAccording to the gossip column Page Six , Watson had been lined up for the musical film but when she supposedly set demands such as rehearsals in London, producers cooled on her. \nWatson could have been appearing in La La Land opposite Miles Teller, who was the breakout star of the previous Oscar winner from director Damien Chazelle, Whiplash . SHARE Miles Teller was tipped to appear in La La Land opposite Emma Watson. Photo: Getty \nTeller was replaced by Ryan Gosling, who in this telling of events, was eager to join the cast when Emma Stone was cast in place of Watson, after the Whiplash actor upped his demand from the $4 million fee offered to $6 million. \nWhether Watson was dropped, never really felt the role was right for her, or in fact had another job available – in some tellings, the Disney live-action Beauty And The Beast – remains speculation. \nWhat isn't speculative is the fact it's Stone and Gosling, not Watson and Teller who are the actors with Oscar heat right at the moment.
