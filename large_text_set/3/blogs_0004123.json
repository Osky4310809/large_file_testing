With that said, the show sucks. I know I won’t like it just as I know I won’t like Clay Aiken’s new album. Sure, I haven’t heard it, but it’s fucking Clay Aiken. Go away. And I’m a little bitter that the top three earners in the comedy genre on television are Big Bang Theory actors. Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, and Johnny Galecki each earn $1 million PER EPISODE. They earn more than 20 times a teacher’s yearly salary per one 26 minute episode for this:\nThis perfectly encapsulates why I hate \"The Big Bang Theory\" pic.twitter.com/G2P4TLyUKy \n— Lyle McDouchebag (@LyleMcDouchebag) January 27, 2016 \n\nAdding in Ricky Gervais’ extraordinarily distinct laugh is the mockery this show needs to bring it back down to earth. Granted, it could be the greatest show I’ve ever seen if my stubborn ass would just give it a chance, but after mining the comment section of the above video, it’s a hard pass for me.\nYouTube\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube\n\n[h/t Uproxx ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:44:33.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
