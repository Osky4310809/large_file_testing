Shivnarine Chanderpaul is one of only two West Indies batsmen to pass 10,000 Test runs Lancashire have signed former West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul and South Africa wicketkeeper Dane Vilas, both as non-overseas players. \nOnly Brian Lara has scored more Test runs for the West Indies than Guyana-born Chanderpaul, 42, who scored 11,867 runs and 30 centuries in 164 matches. \nHe has agreed a one-year contract, while 31-year-old Vilas has signed a two-year deal with the Red Rose county. \nThe last of Vilas' six Tests was against England in January 2016. \nThe emergence of Quinton de Kock as South Africa's first-choice wicketkeeper significantly reduced the international prospects of Vilas, who averages almost 40 in first-class cricket. \nHe is the latest of a number of South Africa internationals to sign Kolpak deals with English counties. \nPace bowler Kyle Abbott and batsman Rilee Roussouw will play for Hampshire in 2017, while Sussex have signed all-rounders David Wiese and Stiaan van Zyl. \nAnother all-rounder, Simon Harmer, has agreed a contract with promoted Essex, while fast bowler Hardus Viljoen has joined Derbyshire. Dane Vilas (right) captained South Africa A against Alastair Cook's England during their 2015-16 tour What is a Kolpak contract? \nKolpak contracts are named after Slovak handball player Marius Kolpak, who won a landmark case at the European Court of Justice in 2003. \nIt allows sportsmen from countries that have associate trade agreements with the European Union, including South Africa and some Caribbean nations, the same right to free movement as EU citizens without being classed as \"foreigners\". \nIn cricket, such contracts render the player ineligible to represent their country at international level.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T09:49:15.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
