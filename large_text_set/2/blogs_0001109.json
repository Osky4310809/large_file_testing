Four cubs from a previous brood, born in March 2013, were distributed to other animal parks. \nThe Furesa refuge has 125 animals from 31 species, including lions, leopards, jaguars, hippopotamuses and pumas. \nAccording to the environmental protection group World Wildlife Fund, there are more than 2,500 Bengal tigers left in the wild, mostly in India. © 2017 AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:50:51.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
