Ivanka Trump. AP \nThe First Daughter has secured her own office on the West Wing's second floor -- a space next to senior adviser Dina Powell, who was recently promoted to a position on the National Security Council, Politico news said in the report on Monday. \nShe is also in the process of obtaining a security clearance and is set to receive government-issued communications devices this week. \nIvanka will be joining her husband Jared Kushner, who is a senior adviser to the President. \nHowever, Ivanka will hold no official position and is not pocketing a salary, according to her attorney Jamie Gorelick. \nIvanka's role will be to serve as the President's \"eyes and ears\" while providing broad-ranging advice, not just limited to women's empowerment issues, Gorelick told Politico news . \nLast week, Ivanka raised eyebrows when she was seated next to Angela Merkel for the German Chancellor's first official visit to Trump's White House. \n\"Ivanka's plans to adhere to the same ethics and records retention rules that apply to government employees even though she is not technically an employee,\" Gorelick said. \nA spokeswoman for Ivanka Trump said her role was signed off on by the White House counsel's office, and the conflict issues were \"worked through\" with the office of government ethics. \nPeople close to Ivanka said that she sees nothing unusual about the arrangement -- it is simply how she has worked with her father for years, as a senior official at the Trump Organisation and as Donald Trump's partner on the reality TV show \"The Apprentice\". \n 36  36 pm Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:23:27.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
