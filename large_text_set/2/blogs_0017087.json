Few people are talking about Roarie Deacon’s 25-yard effort against the bar or Adam May’s chance from David Ospina’s poor clearance.

He has been groundsman as well as goalkeeper and has put in years of service at the club. \nBut this circus plays right into the hands of people who want to keep non-league football in its box. People who’d rather not accept that players are fitter and far more focused at that level, as a relieved Arsene Wenger found on Monday night. \nMany of us have been used over the years to writing about non-league players who doubled up as butchers, bakers and candlestick makers. It is an old tale, often (tediously) told. What did his teammates make of things? (Photo: REUTERS) What about the likes of Craig Eastmond's efforts though?

Shaw broke the FA rules. He admits being aware of the odds and that a few of his mates were on at 8-1. Wayne Shaw on 'Good Morning Britain' (Photo: Rex Features) \nHe explained: “A few of the lads said to me earlier on: ‘What is going on with the 8-1 about eating a pie?’ I said: ‘I don’t know, I’ve eaten nothing all day, so I might give it a go later on,’” he said. \n“Sun Bets had us at 8-1 to eat a pie. I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let’s do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down. \n“I went and got it at half time from the kitchen, I had it all prepared and ready to go. It was meat and potato.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:35:24.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
