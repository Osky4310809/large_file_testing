Tajudeen Adepetu \nThe name of the radio station was exclusively revealed to Potpourri On Point as, “Correct FM” with its broadcast dial as 100.7. \nDescribing Correct Radio in one piece recently, a source who pleaded anonymity said it’s a Pidgin English station with state-of-the-art digital broadcasting equipments deployed in the area. \nThe management of the station is said to have entered into a contract with top Nigerian artiste to record several jingles for the station. \nIt would be recalled that Tajudeen Adepetu founded Soundcity TV and years after launched the Soundcity radio 98.5, Urban Radio and others which are all doing great. With the birth of Correct FM, the CEO of Consolidated Media Associates (CMA), owners of a range of TV channels that cut across television genres are indeed set for another game changing move.
