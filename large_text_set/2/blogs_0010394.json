Nick Viall took his remaining women to Bimini in the Bahamas on the Monday, February 13, episode of The Bachelor , hoping to find more clarity after a tough week in St. Thomas. Some women opened their hearts and one woman opened her legs, but each experienced different outcomes.

After a chat about how “terrified” he is, Nick went to the house to face his ladies.

Nick took the opposite route and apologized for his strong reaction. He realized the women in that room are the ones he wants, and he wants to go all the way. “I’ve been that close before, and I just don’t want to get that close anymore. I want to get all there,” Nick triumphed. \nThen, Nick canceled the cocktail party and rose ceremony and took all the women to Bimini. \nVanessa Professes Her Love \nVanessa received the first date card, which read, “Let’s go deeper.” Corinne , raging with jealousy, said she didn’t “see much depth” from the trilingual special education teacher.

They kissed underwater and Vanessa realized she was in love, and she wanted to tell him that night, hoping to read Nick’s facial expressions for his response. \nNick responded way too diplomatically to Vanessa’s profession of love. “I really, really like you, but it is incredibly important for me, if I’m lucky enough to feel love or say ‘I love you’ in this role, that I only say it to one person,” he responded. \nVanessa “didn’t feel great” about Nick’s response.

Regardless, they all jumped into the water. \nKristina quickly bailed and Nick went after her. She was crying, which Corinne interpreted as a ploy for more time and used it as fuel for her newfound self-consciousness. \nThat night, Kristina kept it real when Nick over-explained why he had such a hard time with sending Danielle L. home. “Listen,” she said, “you can’t keep us all, so you will have to make a decision.” \nMeanwhile, Corinne stress-ate a pound of cheese and became increasingly jealous of Kristina. She told Nick her concerns about their connection going into hometowns and slipped into third person, which completely threw Nick off, but he was able to dial back and make her feel better. \nNonetheless, Nick gave Raven the group date rose, making her the first woman confirmed for a hometown date. Corinne was “flabbergasted” and vowed, “I’m not going to let myself fall from this.” \nOne Woman Goes Home \nDanielle M. had the next one-on-one date, and she and Nick rode bikes and explored the island. \nThey were definitely on different pages, because while Danielle was imagining them tackling huge life events together, Nick was struggling to keep the conversation flowing. \nThat night, Nick tried to press Danielle about how she was feeling. She didn’t maintain eye contact when she described their “wonderful day,” showing her nerves, but knew she had to open up. Danielle told Nick that she cared about him, but she didn’t know how he felt. Nick’s face dropped in response because he is terrible at hiding emotions. \nNick broke up with Danielle. He wanted to love her, but his heart couldn’t “get there.” He threw in a, “You’re great,” for good measure, to which Danielle sadly replied, “Not great enough.” \nRubbing salt in the wound, Danielle had to go back to the house to pack her things in front of all the other women. She was bawling. \nThe other women were somber — except for Corinne, who had her eyes on the prize. “It does hurt my heart a little bit that someone so sweet did go home, but I didn’t really see them together and one less girl here,” she shrugged. \nCorinne’s Bold Move \nWith the revelation that she’d “live in a shack with no diamonds for Nick,” the ultimate sacrifice for love, Corinne decided it was time to do something to solidify her relationship. So, she got ready and marched over to Nick’s hotel room to seduce him. \nBehind closed doors, Nick rejected her major pass. “Oh, my God. This is so terrible,” she later said. “Tonight definitely did not go as I wanted it to.” \nRead Us Weekly ’s full play-by-play of the cringeworthy encounter here . Nick Viall Mitch Haaseth \nNick Talks Race With Rachel \nRachel was asked on the final one-on-one date before hometowns, and she glowed with excitement. \nNick took her to a locals-only bar, where they discussed what it would be like for her to take Nick home. He tried to ask without directly asking whether his race would be a surprise to her family, and she took the bait and answered that she hadn’t brought home a white man, but she also hadn’t brought home many other men. “I just want you to be yourself,” she said, stressing that, above all, it would be a big deal for her to bring him home. \nThere was no evening portion of the date because of the rose ceremony that night, but Rachel felt confident enough in the time they had and started buzzing about her day as soon as she found a person to listen. \nAnother Relationship Ends \nAfter his date with Rachel, Nick knew what he had to do. He told Chris Harrison that he wanted to end this next relationship ahead of the rose ceremony in a personal and private way. Nick was on a mission, so he headed straight to the house.
