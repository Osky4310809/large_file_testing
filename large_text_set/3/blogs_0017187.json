The new trailer shows the bloodier side of the modern fantasy series, and Neil Gaiman, who wrote the original novel, gave it his own stamp of approval via Twitter. \nNow, this trailer works for me. https://t.co/gi8H7Wz0Qh — Neil Gaiman (@neilhimself) March 15, 2017 \nIn American Gods , when Shadow Moon is released from prison, he meets the mysterious Mr. Wednesday and a storm begins to brew. Little does Shadow know, this storm will change the course of his entire life. Left adrift by the recent, tragic death of his wife, and suddenly hired as Mr. Wednesday’s bodyguard, Shadow finds himself in the center of a world that he struggles to understand. It’s a world where magic is real, where the Old Gods fear both irrelevance and the growing power of the New Gods, like Technology and Media. Mr. Wednesday seeks to build a coalition of Old Gods to defend their existence in this new America, and reclaim some of the influence that they’ve lost. As Shadow travels across the country with Mr. Wednesday, he struggles to accept this new reality, and his place in it. \nGaiman's original American Gods novel was published in 2001. American Gods won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for best novel.

In 2014, and HBO executive said the project was abandoned because they struggled with the script.
