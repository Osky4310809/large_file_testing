Carolyn Bryant: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published Updated 11:01 pm EST, January 27, 2017 1 Comment By Daniel S. Levine 13.7k Share Tweet Follow Emmett Till’s gravesite in Aslip, Illinois. (Getty) \nOn the morning of August 24, 1955, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black child from Chicago, skipped church in Money, Mississippi and went to a local grocery store. While there, he saw Carolyn Bryant, the 21-year-old white woman who owned the store with her husband Roy Bryant. Till whistled or flirted with Bryant. On the morning of August 28, 1955, Till was taken from the house he was staying at in Money and killed. Roy Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam were acquitted of the murder, but later admitted to it in Look Magazine. \nBryant never talked about her role in the murder, which would go on to spark the Civil Rights movement, until 2007, when she spoke with author Timothy Tyson. Ahead of the publication of Tyson’s book, The Blood of Emmitt Till , his interview with her is finally going public. On January 26, Vanity Fair published the story of Tyson’s surprising interview. \nIn the interview, Bryant admitted that the story she told during the trial was a lie. \nHere’s what we know about Bryant and her role in the Till story. 1. Bryant Says It’s ‘Not True’ That Till Made Verbal or Physical Advances Towards Her \nCarolyn Bryant Donham, who divorced Roy Bryant and married two more times, testified that on August 24, 1955, Till grabbed her hand as he went to pay for bubble gum. “How about a date, baby?” Till said, according to Bryant’s testimony, which was delivered without the jury present. As Douglas O. Linder writes , Bryant claimed Till grabbed her by the waist and said he told her that he had done an “unprintable word” to “white women before.” “I was just scared to death,” Bryant said. \nAfter delivering her testimony, Judge Curtis Swango ruled that it was inadmissible, but the all-white jury had probably heard the story before. \nNow, Bryant told Tyson that this part of her testimony was not true. “That part’s not true,” she told Tyson, reports Vanity Fair . She also told Tyson that she could not remember what else happened in the grocery store that day. \nAt the time of her interview with Tyson, Bryant was 72. She is still alive is now 82 yeas old. Her family wants to keep her current location private and she has not done any further interviews.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T13:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T08:35:04.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
