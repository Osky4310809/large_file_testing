Photo: Wolter Peeters \nWith neighbours complaining about Bieber's reported parties, which didn't end until 3am, it would seem it wasn't just noise pollution or screaming school girls marauding around Mosman's posh streets that had been causing problems. \n\"It smelled like a Nimbin boarding house,\" PS was informed by one source this week as the clean-up was underway. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Justin Bieber is staying in a luxury mansion in Mosman while he is in town for his Sydney concert. \nPS also understands a very expensive sofa was damaged during the stay with Bieber's management coughing up about $30,000 to cover the cost of repairs and clean up, which is but a drop in the ocean next to Bieber's $300 million fortune. \nThe luxury digs were developed by businessman Cameron MacDonald who is currently trying to sell the place.
