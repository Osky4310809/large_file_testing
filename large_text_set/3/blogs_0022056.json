(AP) — The first U.S. inmate to have taxpayer-funded sex reassignment surgery says she is struggling since being transferred to a California women’s prison.\nIn a federal court filing, convicted killer Shiloh Quine called her new housing a “torture unit.”\nShe said she’s isolated and denied basic privileges such as a razor. She has grown facial hair that is making her transition to life as a woman more difficult.\nQuine wants a judge to order electrolysis, among other changes.\nThe 57-year-old had reassignment surgery in January and last month was moved from a men’s prison.\nState officials say she’s being treated like other female inmates. All initially are denied privileges like razors and TVs as they are evaluated.\nQuine and an accomplice kidnapped, robbed and killed a father of three in Los Angeles in 1980.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:33:37.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
