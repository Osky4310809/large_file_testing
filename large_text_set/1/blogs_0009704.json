On balance, it delivered. \nA mammoth three-hour love-in featured a rotating cast of Bowie band members, a gospel choir, a string and brass section and assorted singers. Duran Duran ’s Simon Le Bon delivered Let’s Dance as if it were Girls On Film and Keane’s Tom Chaplin admirably reclaimed Life On Mars? after the crowd bellowed along to the acoustic opening. \nThe approach was to stick mainly to the hits and to rock kitchen-sink style. As a result, one of the most eclectic canons in popular music was homogenised. \nThere was no acknowledgement of Bowie’s experimental, pioneering side, nor his wit. Beyond Spandau Ballet’s Tony Hadley’s cheery Changes and Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott revisiting the anthem of his own childhood, All The Young Dudes, there was a lack of joy and the sound was often wretched. Bowie only found out his cancer was terminal three months before death \nAt its best, Celebrating David Bowie did just that and there was barely a whiff of speechifying. DJ brilliantly segued into a cacophonous Boys Keep Swinging; Gail Ann Dorsey took Space Oddity to another planet; La Roux threw herself into a deliciously twisted Golden Years and Holly Palmer made Bowie’s refusal to perform Aladdin Sane’s Lady Grinning Soul more mysterious still. \nIt’s hard to imagine this was precisely what Bowie would have wanted, but it was unquestionably what this delirious audience desperately desired. \nFollow Going Out on Facebook and on Twitter @ESgoingout More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T12:07:24.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
