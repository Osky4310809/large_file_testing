King is set to play the role of Abigail Ross in the film while Jackson will reprise his role of ‘Hush’ from the first film. \nThe pair join Sylvester Stallone in the sequel. Steven C. Miller ( Marauders , Arsenal ) is set to direct. \nThe original Escape Plan followed one of the world’s foremost authorities on structural security, who agrees to take on one last job: breaking out of an ultra-secret, high-tech facility called “The Tomb.” Deceived and wrongly imprisoned, Ray Breslin (Stallone) must recruit fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) to help devise a daring, nearly impossible plan to escape from the most protected and fortified prison ever built. \nEscape Plan was released by Summit Entertainment in 2013, and though it only grossed $25 million domestically, it took in $137 million worldwide with the bulk of the international gross coming from China. Original screenwriter Miles Chapman will return to pen the sequel, which is looking to soon begin production in Atlanta. \nThe first film also starred Jim Caviezel, Vinnie Jones, Vincent D’Onofrio and Amy Ryan. \nEscape Plan 2 is a co-production between Emmett/Furla/Oasis and Chinese company Leomus Pictures . \n(Photo credit: Getty Images)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T17:46:51.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
