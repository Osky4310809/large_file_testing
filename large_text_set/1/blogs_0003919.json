Advising and assisting Afghan defense and security forces will assist in preserving gains made together with the Afghans,” a US Marine Corps press statement said. \n“This new deployment of Marines to Helmand reflects our enduring commitment to the people of Afghanistan.” \nIn 2014 , the last marines withdrew from bases in the region alongside British armed forces in a long drawn out handover of Camp Leatherneck and Camp Bastion.

In 2014, the president announced that US armed forces would only be used to support the embassy in Kabul. \n“... by the end of 2016, our military will draw down to a normal embassy presence in Kabul, with a security assistance component, just as we’ve done in Iraq,” he said . \nHowever, in July last year the US president was forced to admit that the number of US forces will be higher than expected at the beginning of 2017 as the Afghan government continues to stave off terror attacks. \nREAD MORE: 2 US soldiers killed, 2 wounded in Kunduz, Afghanistan \n“As president and commander-in-chief, I have made it clear that I will not allow Afghanistan to be used as safe haven for terrorists to attack our nation again,” he said at the time. \nHe added that 8,400 US servicemen and women will remain in the struggling nation past the end of his term because Afghan security forces “are not as strong as they need to be.” \nA total of 2,181 American military personnel have been killed during the US intervention in the region.
