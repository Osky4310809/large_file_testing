Researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago discovered that people who ate gluten-free had higher concentrations of toxins in their body , including arsenic in their urine and mercury in their blood, than those who didn’t follow the diet. That’s important, since these metals have been linked to serious conditions like heart disease and cancer . \nFight Flu Flu activity is spiking , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. During the last week, all 10 regions reported influenza-like activity at or above their region-specific levels—and New York City and 23 states experienced high flu activity. If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet, it’s not too late to get one , HealthDay reports. \nStress Less There may be one more benefit to tying the knot: Married people have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol , compared to those who remained single, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University discovered. Too much cortisol can spike inflammation, setting the stage for a number of diseases. (Married men live longer, have better sex, and make more money, too, as we recently reported .) \nControl Your Blood Pressure Aggressively lowering blood pressure can prevent more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S. each year, a study out of the University of Utah estimates. Previously, doctors worked to lower high blood pressure to less than 140 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). But cutting it even further, to 120 mm Hg or below, can greatly reduce the risks of heart attack and stroke .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:21:06.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
