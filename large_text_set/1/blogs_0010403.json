Related Inside Kim Gordon's Latest Postâ€“Sonic Youth Experiment Body/Head singer-guitarist, bandmate Bill Nace discuss sowing \"audio chaos\" on new live LP 'No Waves' \nSet in a dingy room with a dangling bulb, Gordon was also blindfolded for the chat and asked a series of pointed questions about her life and art. When asked if she felt like a musician, Gordon quipped, \"Do you feel guilty about conforming?\" In classic interrogation form, Gordon was told to \"answer the question, ma'am,\" causing the rocker to laugh and reply, \"I just think of myself as a person, actually.\" \nWhen asked about when she first knew she wanted to be an artist, Gordon recalled making a clay elephant in kindergarten and being asked the following year to teach the younger class how to do it. She also remembered seeing the famed avant grade composer John Cage at age 10, saying, \"It puzzled me, it kept me up at night. I got a fever. I couldn't stop thinking about it, though. Those sort of isolated piano tones that hung in the air.\" \nGordon spoke about returning to Los Angeles as well, and how the city's car culture and changing aesthetics influenced her recent song, \"Murdered Out,\" which arrived last September. While Gordon's post- Sonic Youth projects have been bands , \"Murdered Out\" was notably released under her own name. The song does, however, feature Warpaint's Stella Mozgawa on drums and production from Justin Raisen, and Gordon spoke about why she prefers creating with collaborators: \"It defies the idea of the individual artist. You can't tell who did what, and then the idea of talent can't be pinpointed.\" More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T03:27:52.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
