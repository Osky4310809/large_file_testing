This is the ninth London restaurant he’s opened in the space of six years, and that’s not to mention a pretty hefty international portfolio. \nHis sites are no carbon copies of each other, either. This casual New York-style Italian follows a British grill , a high-end Japanese and a tapas bar . \nObviously he’s not done it alone, and part of his strategy seems to be to breaking his increasingly large empire down into subsections. Temple & Sons , which opened last November in the City, is considered a sister site to City Social and run by its head chef Paul Walsh. \nHe’s decided to partner this latest opening with Soho’s modern British Social Eating House and it is overseen by the same head chef, Paul Hood. It even comes with an upstairs cocktail bar, The Drunken Oyster, which is designed as sibling to The Blind Pig which sits above the other restaurant. Jason Atherton on his favourite restaurants and bars in London \nThere are few parallels to be drawn between the menus, with Hai Cenato focussing on pasta, risotto and pizza along with some grills. But the low-lit space, set to a soundtrack of East Coast hip-hop, with walls made to look like peeling wallpaper does echo the buzzy coolness of its sibling. \nOn the walls hang a couple of dozen hand-drawn caricatures of Atherton’s favourite chefs — ex-boss Ramsay is included, as are the likes of René Redzepi and Heston Blumenthal. In turn these chefs will be responsible for creating a month-long guest pizza to be added to the menu. Fully loaded: pizza with speck, n'duja, spinach, anchovy and harissa \nThe pizzas are right to be a focus: they’re excellent. Salty, slightly chewy but thin bases act as welcome hosts for full-flavoured toppings, either with or without a tomato base layer. The best pizza in London – from sourdough to by-the-slice \nPulling together speck, n'duja, spinach, anchovy and harissa for one of them is bold, but it pays off. It’s the sort of topping that Neapolitans probably wouldn’t approve of, but that Londoners will lap up. \nYou’ll be grateful for the thin bases as there’s a lot more that you’ll want to try and it’s hard to know which part of the menu to devote space to. Pasta course: aged beef bolognese served with corzetti \nWhatever you do, make you sure order the pheasant risotto which sings with rich, earthy stock. Deep, meaty flavours also abound in an aged beef bolognese served with corzetti (rounds of pasta) and lavished with a sage burnt butter. A small plate of grilled octopus and squid is another winner thanks to tender flesh, a punchy green chilli salsa and more super stock — this time used to braise lentils in. \nJason Atherton: Restaurateurs ‘left waiting like plonkers’ for details on Brexit \nIf you can muster a big chunk of meat, a Cumbrian rib-eye is a beautiful beast that drips in fatty flavour. Speaking of dripping, the accompanying crispy ‘cracked potatoes’ sprinkled with rosemary sea salt are a high-level pleasure, hovering somehwere between roastie and crispy potato wedge. You can order them as a side, too. Dripping: Rib-eye steak \nIf you’ve not left much room for pudding after all that, then you might be able to manage one of the ice creams, served in cute mini cones. If you can fit more in, then it’s time for what the menu calls a warm brioche and salted caramel gelato sandwich. More accurately, it’s an ice cream burger. \nRead the latest restaurant news and reviews \nOur waiter recommended an asti spumante to go with that final dish, and it did the job nicely. But for the less outrageous dishes there’s a much more sophisticated selection of good value and lesser-spotted Italian wines available. A 2014 Freisa from Piedmont at £7 a glass is a case in point: it’s lighthearted but with plenty of substance and a feisty edge which sets it apart. \nYou could quite easily use exactly the same description for Hai Cenato. Jason Atherton has done it again. Hai Cenato: The lowdown More restaurants get tried and tasted \nFinal flavour: A high-octane Italian with cooking that’s less casual than the setting. \nAt what cost? Very reasonable for the quality. Small plates and pastas start at £8, and pizzas at £7. Desserts are from £6 with gelato from £3.50. The grills are a touch more expensive. \nFind it: 2 Sir Simon Milton Square, SW1E 5DJ; haicenato.co.uk .
