It claims that Jose Mourinho has been calling Neymar regularly to pitch a move to the Premier League. The calls started a few weeks ago and apparently, it’s a textbook Mourinho tactic. He builds up a rapport with players to win their trust. Neymar’s court case \nMourinho believes that there’s an opportunity to sign Neymar at the end of the season. \nThe Brazilian forward is having a bad season with Barcelona by his own high standards. Having scored a combined 70 goals over the previous two seasons, he’s only been able to follow it up with ten goals this season. \nThe reasons for his struggle in front of goal are unclear but the trial he faces for corruption charges is probably weighing heavily on his mind. It carries a potential jail sentence. \nUnited will be in the market for a forward in the coming transfer window and Neymar would be an incredible signing. They’re being linked with fellow La Liga star Antoine Griezmann, the main striker for Atletico Madrid.
