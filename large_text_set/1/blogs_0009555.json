So it’s easy to empathize with the plight of 24-year-old Nick Taylor, a poor Roseville, Michigan jamoke who received a $128 ticket from a soulless cop for literally warming his car up in the driveway.\nAdvertisement \n\nFor the record, on the day Taylor received his ticket, his area’s high temperature was 19º Fahrenheit. The low was 12º.\nFrom CBS News :\n\nAdvertisement \n\nOn a cold Michigan morning, Nick Taylor drove to his girlfriend’s house to pick her and her 2-year-old son up. \nLike many residents do in the middle of winter, Taylor left his car unlocked and running in the driveway, hoping it would warm up by the time he returned.\nBut when the 24-year-old walked back to his frosted car, he spotted a piece of paper tucked underneath his windshield: it was a $128 ticket for leaving a vehicle unattended.\nTaylor was shocked.\n“I was there for maybe seven or eight minutes before I noticed the ticket,” Taylor told CBS Detroit , adding that he was dropping off diapers in the process.\nHere is a photo of the ticket from, as Taylor eloquently put it , “Officer dipshit K”:\n\nPhoto: Facebook Roseville’s police chief, James Berlin, told clickondetroit.com that it boils down to whether your key is locked into the ignition.
