I realized that Facebook is just a black hole where your time goes. \n“Between jobs, I had a lot of spare time that I’d waste on Facebook.

Prior to that however, it was clear that Facebook was a popularity contest – people who are attractive or sociable got likes for posting anything whereas good content would go ignored if it wasn’t from one of these types.” — DownvoteGargler 9.

So I gave it a three-day test. If I didn’t see anything that I thought was useful information over that period, I would delete it. After that it wasn’t a difficult decision. I’m still not sure if it’s completely deleted as I never sent in the blood sample they wanted to fully delete my account.” — noner85 10. Found it to be a heaving pit of narcissistic wannabes. \n“I lasted about 3 weeks. Just found it to be a heaving pit of narcissistic wannabes either relishing in a false life and sense of achievement through status likes, or droning on about how bad the world is. The worst type are the bandwagon-hoppers—every time there are atrocities they are straight on it changing profile pics updating status to #prayforparis or some shit (no offense meant Parisians just an example) like they gave a flying in the first place. Guys with no tops, girls with the arch back and fish face, some pricks snotty brat whose face hasn’t been wiped in a week, all the selfie stick addicts, mugs who spend more time showing off where they are in the world rather than actually enjoying their holiday, the MOTHERFUCKERS who think they know you well enough to disrespectfully spam you day and night with Farmville. Let me tell you this from the bottom of my heart—fuck you and everything you stand for.” 11.

The morning after the election is what pushed me over the edge. \n“I had been wanting to delete it for a while, but the morning after the election is what pushed me over the edge. Every single post was either ‘You’re a racist if you voted for Trump’ or ‘Libtards think it’s the end of the world lol.’ So I decided I didn’t give a damn and went off the grid. Best part was the reaction from my friends was just like in the latest season of South Park , practically acting like I had committed suicide. That’s when I knew I had made the right choice.” 13.

Facebook has really cheapened the human experience. \n“My wife was sitting on the couch one Saturday morning with a cup of coffee and her phone, trying to wake up and start her day. I was looking at her thinking how beautiful she looked, when suddenly her face contorted in pain. She screamed ‘NO ’ and started crying hysterically. I was utterly confused and trying to console her while figuring out what the hell was going on. She handed me her phone and I saw that she was on Facebook. Her niece had posted that my wife’s 6-week-old nephew had been murdered a few hours ago. That was how my wife found out, no phone call not even a text message. I then realized that Facebook has really cheapened the human experience, it has reduced our communication with each other to impersonal blogging. I decided not to be a part of it anymore.” — TheWitcher3Sux 15. I realized that I was spending all my time my face dug in my phone. \n“I realized that I was spending all my time my face dug in my phone. Stopped it completely.” — HuseyinCinar 16. Decided that the people that liked me would find a way to speak to me. \n“An old school ‘friend’ kept moaning on Facebook about how her kids were a pain, which was no surprise seeing as she seemed to spend more time on Facebook than with her kids. Decided that the people that liked me would find a way to speak to me. Funnily enough they did, and I didn’t need Facebook.” — EdanE33 17. Went through a horrible breakup when I discovered my (ex) boyfriend had been cheating on me with multiple women. \n“Went through a horrible breakup when I discovered my (ex) boyfriend had been cheating on me with multiple women. I tortured myself for a few months, basically Internet stalking these girls and making myself feel even more inadequate. I realized if I was ever going to move on I needed to stop comparing myself to them and decided to go cold turkey. Facebook deleted. \nAfter a few months or so I thought about getting it back but actually hadn’t missed it one bit. \n6 years later and I’m just not interested! People are still shocked when I say I’m not on Facebook though. As a 26-year-old sociable female it’s almost unheard of.” — barrychucklez 18. The same crap over and over. \n“Do you ever go to the refrigerator to see if something is appealing and later on you return to see if anything is appealing as if something magically appeared…this is checking Facebook throughout the day—the same crap over and over. When I came to this realization I deleted it.” — Gman767 19. Realized that I was looking at a croissant someone I worked with years prior was having for breakfast. \n“Realized that I was looking at a croissant someone I worked with years prior was having for breakfast. That’s not how I want to spend my time.” 20. Zuckerberg is a sleaze. \n“Lack of privacy. \nLack of trust in the company. \nZuckerberg is a sleaze. \nIt’s depressing to be reminded of what I don’t have and/or haven’t achieved. \nThe politics… My friends and acquaintances have always had some views that are stupid and that’s okay, but that doesn’t mean I want to see them every day. The politics of the company itself. \nIgnoring the privacy issues, Facebook made sense in college. The jokes, the messages, information about parties, and let’s face it… gossip. But it doesn’t make sense for me 10 years later. \nI love not having Facebook. Not going back; not tempted to go back. Aside from from feeling less stress and more relaxed, it’s great to be absolved of the responsibility of knowing anything that’s posted there. Now, when friends or family start gossiping and talking trash about some bullshit drama, I just say, ‘oh I don’t have a Facebook.’ Bliss.” — RP_Fan 21. All of the data mining and privacy concerns added up. \n“All of the data mining and privacy concerns added up. Also my parents and extended family started getting upset that I wasn’t liking their photos and passing on their bullshit chain messages. Like actually getting upset with me in real life. So I fucked it right off and haven’t looked back.” — gamingchicken 22. Getting offended by something someone I hadn’t seen or talked to in over ten years posted. \n“Getting offended by something someone I hadn’t seen or talked to in over ten years posted. I thought to myself, ‘What the heck am I doing?’ That, coupled with getting tired of having to take the perfect picture when out with friends.” — ohymygoditspurple 23. It wasn’t helping me to see old exes and people I used to be close to who have moved on. \n“I deleted it as one of many steps to cure my depression. It wasn’t helping me to see old exes and people I used to be close to who have moved on, so I got rid of it and have been much happier since. Oh, and the time saved per day that isn’t wasted Facebook-surfing? I turned that into a second job. :)” — Seredhiel90 24. Someone who assaulted me in high school found me and sent a friend request. \n“Someone who assaulted me in high school found me and sent a friend request. It was the last straw in a mountain of straws and I deleted everything and left.” — anarashka 25. I’ve been battling postpartum depression for a while now and I kept having ads for it pop up. \n“I’ve been battling postpartum depression for a while now and I kept having ads for it pop up. Then there were people constantly reminding me about my husband’s death. I never made a post about it and I’d constantly get messages from people asking how he was doing; it just got to the point where it was too much for me.” — The_ocean_is_my_home 26. I didn’t like the idea that I was putting my life on display for the entire world. \n“Privacy: I didn’t like the idea that I was putting my life on display for the entire world, nor did I like the idea that weirdos and exes could just idly stalk me and my family whenever they felt like it. \nManipulation: I don’t like the power Facebook has over its users. It’s a simple matter of steering emotionally charged imagery and opinion towards people to manipulate how they think, act, and believe. I also see it as an extremely polarizing; it’s very easy to get caught up in believing you and all these strangers know THE TRUTH, while the shadowy others that disagree with you are TERRIBLE HITLERS. You never talk to someone who disagrees with you, you simply preach to the choir and circle-jerk each other’s likes. I half-joke that I got rid of FB because I got tired of hating my friends and family. \nIsolation: Social media gives the appearance of social interaction, while eliminating as much social interaction as possible. I found myself viewing friends’ pages, liking their pictures, but rarely actually visiting them or calling them up. At a certain point, lifelong friends were as real to me as celebrities or memes. That’s bizarre and horrifying. \nShady business practices: Even though I know that it was laid out to me in the contract, etc. I got more and more uncomfortable with the fact that my thoughts, communications, and images were legally owned by FB and whoever FB decided to sell them to. I didn’t like the idea that my life experiences were commodified, and I started thinking how weird it was that this is so normalized. Tell any mother to leave a box of her baby’s pictures on a park bench for anyone to take, and she’d likely be horrified…but she’ll post every baby pic she ever takes on FB. \nBalanced against the things I hate about FB, there’s…what, exactly? I tried to think about what I actually gained from FB, and I came up short. Keeping in touch with people? Email, phones and meeting up did that better. Status signaling? I don’t think surrendering all privacy for a minor ego stroke was a good deal. There’s nothing for me in that fucking trap. I’m willing to bet there’s nothing there for you, either.” — Bag_of_Drowned_Cats 27. The roaring dumpster fire that people call a news feed was too much for me. \n“The roaring dumpster fire that people call a news feed was too much for me. I like my friends, but I never wanna know their political views on things.” — iwrestledaDanaonce 28. Realized one day that I’d purged everyone. \n“Every couple of months I would do a friend ‘purge’ and either delete or hide people whose feeds annoyed me. Realized one day that I’d purged everyone…” — main-sequence-star 29. My mom died and waves of condolences I neither needed or wanted started flooding in. \n“My mom died and waves of condolences I neither needed or wanted started flooding in from people for whom I didn’t give a shit.” — BobBastrd 30. Started getting friend requests from people who hated me in high school. \n“I had it for two weeks in 2009. Started getting friend requests from people who hated me in high school. Thought ‘Fuck this shit’ and deleted it. My profile resurrected five years later and started messaging everyone about Ray-Bans. Had a quick look, saw absolutely nothing to draw me back. DRAHMAHS.” — blinky84 31. Just people posting pictures of what they eat or people with kids or newborn kid. \n“I got bored of what it had become by then. Just people posting pictures of what they eat or people with kids or newborn kid. So annoying!” 32. Going to my ex’s profile all the time. \n“Going to my ex’s profile all the time.” — jrg152 33. Seeing pics of my (ex)-gf at a house party drunk and half-naked. \n“Seeing pics of my (ex)-gf at a house party drunk and half-naked when she told me she was at her mother’s all weekend….” — phman888 34. I was intensely bullied online. \n“Well, I was fifteen when I deleted it—I’m now 22. I was intensely bullied online; groups and comments and pictures put up for the sole intent of making me feel awful about myself. There was a picture that had like 25 comments from the same nine guys just going back on forth on how I deserved to die, how ugly I was, – I’ve never actually read through them, just been told from friends. \nThe final straw was pretty much the moment I realized I couldn’t log in without feeling sick rising up from my stomach, without my heart running a marathon every time I saw ‘one new notification.’ I was like nope, and quit. And I never, ever wanted it again. \nYou get a lot of people asking why. The truth has changed over the years, actually, as to why I still don’t have it. And I never, ever mention the cyber-bullying. Who wants to see that shitty pity-face? \nAt first, yeah, it was a way for me to get away from constant anxiety, but then it turned into something else. I just didn’t want it. The people I had in my life – were the people I wanted in my life. I didn’t want access to any Tom, Dick and Harry – I wanted a little circle of people and family that I could contact via phone, a small amount of people who didn’t have to scroll through my fb to know what I was doing – they could just ask me. \nI hate pretty much all social media tbh. I think it takes valuable time from people’s lives, takes them away from the present and their friends, and takes them to another place they don’t need to be. I know I’m that annoying person that says ‘will you get off your phone’, but I’d rather be that than the dead-eyed person staring at their screen 24/7.” — emberrypie944 35. I just can’t stand how naive and stupid people are anymore. \n“A picture from an obviously fake account (pictures didn’t match and showed up on a reverse image search) of an obviously attractive young woman in a wheelchair with the caption ‘my friends say I’m ugly and nobody will share this’… \nIt was shared 80,000 times with everyone telling her how beautiful she was blah blah blah. One guy even said he would take her out on a date and publicly gave out his phone number. \nI just can’t stand how naive and stupid people are anymore. \nI know I sound like an elitist snob, but it’s mind-boggling what people believe on Facebook. The ads, constant bragging, game requests, and attention whoring…it just got to me.” 36. ‘LOOK AT ME! I AM IMPORTANT.’ \n“Facebook I like to call Fakebook. \nYou aren’t ‘keeping in touch with your friends.’ You are keeping in touch with the image of the friend that said person wants to project. You only get what they give you, and it’s all fake shit. \nAlso not to mention how self-centered it is. It’s the reason people have to take selfies with their face in it for everything they do… So they can post it and say ‘LOOK AT ME! I AM IMPORTANT.’” — TheMacPhisto 37. Insane amounts of false information. \n“Insane amounts of false information. I don’t want to read your lame-ass quote on how to be a better person. The love of my life dating my friend—you know, the usual.” 38. For me, it was the eccentric, attention-starved behavior. \n“For me, it was the eccentric, attention-starved behavior (especially Valentine’s Day). \n1. A lot of the people on my feed thought that in spite of being single that somebody owed them roses and chocolates. That’s really not how it works>:i \n2. People who post pictures and make some quip about how ‘ugly’ or ‘fat’ they were in hopes for a compliment. Miss me with that forced vanity horse shit. \n3. Way too much passive0aggressive behavior. Vague messages about who or what has your panties in a wad with no explanation in spite of the fact that you made a PUBLIC FUCKING POST! \n4. The irrational demand to be acknowledged just for the sake of it. You know, the whole, ‘Since most of you don’t care about me I’m just going to start deleting friends unless you say something.’ Go hug a fucking relative, you depraved brat. \nAnd yes, I was guilty of some of this shit, too (especially in my early 20’s which shows the difficulty of resisting toxic Internet behavior no matter who you are. I do believe it is possible to navigate social media without these annoying habits. It’s just fucking difficult.” — gettinbetter 39. All the pages that I got memes from started posting stupid shit and those godawful minion memes. \n“I never socialized with any of my 300 friends other than my sister and 4 friends. All the pages that I got memes from started posting stupid shit and those godawful minion memes. But the worst part was when the pages that gave me news about movies and stuff started posting clickbait. That pushed me to my limit and I deleted my account.” — HornyNcurious66 40. Crazy ex. \n“Crazy ex. My current SO and I were together for a while, then we weren’t for about a year, that’s when I was with the Crazy, and since then we’re back together and for good. Crazy was convinced we were somehow fated to be together and got awfully stalkery and disruptive and dealing with that kind of shit made me realize that there isn’t anyone I wanted to interact with on a regular basis that required me to use Facebook to do so. So I shit-canned the whole thing and haven’t looked back.” — Kalipygia 41. I realized that I not only wasn’t really interested in what anyone was posting, but also that they actively irritated me. \n“When I realized that I not only wasn’t really interested in what anyone was posting, but also that they actively irritated me. I had over 500 ‘friends,’ but only one or two people were posting anything worth even glancing at, and even those were hit or miss. Then the political crap started. By February 2016, I had enough. When my birthday hit in April, and NOBODY messaged me, I realized that those ‘friends’ were ephemeral at best. Facebook makes you feel better about yourself at first, because it gives you a sense of community, a sense that you belong to something greater, but then the cold reality sets in and you realize that everyone is self-absorbed and just want everyone to think that THEIR life is better than yours. I still hear my wife complaining about all the people that have such great lives, posting wonderful family pictures, but I don’t believe most of them. There were bribes, fights, and tears involved before that final postable photo.” — Aegisuv 42. I’d rather have 3 close friends than 300 Facebook friends. \n“In 2008 I friended this dude I went to grade school with. He referred to himself as a digital nomad, somehow always being able to hustle income together to be able to travel the world. Never lived in the same place for more than a year. His fb updates and pics were nothing but travel. \nFast-forward to two weeks ago. He dies in a tragic snowboarding accident. He was only 34. \nSuddenly the fb posts start flooding to his page, about what a great dude he was, how inspirational and fun he was, how he positively impacted everyone he met. \nThen this woman posts a pic to his wall. It’s a picture of him with a child and the caption is something like ‘look, I’m probably a piece of shit for posting this, but everyone needs to understand that there are two sides to every coin. This dude is a father who refused to take care of his son because he wanted to live his dream of being a nomad. His son is now 7 and has met his father 3 times.’ NO ONE KNEW this dude was a father and while that post was probably not appropriate given the circumstances, it really made me think about the number of people I think I know. This dude actually had a ton of issues he was struggling with, but he had spent so long carefully crafting his persona online that even some of his close friends didn’t know about some of the stuff he was going through. As much as the nomad lifestyle was something he was pursuing, it was also a means to run away from a lot of people and situations he didn’t want to deal with. \nIt’s getting to the point where sites like Facebook have been around long enough to truly impact our worldview and our perceptions of others. \nI’d rather have 3 close friends than 300 Facebook friends.” — toasted_rays 43. It’s such a waste of time. \n“It’s such a waste of time. Really. And it’s a breeding ground for vile conversations and debates, political and otherwise. Social media in general has dehumanized everyone to the point that nobody has tact or patience, and they’ll say whatever, whenever. Honesty is awesome, but whatever happened to ‘if you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all’? I digress. I still have a Facebook account, but only to manage my music page. I very seldom check my newsfeed anymore. \nIronically, part of my job is social media. I have a love/hate relationship with it. It’s brilliant, but terrifying. The convenience of keeping in touch and being informed = fantastic. The challenge of privacy/sanity/depression/being informed too much = enough to make me want to cut the cord at least several times a week.” 44.

I was becoming one of those crazy stay-at-home moms that would post every 10 minutes looking for attention. \n“I was becoming one of those crazy stay-at-home moms that would post every 10 minutes looking for attention. I was going through a really rough spot raising my daughter who has some developmental problems and I used Facebook as a means to socialize with anybody or just myself really. I couldn’t have a life because her immune system was compromised, so Facebook became my life. I know boohoo for you, but it happens.” — RadioIsMyFriend 47. I just got tired of all the tailored BS with the fake news and fake people. \n“I just got tired of all the tailored BS with the fake news and fake people. The fake people made me predisposed to depression and reading the ‘news articles’ that were extremely polarized (I was friends with both liberals and conservatives) made me realize that it’s all fake and biased. The real reward was a few months after I deleted fb and my veteran cousin with PTSD and strong/caustic opinions went off on my sister because she posted something about not standing for the National Anthem. I heard about it from my sister and my first reaction was ‘holy crap, that’s messed up’ followed closely by the realization that I avoided all of that drama. It was a pretty nice feeling.” — oneofthelonewolfmen 48. I deleted it after an ex-girlfriend accused me of making threats (I never made any such comments) and they notified me that my account was suspended. \n“I deleted it after an ex-girlfriend accused me of making threats (I never made any such comments) and they notified me that my account was suspended. However, they never told me the exact reason they were suspending my account (this was a BUSINESS account), only keep referring me to their terms of use. I appealed the decision and STILL only received references to the terms of use which I argued had no bearing on any behavior on my account. After 3 weeks of attempting to get them to prove that I had breached their terms in any way and STILL only receiving bot references to the terms of use, I deleted my account. \nI didn’t learn until over a year later from someone who knew my ex that she had bragged all about fucking with me by saying that I’d threatened her via Facebook.” — NHDaddy4U 49. I found that Facebook would make me really sad. \n“I found that Facebook would make me really sad. I have an obsessive nature so I would spend hours stalking people, their friends, etc., and comparing their lives to mine. My life seemed really boring in comparison. \nIt took a few deactivate-reactivate cycles to realize this, and I fully deleted my profile a year ago. I now don’t miss Facebook a bit, and looking at friends on it, I don’t think I will ever go back. It just seems weird to me now. \nI prefer to catch up with people every few months; there is often a lot to talk about since I don’t get to see every detail of their lives in real time anymore!” — Wartortl__ 50.

I felt surveilled and got out. \n“Ads started coming up in my FB feed for things referring to a condition I recently got diagnosed with. I had not googled the condition or anything like that.

I got sick of my girlfriend, who uses Facebook like 25 times a day. \n“I got sick of my girlfriend, who uses Facebook like 25 times a day, always looking over my shoulder to see if other girls were messaging me. I’m just scrolling just like she is! I deleted mine and started hacking into her FB messenger to find other guys she’s been talking to. TL;DR Deleting Facebook helped me dump my guilty ex-GF basically.” — goober_boobz 54.

Go sit on a fist.” — Meatface5 57. The addiction is in the constant need to be validated. \n“My best friend was killed in a work accident. I’m 35. It was mind-blowing to see all the people who sort of exploited it for ‘likes.’ He didn’t have many friends, but after he died, people who barely knew him were getting tribute tattoos. Those seemed like pretty expensive FB posts, or some sort of grieving-chic thing. \nAt the end of the day, Facebook is like the game The Sims , or some sort of weird arms race. People parade their poor kids and pets around for daily photoshoots. The addiction is in the constant need to be validated. People get trapped in these personas. It’s very, very sad. People sort of ‘focus test’ their entire lives now, and that’s not how good things rise to the top.” 58.

Every time I drank when I was single, I’d go on it and be really stupid. \n“Every time I drank when I was single, I’d go on it and be really stupid. I deleted it 2 years ago when I got into a relationship and haven’t looked back. I deleted Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. I keep a Twitter for political and sports breaking news, but my days are much more productive due to deleting most social media.” — cheesus_ricet 60. Final straw was every family member commenting on every status ever. \n“I was getting extremely annoyed with people sharing clickbait articles with their deranged opinions, but that was technically the first straw. Final straw was every family member commenting on every status ever. \n‘Just went out and bought Childish Gambino’s new album, hope it’s good!’ \nGrandma comments – I don’t know who that is but I love you! Mom comments – are you still listening to that Devil music? Aunt comments – did that sweater I bought you last Christmas fit? Friend with similar taste in music comments – JK he doesn’t comment because my family can’t just text me.” — SenpaiSwanky 61. It made me really gloomy at night, because I’d be watching people on Facebook have fun while I was trying to fall asleep from the painkillers. \n“My acquaintances from back in high school were posting photos of fancy dinners, beautiful sceneries from their travels, and nights out. I suffer from cystic fibrosis and pancreatic cancer so I can’t really do any of that and I don’t really have anything to offer on Facebook. It made me really gloomy at night, because I’d be watching people on Facebook have fun while I was trying to fall asleep from the painkillers. Plus, I am alone so that didn’t help – my mom passed away and I’ve lost contact with my dad. Come to think of it, I think I was just sulking because I didn’t get to live/enjoy as much as others, and it was petty of me, but either way, getting off of Facebook really helped me.” — Milkypopsicle 62. Outed as gay to my town. \n“Outed as gay to my town. Resulted in me losing my house, my job, my friends, my family. Facebook is a cesspool of gossip, drama, and fake news.” — Logical-Lizard 63. I’m a negative enough person as it is, and seeing the worst side of everyone else did not help matters. \n“I’m a negative enough person as it is, and seeing the worst side of everyone else did not help matters. On top of that, I found myself looking at endless BuzzFeed links and horribly uninformed political opinions.” — BeerBellies 64. Everything was a political fight. \n“Everything was a political fight. It turned into scrolling down and just thinking ‘That’s wrong,’ ‘That’s a stupid opinion,’ and various other negative disagreeing statements. That much negativity, even though I know was all on my part, became tiring and affected the rest of my mindset. I was over the ‘debates’ and everyone, including me, posting their crap political stances. \nThat and the creepy government intrusion, listening via Facebook to everything you say and do. Having federal agents use what you said to others in ‘“privacy’ and they picked up via your phone in court made me realize how this will all be happening in the future. I’d get rid of my cell phone if that was a viable option.” — HemingwayMouthwash 65. It’s really sad to read constantly. \n“People bragging about their success and people posting about how depressing they are because of how ‘unsuccessful’ they are. It’s really sad to read constantly.” — mtteo 66. I found myself on the verge of hating people I genuinely care about. \n“I deleted Facebook because I found myself on the verge of hating people I genuinely care about. People are not who they are on Facebook, or at least, that’s what I want to believe. Beyond that I started to hate how I would constantly go back to the app like a rat to the feeder bar. A few days after deleting it I found myself using the time that would have been spent on Facebook doing far more productive things.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:46:41.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
