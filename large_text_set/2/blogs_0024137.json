In the film, Denzel plays Troy Maxson, who juggles tense relationships with his wife Rose (Viola Davis), his brother, and his son. Struggling with coming to terms with failures in his past, he battles his demons in the present, and the impact of his actions ripples onto the lives of those nearest and dearest to him. \nLast year’s Best Supporting Actor winner Mark Rylance presented this year’s victor, praising women as being better able to “oppose without hatred.” \nThis is Viola's first Oscar and 3rd nomination. \nViola beat Naomi Harris (Moonlight), Nicole Kidman (Lion), Octavia Spencer (Hidden Figures) and Michelle Williams (Manchester by the Sea). – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
