I know his bed was used for one scene. \n“The films were released for download and not on disc. They were a cult favourite among the gay community because a lot of people knew they had been secretly shot at George’s house, and it gave buyers an extra kick.” \nGETTY DISGRACEFUL: The Wham star did not know his house was being used to film porn \nOur source said producers have stopped selling the movies since George’s death, fearing a backlash. \nWham! star George died aged 53 on Christmas Day.
