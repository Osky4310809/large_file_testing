According to a report from ETnews , LG has a different strategy set up this year. The company’s goal is to release the upcoming G6 before Samsung’s flagship devices hit markets across the world, which is rumored to happen in mid-April. \nThe report states that LG will take the wraps off the G6 on February 26 in Barcelona, one day before the official start of the Mobile World Congress . The smartphone will then go on sale less than two weeks after, on March 10, but only in South Korea. A global launch of the device will follow soon after, although a specific date has not been mentioned yet.\nSee also: LG G6 will have world’s first QHD+ display with 18:9 aspect ratio 6 hours ago LG wants to get its flagship device on the market as fast as possible in hopes of boosting sales in the first month or so before people are able to get their hands on a competitive device from Samsung and other brands like HTC. It’s not a bad idea to speed things up a bit, although one could argue that those who really want a Samsung device, won’t mind waiting an additional month to get it.\nThe high-end LG G6 is expected to come with a Quad HD OLED display, the Snapdragon 835 chipset, and at least 6 GB of RAM. Rumors also claim that the device will feature a bigger battery, which won’t be removable, a waterproof body, wireless charging, and a brand new design.\nIf you want to learn more about the device, check out our recent “LG G6: all the rumors in one place” post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T17:19:35.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
