The present curriculum of secondary education is overloaded. The requirement of writing eight or nine subjects in secondary school leaving exams, is burdensome..” \nHe said,“The idea of five credits at one or two sittings before you can progress to further studies has to be reviewed. The idea of sitting for UTME every year, irrespective of the mark you scored in previous years must be reviewed too.

I am not against the number of credits but against the number of opportunities. If it takes you 10 years to achieve that level, you should be qualified for further career education or professionalism. Not until you make it once or twice.” \nHe said as far as a student is able to make five credits, irrespective of the period the person sits for it, he should be qualified for further studies in the university. Oni who had spent over 30 years in the teaching career, revealed that he felt elevated having been retired. \n“I thank God for this day. I started as a casual teacher as far back as 1975 when I was just leaving the school. I later attended teachers college.” \nOni said that the present welfare package of teachers in Lagos is highly commendable, stating, however, that the state government must improve on it. He, however, urged teachers to obey the ethics of the profession, adding that perseverance and endurance are the key to becoming successful teachers.
