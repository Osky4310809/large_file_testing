Do not proceed if you have not watched Tuesday’s episode of This Is Us . If you have, read our full recap . Milo Ventimiglia and Mandy Moore are breaking down Jack and Rebecca's troubled relationship. \nOn Tuesday’s episode of This Is Us , the couple's marriage continued to crumble -- and the timing couldn’t have been worse. With Rebecca leaving for a five-city tour without so much as a forced kiss on the cheek from her husband, the feeling of uncertainty over the future of Jack and Rebecca’s marriage loomed large. \nRELATED: 'This Is Us': Kate Drops a Huge Bombshell About Jack's Death \n“To leave on a note of such [tension], the air in the house is just so heavy,” Moore said following the episode. “There’s so much that’s not being said between these two people and to be so completely disconnected -- and I feel like it was maybe talked around a little bit the next day, a couple days later -- and just to be leaving on this note, it’s the worst possible scenario.” “It doesn’t feel good,” the 32-year-old actress continued. “I don’t think that they’re accustomed to being in this place with one another.\" Jack and Rebecca’s inability to work through their marital issues comes at a cost, and there may not be a light at the end of the tunnel. \n“To not have that resolution or conversation of ‘We’re OK’ [is tough],” Ventimiglia said, echoing Moore’s sentiments. “But this is something that’s been bubbling up and boiling between them since Miguel and Shelley broke up. … When they are not quite connecting, it’s unnerving.” \nRELATED: 'This Is Us' Star Milo Ventimiglia Warns Final Episodes Are 'Stressful' “I almost feel like Jack and Rebecca don’t know how to see their way out of it because they’ve never really been in this situation before. I don’t think they know how to navigate these waters,” Moore added. “How do we get back [to the way things were]? How am I leaving the house and you’re not embracing me and scooping me up and giving me a big kiss and looking into each other’s eyes and saying, ‘Go out there and crush it and have the best time ever. I’m your man and I can hold it down here in the house’?” The TV couple admitted going through Jack and Rebecca’s trials and tribulations isn’t something they enjoy doing as actors, with Moore confessing those scenes weren’t “fun” to do. “We’re very tight,” Ventimiglia said of filming alongside his on-screen wife. “Our chairs are next to each other. We talk a lot in between takes and whatnot, and the days that we have to play very distant, they’re just not fun to film.” \nIn the most recent episode, we may have gotten another major clue to Jack’s death when Kate dropped a huge bombshell. “You remember when I told you I couldn’t talk about my dad’s death?” Kate told Toby, who had been dying (no pun intended) for a real conversation about Jack for a while now. “That’s because it’s my fault. I’m the reason that he’s dead.” \nRELATED: Every 'This Is Us' Clue That Tipped Us Off on Jack's Death ET was recently with Ventimiglia, where he rightly warned that the final episodes -- including Tuesday’s -- were “stressful.” “Even though things may be crumbling or in disrepair or up in the air, the skies will part, the clouds and the sun will shine again,” the 39-year-old actor said, coyly teasing that answers to Jack’s death could come sooner than expected. “It could be the next episode. It could be the second to last episode. It could be a ways away.” This Is Us airs its finale next Tuesday   For more on what Ventimiglia said, watch the video below.
