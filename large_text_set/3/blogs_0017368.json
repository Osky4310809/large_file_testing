Truth be told, I did more than that.\" \nShe detailed her experience with gospel-singing conversion groups as a teenager and said: \"How was I going to reconcile that with a gospel singing girl raised in youth groups that were pro-conversion camps? What I did know was I was curious and even then I knew sexuality wasn't as black and white as this dress.\" View Story \n\"Honestly,\" she said, \"I haven't always gotten it right but in 2008 when that song came out I knew that I started a conversation and a lot of the world seemed curious enough to sing along, too.\" \nPerry revealed that she spent a lot of time as an adolescent trying to \"pray the gay away\" in \"Jesus camps,\" but things changed for her when she entered the world of mainstream pop music. \n\"I found my gift and my gift introduced me to people outside my bubble and my bubble started to burst,\" Perry told the crowd. \"These people were nothing like I had been taught to fear. They were the most free, strong, kind and inclusive people I have ever met.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T17:13:31.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
