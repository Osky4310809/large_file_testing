She took a deep breath, turned the handle and waited for the terror to begin, again. \nFor days, Aswad had relived the sexual assault she endured at the hands of an ex-boyfriend in her downtown Denver apartment. \n“I simply dreaded going home, and then being there,” the 36-year-old said of the assault four years ago. “And then I was too terrified to leave once I was inside.” \nAswad asked her apartment manager about breaking her lease. Her assailant, she explained, knew her home, knew her life patterns, knew her. But the answer was no. \n“It wasn’t a very secure building; he was always getting in the front door behind other people,” Aswad said. “I’d hear the elevator ding and it sent me spiraling.” \nAswad is among a group of sexual assault victims who advocates say are victimized daily by familiar surroundings that not only carry the memories of their lives, but the horrors of their attacks. Except for victims of domestic abuse — people who share a domicile — those who are sexually assaulted or targets of stalking are bound by their leases regardless of the dangers they might face. \nRep. Dominique Jackson, an Aurora Democrat, is sponsoring a bill that would allow such victims to break their leases under certain circumstances. HB 17-1035 has passed the full House and heads to the Senate Judiciary Committee for hearings Wednesday. \n“The victims are deeper than just those in a relationship,” Jackson said. “You don’t hear from those victimized by their caregivers, or others who are highly regarded or hold positions of power. You don’t hear about the victimization by the landlords themselves.” \nNo room to move \nAswad said she was stunned that her apartment manager would not let her out of the lease. \n“She said there was nothing she could do for me. If I broke the lease, I would be responsible for the six or seven months left,” Aswad recalled. “At more than $800 a month, and the loss of a security deposit, I couldn’t afford that.” \nHaving just come out of minor surgery — which had been aggravated by the assault — and subsisting on a $15-an-hour, part-time job while working on an undergraduate degree, Aswad understood her financial prospects were bleak. \nAnother week of sleepless nights on the living room floor passed before Aswad tried again. “I couldn’t bear to be in my own bedroom, to touch anything he had touched,” she said. \nShe asked the landlord if she could move to another apartment in the building, but got the same answer. It would cost money to clean up the apartment and ready it for re-renting. Andy Cross, The Denver Post Artist Michelle Aswad, a sexual assault victim, puts final touches on her pencil drawing of Colorado Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado at her home March 07, 2017. The drawing was started after her assault and is a therapeutic an outlet for her. Aswad and other sexual assault victims and stalking victims are pressing Colorado legislation to allow victims to break free from their lease to distance themselves from further threats. \nDocuments required \nTo protect against potential fraud, Jackson’s bill, co-sponsored by Sen. John Cooke, R-Greeley, requires that anyone seeking to break their lease provide one of three documents: a police report or protection order; a statement from a medical professional confirming the victim’s status; or a statement from the state’s address confidentiality program that the victim has applied for help. \nAttorney Deborah Wilson, a member of the Apartment Association of Metro Denver who also represents landlords, told legislators she supported the measure in theory but had concerns about potential abuse. \n“As drafted, it incentivizes people to make false claims to try to get out of their lease,” she testified. “The threshold for proof is very low, where someone can go to a doctor and make a self-serving statement … and I can see a lot of people doing that.” \nCommittee vice chairman Rep. Joe Salazar, D-Thornton, bristled. \n“Would you rather a victim wait to suffer an assault before you take action, and if so, would you be willing to accept all the liability of that?” he asked Wilson. “Or break their lease and (allow them to) move to a safer place? … The vacancy rate is 5.4 percent in the Denver metro area, so it doesn’t seem like landlords are having a hard time finding new tenants.” \nThere are no hard numbers of how many sexual assault victims are turned away by landlords refusing to break a lease, Jackson admits, nor those locked behind their own apartment doors fearful of the person stalking them.
