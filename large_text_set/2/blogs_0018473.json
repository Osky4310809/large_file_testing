The awards are organised by The Arsenal Foundation’s charity partner Willow, who create uplifting special days for seriously ill young adults. We have been working with Willow for many years through donations totaling over £400,000 , welcoming special day beneficiaries to Emirates Stadium on a matchday and visits to our training ground to create special moments and memories for seriously ill young people and their families.Willow was founded by former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson and his wife Megs, in memory of their daughter Anna. Bob is also an Arsenal Foundation Ambassador.For more information about the awards visit willowfoundation.org.uk   21 Feb 2017 Find out how you can follow our coverage of our Premier League 2 match against Chelsea at Colney on Friday Features Access to all Arsenal Player VideosReceive the digital member e-newsletter Email Address or Arsenal Membership number Red, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Junior Gunner Members should log in using your membership number Password Forgotten Password?
