Since January, Baltimore, Tulare, Calif.; Ithaca, N.Y.; Travis County, Texas; Iowa City, Iowa; and Boulder, Colo., have publicly announced their intentions to not honor ICE detainers. \nThe report noted that ICE field offices have been instructed to continue issuing detainers on all removable aliens in law enforcement custody regardless of prior non-cooperation. As a result, the report states, the number of issued detainers will increase over the next several reporting periods. \nThe report comes days after Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatened to pull federal funding from cities that refuse to comply with federal immigration law. \n“Such policies cannot continue,\" he said Monday. \"They make our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on the street.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-01T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:50:23.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
