Second, honey you ain’t the only one with ‘struggles.’ You want pity go to a one leg support group!”\nAshely Brady, 26, who lost her leg in an accident last year, is able to walk thanks to a prosthetic limb. However, she still struggles with snow, ice and the three flights of stairs to her apartment.\nBrady eventually asked the management of her apartment complex to create a handicap parking space that she could use to make her walks easier. The spot was just installed on Thursday, though her neighbor has apparently not wasted time trying to take advantage of it.\nBrady left a note, which she called “stern” and “confident,” to inform her neighbor of her reserved spot. Brady also explained that the neighbor can’t understand what it’s like to walk on one leg.\n“I let the office know the cry baby one leg touches my property I will cause trouble,” the letter went on, “so go cry your struggles to someone who cares casue I’m walking away with both mine!”\nBrady has since shared the letter on Facebook in hopes of shaming her neighbor. She has also complained to the apartment complex’s management and filed a complaint with police. \n\nHey handicap! First, never place your hands on my car again! Second, honey you ain’t the only one with “struggles.” You want pity go to a one leg support group! You messed with the wrong one! I don’t care what your note said shove it, but you touch my car again I will file a report, I am not playing! I let the office know the cry baby one leg touches my property I will cause trouble so go cry your struggles to someone who cares cause I’m walking away with both mine! -[Expletive] \nSources:  Inquisitir ,  Yahoo News  / Photo Credit: Facebook\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T13:03:56.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
