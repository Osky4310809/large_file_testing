It's already dug a burrow, so take the spider down while it's still alive. [The wasp] will then lay a single egg in it, the baby will hatch out and then it'll start to eat the spider alive,\" he added. \n\"It eats the spider bit by bit, leaving the vital organs last so it'll stay alive for longer.\" It could take days for the wasp to finish it meal. Eww.\nWhile the insect is found broadly around Australia, fortunately for humans they're not super aggressive â€” although their stings do hurt. \nBONUS: Keep calm with this wristband that emits comforting heartbeat-like vibrations", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T04:31:08.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
