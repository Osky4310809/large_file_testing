Pablo Hernandez of Leeds United in action (Photo: Nathan Stirk) \nSouleymane Doukara was guilty of pulling down Sam Hutchinson in the area but Jordan Rhodes’s spot-kick was tipped on to the post by Robert Green. \nHere are the five things we learned from the match: Wood was too hot to handle \nLeeds United front man Chris Wood is enjoying one of the best seasons of his career and his performance here today highlighted why he is one of the division’s hottest strikers. \nThe New Zealander tucked home his 20th league goal of the season and 23rd in all competitions from close range with ice-cold composure to break the deadlock. \nHis goals have been instrumental in propelling Gary Monk’s men into the top six and he’s accountable for almost half of their league tally this season. Pontus Jansson of Leeds United tackles Fernando Forestieri (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nHowever, it’s not just his goals that make him so important for Leeds. His all-round play and strength caused centre half Vincent Sasso all manner of problems and even led to the defender being booked in the first half after he turned him on the halfway line. \nIf Leeds are to realise their ambition this season, Wood’s form in the final 13 games is going to be crucial. Both teams look odds-on for a top six finish \nThere may be 12 games still to go but it would take an almighty collapse by one of these two teams for them not to finish in the top six. \nUnder Gary Monk, Leeds are enjoying their best season since dropping out of the Premier League 13 years ago and have been a staple fixture in the top six. Kyle Bartley of Leeds United gestures (Photo: Nathan Stirk) \nThe Owls have been here before, having reached the play-off final last season and have the experience of coping with the pressure of a Championship run-in. Home is where the heart is for Leeds \nElland Road for a long time in recent years has not been the fortress it once was in English football but Monk has changed that this season. \nLeeds have one of the best home records in the division and have lost just two of their last 15 league games on home soil. \nThere is now a real belief that this sleeping giant is slowly awakening after more than a decade outside the top flight.

Strong case for the defence \nWhile striker Chris Wood will take the plaudits for notching his milestone goal, Leeds had their defensive unit and keeper Robert Green to thank for the victory. \nThe former England keeper produced a superb stop, diving low to his left, to deny Jordan Rhodes from the penalty spot nine minutes after the restart. \nHowever, the whole back four of Luke Ayling, Kyle Bartley, Pontus Jansson and Gaetano Berardi were outstanding in the second half as The Owls pushed for an equaliser. \nMake no mistake, the foundations for victory were laid at the back. Wednesday fire power the envy of most teams \nWednesday may be the lowest scorers of all the teams in the top six but they have a strike force that will be the envy of many managers in the division. Fernando Forestieri of Sheffield Wednesday attempts an over-head kick (Photo: Nathan Stirk) \nStriker Jordan Rhodes and Fernando Forestieri began the day up front for Carlos Carvalhal’s team and would be first choice in almost any team in the division. \nHowever, in such a demanding league, strength in depth is crucial and Carvalhal had that in abundance with former Sunderland man Steven Fletcher and January signing Sam Winnall on the bench. \nAdd Gary Hooper to that list and it’s easy to see why they are not short of attacking options. \nCarvalhal will need all of these players in the run-in if the Owls are to try and go one better than last season. \nWednesday were much better after the break but could not find an equaliser after stout defending from the hosts.
