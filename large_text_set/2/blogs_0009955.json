(Courtesy Union Kitchen) Union Kitchen Grocery wants to be your new corner store. In a city where CVS and 7-Eleven plop down locations separated by what you could barely call a stone's throw, that sounds like a tall order. But Union Kitchen Grocery is working on it.\n\"We really see our radius as being two or three blocks,\" said Cullen Gilchrist, co-founder of Union Kitchen , the food business incubator in NoMa that counts the store in its portfolio of ventures. The goal is to be within easy reach of potential customers. \"We want to come where they are.\"\n[ Union Kitchen gives small food businesses a space to call their own ]\nThe second location of the shop opens Monday in Shaw at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. It's about twice the size of the original storefront near Union Station.\nThe additional space means the store can expand its prepared food options beyond sandwiches, the selection of which includes an Italian sub, bulgogi banh mi and a new Philly roast pork. In the mornings, expect a yogurt bar and hot breakfast bar with oatmeal and eggs. For lunch and dinner, those spaces will transform into a salad bar and a counter serving rotating specials with Indian, American comfort food, Caribbean, Chinese and Italian fare. Think dishes along the lines of butter chicken, meatloaf, lasagna, ropa vieja and beef with broccoli.\nAlso in the carryout portion of the operation: a self-serve nitro draft bar, featuring soda, cold brew coffee and Vietnamese iced coffee. The espresso bar menu will serve made-to-order drinks, which, like some of those at the nitro bar, will be made with the District's Compass Coffee.\nThe other half of the store will be for shopping. One of the store's goals is to showcase Union Kitchen members and make it easy for shoppers to engage with the local scene, whether they're out-of-towners here for a convention or residents who may not be familiar with the goods being made nearby. There will be more than 200 products from more than 100 area businesses, including cocktail bitters from Embitterment, fruit-flavored ketchups from 'Chups, kombucha from Capital Kombucha and ice cream from Milk Cult and Ice Cream Jubilee.\nGilchrist knows members can't supply everything people may want in a corner store run, so the total inventory of more than 1,000 items will also include such necessities as flour, paper goods and good old Coca-Cola.\n\"We want to be fast,\" he said. \"We want to be convenient.\"\nUnion Kitchen Grocery, 1251 Ninth St. NW. Open 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekdays and 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekends.\nRead more:\n- Why Shaw was the District's best dining neighborhood of 2016\n- Where to dine around the Walter E.
