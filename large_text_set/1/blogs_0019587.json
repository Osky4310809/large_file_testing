Limbaugh criticized the demonstration by saying that the marchers had no explanations for their protest except that the didn’t like Trump’s remarks about grabbing women “by the pussy.” \n“Is that how delicate? Is that how sensitive? Is that how fragile these women are, really, after years and years of feminism?” Limbaugh asked. \nLimbaugh went on to say that celebrity speakers like Madonna and Ashley Judd were “having a little temper tantrum” because they can’t accept Trump won and that the Democrats are currently in a state of disarray: \n“Donald Trump hasn’t done anything but utter a bunch of words and win an election, and these women simply can’t take it, from Madonna to Ashley Judd. I mean, it’s embarrassing. But, folks, it’s not gonna rebuild the Democrat Party. And they can’t even tell you what they’re doing it for. They’re just having a little temper tantrum.” \nListen above, via The Rush Limbaugh Show .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:47:34.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
