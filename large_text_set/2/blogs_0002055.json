Lights show by Steven McKenzie Image copyright Thinkstock \nIf you have been lucky enough to see the Northern Lights you won't need to be told how awe inspiring the displays can be. \nGrowing up in deepest rural Aberdeenshire my mum would often tell me at breakfast how wonderful the aurora had been the night before. \n\"Why didn't you wake me up?\" I'd whine, only to be told the \"lights\" had \"come on\" well after my bed-time. \nWhen eventually I was old enough to be up a bit later and caught sight of the aurora I found myself riveted to the spot. \nIt was on a cold night and the temperature was below freezing, but I didn't notice the cold. I was transfixed by a giant curtain of light, being tugged into rippling movement by a silent wind and of colours that changed from bright green to deep purple. \nI stood staring up at the Northern Lights until my hands were blue with cold and my neck ached...and my mum had shouted at me for the umpteenth time it was time to come inside. \nReading University's Dr Mathew Owens, whose study of the aurora with Prof Mike Lockwood has been published in the journal Scientific Reports, said activity on the sun was reducing. \nHe said: \"The magnetic activity of the sun ebbs and flows in predictable cycles, but there is also evidence that it is due to plummet, possibly by the largest amount for 300 years. \n\"If so, the Northern Lights phenomenon would become a natural show exclusive to the polar regions, due to a lack of solar wind forces that often make it visible at lower latitudes.\" Image copyright Solar Dynamics Observatory, NASA Image caption The image taken by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory last year \nScientists have been observing the decline in activity on the sun for some time. \nTowards the end of last year, Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft recorded Earth's nearest star hitting its lowest level of solar activity since 2011. \nThe Solar Dynamics Observatory captured an image of the sun showing it almost completely clear of sunspots, indicators of activity on the star.
