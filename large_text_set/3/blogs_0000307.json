Besides SRK, his other regular clients include Varun Dhawan, Ajay Devgn, Abhishek Bachchan, and Alia Bhatt. While Shah Rukh trains with Prashant all the time, he normally does so at his state-of-the-art home gym. But yesterday, Shah Rukh visited Prashant's gym in Bandra, Body Sculptor, instead. Not only was he impressed by the gym's amenities, but also the fact that they serve healthy meals there as well. The actor even put up a video on Twitter, about his experience. Check it out, here. Went to Body Sculptor Bandra first time. Worked out & they serve healthy dinner too. pic.twitter.com/vqaq1cbJtP â€” Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) February 28, 2017 Image credit: Prashant Sawant on Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T08:27:06.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
