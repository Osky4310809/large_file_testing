By Alyssa Bailey Mar 24, 2017 Last August, a longtime stalker of Kendall Jenner's was arrested after following her inside the gates of her Hollywood Hills home and banging on her car window while she was in the vehicle. Jenner was able to get a restraining order but had to later testify in court about the incident. She reportedly told the judge that October , \"I've never been so scared in my life.\" Jenner has now recounted the full details of that night on Keeping Up With the Kardashians , along with how much it affected her. \"I used to be the one who was so independent, I was always kind of by myself in a good way but now it's like fully flipped,\" she told her mother Kris Jenner and Scott Disick in the clip. Then she broke down exactly what happened: \nSo I came home one night and there was a guy sitting on the side of my street. And I was like, 'That's so weird. Like, he just looked like a homeless man sitting on his knees like this [Kendall buries her face in her knees] in the street so I'm like \"That's weird.\" So I drove around and went into my house and I watched the gate close. I turn my car off, getting my stuff together, I'm about to open my door and I look in my rear view mirror and he was standing right there. I saw his figure, in the gate, right behind my carâ€¦ \nI'm freaking out. He goes, \"I need to talk to you,'\"and I was like \"No, like you need to leave.\" And I called one of my friends immediately. I'm sobbing, crying. He's at my window, banging at my window screaming at me so I finally start backing out and I get to my gate, the gate opens, and I get out, and then all of a sudden he starts running after me. At that moment is when my friends pull up and they had him sit on the curb and we waited for the police to come and I'm like crying, I'm like freaking out.   Jenner ultimately was granted a five-year restraining order against McKenzie. According to Fox News , in October the jury acquitted McKenzie of stalking charges (under the argument that there was no evidence that he intended to cause Jenner fear) but charged him with misdemeanor trespassing. He reportedly was sentenced to 178 days in county jail in November .
