The teams combined for 35 hits, including five home runs. Two of the dingers were grand slams, one by Colorado’s Stephen Cardullo off of former Rockies reliever Boone Logan , the other by the Indians’ Giovanny Urshela off fifth-starter candidate German Marquez. \nFor starters: Rookie right-hander Jeff Hoffman , competing for the fifth spot in the rotation, pitched two scoreless innings, allowed two hits, struck out one and hit one batter. \n“I think the last time out there were some tough, unlucky moments, but I thought I threw the ball pretty well,” he said. “I felt good today, but I got myself in a tough spot there, but I was able to work out of it.” \nHoffman gave up a single to Tyler Naquin in the second and hit Yandy Diaz, but got Richie Shaffer to foul out and induced a double play grounder from Urshela. \n“Hoffman showed some good stuff,” manager Bud Black said. “He’s pumped up about where he is. We view him as a starter moving forward, either out of camp, or at some time. But he’s shown up well so far.” John Leyba, The Denver Post GOODYEAR, AZ – MARCH 03: Colorado Rockies left fielder Gerardo Parra (8) spits out water in the dugout after his first inning score against the Cleveland Indians at Goodyear Ballpark on March 3, 2017 in Goodyear, Arizona.
