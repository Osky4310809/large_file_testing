Rex Harrison starred in a 1967 movie version of the story that won a couple Oscars, and Eddie Murphy starred in a reboot and its sequel in 1998 and 2001. And this new movie will, presumably, be another total reboot that’s designed to reintroduce the “guy who talks to animals” story to a new generation. \nThis news comes from Variety , which adds that Gold director Stephen Gaghan will direct from his own screenplay. Gaghan previously wrote both Traffic and Syriana , and he won an Emmy for his work on NYPD Blue , so this sounds like a weirdly prestigious lineup for a Doctor Doolittle movie, but that probably doesn’t mean that this will be a hard-edged, serious take on the subject matter. After all, everybody needs to make a movie they can show to their kids from time to time. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:39:41.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
