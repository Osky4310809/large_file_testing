I’m not saying we didn’t need a whole Fast and the Furious franchise, but I really don’t think we’re on the seventh sequel because some artist felt his story wasn’t finished being told. Sequels are dumb, and most are best left forgotten ... and yet, there are some that actually outshine their predecessors, and here they are! Ouija 2: Origin of Evil \nThe first Ouija was boring and forgettable, but somehow Ouija 2: Origin of Evil is scarier and way more interesting than the first. Just skip the first one, don’t worry you’ll be able to understand the story without it. Evil Dead 2 \nEvil Dead 2 is basically just a rehashing of Evil Dead , and that movie is great . So how can Evil Dead 2 be better? Well, it has more gore, more violence, more demons, more laughs, but most importantly, more Bruce Campbell eating up the scenery. Hellboy 2: The Golden Army \nHellboy 2: The Golden Army dove deep into the incredibly beautiful, fun and inventive world of Hellboy. Every aspect of the first Hellboy was kicked up a notch, from the story to the special effects to the acting. Though the original Hellboy is fun, its sequel is far superior. Even if you didn’t like the original, you should give Hellboy 2 a watch. Harry Potter \nMaybe it's because each book gets better and better, but I feel like every movie in the Harry Potter series is better than the last. They just build on each other so you’re sucked deeper and deeper into this magical world. The characters become more alive with each movie and the stakes get higher and there’s always some cool magic that outshines the previous movie. Aliens \nThat’s right i said it. Come at me! \nDid I miss any dope sequels?
