King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 10 hours ago 9 \nSteven Wilson revealed he's absolutely not a fan of attending live shows, stressing that while he absolutely enjoys live music, he simply can't stand the \"claustrophobic\" atmosphere of live shows. And the smell too. \nThe musician told journalist Jarrett Bellini : \"One of the problems with being a touring musician is that when someone invites you to a show, it's kind of the last thing you wanna do. \n\"It's like someone saying to you on a Saturday night, 'Hey, you wanna go hang out in the office?' \n\"I don't go to live shows, I don't really enjoy the experience of live shows, but that's not to say I don't appreciate great live music - of course I do, and I'm very committed to live music. \n\"But for me to go to a live show, it has to be something extraordinary. I would go and see Prince or I would go and see a friend's band, but I'm not scanning the listings to see who's playing live. \n\"To be honest, it's tough for me to enjoy that whole kind of experience.\" \nAsked whether he feels that way \"because of the way crowds are now at live shows or because you're hyper-critical as a musician,\" Steven replied: \n\"All of the above. Just the whole idea of going to a venue, hanging out in a dark room with the smell of beer and sweat, and the volume and everything. I'm a bit claustrophobic anyway, I don't like to be in crowds. \n\"I like to be up on stage, but I don't envy looking down - crushed people, that's not my idea of fun. I would say it's because I'm old, but I was like that when I was young too; I didn't really enjoy that kind of claustrophobic atmosphere of being in a crowd at a concert or a festival.\" Steven has a new, yet-untitled studio album tentatively set for release this September.
