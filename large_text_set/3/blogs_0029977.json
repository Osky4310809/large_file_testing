China bans parents from 'luring children into religion' in province \nThey also prohibit the “abnormal growing of beards and naming of children to exaggerate religious fervour”, without giving specifics. \nIt will be forbidden to “reject or refuse radio, television and other public facilities and services”, marrying using religious rather than legal procedures and “using the name of Halal to meddle in the secular life of others”. \nRules published in state-controlled media continue: “ Parents should use good moral conduct to influence their children , educate them to revere science, pursue culture, uphold ethnic unity and refuse and oppose extremism.” \nThe document also bans not allowing children to attend regular school, not abiding by family planning policies and deliberately damaging legal documents. \nSuccessive bans on select \"extremist behaviours\" have previously been introduced in in areas of Xinjiang, including stopping people with headscarves, veils and long beards from boarding buses in at least one city.

China expels French journalist, accusing her of 'supporting terrorism' \nThe popularity of Islamic veils including the niqab and burqa, which cover the face, has been rising among Uyghurs in recent years, in what experts say is an expression of opposition to Chinese controls. \nHuman Rights Watch’s 2017 world report accused Beijing of increasing “restrictions on fundamental human rights and pervasive ethnic and religious discrimination”, noting that details of “counter-terror” operations are scarce. \nTravel restrictions increased when passports were recalled last year, with authorities requiring applicants to provide a DNA sample, fingerprints, a voice recording, and a “three-dimensional image”. \nLocal authorities have previously banned Muslim civil servants, students, and teachers from fasting and instructed restaurants to stay open during the holy month of Ramadan. \nAmnesty International said the move, as well as a crackdown on “unauthorised” Muslim prayer gatherings, constituted violations of freedom of religion. \nDozens of students and writers have been arrested under a “counter-terror law” brought in last year and critics of government policy have been jailed. \nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T14:46:39.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
