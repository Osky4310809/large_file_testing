(Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP) \n(This weekend’s ice storm reminded Bill McClellan of this column, which appeared in 1991.) \nSaturday morning, and the children were already watching cartoons. I fixed some coffee and threw open the back door to let the dogs out. The fat dog slipped on the ice and ended up on her back, like a bug. As she tried to right herself, I stood at the top of the stairs laughing. My laughter attracted the kids. “Look at Tia,” I said. “Hahahaha.” \nFinally, she righted herself and threw me a hateful glance. \nAfter letting the dogs back in, I decided to get the paper. I thought briefly about putting on my clothes, or at least my shoes, but decided not to bother. After all, I was wearing my robe. Out the front door I went. \nNo wonder Tia had slipped. A sheet of ice was covering everything. Gingerly, I made my way down the steps. I crossed the lawn, and very carefully went down the small incline that leads to the sidewalk. I picked up the paper and headed back. \nBut I couldn’t get back up the mountain. At least that’s what the incline seemed like. It’s only about three feet, and it never seemed particularly steep before, but I couldn’t get back up. Meanwhile, my bare feet were beginning to get very cold. \nAgain, I tried to get up the incline, and again, I slipped back. My feet were now very cold, too cold. I sat down on the ice-covered sidewalk and rubbed my feet. I gave myself a pep talk and tried again to get up the incline. One step up, and then I slid back down. \nIf Jack London had ever written a script for Chevy Chase, this would have been it. \nWhen I looked up at the window — if only my wife were aware of what was happening — the only face that was visible belonged to Tia. She was sitting on the couch, watching me. Perhaps the cold was beginning to get to me, but it looked as if she was laughing. \nShe was laughing! \nNo, she wasn’t. It was another face that was laughing. Two other faces. The children! \nI hugged myself to pantomime that I was cold. I sat on the sidewalk and rubbed my feet. I hugged myself again. \nNow the children were applauding! \nIn a sense, this was my fault. Several days earlier, the children had complained about the cold, and to show them what a He-Man their father is, I ran outside without a shirt on. I danced around in the cold while they stood at the window cheering. \nObviously, that had been a bad idea. Now, in my moment of need, the kids thought I was trying to amuse them. I was beginning to get very, very cold. \nDesperation led to an idea. If I were to take my robe off, and use it as a carpet, perhaps I could get up the incline. But if I were to take off my robe, I’d be really cold. Furthermore, I’d be opening myself to a criminal charge. I’d be exposing myself. \nAnd what if I were to slip and knock myself out? Without my robe on, I’d be a goner in minutes. Then I’d really be in trouble. I know a lot of prosecutors, and I know how they work. In my mind, I heard the closing argument in the case against me. “He’s charged with exposing himself. And what does the death certificate say he died from? Exposure!” \nI glanced back up at the window, and wonder of wonders, the children’s laughter had awakened my wife. I was saved! \nBut wait. A closer look revealed that something was wrong. My wife was crying. I stared at the window. She was crying because she was laughing so hard. Obviously, she didn’t know how desperate my situation was. I hugged myself. \nShe applauded! \nI sat back down on the sidewalk to rub my feet. Moments later, my wife came out. She was wearing her coat, and her boots, and she was carrying towels. From the top of the incline, she threw me the towels, and I managed to crawl up the hill. \nI walked into the house, and the children applauded. Tia, who looked vaguely disappointed, rolled over and went to sleep. \nBill McClellan • 314-340-8143", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:36:24.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
