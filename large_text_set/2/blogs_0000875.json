‘Valor’ From ‘Beauty and the Beast’ EP \nBill Haber to executive produce project written by Kyle Jarrow Linda Ge | February 2, 2017 @ 4:45 PM \nThe CW has added military drama “Valor” to its pile of pilots for the upcoming season. \nWritten and executive produced by Kyle Jarrow, “Valor” is about how the boundaries between military discipline and human desire are tested on a US Army base that houses an elite unit of helicopter pilots trained to perform clandestine international and domestic missions. \nThe drama unfolds in the present as well as in flashbacks to a failed mission involving one of the first female pilots in the unit, ultimately uncovering layers of personal and government/military secrets, and leading to a season-long plan to rescue a group of MIA soldiers.

The CBS Studios project joins the Lucy Hale-led dramedy “Life Sentence,” a “Dynasty” reboot, beauty-pageant drama “Insatiable,” from “Dexter” alum Lauren Gussis and sci-fi “Searchers,” from “The 100” showrunner Jason Rothenberg and Greg Berlanti. 17 Breakout TV Stars to Watch for In 2017, From Ricky Whittle to Rose Leslie (Photos) \nAnother year, another crop of TV stars ready to steal audiences' hearts and attentions.
