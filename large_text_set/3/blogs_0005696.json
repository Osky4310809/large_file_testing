Old Believers often live in very isolated communities (file photo) (Photo: Getty) \nThe Old Believers are branch of Christians that split from the Russian Orthodox church in the 17th Century. \nMen do not shave their beards, believing it is a serious sin. \n\"They didnâ€™t tell me it was a one-way ticket,\" Yelizaveta said. \n\"They lied to me and sent me there. We got to the monastery and I lived there for 15 years.\" \nYelizaveta said she wasn't physically abused but had to live a very strict life, spending her time collecting firewood or ploughing fields by hand. \nShe also developed asthma and said the Old Believers said she there was no cure and she had to die. \nYelizaveta fled one night while others were sleeping and made her way to another village, The Times reports. \nShe managed to get help to make her way back to Moscow and get a new passport to fly back to Seattle aged 32.
