It seems absurd that this is even being debated, because because we’ve come so far toward equality that it would be devastating to turn backwards now.\nAnne Hathaway posted an illustration on Instagram that captures the issue perfectly, and raises awareness about the struggle that transgender youth go through in just having a safe place to go to the bathroom. Her accompanying message is just as thought-provoking.\n. Grown Ups: Exercise your compassion and get your head out of your fear. TransKids: Everything is going to be okay, and this is not your fault. You are 100% normal and you matter. Non-Trans Kids: Please listen to your light and do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Let’s put our best foot forward and join in.\nToday is #ElectionDay! Have you made your voice heard yet?
