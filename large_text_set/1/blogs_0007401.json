It's already been announced that Samurai Jack would be airing new episodes in 2017, as the series has been revived for a fifth season. These new episodes will help to conclude the story of the warrior. \nWhile the new episodes have no solid premiere date - other than sometime this year - Adult Swim has revealed that the classic cartoon will be making its return to their lineup much sooner than you think. (Photo: Cartoon Network ) \nStarting next week, January 14th at 8:30 pm, the network will be re-airing the original Samurai Jack series. Beginning with episode one, the series will air each week, during that Saturday 8:30 timeslot, each and every week. \nSamurai Jack originally aired on Cartoon Network in 2001, and the show ran for four seasons. Over the course of its run, Samurai Jack aired 52 episodes, and was a critical darling. The show actually earned four primetime Emmy awards during its original run. \nThe story follows Jack, as he uses a magical katana - passed on to him by his father - to fight off the evil spirti Aku. While taking place in Japan, and having an incredibly heavy Japanese influence, Samurai Jack was produced and recorded in America. \nThe new season of the show will be slightly darker than the original, but will find a way to capture the original heart and tone. Creator Genndy Tartakovsky is returning to make the new season. \nIt looks like adult swim is airing the episode to prepare fans for the new season, as well as continue to build hype for the revival. \nIf you hadn't noticed, it's totally working.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:03:12.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
