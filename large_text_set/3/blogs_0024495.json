He was on his way to a delivery when he spotted a dog wandering around a very busy and dangerous street. He found the dog and brought him to his car realizing he had a name tag that said Mr. Snickers. Turns out the dog was only a few miles from home so he brought Mr. Snickers on his delivery. 2 \nThe people waiting for their pizza weren’t mad about the delay, in fact they thought it was awesome. After the delivery he dropped Mr. Snickers off at home and he’s safe and sound! 3 \nSteven told Buzzfeed, “When I started getting close to his house, he kind of perked up and was looking around…wagging his tail, he knew he was about to be home.” 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T21:05:16.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
