There are not thought to be any problems with his application but it is unclear whether the process will be completed in time for Milivojevic to play against Stoke on Saturday. \nAllardyce needs Milivojevic to make an impact with Palace in the relegation zone after their 4-0 defeat to Sunderland. “He will bring a bit of stability into midfield,” said Allardyce. “You can get through it too easily at times. You saw that against Sunderland.” Crystal Palace have been 'dragged' back into the relegation battle \nResponding to jeers from the Palace fans following the 4-0 home defeat to Sunderland, Allardyce added: “It’s an emotional game and fans get very emotional when they see us turn out the sort of performance we did. \n“We don’t want them to react like that but in many ways you can understand it. Fans will show their disapproval when they’ve paid their money – not that way. The booing I expected, and rightly so. But they shouldn’t be jumping over on to the pitch and confronting a player.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:02:33.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
