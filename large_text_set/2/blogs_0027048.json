Nothing much to see in the latter, just the standard Volvo iron mark emblem and vertical chrome slats. \nThe rear lights are slightly more interesting. From yesterday’s side profile shot, we already know that the tail lamps are vertical and trace the angle of the tailgate, a typical Volvo XC cue. Now, we get to see the light signature pattern, which is divided into two chambers. Also, unlike the XC90’s lights that only wraparound the tailgate, the XC60’s lights curve into the hatch as well, like the V90 . \nExpect a larger footprint and a longer wheelbase from Volvo’s midsize SUV, which like the XC90 , will sit on the firm’s new Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform. Volvo’s downsizing push mean that the largest petrol and diesel engines will be 2.0 litre turbos. There could be a T5 three-cylinder hybrid system, too. \nShould the cabin of the new XC60 also follow the style of the XC90 – large central screen with AC vents as wings, high centre console – it will bring fresh style into a segment that includes the new Audi Q5 , Mercedes-Benz GLC and the soon to be replaced BMW X3 . \nThe XC60 has been around in current form since 2008, so a replacement is long overdue. Volvo has said that it will also reveal the all-new XC40 this year . This jigsaw puzzle will be completed next week at the Geneva Motor Show.
