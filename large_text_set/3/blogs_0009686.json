I said in reference to my son: ‘Does Jackson know?’ She said: ‘Yes, he knows now, they weren’t going to tell Jackson because he would go and tread on someone’s toes and end up dead himself’.\n“Sometime later I recall Jackson being on the telephone one night talking to a mate about taking [the girl] and another girl to a movie.\n\n“I said to him: ‘Keep away from her, she’s bad news – you know what I’m talking about’. My son said: ‘Who told you?’”\nMarilyn also said in the statement that the girl had a friend place a note on her son’s coffin.\n“At the funeral [the girl] was present and she had a letter or a poem or something of that nature which she wanted placed in the grave,” she said. “She had one of her other mates [do it]… and I remember thinking at the time that that seemed very strange because [my son] couldn’t stand her.”\nView this image › \nMark Haines. Allan Clarke / BuzzFeed \nID: 10668239 Marilyn gave permission at the time for the coffin to be exhumed in order to retrieve the note, but this never occurred.\n\nFollowing the funeral, she spoke with Mr X about the rumours she had heard about the girl.\n“After talking to one of my son’s mates [Mr X] I thought it would be a good idea if we went and seen a solicitor, but we went down and we seen the Haines first, and then that’s how we ended up going to the solicitors,” Marilyn told BuzzFeed News.\nIn the transcript, Mr X recounted a conversation he had with the girl, and alleged the motive for the murder revolved around drugs.\n“The week before [Mark’s death] a heap of them got together at a house drinking and Stoney [Mark] came up and one of them said: ‘He knows too much – what are we going to do about him?’,” Mr X said. “It was something to do with a crop of drugs.\n“She told me that they then drove out with Stoney in the stolen car to where there was another car. She said that the stolen car was to be used as a plant.”\nView this image › \nMark’s family on an anniversary of his death. Allan Clarke / BuzzFeed \nID: 10668249 Mark was 17-years-old when he was found dead on January 16, 1988, on railway tracks outside Tamworth.\n\nHe had said goodbye to his girlfriend at around 3:30am that morning, and just over three hours later a train driver discovered his body on the tracks.\nDespite massive head trauma there was only a patch of blood the size of a 50 cent piece at the scene. A stolen car found nearby was not fingerprinted at the site, nor was its interior searched by police. The car was left exposed to the elements for around six weeks and was then removed from the scene. Police are unable to comment on what happened to the vehicle, as it remains part of an ongoing investigation.\nThe death was ruled suspicious and a coronial inquest returned open findings, failing to identify what caused Haines’ injuries.\nView this image › \nAllan Clarke / BuzzFeed \nID: 10668255 The information provided by Mr X and Mr Y alleged that Mark knew “too much” about a marijuana drug crop and was going to be “taught a lesson” in the form of a bashing that got out of hand.\n\n“Mark was hurt,” Mr X said in the 1988 statement. “Two of them held him while [the suspect] laid into him and hurt him badly in the stomach so that he was really badly hurt and that they then put him on the railway tracks.”\nThe first police investigation has come under fire for what critics consider to be a lax approach. Initially, grieving family members said they were encouraged by detectives to conduct their own investigations, which resulted in Don Craigie, Mark’s uncle, being brutally assaulted twice and having his jaw broken.\n\nLast year, a woman came forward to BuzzFeed News with new information after reading several stories on Mark’s death, leading to the case being actively investigated once again.\nIt took months for the Oxley LAC detectives to follow up on those leads, prompting Greens MLA David Shoebridge to demand the case be moved from the local area to the elite State Crime Command’s (SCC) homicide unit in Sydney.\nView this image › \nDon Craigie and David Shoebridge talk with Oxley LAC police. Allan Clarke / BuzzFeed \nID: 10668256 Today, the SCC is conducting a review of the initial police investigation and, based on its findings, will consider taking on the case.\n\nMarilyn told BuzzFeed News that the police never followed up with her statement from 1988.\n“I haven’t seen or heard from anyone,” Marilyn said. “I’m going to say this and I don’t care what people say. But if he was a child from East Tamworth and white, that this happened to, it would’ve been finished, over. They would’ve found out. But no, this is some poor Aboriginal kid that didn’t deserve it.”\nAdditional reporting by Ellen Leabeater.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:13:57.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
