But today, it’s not history which egged me to refer to this nondescript town – it is the elections in India’s most populous state Uttar Pradesh.\nThe conversations at any gathering in India, especially in Uttar Pradesh, automatically take a political turn as I found out to my surprise when I landed up here. Even a poignant function can turn into an arena of freewheeling debate. The attendees, like any other, had different political leanings and everyone was wearing his heart on his sleeve. The discussion started on a mild note when a substantial number of people were eating. Demonetisation acted as the fuel.\n“You tell me, what has Modi government achieved by implementing this scheme? If you want me to pay through cheques and other digital means, why launch a Rs 2000 note in the first place? Basically, you are telling me to jump across a nullah and are also making a bridge. This is foolishness!” said one of the participants animatedly.\n“Forget demonetisation, this government has achieved nothing what its leaders promised. Look at the petrol prices. Has anyone received the money promised by Modiji after his crackdown against black money and corruption? I agree that there was corruption during Congress regime, but what has this government achieved in two and a half years?” said another, a local Samajwadi Party supporter.\nHe had a point to counter everyone, especially those who uttered a word in support of the BJP. “The crude oil prices during UPA regime were $112 per barrel. But it has come down substantially now. I think it’s about half that price now. But no one in the country has received any benefit,” the man said when prodded by a ‘rival’.\n“Raghuram Rajan did not support this decision of the government so he was thrown out. I am telling you, demonetisation has only brought misery for the countrymen.” “But there are some taxes on oil,” came a counter. “They basically have to keep the prices of fuel at this level so they’ve made an excuse with this tax thing. You can’t reduce the price and are just making fun of us with this taxation thing. Wah ji wah !” the man said waving his hands.\nThe discussion soon took an interesting turn when demonetisation was replaced with Samajwadi Party feud. “Mulayam had an inkling beforehand that Shivpal can go to any extent to grab power. He feared for his son’s safety so he planned the entire thing to cut Shivpal to size,” said a latecomer who held considerable clout in the area. The statement grabbed everyone’s attention. “Yes, it’s true. People know about it,” he said emphasising his point. “But you can never beat Shivpal. He is the true muscle power of Samajwadi Party and has worked very hard to rise in the party,” countered someone. “Shivpal can’t do anything now. Believe me, he is powerless. Akhilesh has crushed his dissent,” was the answer.\n“But Mulayam has given Akhilesh a list of 38 people and it has Shivpal’s name,” someone said joining the debate. “Shivpal will not get a ticket, you take this in writing from me,” the Johnny come lately was assured. “All this has been done to keep him out. Fir to is sab ka matlab hi kya hai?” The split in Samajwadi Party soon became apparent in the discussion too. “How can you say that? There is no such story. Everyone knows that despite his political acumen, Mulayam has lost the battle from his own son, a political newcomer,” an aggressive participant said enumerating the things and schemes launched by Akhilesh which, he said, made the chief minister popular. “Akhilesh ne Mulayam ko unki aukat bata di .” But the other camp was not ready to buy the argument. They kept insisting that everything was planned by Mulayam and that he is the true politician who cannot lose a battle like this.\nThe discussion also had its share of humour. “Have you eaten?” the host came to ask all of us. “Just about to,” said the SP supporter. “Oh, to itna gussa isliye kyunki aap bhookhe hain ,” a ‘rival’ camp member quipped leaving everyone in splits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T12:34:27.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
