Dave Hyde off-season plan is a simple one: Pay their own, hand-selected guys whom they know well rather than pay outside free-agents who they only can know so much about.\nThis is Adam Gase’s way, as I wrote in a recent column , and it’s an interesting take on how to build a team. The common sense is clear. Pay your players. Build “loyalty” and “family” that way. Keep good players together in a manner that’s tough in the world of modern football. \n“I paid the cost for you to win financially,’’ Gase is saying, “Now you pay the cost for all of us to win on the field.” \nThe risks? They’re there, too. Bodies age in dog years in football. The Dolphins re-did deals for Reshad Jones , 29 and coming off a shoulder injury, and Kiko Alonso, 27 in August and with some knee issues in his career. Both had a year remaining on their contract. \nThis is a nice way to do what is often hard-line business. For instance, the Dolphins could have let Jones play out this year, franchise-tag him for about $14 million next year — and, to be really hard-line, tag him a second year at age 31. That would have been more cost-effective and lots of teams would have done that. \nThe Dolphins have chosen a friends-and-family plan. You can appreciate that. Let’s see where it goes now. \nOne of Bill Belichick’s pet lines is, “Don’t be afraid to let your players go to free agency.” He’s did that most recently with Dont’a Hightower. He’s thrown players overboard on the edge of free agency for years (Chandler Jones, Jamie Collins , Logan Mankins , Lawyer Milloy …) \nThis isn’t to say Belichick’s way is right. Seattle does it a friendlier way. There are a lot of ways up the mountain, and the Dolphins are doing it Gase’s interesting way. Pay your players. Buy their loyalty. And only buy outside free agents for value deals. Guard/center Ted Larsen was a value deal at three years, $5.6 million. Dontari Poe (one year, $8 million with Atlanta) and evidently Zach Brown weren’t. \nIn the recent weeks, the Dolphins have done big-dollar deals for Jones, Alonso, Kenny Stills, Andre Branch and Cameron Wake. That’s the start of a foundation Gase has invested to win. \nAlonso was the latest with a four-year, $28.2 million deal. \nLandry would be next. He has a year remaining on his rookie contract, but the Dolphins have shown . We’ll see where this ends up with him. But the Dolphins philosophy is crystal clear. \nDon’t pay for players you don’t know. \nPay for your own. \nSee which players are on the move as the Dolphins continue to revamp their roster in free agency. \n2. I’m rooting for Roger Federer at the Miami Open, as I wrote in my column today. And why not? Federer isn’t just one of sport’s great champs. At 35, he’s having the start of a year no one expected. Now if he can just stay healthy through it … \n3. So you can get into the Real Madrid-Barcelona exhibition for about $1,000 now. Or you can fly to Madrid in late April, go to a Real Madrid game in La Liga (no, not El Classico) and have a weekend in Spain for about the same. \n4.
