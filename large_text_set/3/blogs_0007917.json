MY COUSIN VINNY (20th Century Fox 1992) (Judge Chamberlain Haller: “Don’t talk to me sitting in that chair! . . . When you’re addressing this court, you’ll rise and speak to me in a clear, intelligible voice.”). Viewed objectively, these alleged acts could easily be considered speeches to a public assembly that tended to disrupt the Court’s operations — conduct covered by § 6134’s prohibition of ‘make a harangue or oration.'” \nThe misguided “youts” will now have to face the original charges they were arrested under for haranguing or orating in front of the court in a disruptive manner. Unfortunately for the late Scalia, they likely won’t receive “stiff sentences” though, as the charges they face only carry a maximum sentence of 60 days in jail and a fine. \nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter so everyone can see this federal judge cite the classic film “My Cousin Vinny” in a federal appeals court ruling.
