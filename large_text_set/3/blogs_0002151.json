Don't forget @TheDemocrats effort to incite violence at Trump rallies https://t.co/uTBFGhI0Kh — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) February 28, 2017 \nHe also cited a Breitbart article that included a video from conservative activist James O'Keefe that claimed Democrats used \"trained provocateurs\" during the presidential campaign to instigate violence at Trump rallies. \nAlmost immediately, Scaramucci began taking flack, including from Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who called his tweet \"vile\" and called for him to resign. This is vile. You should quit your role as Senior Advisor to the President, for the good of the country. https://t.co/NIPXTtehwT — Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) February 28, 2017 \nIn a subsequent Tweet, Scaramucci appeared to backtrack, saying that \"it's highly irresponsible to jump to conclusions.\" No, I'm saying until we know for sure it's highly irresponsible to jump to conclusions https://t.co/wynFuUCKyT — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) February 28, 2017 \nThe Trump adviser did not immediately respond to a request from NBC News about his tweets. \nScaramucci has vigorously defended Trump against allegations that he has not done enough to combat the sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents that the Anti-Defamation League has recorded since the presidential election. To blame President Trump for rise in anti-Semitism is extremely unfair. He condemns the heinous acts and is eager to find those responsible — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) February 28, 2017 \nSo far this year, JCCs have been hit with bomb threats seven dozen times at 53 facilities in 26 states and a Canadian province. The most recent rash on Monday resulted in the evacuations of hundreds of pre-school children and senior citizens. \nThey all turned out to be hoaxes but the FBI and local authorities are investigating and so far have not turned up any suspects. \nScaramucci on Tuesday also took part in a contentious interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle during which he was put on the spot about the JCC bomb threats. \n\"Why are you blaming the bomb threats on the president?\" he said at one point.
