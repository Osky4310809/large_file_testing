The new version brings a handful of new features and performance improvements. \nAndroid O brings new automatic limits imposed on applications, and specifically what they can do in the background. It is expected to enhance the performance and battery life of devices. Notifications are also getting an upgrade in Android O, with developers now able to define categories for notification content. \nGoogle introduced Picture-in-Picture (PIP) mode for the first time on Android TV. With Android O, this feature is finally coming to phones and tablets. This feature will let you watch videos while using other apps. Also, Android O is bringing multi-display support, font resources in XML, support for adaptive app icons, Wi-Fi Aware and more. \nWhile Google traditionally releases the name of the new Android versions after Google I/O, the consensus at the moment appears to be ‘Oreo’. The final release of the new version will be released in the third quarter of this year, so you’ll have to wait a while for a stable build on your device. It’s worth mentioning that Android Nougat is only running on around 2.5 percent of total Android phones and tablets as of now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:52:28.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
