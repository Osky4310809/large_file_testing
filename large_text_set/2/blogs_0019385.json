The Lady Eagles improved to 5-1 and extended its win streak to four games while the Lady Maroons (4-1) slipped to second place after getting its unbeaten run snapped. The Lady Maroons, down 19-9, managed to fight back in the third set with a 12-5 run to cut the deficit to three, 24-21, but Jhoana Maraguinot had enough of UP’s persistence and ended the match with a down-the-line kill. ADVERTISEMENT Ateneo assistant coach Sherwin Meneses said their win against the Lady Maroons was a huge confidence booster especially going to their final game of the first round against archrivals De La Salle University. “This was an important win for us because now we’re tied for first, and we’re facing La Salle next so our confidence is at a high right now,” said Meneses. “And we told the players going into this game that the right mindset would be critical because whoever has the better mental strength will win this game.” Bea De Leon and Maraguinot led Ateneo with 11 points apiece while Mich Morente added 10. Diana Carlos and Isa Molde had 12 points each to lead the Lady Maroons. Ateneo had an almost flawless game as the Blue Eagles scored on 40 of its 76 spike attempts and managed to limit their errors to just 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T16:08:30.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
