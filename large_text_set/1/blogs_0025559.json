Publishers and developers operate in just about every region of the world, and most support teams represent a vast assortment of nationalities.\nSEE ALSO: 2 big names in video games take on Trump's immigration ban\nTrump's executive order potentially spells trouble for those who make and sell games. For the next 90 days, travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — all predominantly Muslim nations — are barred from entering the United States.\nThe next major gaming event on the horizon is the annual Game Developer's Conference, which runs from Feb. 27 to March 3 — right inside Trump's travel ban window — in San Francisco. That's why it was no surprise to see a swift response from the trade show's organizers, via Twitter.\nGDC is a global community - we're horrified by the #MuslimBan . Of course we'll refund affected attendees, and keep fighting for inclusivity.\n— Official_GDC (@Official_GDC) January 29, 2017\nThe International Game Developer's Association — which meets at GDC every year — confirmed to Polygon that only two of its 8,000 members come from one of the seven countries affected by the ban. But that's not the point, the IGDA notes.\n\"[The] issue isn't necessarily the affect on these specific countries but on the general spread of xenophobia in the U.S. government and how it will certainly affect the U.S.'s ability to hire talent and remain globally competitive,\" the organization's executive director, Kate Edwards, noted.\nThe Entertainment Software Association issued a statement of its own on Monday, Jan. 30. This one directly addresses the new immigration policy, raising concerns that echo those pointed out in the IGDA's response.\nHere's the ESA statement in full:\nThe Entertainment Software Association urges the White House to exercise caution with regard to vital immigration and foreign worker programs. As a leading force in technology and exporter of entertainment, the U.S. video game industry thrives on the contributions of innovators and storytellers from around the world. While recognizing that enhancing national security and protecting our country’s citizens are critical goals, our companies rely on the skilled talent of U.S. citizens, foreign nationals, and immigrants alike. Our nation’s actions and words should support their participation in the American economy.\nWe've reached out to a number of publishers and hardware manufacturers individually, including Sony, Nintendo, Bethesda Softworks, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Capcom, Square-Enix and The Pokémon Company. Xbox-maker Microsoft issued a statement over the weekend.\nBethesda responded with the following statement:\nWe are a global company with employees of every race, gender, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation. As such, we will always support diversity and acceptance over division and exclusion.\nCapcom and Square-Enix responded as well, both pointing us to the ESA statement above. The Pokémon Company opted against commenting on the matter at all.\nThe rest — Sony, Nintendo, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, and Electronic Arts — have yet to respond. We'll update this post as we hear from others.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Official_GDC/status/825553192415019008", "http://www.theesa.com/article/entertainment-software-associations-statement-new-u-s-travel-policy/", "http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/29/14430014/muslim-ban-immigration-gdc-game-developers", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuslimBan?src=hash"], "published": "2017-01-31T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:43:48.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
