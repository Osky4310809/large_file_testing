Hamann claims England have hardly any of the world's best 100 players (Photo: AFP/Getty) \n“The two I like best are Ross Barkley and John Stones, but at the back we are pretty good with Hummels and Boateng. So it would be tough for stones to get in there, in midfield we’ve Sami Khedira and Toni Kroos so it would be mighty difficult for Barkley to dislodge those two. \n“At the moment, I just couldn’t see any of them getting into a German team. Even Raheem Sterling would be up against Mesut Özil and Marco Reus in front of him, he’d be the next one on my list if I had to pick because he’s having an excellent season at the moment. \n“But, we got some great players now – Julian Draxler doing very well at PSG now, the competition in that department is great as well. I’d honestly go as far as saying no English player would get in.

We can talk about formations all we want, if you look at the team they’re just not up to it. \n“If you’re looking at today’s top class players they’re French, German, Italy and South American. I couldn’t think of too many English guys who’d get in the top 50, or even the Top 100 in the world - that’s the bottom line. \n“If you take the Champions League for example, even though you got a lot of foreign influence in them, it’s been another shambolic effort by Premier League sides. One team in the last eight, a club that nearly got relegated two seasons before – it says it all.” The former Germany international has put the knife in on England (Photo: Action Images) \nHamann also questioned England’s mentality at major tournaments and fears Southgate would struggle to turn it around. \n“It’s impossible not to have doubts after England’s high profile exits in recent major tournaments – nothing I’ve seen can change my mind at the moment,” said Hamann. \n“I like the appointment of Southgate and I think he’s someone who’s authentic and can bring a certain type of perspective to the job. Southgate is a very humble man but it’s hard to say whether England can compete at the big tournaments because they’ve been so poor recently. Hamann likes the Southgate appointment - but says he faces a tough job (Photo: Getty) \n“Gareth needs the backing of the FA and the job security so he can work for the next two or three years but at the same time it’s a results driven business. If he doesn’t get the results the same thing will happen to Southgate as previous managers. \n“Southgate has to try to find a team, or at least a spine of a team, which can lead and help the other players. \n“He needs to find leaders – a lot of these England players are led by foreigners in the Premier League but once they come together for England they look for help, advice and guidance and the simply don’t get it. That’s the biggest issue.” Hamann sees John Stones as a potential future England skipper (Photo: The FA via Getty) \nHamann believes England are short of natural leaders but claims John Stones could be a long term option. \nBut Hamann expects Germany to prove they are much better than England even if tonight’s friendly in Dortmund is expected to be close. \nHamman added: “If you asked me who could step up and captain Germany I could give you five names but in the England setup I’d struggle to find you one who’s got that personality and the capability as a player. It’s one thing being a leader but you’ve got to be a top player as well.
