'Falsely reassured' \nBut after analysing the results of 49 studies of screening tests and 50 intervention trials, University of Oxford researchers said the policy would benefit some, but not all those at high risk. \nThey also said a population-wide approach to diabetes prevention would be a useful addition. \nIn the BMJ study , they found that two blood tests - HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose - were inaccurate at detecting pre-diabetes, although they are the only ones available to doctors and patients.
