Riker took command of the USS Titan on stardate 56941.1, in the closing days of the year 2379 . After more than four offers by Starfleet Command , Admiral Kathryn Janeway told Riker it was a \"take-it-or-leave-it\" decision. Deanna was assigned as ship's Head Counselor and Diplomatic Officer . In hindsight of this, one could point out Riker's career choice may have also been borne out of sheer nostalgia, having co-piloted, six years earlier, a Titan -class rocket, in Earth 's past. His love for 20th century Earth Blues and its varieties, compelled him to have all issued shuttles christened with names of musicians from the era. One, in particular, the Armstrong ; was mistaken for Neil the astronaut , rather than Louis (\"Satchmo\"). \nThe Titan 's primary mission was to be one of scientific inquiry and exploration in the uncharted region known as the Gum Nebula . But, before the ship and crew could begin that mission, Admirals William Ross and Leonard James Akaar ordered a slight detour. \nTitan was sent to Romulus as head of a small diplomatic and humanitarian convoy in response to Praetor Tal'Aura 's request to begin a dialogue between the Federation and the Romulan Star Empire . Titan taking wing. \nWhile in Romulan space, Riker and Titan managed to rescue Commander Tuvok , formerly of the starship USS Voyager , who had been sent to Romulus to recall the legendary Ambassador Spock back to Federation space. Instead, Tuvok found himself taken captive by a Romulan faction during the chaos following Shinzon's murder of the Romulan Senate . \nRiker and Spock managed to negotiate an agreement between the Romulans, the Remans , and the Klingons that did much to stabilize the region. \nBefore leaving Romulan space, Riker assisted Romulan Commander Donatra in searching for a missing fleet of Romulan ships that vanished near the anomaly created by the destruction of Shinzon's thalaron weapon , which the Romulans called The Great Bloom . The Remans and others called it Shinzon's Folly. The bloom turned out to be an interspacial portal of some kind that deposited Titan and Donatra's ship, the Valdore into the mini-galaxy known as the Smaller Magellanic Cloud , home to the sundered branch of Earth humanity known as the Neyel . ( TTN novel : Taking Wing ) \nWhile in SMC space, the Titan evacuated as many Neyel and other species as they could from the destruction caused by the growth of a Proto-Universe (which was called the Sleeper by the natives of the SMC, and dubbed the \" Red King \" by the crew of the Titan ), back to the Milky Way Galaxy . The fate of those left behind in the SMC is uncertain. \nAfter returning from SMC space, Riker chose the Vulcan phrase Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations for the ship's Dedication Plaque , in tribute to Titan s crew, which was one of the most diverse in Starfleet history . One of his other choices was a verse sung by Jazz legend Theressa Brewer. ( It don't mean a thing/ If it ain't got that swing ) ( TTN novel : The Red King ) \nTitan finally began her primary exploratory mission of exploration in the Gum Nebula in late February of 2380 , on stardate 57137.8. \nIn Riker's first mission, he brokered an agreement between a race of galactic hunters called the Pa'haquel (who believed that they were protecting the galactic ecology by hunting down and killing hostile Cosmozoan species), and the intelligent Star-jellies (who objected to be hunted and their corpses defiled), whom Riker and Troi first encountered at Deneb IV , on their first mission on the Enterprise -D. \nThe Gum Nebula apparently served as a breeding ground for cosmozoan species such as the Star-Jellies, the Crystalline Entities or Branchers , a living Solar System called the Proplydian , and many others. ( TTN novel : Orion's Hounds ) \nThe Titan continued on her mission of exploration in the Gum Nebula. \nSometime in mid-2380, Will and Deanna attempted to conceive a child through natural means. Although she required hormonal treatments to improve fertility which had the side effect of weakening her psionic defenses, Deanna eventually became pregnant with child. However, the fetus was miscarried. With miscarriage not an uncommon occurrence, the medical professionals on the Titan did not consider any further testing after removing the fetus. \nIn 2381 , the couple was able to again conceive a child. Again, the pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage. Doctor Ree diagnosed severe genetic abnormalities in the fetus, which they had not previously considered testing for. Although the growing child was likely to rupture her uterine lining, Troi refused to allow Dr Ree to remove the fetus, a reaction that Riker supported despite his personal misgivings. The second miscarriage spun the couple into a dark depression; Riker knew that Deanna would refuse to speak rationally with him if he went to speak with her, and he wouldn't remove her from duty. William felt as though he had lost all hopes for children with Deanna when Dr Ree delivered his prognosis that pregnancy was impossible due to Troi's past pregnancy with the entity that she had come to call Ian Andrew Troi II , as the energy the entity generated in her womb had caused subtle damage to her reproductive systems that was beyond anything Federation science could treat. Despite her condition, he allowed Deanna Troi to join an away mission to the planet later revealed to be New Erigol , the home of the reclusive Caeliar . ( ST - Destiny novel : Gods of Night ) \nOnce on the surface, Troi and the rest of the away team became invited permanent guests of the Caeliar, and a similar message was delivered to Captain Riker and the Titan . The tension and grief between the two had all but prevented communications between them, and Riker found the loss of his trusted officers Deanna, Vale, and Tuvok to be yet another personal blow. Riker attempted to rescue the away team with a strike force, but a feedback in their systems halted the effort; rather than allow his crew to be discouraged, Riker made an announcement that they had made progress in learning more of the Caeliar capabilities and were finding the next attempt. Eventually, the Titan was able to tap into the soliton pulses used to maintain their subspace tunnels ; former United Earth Starfleet Captain Erika Hernandez became aware of this, and offered to take the Titan to the Azure Nebula if they left immediately. Although Riker was hesitant to leave behind his wife and away team, he agreed with Erika's plan and they departed New Erigol. ( ST - Destiny novel : Mere Mortals ) They were eventually able to return and retrieve the away team, but during her time with the Caeliar Deanna's damaged reproductive system was cured by their advanced medical science, allowing her to complete her pregnancy and carry the baby to full term. \nAlso in 2381 Will and Deanna have their first child, named Natasha Riker-Troi . ( TTN novel : Over a Torrent Sea ) \nIn November 2382 , the Shantherin th'Clane travelled to the Vela Pulsar to meet with the USS Titan , intending to deprive the Starfleet vessel of its seven Andorian crewmembers. The two ships parted without exchanging fire. ( TTN novel : Fallen Gods ) Admiral Riker Edit The Titan is recalled to Earth. \nIn September 2385 , in the month after the death of President Nanietta Bacco , Admiral Akaar summoned Riker and the Titan to Earth without explanation. Beaming down to Starfleet Command Riker found himself suddenly promoted to Rear Admiral without explanation, with no option to refuse. Torn by the sudden removal from starship command, Will, Deanna and Tasha settled into life in San Francisco. Without a specific brief (\"without portfolio\") or instructions from Akaar, Riker was frustrated by the bizarre turn of events. His aide, Lieutenant Ssura could offer no further explanation but advised him on the cynical turn of events on Earth towards surveillance and suspicion. Eventually he managed to confront his superior officer, where it was revealed to him Akaar's frustrations with the President Pro Tempore Ishan Anjar , who had surrounded himself with a cadre of war-minded hawks and begun a series of bellicose policies. He tasked Riker with investigating the fraught state of affairs within Starfleet revealed under Ishan, particularly in connection to the arrest of the traitorous idealist, Julian Bashir , and to dig deeper into Ishan's cadre of advisors. \nTo tackle the question of Bashir, and what really had happened with the Andorian crisis, Riker assigned Christine Vale to command the medical ship, USS Lionheart on a short term mission as excuse to visit the imprisoned Ezri Dax and gather information from the former Starfleet captain, who, herself, had helped Bashir escape with the classified medical information he stole. He also attempted to breach the communications of Ishan's chief-of-staff, Galif jav Velk . Though itself illegal, Riker discovered that Velk was running an off-the-books secret ops team, Active Four , tasked with capturing the assassins of Bacco and rendering them to a Klingon Imperial Intelligence world for torture and disappearance. Riker, to escape the surveillance on Earth and stop Velk's team, took the Titan in pursuit of the Active Team, contacting Chancellor Martok and finding the Intelligence elements involved to be some of Martok's interior enemies. Riker and Martok agreed to try and capture the Active team and the Bacco assassins, while Martok's troops destroyed the KII base and personnel. In the end, the Titan could only rescue four members of Active Four - his own officer Tuvok, Lieutenant Commander Nog of Deep Space 9 , the Bolian pilot Lieutenant Yal Ixxen of the USS Blake , and his own \"brother\", Thomas Riker . Tuvok, Nog, and Thomas revealed to Riker that the Cardassian extremists, the True Way , had assassinated Bacco. More so, the True Way had claimed to have done so with the cooperation of Ishan's chief-of-staff, Galif jav Velk . Upon returning to Earth several days later, Riker found the situation on Earth changed - Velk had revealed his illegal managing of Active Four, and stepped down. Without proof Riker could not pursue Velk, who was now in custody. In confrontation with President Ishan, Riker found himself committed to toppling the man he believed responsible to have dirtied the Federation and, to some unknown degree, have been responsible for the murder of President Bacco. ( ST - The Fall novel : The Poisoned Chalice ) \nFollowing the arrest of President Ishan Anjar, both Riker and Admiral Akaar tried once again to convince Captain Picard to accept promotion to the admiralty but was once again turned down by Picard. Riker then presented to Picard with an isolinear chip containing information on a new long term exploratory mission to a region of space only ever explored by long range probes. Picard gratefully accepted such a mission. The new President also hinted to her Chief of Staff that Admiral Riker had requested a posting back to his ship. ( ST - The Fall novel : Peaceable Kingdoms ) \nIn November 2385 , Rear Admiral Riker was the Federation representative to the mysterious Far Embassy , who, along with representatives from the Klingon Empire , Romulan Star Empire , Cardassian Union , Ferengi Alliance , Tzenkethi Coalition , Gorn Hegemony , and Tholian Assembly , became agents of the Cytherians . Under their influence, Riker transferred to the USS Aventine , and began attacking various communications stations. Eventually, with the help of the crews of Aventine and Enterprise , Riker was returned to normal. \nAfter his experience with the Cytherians, Admiral Riker spent a few weeks at the Mira Romaine Center for Rehabilitation and Reintegration on Betazed Station 4 under the care of Dr. Simus . ( TNG novel : Takedown ) \nIn 2386 , Rear Admiral Riker was assigned as sector commander of the Alpha Quadrant frontier zone , with the Titan to serve as his flagship and mobile base of operations. He experienced some growing pains with newly-promoted Captain Christine Vale as the two attempted to define their new duty parameters. \nHis first mission as sector commander was to visit the Dinac , and he and Titan ended up in a conflict with the Solanae , the mysterious aliens who had abducted him and many of his crewmates on the Enterprise -D seventeen years earlier. ( TTN novel : Sight Unseen ) The 25th century \nAt some point in this century, Will was an admiral with three grandchildren. ( STO novel : The Needs of the Many ) Alternate timelines and realities \nIn an alternate timeline , Riker was the last person whom Picard saw alive, as his shuttlecraft departed the Enterprise -D minutes before the Galaxy -class ship was destroyed by a vortex in 2365 . ( TNG episode : \" Time Squared \") Riker dead in an alternate timeline. William T. Riker in an alternate timeline. \nIn another alternate timeline created when the USS Enterprise -C was accidentally sent through a temporal rift from 2344 to 2366 , the Federation had been at war with the Klingon Empire for almost 20 years as the Enterprise -C's disappearance resulted in the destruction of the Klingon colony Narendra III . In this timeline, Riker was still the first officer of the Enterprise . He was killed on the bridge in 2366 , while manning a terminal which exploded as a result of heavy Klingon fire. He was helping to buy time for the underpowered Enterprise -C to return through the temporal rift to Narendra III in 2344. ( TNG episode : \" Yesterday's Enterprise \") \nIn another alternate timeline called \"Track A\", Riker was captured and tortured in a joint Romulan-Cardassian experiment into pain shortly after his marriage to Deanna Troi, unaware that he had conceived a son with her. In this universe, Riker was eventually rescued by Worf, a paranoid Klingon rogue, who then returned him to the Federation. After Trelane merged this universe with two others, Riker was forced to kill his counterpart from the \"Track C\" reality, who had become increasingly unbalanced due to the disruptions to reality caused by Trelane. This act was done in protecting his son and Deanna Riker, whom he was finally able to recognize and re-associate into his tortured memory. Following this experience, Commander Jean-Luc Picard- promoted to Captain after the suicide of Captain Jack Crusher - suggested that Riker serve as his first officer, as he was of the appropriate rank and they were each two equally damaged officers who might be just what the other needed. ( TNG novel : Q-Squared ) \nIn an alternate timeline in which Khan Noonien Singh won the Eugenics Wars and Humanity underwent genetic engineering en masse, Princeps William Riker was the commanding officer of the Earthfleet warship Excalibur . Like his fellow Princeps, he frequently conversed with a holographic recreation of Khan which possessed all of his intelligence and memories. Riker preferred to use the image of Khan as a general and warlord from the Romulan Wars of the 2100s while consulting the hologram. ( DS9 - Myriad Universes novel : Seeds of Dissent ) \nIn another alternate timeline, Riker was given command of the USS Excalibur prior to 2378 . He was succeeded as first officer of the Enterprise -D by the ship's chief engineer Geordi La Forge . ( TNG - Myriad Universes novel : Brave New World ) \nIn another alternate timeline in which the Cardassian Union did not withdraw from Bajor in 2369 , Riker became the captain of the USS Sugihara in 2373 , shortly after the outbreak of the Romulan War . Worf succeeded him as first officer of the Enterprise -E. Although Riker had recently married Deanna, she remained aboard the Enterprise as the Sugihara already had a qualified counselor whom Riker did not dislodge for his wife. ( TNG - Myriad Universes novel : A Gutted World ). ( TNG - Myriad Universes novel : A Gutted World ) Captain Riker in an alternate reality. \nIn several alternate realities visited by Lieutenant Worf in 2370 , Riker was still the Enterprise -D's first officer and threw a surprise birthday party for Worf. In another alternate reality, he was the captain of the Enterprise as Jean-Luc Picard had been killed during the Borg Incursion of 2366-2367 . Riker in an alternate reality. \nIn another reality, the Borg Collective had succeeded in conquering the Federation and much of the Alpha Quadrant by 2370. The Enterprise , under Riker's command, was one of the last surviving ships. Along with Worf, he was one of its few remaining crewmembers. After it became one of the approximately 285,000 different Enterprise s to be sent to the same reality, Riker fired on the Curie as he did not want to return to his own reality. The Enterprise indigenous to that reality then fired on the Borg -infested Enterprise using minimal weapons. This began a chain reaction which resulted in its destruction due to the severe damage which it had suffered in its many engagements with the Borg. ( TNG episode : \" Parallels \") \nIn another reality in which Riker had failed to stop the Borg, Riker had lost his right eye, many of his crew, and the saucer section of the USS Enterprise -D. Despite his defeat, Riker and the remaining crew continued to help Earth resist the Borg using the Enterprise 's battle section. ( TNG comic : \" The Worst of Both Worlds \") \nIn another reality, Riker took command of the FSS Aries in 2365 . \nIn another reality, Riker served aboard the United Earth Space Probe Agency vessel Enterprise before it was captured by the Klingon Empire and became the IKS Qu' . His throat was cut by the Klingons . By 2380, Captain Picard was the only surviving member of the original crew. \nIn another reality, Riker served as the first officer of the USS Enterprise -E , which was under the command of Thomas Halloway , prior to taking command of the USS Titan . As a final parting gift before leaving for the Titan , Riker assigned Lieutenant Commander Picard to bridge duty. This seems to be a similar, if not identical, timeline to the one which Q had shown Picard in 2369 , as it is mentioned that Lieutenant Commander Picard had worked extremely hard since Riker and Deanna had evaluated him. \nIn another reality, Riker was the captain of the USS Enterprise -E in 2380.
