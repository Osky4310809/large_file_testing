Four North Koreans men are still being sought. \nIt is widely believed that North Korea was behind this assassination. However the regime has refused to accept any of Malaysia’s findings on the death, and this entire incident could potentially cause North Korea to cut its ties to Malaysia, one of the few countries in the world it has good relations with, according to the Wall Street Journal . \nIt is unclear what this assassination might mean for the stability of the North Korean regime, but any time something major like this happens it’s always a good idea to keep an eye on Pyongyang. You never know what that crazy dictatorship might do next. \nShare this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what your reaction to this shocking video was. What do you think of this video?
