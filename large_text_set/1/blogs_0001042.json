We need to be more united, you racist, misogynist pieces of s***!   \nWhile Green wasn’t the only liberal having a Clark Griswold “Jelly of the Month Club”-style meltdown on the night of Nov. 8 , her self-evidently hypocritical remarks became emblematic of a very particular sort of hatred and bigotry endemic to the American political left, one that remained latent until the election didn’t go the way they had wanted. \nWhat’s even funnier is that this hatred had disguised itself as tolerance and love, as the opinions of entire swaths of individuals were branded as “hateful” with the repetition and subtlety of a bludgeoning. \nWhen it turned out those people had given the presidency to Donald Trump, that hatred became manifest. Thankfully, along with the ugliness, it gave us hilarious moments like this. \nAnd while there were a lot of nominees to pick from, we award you, Laci Green, the 2016 edition of Conservative Tribune’s prestigious Keith Olbermann Memorial Award for Most Deranged Meltdown of the Year.
