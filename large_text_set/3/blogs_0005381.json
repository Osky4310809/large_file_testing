The first generously proportioned babe ever to grace the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine’s Swimsuit Issue was photographed aboard a jet ski in Miami last week, showing off not only her bodacious backside, but her dimples. That’s right, the woman has cellulite — just like most of us.\nAnd she looks fabulous.\n“I work out. I do my best to eat well. I love the skin I’m in,” she wrote in a caption for a January Instagram post accompanying a pic of herself, bodily flaws and all, in a bikini. “And I’m not ashamed of a few bumps, lumps of cellulite, and you shouldn’t be either.”\nGraham, whose husband, filmmaker Justin Ervin, adorably gave her the pet name “Butt,” was joined by, among others, Teyana Taylor, 26, the singer, songwriter, dancer, actress and entrepreneur known for appearing in Kanye West’s “Fade” video. Taylor has admitted she’s tried her entire life to gain weight. (We all should be so cursed.)\nI workout. I do my best to eat well. I love the skin I'm in. And I'm not ashamed of a few lumps, bumps or cellulite.. and you shouldn't be either. #beautybeyondsize #lovetheskinyourein \nA post shared by A S H L E Y G R A H A M (@theashleygraham) on Jan 25, 2017 at 6:41pm PST \nYet she grapples with her own body issues.\n“My favorite part [of my body] used to be my breasts, but now my breasts belong to Junie,” she said in an interview with Self magazine published in January , referring to her 1-year-old daughter with husband Iman Shumpert, 26, a hoops player for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n“I appreciate every stretch mark, every sag,” she said. “One boob is bigger than the other . . . but it is what it is. I love my body and I love the place that I’m in.”\nWhat is happening here?\nWomen displaying diverse body types, ages, races and even disabilities are finally being presented as attractive, strong and desirable.\nThey’re crushing on red carpets and runways, in all forms of entertainment, social media and even at offices and on the streets.\nOnce, worthiness was thought to live exclusively inside the frames of anorexic and bulimic, mainly teenage mannequins wearing Size 0. Now, Dame Helen Mirren, 71, and muscular tennis star Serena Williams, 35, are widely considered hotties. Oscar winner (for her supporting role in “The Help”) Octavia Spencer, a lovely full-figured lady of 46 years, was front and center at the Oscars, nominated again for her supporting role in the flick “Hidden Figures.”\nEven some Barbie dolls, which began encouraging impressionable young girls to binge and purge in 1959, have grown love handles and pot bellies.\nAnd the sexiest gal on television these days may be Chrissy Metz, 36, of “This is US,” a woman of size who recently had two male characters on the show vying for her affection. (Her contract requires her to lose weight; NBC brass should reconsider.)\nThe cynic in me sees the effort to find desirability in previously marginalized populations as a moneymaking scheme, using big, pretty women to sell cute clothing to those once steered toward muumuus rather than thong underwear.\nBut what’s wrong with women looking fine?\n“The popular culture is reflecting what you see every day,” female body-image expert Stacey Peterson, Ph.D., 50, a professor of communication studies at Montgomery College in Maryland, told me.\n“It’s important for women” — we’re primarily talking about women here — “to see images of people who look like us. It’s very positive for a young girl to see a model of her femaleness, someone who’s full-figured, whatever the politically correct term is. We’re seeing it depicted more regularly and positively, and that’s new,” she said.\nThis should in no way be taken as an endorsement of obesity, an epidemic that leads to the deaths of about 300,000 American men and women annually from ailments including diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health. This is about maintaining good health at every weight.\n“What we want to encourage is people being healthy, taking care of themselves, physically and emotionally,’’ said Peterson.\nAll women deserve the right to feel lovely.\nSorry, Ahnold, you didn’t rate \nHollywood tough guy Arnold Schwarzenegger announced Friday he’s quitting his hosting gig on NBC’s “The Celebrity Apprentice” after one season of rotten ratings.\nSEE ALSO \nArnold quits 'Celebrity Apprentice,' blames ratings woes on Trump 0:0 He won't be back. But the former California Republican Governator blames fleeing viewers and sponsors not on his own lackluster performance — but on the fact that President Trump, the ex-host, is still credited as an executive producer, he told Empire online magazine. Trump tweeted Saturday that Ahnold “was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me.”\nSchwarzenegger shot back. “You should think about hiring a new joke writer and a fact checker.”\nStop!\nThe whining just makes The Donald proud.\nScandals haunt Jacko’s ranch \nWith no takers, the former Neverland Valley Ranch, once a veritable venus fly trap for young boys, is again on the market — its asking price slashed from $100 million in 2015 to $67 million.\nTwisted pop icon Michael Jackson sold the California spread to Colony Capital for $22.5 million before dying of a drug overdose in 2009. It’s been renamed the Sycamore Valley Ranch.\nThere must be some seriously bad juju floating over the place.\nNo ‘good’ deed… \nSEE ALSO \nSchumer, Gillibrand pulled visa strings for athlete accused of sex abuse 0:0 A snowshoe racer from India who got a visa after... It should have been a warning. The Indian government denied visas to enter the United States to a snowshoe racer and his team manager for a competition last month.\nBut New York’s Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and other officials, pulled strings . Voilà — the men traveled to upstate Saranac Lake.\nThen last week, snowshoer Tanveer Hussain, 24, was arrested and charged there with sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl.
