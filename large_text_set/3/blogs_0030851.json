It will conclude with several trips to climb tall mountains around the world and raise the UAE flag on their summits. \nThe programme aims to encourage UAE girls to develop their adventurous spirit, and to promote the UAEâ€™s position on the world sporting map. \nSome 50 Emirati girls have dealt with a range of challenges this year in the programme, and have proven the capability of UAE girls to overcome challenges, as well as developing independence, team work and persistence in achieving their goals. During the programme, they also developed a range of survival skills, which include a 15 kilometre walk in the Al Wathba desert, a two-day sports camp in Fujairah, climbing the Hatta and Negev mountains, and a physical endurance challenge at Zayed Sports City. \nThe challenges have so far led to the selection of the top 10 girls, who form the team that will compete to climb the summit of Jebel Jais before the launch of this year's grand adventure on 28th April, which includes a trip to climb to the top of Mount Toubkal in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the highest peak in North Africa at 4,167 metres above sea level. The girls are planning to raise the UAE flag at the top of the summit.
