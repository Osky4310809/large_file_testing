Soon, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the FBI was involved, and Morgan's department \"very quickly put a team together.\"\nRelated: Jodie Sweetin's Ex-Fiancé Arrested For Violating Restraining Order! \nAn undercover TBI agent agreed to meet with Cain and Greer on Friday outside the Dollar General store, where the couple allegedly accepted $3,000 in cash in exchange for the child.\nMorgan didn't reveal the couple's \"story,\" but noted the boy is in the custody of the state's Department of Children's Services.\nThe parents, to use that term loosely, are scheduled to appear in court for a preliminary hearing on April 7 where they could face federal charges.\nGreer's bond was set at $150,000 — or roughly 50 babies, at the going Craigslist rate. Cain is being held without bond, as he has since been served with a warrant as a fugitive from charges of embezzlement, breaking and entering, and other misdemeanors.\n[ Image via Greene County Sheriff's Office . ] \nTags: baby blabber , crazzzzy , deanna lynn greer , icky icky diaper poo , john david cain , legal matters , perezcious parenting , sad sad , viral: kids , viral: news", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:28:08.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
