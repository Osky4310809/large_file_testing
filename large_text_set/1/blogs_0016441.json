Bush wasn’t a “legitimate” president after the contested 2000 election. \nAnd now, Democratic Georgia Congressman John Lewis has delivered a dose of his own medicine to Trump, claiming that he is an illegitimate president because of Russian efforts to try to influence the election outcome, even though the intelligence report on the Russian hacking offered no evidence of an actual impact on the vote. \nWhat’s wrong with all this? \nEverything. \nThe illegitimacy card is an effective weapon, with at least one poll showing more than 40-percent of Republicans still believe the Obama birther garbage. \nBut it’s also an overused tactic that’s damaging to democracy. Trust in government and respect for the presidency has been in decline for years, and the scorched-earth legitimacy attacks accelerate that process. \nIf and when Trump or anyone else is proven to have cheated their way into office, we’ll talk. Until then, the illegitimacy card is nothing more than a wicked cheap shot.
