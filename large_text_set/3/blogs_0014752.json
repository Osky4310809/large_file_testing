However much was destined to change on Sunday (March 19) as Tamim Iqbal and Sabbir Rahman chose the big occasion to pull out a special partnership in search of glory. With both of them falling in quick succession, Bangladesh's confidence took a hit but they are still well positioned at 156 for 4 for a comfortable victory at Tea time on the final day at the P. Sara Oval. \nDilruwan Perera and Rangana Herath continued in tandem but despite the ball turning a bit, both the batsmen applied themselves very well at the crease to keep the bowlers at bay. While Tamim and Sabbir batted with restraint in the initial overs, runs started to come freely soon after. Herath employed his other spinner Lakshan Sandakan too but to no avail as Bangladesh kept eating away at the target. \nA drive here, a flick there and Tamim soon registered his 22nd Test fifty while the partnership kept growing in prominence and size. Suranga Lakmal was brought in after 28 overs of play but that didn't deter the tourists much. Tamim took on Sandakan by hitting him for a four and a six in the following over as the century stand came through as well in the next few overs. \nJust as when Bangladesh seemed to be in total authority of the game (some thing they aren't used to much in Test cricket), Tamim suffered the much used word - 'brain-fade', as he went for a mighty heave to only miscue a catch to long on. Dinesh Chandimal, running backwards, judged one to perfection to send Bangladesh's top-scorer back. The reactions from the Bangladesh head coach Chandika Hathurusingha conveyed it all in the moments to follow. \nSabbir Rahman, the other vital cog and set batsman, fell prey to Dilruwan as he missed a sweep to be given out leg before on a review. Ever since, Bangladesh's most seasoned duo of Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim are in the middle and would look to shepherd the chase for their side. With only 35 runs to win, Bangladesh shouldn't allow any more brain-fades on the way. Sri Lanka, though would bank on their skills as much as riding on Bangladesh's inglorious past. \nBrief Scores: Sri Lanka 338 and 319 (Dimuth Karunaratne 126, Dilruwan Perera 50; Shakib Al Hasan 4-74, Mustafizur Rahman 3-78) lead Bangladesh 467 and 156/4 (Tamim Iqbal 82, Sabbir Rahman 41; Rangana Herath 2-59) by 35 runs. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T11:57:21.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
