(EPA/Jim Lo Scalzo) The co-founder of Taylor Gourmet angered some Washingtonians today by meeting with President Trump for a photo-op connected to his executive order cutting regulations for small businesses .\nCasey Patten, who co-founded the local chain of hoagie shops in 2008, was photographed shaking hands with the president in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. The meeting was first reported by Popville.com , and quickly led to Twitter calls for a boycott from its patrons, many of whom reside in the District of Columbia, which voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton. Patten has not yet responded to multiple requests for comment.\nIf @TaylorGourmet wants to be a small business so bad, I say we help it out. Make it real, real small https://t.co/TpLPnCfS9Q\n— No, Ben, No! (@dtipson) January 30, 2017\nThe founder of @TaylorGourmet met with Trump and now there's a hole in my heart where risotto balls used to be.\n— Sara Langhinrichs (@SaraLang) January 30, 2017\n@TaylorGourmet you with Trump? I'm out.\n— Aaron C (@DmpLngInYrMth) January 30, 2017\nTrump’s policies, including the new travel and immigration ban, were met with days of protests this past weekend. The restaurant industry is a major employer of immigrants. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that, of the 24 million foreign-born workers in the U.S. , about 1.7 million are employed in food service and preparation jobs, though the bureau does not include citizenship or immigration status data. According to Pew , the biggest employer of undocumented immigrants in the District is the hospitality industry.\nIn recent days, business who have spoken out against the president’s policies have been rewarded with support on social media, and companies that have spoken out against his policies have been met with sharp criticism from both sides. Starbucks announced that it would hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years, a decision that was met by calls for a boycott from the right . A campaign to delete the Uber app trended this weekend, after the company continued to accept fares from John F. Kennedy International Airport after a taxi strike in solidarity with travelers who were being detained due to the travel ban. Uber later said it would establish a fund to assist drivers affected by the refugee ban. But passengers tweeted about their intentions to switch to Lyft, another ride-sharing service that was being lauded for its donation to the American Civil Liberties Union.\nFor Taylor Gourmet, the backlash is especially ironic considering the company’s downtown billboard that reads: “Less politics, more hoagies.”\nThinking about lunch already.
