He was 69. \nPage Stallings, Trucks' booking agent, said Trucks died Tuesday at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. Stallings didn't know the cause of death. \nTrucks was one of two original drummers, along with Jai Johanny \"Jaimoe\" Johanson, who helped formed the rhythms and the drive for The Allman Brothers. Formed in 1969 and led by Duane and Gregg Allman, the group helped define the Southern rock sound that incorporated blues, rock, country and jazz. \nOriginally from Jacksonville, Fla., Trucks joined with the Allman siblings to form the band, including guitarist Dickey Betts and bassist Berry Oakley. They moved to Macon, Ga., to cut their first record with Capricorn Records. \nIn a statement released Wednesday, Gregg Allman mourned the loss of his longtime friend and partner. \n\"I'm heartbroken. I've lost another brother and it hurts beyond words. Butch and I knew each other since we were teenagers and we were bandmates for over 45 years. He was a great man and a great drummer and I'm going to miss him forever. Rest In Peace Brother Butch,\" he said. \nThe two ABB drummers melded their individual styles, with Trucks considered to be the straightforward, driving-train rhythm player, while Johanson added his R&B and jazz drumming influences. \nThe band's 1971 live album, At Fillmore East , became their seminal breakthrough release, featuring a fusion of jazz, blues and rock and including such songs as \"You Don't Love Me\" and a 22-minute-long version of \"Whipping Post.\" \nBut Duane Allman died shortly after that record in 1971 and Oakley died in 1972. The band continued to record and tour before breaking up in the late '70s. Over the last three decades, they have reformed several times with additional bandmembers. \nIn 1995, The Allman Brothers Band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \nTrucks also helped encourage a family lineage of musicians. One nephew, Derek Trucks, is the frontman of the Tedeschi Trucks Band and also joined The Allman Brothers band in 1999 as a guitarist. Another nephew, Duane Trucks, is the drummer for Widespread Panic. \nTrucks was most recently touring with his band, Butch Trucks and the Freight Train. He is survived by his wife and four children.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:45:58.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
