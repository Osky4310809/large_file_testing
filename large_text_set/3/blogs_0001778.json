Wolfsburg is rectifying the situation, belatedly. Autocar reports that VW will launch a new small SUV by the end of 2018. \nLike its rivals, VW’s compact crossover will sit on the platform of its B-segment supermini, the Polo. The model will take on the Renault Captur , Peugeot 2008 and Opel/Vauxhall Mokka in Europe. Here in Asia, we have the market leading Honda HR-V , Mazda CX-3 and the anticipated Toyota C-HR in the lucrative segment. \nAccording to the British mag, the upcoming VW SUV will take inspiration from the T-Cross Breeze concept that was displayed at last year’s Geneva Motor Show. Of course, the production car will have a fixed metal roof, five doors and seating for five. It will be built alongside the next-generation Polo in Spain, the report adds. \nThe small sibling of the Tiguan and Touareg will also share engines with the new Polo – expect three- and four-cylinder turbo motors ranging from 74 hp to 200 hp, Autocar says. \nAlso on the cards is a new petrol hybrid system that will serve as an alternative to the currently popular 1.6 TDI option. The mild hybrid system will employ a 15kW electric motor alongside a seven-speed DSG, and will provide few kilometres of electric drive, plus assist in acceleration. Over time, motor output and electric range will be boosted. \nGALLERY: Volkswagen T-Cross Breeze Concept Research Volkswagen Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:04:21.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
