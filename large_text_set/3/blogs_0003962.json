'Dealt with' \nThe SYFA set a deadline of 28 February to clear a backlog of about 950 applications., but Mr Little said a further 1,170 were now being processed after an influx in applications for next season. \nHe added: \"The backlog that existed has now been cleared. That process has now been completed and people who were not compliant have been dealt with. \n\"As of today, with the new members coming in in February, there's 1,170 new members who have joined the SYFA.\" \nAsked by committee member Clare Haughey how many people had been placed on an automatic suspension for not submitting a PVG application, Mr Little said: \"In respect of the backlog, 488. \n\"They are precautionary suspended, that means they are completely debarred from participation in any football under the jurisdiction of the SYFA.\" \nWhen asked how long they were coaching in the SYFA before they were suspended, Mr Little said: \"That would vary from official to official. They would have had access (to children) only via supervision.\" Offer of help \nThe Holyrood session on child protection in sport follows allegations of historical abuse in football . Police Scotland is investigating and the SFA has set up an independent review. \nLast month, Disclosure Scotland, which runs the PVG scheme, told MSPs the SYFA turned down an offer of help to clear the backlog of checks. \nSFA chief executive Stewart Regan told the committee his organisation had also offered to help. \nHe said: \"Back in February 2015, we offered support on child protection matters to the SYFA which was rejected at the time in favour of further financial support.\" \nMr Little said: \"I think at this particular stage we're trying to get the ability to bring more volunteers in to do more of the work (process applications). \n\"It would certainly assist if we had the ability to increase staff. The help that was on offer was in respect of the checking of the forms at meetings. \n\"With all due respect, that wasn't the assistance we required at that particular time. We've since had meetings with Disclosure Scotland where we've spoken about training and process.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:34:05.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
