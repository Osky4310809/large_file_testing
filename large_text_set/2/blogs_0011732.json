USA TODAY NETWORK Dane DeHaan's sanity is tested in 'A Cure for Wellness.' (Photo: 20th Century Fox) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLOS ANGELES — Warning, spa-loving Hollywood: The psychological thriller A Cure for Wellness (in theaters Friday) turns therapy treatments into twisted terrors. \nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 star Dane DeHaan plays an ambitious Wall Street executive called Lockhart, who's on a mission to retrieve his company’s CEO from the seemingly revitalizing European resort. DeHaan bore the brunt of the movie's weirdest scenes, from dental torture to isolation water tanks gone very wrong. \nThe actor says director Gore Verbinski grouped all his painful scenes together. \n“There was this one month of torture,” says DeHaan, 31. \"It was like, 'OK, I finally finished shooting in the water tank, but tomorrow I’ll be strapped in a dental chair.' This was a marathon.” \nOver drinks in the antiquated Chateau Marmont Hotel, DeHaan shared his bizarre Wellness memories: \nLockhart (Dane DeHaan) gets a taste of undesirable dental work in 'A Cure for Wellness.' (Photo: 20th Century Fox) \nDrill, baby, drill! \nDental work at a spa that doesn't do anesthesia makes for painful moments. DeHaan wore this “intense apparatus” which forced his mouth open while his arms, body and head were strapped to the chair — accompanied by the sound of a high-pitched dental drill. \n“I couldn't move,” says DeHaan. “The drill piece is made out of rubber. But it’s a drill and it’s coming at me.” The best Super Bowl trailers from 'Baywatch' to 'Furious' to 'Guardians' \nDeHaan didn't know how he’d react to the bizarre situation when cameras rolled. \n“My reaction was entirely genuine. I was squealing like a pig. Gore just dug that and wanted that,” says DeHaan. “Two days of that. Those scenes (messed) with me psychologically the most. It wasn’t good. I’m due to go to the dentist for real, but I don’t want to go.” \nDane DeHaan wipes out in 'A Cure for Wellness.' (Photo: 20th Century Fox) \nThat time he turned into a human crash-test dummy \nLockhart’s rolling car crash, in which he breaks a leg, is shown in excruciating close-up. The car was placed on a rotisserie-like device “and they would just spin it around and around and film me getting tossed,\" says DeHaan. \nHe was harnessed in to keep from flying out of the car, but loose enough that his head and arms realistically banged the ceiling. \n“My arm actually popped out of the shoulder socket during filming and then popped back in,” says DeHaan. “That was intense and the only time I really injured myself filming.” \nThe actor gets tanked in 'A Cure for Wellness.' (Photo: 20th Century Fox) \nTerrors of the isolation tank \nShooting Lockhart’s trip into a water isolation tank required two weeks of wearing an oxygen hose and a waist harness attached to wires to keep his body floating and horizontal. \nVerbinski would talk through an intercom and DeHaan would hand signal that things were OK, needed adjustment or needed to stop. During one scene where the tank fills up, DeHaan signaled that the water pressure was intense. \n“I gave the hand signal that ‘Something is not OK. Can we stop?' but in the underwater speaker I hear Gore say, ‘Is he OK, what’s going on?’ The tank kept filling and I kept feeling all this pressure,” says DeHaan. \"Finally, I gave the ‘Get me out of here!’ signal and divers dove in.” \n“But it was two weeks of shooting this in shorts and a fake cast,” says DeHaan. “I was very pruney, for sure.” \nLockhart (Dane DeHaan) gets mauled by fellow spa guests in 'A Cure for Wellness.' (Photo: 20th Century Fox) \nThe extras were hands-on \nThe scene where Lockhart gets roughed up by octogenarian spa-goers wasn't as torturous as it appears. \n“It was these older German people who have never been in a movie before,\" says DeHaan. \"They would just smile as they were slapping me. It took a lot to concentration to keep my focus.\" 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2llq0sg NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
