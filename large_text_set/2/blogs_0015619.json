While it doesn't fire anything, ZaziNombies' replica has \"realistic reload action\" and the design, such as the translucent red scope, is made to look as similar as possible to the original. The replica measures four feet long, and is made with an estimated 1,800 Lego bricks. \nThis isn't the first time ZaziNombies created a Lego weapon inspired by Overwatch. Check out his Lego creation of Reaper's shotguns here . \nFor more of ZaziNombies' creations, take a look at his YouTube channel . His past works include building replicas for Doom's BFG 9000 and Claptrap from Borderlands . \nEmail the author , or follow on Game Informer .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:31:38.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
