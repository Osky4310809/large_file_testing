She exudes strength, confidence, and inspiration in each and every photo she shares. But with each snapshot she takes, she's also learning to embrace an entirely other realm of her body that rarely sees the camera: her cellulite. The bodybuilder and founder of Grrrl Clothing , an athletic wear brand made to fit all body types and sizes (it even has its own \"Grrrl Army\" following), recently opened up to her followers about embracing her so-called imperfections in an inspiring post on Instagram.

We've changed the game.\" More dispelling beauty stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:38:36.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
