Severe winter storms have brought torrential rain and significant snow after five years of drought. \nDamage to California’s highways is estimated at nearly $600 million. More than 14,000 people in San Jose were forced to evacuate last month and floods shut down a portion of a major freeway. \nIn the Yosemite Valley, only one of three main routes into the national park’s major attraction is open because of damage or fear the roads could give out from cracks and seeping water, rangers said. On central California’s rain-soaked coast, a bridge in Big Sur has crumbled beyond repair, blocking passage on the north-south Highway 1 through the tourist destination for up to a year. \nProposals by Gov. Jerry Brown for $387 million for flood control and emergency response were “an important start,” Laird said at a Senate hearing Wednesday, but the requests fall far short of the amount needed to address flood projects statewide.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said nearly half of California’s 1,400 dams are designated as “high hazard potential” by state officials. \nThe state has invested about $11 billion in flood control management over the past decade, Harris said, yet more action is needed to protect nearly 7 million people and $580 billion worth of assets — buildings, farmland, and crops — that are at risk. \nThe committee also heard from officials in Wyoming and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where recent floods caused millions of dollars in damage. \nThe panel’s chairman, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said winter “ice jams” on partially frozen rivers, combined with rapid snowmelt, cause frequent floods that harm small towns from Wyoming to the Dakotas and upstate New York. \nPresident Donald Trump has made improving the nation’s infrastructure a priority, and Barrasso said he was optimistic Congress would approve funding to modernize dams and levees across the country. \n“Infrastructure is critical to our nation’s prosperity,” Barrasso said. “It’s a driver of our nation’s economy and it impacts every community.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:16:43.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
