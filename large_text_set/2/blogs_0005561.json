In this second release from their instrumental series, the prolific musicians cover well-known worship songs (both their own and others’), weaving familiar melodies into ethereal electronic arrangements. The lush, layered instrumentation on tracks like “It Is Well” and “Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)” creates an uplifting and transporting soundscape. Meanwhile, stripped-down songs like the piano-driven “Isabelline (Interlude)” turn contemplative, providing gentle counterpoint. Customer Reviews Bethel Produces Jaw-Dropping Worship Music Again by WilsonnAngel I promise, this worship team never ceases to amaze me. The album hasn't even dropped yet, but just by listening to the previews, I can already TELL I'm going to be flabbergasted by the full product! PLEASE, support this ministry by purchasing this album! Illegally downloading is a form of STEALING! Trust me, buy this album, IT'S WELL WORTH IT. I can already TELL its going to be AMAZING!!! Perfect Prayer Time Music by tunedears There is not much instrument worship music out there, however this is the cream of the crop. :D Disappointing by SammyXp I had high expectations from the worship group in Redding, based on the phenomenal way God has used their talents in previous albums. When I heard their new album would be instrumental, I recoiled at first, thinking that the music couldn't possibly entertain God's presence without the heartfelt vocals of Brian and Jenn Johnson and team. But then I thought about \"Give Me Jesus\" off the Tides album, and the way the instrumentals created an environment of praise that just might stand on its own, and I found myself looking forward to this album!What a disappointment.Bethel Music advertised that the instrumental album would be composed of both new songs and some recognizable worship favorites that would allow you encounter God in your own voice. There are a handful of recognizable titles, but I would never know it unless I glanced at the screen to see it. The rest of the album plays like the cheap $6.99 CD's you can buy at the little stands at stores in the mall like Natural Wonders (do they even have those any more? Admittedly, I haven't been to a mall since the '90's.)If you're into transcendental meditation music, this might be for you, though!
