During the 2016 election, the Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient called Trump a “ demagogue who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator. ”\nNow, Hawking is urging the President to take climate change seriously. “He should replace Scott Pruitt at the Environment Protection Agency,” Hawking said. “Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it’s one we can prevent. It affects America badly, so tackling it should win votes for his second term. God forbid.”\nWatch the full interview at ITV .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:05:13.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
