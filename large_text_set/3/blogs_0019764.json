By Tom Phillips Published 16/03/2017 \nResident Evil 7 is getting an upcoming free expansion, named Not a Hero, which stars series legend Chris Redfield - but fans had been speculating all was not what it seemed. \nSome fans doubted whether the character being presented as Chris Redfield was indeed the returning star - not least, because his character design was very different. \nHowever, a new blog post from Capcom appears to confirm the Chris Redfield we'll be playing as is indeed really him - bursting a growing, popular Resident Evil fan theory which actually made a lot of sense. \nApart from the change in character design, fans had real reason to believe Chris was not who he seemed. These reasons involve spoilers for Resident Evil 7 itself. Fair warning: we'll get into them just below. Left: Chris in Resident Evil 6. Right: Chris in Resident Evil 7. \nThere may be spoilers ahead: \nChris pops up first at the end of Resident Evil 7, arriving in a helicopter with Umbrella's logo attached. It appears Chris is working with Umbrella, the series' bad guys - a complete U-turn of allegiance. \nSo, fans had speculated, this Chris was actually someone else. Someone whose face had barely been glimpsed in the series to date - the masked Umbrella operative Hunk. There were also whispers that Resident Evil Revelations, worked on by Resident Evil 7's director, once featured this plotline - of a character suddenly being revealed as Hunk - before it ended up being cut. \nBut Capcom has now addressed the changed design for Chris' character model in a fresh blog post - and it seems the alteration is just that: a simple decision to change his design. \n\"This time, each character is made on the premise of photo realistic depiction, and Chris Redfield which appears in \"Not A Hero\" (DLC scheduled for free delivery this spring) also receives a pretty impressive impression,\" Resident Evil 7 director Koushi Nakanishi wrote. \nResi 6's Chris model was just not suitable for Resi 7's game engine or aesthetic, Nakanishi continued: \n\"Although it is fairly realistic impression, even if it mixes with the character of \"7\", it seems that a sense of incongruity will come out.\" \nWe'll just have to play Not a Hero when it is released and discover Chris' new machinations ourselves.
