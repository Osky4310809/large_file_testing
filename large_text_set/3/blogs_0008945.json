Cory Booker is maybe possibly going to be a presidential candidate at some point in our lives, although who knows, because getting straight answers from a politician is hardly a thing that is possible. \nBooker has been thought of as a potential Democratic presidential candidate for a while now, and he didn’t do anything to tamp down the rumors on Friday at SXSW in Austin, Texas. \n“I don’t know what the future holds, but at this time in my life, I want to be a fierce truth teller,” Booker said during a discussion to kick off the festival. “Let’s not focus on 2020. Let’s work on the injustices that exist now.” \nHe didn’t say he wasn’t going to, though he didn’t say he was going to, so, you know, do what you will with that. His remarks were toned down from January, however, when he explicitly told reporters “I am not open to being president.” \nDuring a later sit-down interview, Booker said he’s running for reelection in 2020. \nI’d say that settles it, but should he choose to try for the White House, it wouldn’t be the first time a politician has flip-flopped. \n“The Mashable Show” is live on Twitter from SXSW on March 11 and 12 at 1 p.m. EST and you can tune in right here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T07:20:40.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
