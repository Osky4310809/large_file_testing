The blown V12 produces 610 hp at 5,500 rpm and 800 Nm of torque at 1,550 rpm, propelling the luxury sedan to 100 km/h in 3.7 seconds, and onwards to an electronically-limited top speed of 250 km/h. With the optional M Driver’s Package specified, the speed limiter is raised to 305 km/h. \nCombined fuel consumption is rated at 12.8 L/100 km, with combined CO2 emissions rated at 294 g/km. The M760Li’s prodigious outputs are channeled to all four wheels via an eight-speed Steptronic transmission, while the rear-biased xDrive all-wheel drive layout adapts to available grip levels, and distributes engine output to the most suitable corners as required. \nM Performance-specific software tuning is applied to the M760Li’s eight-speed transmission, aimed at delivering “sportier gearchanges” and quicker downshifts throughout the V12’s rev range, with the shift programming adapted to the characteristics of the engine itself. Beyond its sporting side, the transmission draws from the vehicle’s navigation data for optimum gear selection, and elsewhere works with the Auto Start Stop function. \nAs with present day 5 and 7 Series models, the M760Li xDrive comes with an extensive range of driver assistance systems. Driving Assistant Plus includes steering and lane control assistance, lane keeping assistance with active side collision protection, rear collision prevention and crossing traffic warning functions. \nBeing a luxury sedan often tasked with limousine duties, the 7 Series needs to be accomplished in the chassis department. To that end, the M760Li xDrive employs the Executive Drive Pro suspension system, which together with all-round air suspension, includes active roll stabilisation as part of its arsenal to minimise body movements. Performance tyres mounted on 20-inch, M light-alloy wheels aim to give the 760Li xDrive “the best driving dynamics in its class,” without negatively affecting ride comfort, says BMW. \nAt the helm, Integral Active Steering in the M760Li xDrive integrates rear-wheel steering into the mix, which aims to reduce steering effort and increase manoeuvrability in urban scenarios, while aiding directional stability at higher speeds, with smooth and composed responses when changing lanes and cornering. \nDifferent steering characteristics are selected in driving programmes via the Drive Experience Control switch, which includes an Adaptive mode for automatic selection of driving modes best suited to the situations. \nAs detailed here, the M760Li xDrive can also be specified in a less overtly sporting, more discreet exterior, in the guise of the BMW M760Li xDrive Model V12 Excellence . The V12 Excellence rolls on 20-inch, BMW Individual light-alloy wheels in W-spoke 646 design, with tyres sized 245/40R20 in front, and 275/35R20 for the rear. In front, the V12 Excellence features a full-width chrome bar, along with silver kidney grille bars housed within bright chrome surrounds. \nProminent V12 badging features around the V12 Excellence, while around the back, rectangular tailpipe embellishers surround the outlets for a more subdued and refined exhaust note relative to the car decked-out in standard M Performance trim. Inside, the V12 Excellence adopts the Pure Excellence interior design package, which brings an Alcantara headliner, door sill plates in fine brushed aluminium with illuminated V12 badge and decorative stitching in the lower section of the instrument panel. \nAlso, fine wood inlays feature on the seat belt outlet covers, armrest and rear roof grab handles, while the rear compartment gains deep-pile floor mats. For the driver, the leather steering wheel gains wood trim, while the instrument cluster displays the V12 emblem upon starting up the engine.
