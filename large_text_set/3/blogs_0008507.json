Four years later, CalPERS Board of Administration member Richard Costigan said the natur Dan Smith The Sacramento Bee \nScarber’s bid for a full disability pension has led to the unusual public disclosure of some of his personnel records. Such documents normally remain concealed because of privacy protections granted to California public safety employees. \nAs a result, CalPERS members received copies of a scathing July 2013 report from the CHP that ordered his dismissal. It accused him of storing pornography on his computer, using his rank to seek favors at the Fresno County jail while his son was in custody and ultimately creating a fake crime scene at his house on the night his wife, son and stepdaughter drove to Mexico. \nThe appearance is you got in trouble and you decided to try to retire. \nCalPERS board member Theresa Taylor to Kyle Scarber \nTheir flight to Mexico took place in the midst of Spencer Scarber’s trial. A jury convicted him while he was out of the country, and he was sentenced to 35 years in prison after he was apprehended in Acapulco. \n“The statements you provided to the (Fresno County Sheriff’s Office) were dishonest and aided in Spencer Scarber fleeing the country,” read the 2013 CHP report, which was called a notice of adverse action. \nAt the end of 2013, the CHP withdrew Scarber’s dismissal and accepted his voluntary resignation “for personal reasons.” \nThe settlement, signed by CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow, required Scarber to drop an appeal he filed contesting his dismissal. It also said he could not work for the CHP again. \nHe first filed a disability claim in February 2013 based on the December 2012 medical appointment that declared him unable to work. Scarber told The Bee it was a coincidence that the medical appointment took place a week after his son fled his trial. \n“I can’t make my medical results or (electrocardiogram) or blood pressure results react that way. These things have been harboring, festering for years, these ailments,” he said. \nHis CalPERS disability claim asserts that “cumulative” events during his career have caused chest pain, fatigue, headaches and panic attacks. At CalPERS, Scarber told board members about two traumatic incidents that have stayed with him. In one, a “gang-banger” struck him on the head with a metal object; in another, he sat with a dead infant at the scene of a car accident while waiting for the coroner to arrive. He also said he was involved in car accidents on duty. \nSome of the allegations in the notice of adverse action are similar to the criminal charges that Scarber, his wife and stepdaughter are still facing. He’s due in court next week for a pretrial hearing, where a trial date could be announced. \nAt past hearings, he has cast his family as the victims of a political conspiracy , charging their son did not receive a fair trial and that authorities have mistreated them. He further said law enforcement officers did not properly investigate threats again him and his family. \nThe notice of adverse of action “is wrong,” he told The Bee. “The allegations, every one of the allegations could have been acquitted, could have been reduced.” \nState employees convicted of felonies can lose portions of their pensions, according to CalPERS. They lose credit for years of service that take place after a felony act. \nThat means Scarber could lose about one year’s worth of service credit, or about 3 percent of his income. He would retain credit for his previous 23 years. \nAdam Ashton: 916-321-1063 , @Adam_Ashton . Sign up for state worker news alerts at sacbee.com/newsletters .
