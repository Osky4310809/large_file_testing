In an interview with Times Now on Wednesday afternoon, Anna Hazare said while the entire world is developing with the help of Science and Technology, people are talking about using ballot papers. “Science and Technology are developing, the world is going ahead and we are talking about using ballot papers! It’s like going backwards,” said Anna who started a hunger strike in 2011 against the Indian government in support of The Lokpal Bill. Arvind Kejriwal was one of the prominent members of ‘team Anna’ but later joined politics. \nREAD | MCD Polls 2017: Arvind Kejriwal why only EVMs, let’s stop using laptops and smartphones too! \nAnna gave reasons to support his statement. He added, “First of all, the voter has to either sign or put his thumb impression on the ballot paper which takes a lot of time. Secondly, the voter has to fold the ballot paper and put it inside the box and thirdly, counting of votes also takes a lot of time.” He said using EVMs saves a lot of time but there are certain issues with the current machines that need to be addressed. \nWatch Anna Hazare’s take on ballot voting: Anna Hazare says ballot voting is regressive. #Watch a @TimesNow exclusive pic.twitter.com/TuzqK2ZE26 \n— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) March 15, 2017 \n“Yes, the voting has to be done through EVMs but by making certain changes in the present machines. The Election Commission should use totaliser machines instead of EVMs. If we start using, nobody can doubt the voting procedure. With the help of the totaliser machine, no one will be able to find out who got how many votes in which area,” said Anna while revealing that he had written to the Election Commission asking them to buy totaliser machines. He said even though EC forwarded the proposal to the Indian government, the machines haven’t been bought due to some reason. \nThe Election Commission’s proposal over totaliser machines came in November 2008 and last year a team of Union Ministers was formed on the direction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take the final decision on the matter. EVMs were introduced in India partially in 1999 elections and in complete from the 2003 elections. Before that, voting used to take place by mixing of ballot papers.
