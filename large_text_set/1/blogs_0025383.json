Instead, he's preparing to release the \"modern day 400 Degreez, \" according to the SoundCloud description of his new track \"Red Sox.\" For those who may be too young to remember, 400 Degreez is the 1998 album from Juvie that housed the massive single \"Back That Azz Up' and \"Ha,\" and was certified 4x platinum a year after its release.Setting a goal to replicate that kind of influence is ambitious, but Juvie has teamed with the right person to get the album rollout started, tapping Young Thug for the new record. Juvie starts things off with his signature bounce flows, before handing things off to Thug who pays tribute to the H-O-T Boys, Juvenile's former group, and takes the track in some unexpected directions.
