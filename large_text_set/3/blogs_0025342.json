That is quite a shocking realisation.” \nMasood also reportedly told staff at the Preston Park Hotel in Brighton that London “wasn’t like what it used to be”. \nA source told The Sun he chatted with staff at the hotel and told them he was “off to London today”. \nDetectives traced him to the hotel thanks to a receipt left in the car he crashed into railings outside Parliament \nPolice have appealed to anyone who knew Masood to come forward with information. Londoners celebrate diversity in face of right-wing response to attack \nHe is believed to have operated under various aliases, and the Metropolitan Police have revealed he was born as Adrian Russell Ajao in Kent. \nMasood killed three people with a hired car as he drove into pedestrians on Westminster bridge, before crashing the car and stabbing PC Keith Palmer outside Parliament. \nFifty people were injured in the attack and 31 required hospital treatment. Two people remain in a critical condition, one with life-threatening injuries. \nIsis hailed Masood as a “soldier of the Islamic State” in a claim of responsibility issued the following day, although the extent of any involvement by the terrorist group remains unclear. \nScotland Yard's Deputy Commissioner Mark Rowley said officers were investigating whether Masood was radicalised by online jihadi propaganda or if he had been directed by the terrorist group. \n“Our investigation focuses on understanding his motivation, his preparation and his associates,” he added.   \n“Our determination is to find out whether he acted totally alone inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T14:33:53.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
