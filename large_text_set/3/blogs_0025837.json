Adding “In recent years, there have been changes globally and locally that requires Nigerian Society to meet up with the demands of the 21stCentury. \n“Institutions are important for driving development as growths alone are not sufficient to create development. People should not see governance as an avenue to distribute “freebies” but as a collective responsibility involving everyone.” \nWhile identifying different perspectives of inequality in the country, Former president of NON-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions, (NASU) Ivor Takor, he said that some individual were born into poverty due to no fault of their own. \nHe also said that “In Nigeria, people who belong to richer echelons of the society have better access to quality education as well as employment. Also, disability, as well as gender, is a barrier to bridging inequality. \nHe added that “Taxation is not the most contextually efficient way of improving income inequality in Nigeria, rather, the government should focus on the provision of social security services for the population.
