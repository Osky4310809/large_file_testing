But as the first-year coach of the program, Field was unsure about what exactly to expect. However, his team has responded and has TWCA on the doorstep of another state championship game appearance with a 27-5 overall record. \n\"I would say once we got through the first half of district undefeated, we knew there was potential,\" Field said. \"We started to kind of project playoff brackets and the way things would break down. We just felt like our district was really strong, and that the top three teams out of our district could potentially compete for the final four.\" \nAfter earning a first-round bye, the Warriors pulled out a 51-50 victory over Austin Brentwood in the second round of the TAPPS 4A playoffs. And then last week, TWCA advanced to the final four with a 67-53 triumph over Bay Area Christian at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. \nNow the Warriors will face off against District 5 rival Northland Christian (20-12) at 11 a.m. today at Moody Coliseum on the campus of Abilene Christian University . \nThe winner will take on either Lubbock Trinity Christian (36-6) or Fort Worth Lake Country Christian (21-10) in the state championship game at 1 p.m. Friday. \nTWCA and Northland Christian split their two matchups this season with each team winning on the road. The Warriors took a 78-74 victory at the beginning of January, and the Cougars captured a 67-64 win just a few weeks later. \n\"It's definitely a tough matchup for us,\" Field said. \"They've got some really key players that we've got to slow down. â€¦ The biggest key is just being able to defend and keep them out of the paint.\" \nThe Warriors have been successful as a team because of their versatility and their wealth of talented from top to bottom. Junior forward Dawson Libonati leads the charge, averaging more than 20 points and nearly 10 rebounds per game this season. But he is just one piece of the puzzle. \nSenior guard Liam Mansfield , sophomore guard Zack Golaszewski , freshman guard Nash Golaszewski and 6-foot-9 freshman center Emanuel Jones have all played key roles in making TWCA a contender this season. \n\"We've been a great shooting team all year,\" Field said. \"Obviously we have talented players, but we don't have any one guy that you can really key on because any one of our top six, seven players could have a great game and score anywhere from 15 to 25 points. I think it makes us difficult to guard because we can play inside and outside.\" \nField said his team is excited about the possibility of bringing another state championship back to The Woodlands. After moving up a classification this school year, the Warriors are certainly proving they can hang with some of the top teams from around the state. \n\"I'm a pretty difficult coach to play for at times,\" Field said. \"But I want to make sure I tell my guys as much as I can that I love them and that I do everything for their best interest. I think once we started playing and started winning, they realized everything was worth it - everything they've endured and all the work they've put in to get to this point. I think they're going to look back and be proud of what they've done.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:38:28.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
