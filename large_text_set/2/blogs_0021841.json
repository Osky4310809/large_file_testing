John McCain (R-Ariz.) a “war criminal.” \nThe original tweet, which has since been deleted, linked to an article from the right-wing conspiracy website Gateway Pundit that alleged “globalist war criminal John McCain requested campaign donations from the Russians.” \n“Wow if true,” Hannity tweeted Wednesday night.

The Russian embassy told the BBC at the time that there wasn’t a nefarious request from McCain, they just received a standard McCain fundraising appeal in the mail. “It sounds like they’re having a little fun at our expense,” said McCain’s spokesman Brian Rogers. “It’s just an error.” \n“It’s evident that [the letter] was a mistake,” his Russian counterpart agreed. “It happens.” \nIn a statement Thursday, McCain’s spokeswoman Julie Varallo called on Hannity to “correct the record” following the tweet. \n“It is unfortunate that Sean Hannity would attack Senator John McCain over a fake news story,” Varallo said. “It’s wrong and he should correct the record.” \nHannity tweeted an apology Thursday afternoon. I retweeted an inaccurate article. My apologies to @SenJohnMcCain . \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 23, 2017 \nMcCain is a decorated Vietnam War veteran who was a prisoner of war for more than five years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:43:40.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
