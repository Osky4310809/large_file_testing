Tracks include No Woman No Cry, Jamming and Exodus. \nThey were at first believed to be ruined beyond repair, largely because of water damage. \nMarley, who died in 1981, would have been 72 on Monday. \nThe tapes were found in a run-down hotel in Kensal Rise, north-west London, where Bob Marley and the Wailers stayed during their European tours in the mid-1970s. \nThey were discovered when Joe Gatt, a Marley fan and London businessman, took a phone call from a friend, who had found them while doing a building refuse clearance. \nFrom the 13 reel-to-reel analogue master tapes, 10 were fully restored, two were blank and one was beyond repair. Work lasted one year and cost Â£25,000 ($31,200). \n\"They were (in an) appalling (condition)... I wasn't too hopeful,\" Martin Nichols, a sound engineer at the White House Studios in the west of England, told the BBC.

It was loaned to Bob Marley and the Wailers by the Rolling Stones.
