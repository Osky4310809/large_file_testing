Joshua vows not to be overawed by scale of Klitschko Wembley bout \nKhan said: “I can’t wait to see the fight of the year here in London and it’s fantastic that a post-war record crowd will get to watch it at a world-class venue like Wembley. \n“I’m delighted Transport for London and Network Rail have pulled out all the stops to make this happen so we can move 90,000 people around the capital quickly and safely. \n\"Like me, they have recognised the importance to the capital of staging this epic showdown of the best two fighters in the heavyweight division and I look forward to our great city staging more great fights in the future.” \nEddie Hearn - Joshua's Matchroom promoter - added: “I’m delighted that the capacity for Joshua vs Klitschko has been increased to 90,000 making it the biggest live gate of all time at the new Wembley stadium. Joshua to become superstar in 2017 as boxing prepares for huge fight \n\"I want to thank Wembley, TfL and Brent Council and particularly the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has fought our corner to ensure a capacity crowd will get the opportunity to watch this event live in the capital.\" \nJoshua is unbeaten in 18 professional fights, having quickly progressed through the ranks since winning Gold at the London 2012 Olympics. \nKlitschko, meanwhile, ruled the heavyweight division for nine years before losing his belts to Tyson Fury in November 2015.
