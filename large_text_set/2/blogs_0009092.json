(Terry Pluto / Plain Dealer) \nWOOSTER, Ohio -- There are times when Steve Moore seems to be auditioning to be the nicest, most boring man in the world. \nIt's usually when you first meet the Wooster College basketball coach. \nYou wonder, \"This is the guy who just won his 700th game at Wooster, a guy with the second-most victories (795) in the history of Division III basketball?\" \nMoore looks like someone you'd expect to live next door to Mr. Rogers in his neighborhood. \n\"You need to see him in the gym,\" said Dan Fanelly, a senior from Green High School, and Wooster's leading scorer averaging 18 points per game. \nFanelly began telling stories. \nLike the time Moore didn't think his team was playing tough enough defense during practice. The Scots had a drill where players worked on taking charges. \n\"Coach jumped right in and took,\" said Fanelly. \nAnd went splat on the court. \n\"Right there,\" said Doug Cline, the Wooster assistant coach, pointing to a corner of the gym. \nThat's where Moore wanted to demonstrate how his team needed to hit the court to grab a loose ball. Instead, he crashed into a wall. He was a bit shaken up, but nothing much hurt, except possibly his pride. \nIt could have been worse. \n\"Several years ago, I tried to show them how to go for a loose ball,\" said Moore. \"I swore I broke my arm.\" \nHe said it in the tone of voice of a man who would be describing how he stopped at the store on the way home for bread and milk. \nPASSION, FIRE AND DECENCY \n\"On the court, he is so passionate,\" said Spencer Williams from Orange High, a 15-point scorer for the Scots. \nA junior, Williams recalled a game where Moore was so upset at the half that he threw his jacket and kicked a trash can. \n\"The assistant coaches ducked,\" said Williams, laughing. \nMoore almost never swears. He doesn't attack his players personally. He is not a junior version of Bob Knight, another coach with Wayne County roots. \nHe just wants the game played the right way. \n\"He is one of the all-time great coaches and we know that,\" said Fanelly. \"When you talk to him, he's one of the most humble people you ever meet. He is a very kind man, just a good person.\" \nThat's what you discover after spending some time with Moore -- his inherent decency. \nHis anger will flare. The temperature in the room or the practice gym can soar. But he does it in a way that doesn't belittle his players. \nIn a recent game at Oberlin, Moore went into a defensive stance, his eyes wide, moving his feet, sweating and demanding his guys \"play with fire.\" \nHe was wearing a suit at the time. \n\"I love playing for him,\" said Williams. \nOn a whiteboard in the Wooster dressing room, this was written: IF YOU GO FAST, YOU GO ALONE ... IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR, GO TOGETHER. \nThat's how he coaches. \nFINAL SCORE: 15-6 \nMoore is 64 years old. He began his college coaching career before there was a shot clock, before the 3-point shot. \nIn his rookie season as a head college coach (1981-82), Moore's Muhlenberg Mules were playing a far more talented Dickinson College team. \nDickinson played a tight zone. Moore wanted to bring them out to play man-to-man. So he ordered his players to hold the ball. \nThe Mules stubbornly stood outside the zone, passing the ball around. \nDickinson stayed in the zone. Right before the half, a Muhlenberg player fired a shot and made it. \nMuhlenberg had a 2-0 lead at half. It was 6-4 late in the game before Dickinson finally won, 15-6. That game set several Division III records for fewest points and shots in a game. They will probably stand forever unless the shot clock disappears. \n\"We had try something,\" said Moore. \"They had drilled us by 30-some points earlier.\" \nActually, the final score was 77-53, but the game wasn't even that close. \nThis year's Wooster team is averaging 85 points per game. In 2005-06, the Scots scored 98.2 points a game. \n\"Coach adapts to his talent,\" said Cline. \n30 YEARS AT WOOSTER \nMoore has spent three decades at Wooster, winning everything except a Division III national title. \nHe has been to the Division III Final Four three times, losing in the 2011 Finals. \nLast season, his Scots were 24-8 and went to the Elite Eight of Division III. \nMoore has never had a losing season at Wooster. His team has the highest winning percentage (.838) since 2000 in all of college basketball, any NCAA division. \nThis season, his Scots are 16-6 overall, 13-2 in the North Coast Athletic Conference. They have won 10 in a row. \nOnce he arrived in Wooster in 1987, Moore said he's never thought about coaching anywhere else. \nAssistant coach Bruce Martin has been with Moore for 23 seasons. Cline played four years for Moore and has been an assistant for 21 seasons. \nCline has turned down Division III head coaching jobs to stay with Moore and at Wooster. \nThis school, this level of basketball has a hold on these coaches. \nWHY HE STAYS \n\"I like Division III because you coach some exceptional young men,\" Moore said. \"Wooster is a special place. There's great community support. I've been able to coach so many good players and people.\" \nMoore has not had any real interest in coaching at the Division I level. He knows that Division III is non-scholarship. He and his assistant coaches worked with some others to renovate the locker rooms several years ago. \n\"We did grunt work putting in the new wooden lockers,\" he said. \nMoore's office is cramped, and has pictures drawn by his grandchildren above his desk. It's not a place designed to impress recruits or their parents. \nIt's pure, no-frills basketball. He's in no rush to retire. \n\"I still get the butterflies before games,\" he said. \"I still don't sleep much after we lose. I still enjoy the players.\" \nThe only Division III coach with more victories than Moore (795) is Franklin & Marshall's Glenn Robinson (927). \n\"He's still coaching,\" said Moore. \"I coached against him when I was at Muhlenberg.\" \nRobinson is 72 years old. He has been Franklin & Marshall's head coach since 1971 and has a 15-6 record this season. \nMoore is not thinking about history, just coaching. \n\"I want to keep impacting the lives of my players,\" he said. \"At this level, that's really your job.\" More Terry Pluto", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T22:06:35.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
