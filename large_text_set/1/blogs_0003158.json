The move follows the departure of one the show’s two leads, Nicole Beharie who was written out in the show’s season-three finale. \n“Sleepy Hollow,” which was a breakout hit when it aired on Mondays in its first season, has faded since as it shifted t o Thursd ay and the n Frid ay halfway through season three. This season, it averaged a 1.4 rating in adults 18-49 and 4.8 million viewers overall in Nielsen’s “live plus-7” estimates. \nBeharie’s character was killed off in the April season finale. Though her departure may have surprised fans, it had been in discussions since before season three began. Beharie no longer wanted to be on the show and had been eyeing an exit from her contract for some time. The show’s producers did not step in the way of her departure, and originally had planned to write her off in the midseason finale. The network backed away from the plan, deciding to finish out the season with the star, who has been co-lead alongside Tom Mison since the show premiered in 2013. \nThe drama series is produced by 20th Century Fox Television and K/O Paper Products. It is created by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Phillip Iscove and Len Wiseman. Kurtzman, Orci, Wiseman, Clifton Campbell, Albert Kim, Russell Fine, Heather Kadin and Raven Metzner serve as executive producers.
