At one point there were 600,000 apps that relied on the platform. \nWhile Parse wasn’t the most popular tool amongst experienced developers (who had the resources to build their own custom backends) it was an invaluable tool for smaller developers. \nI first came across the service in high school when I was just dipping my toes into iOS development. The low cost (free for most small users) combined with relative ease of use and detailed documentation made it an invaluable tool for me and many others young developers. \nThat’s why the community was so shocked when Facebook decided to shut it down – supporting Parse seemed like a small price to pay to appease an entire developer community, many of whom Facebook rely on to build apps for Facebook. \nParse did publish a big migration guide as well as open source their server backend , both of which are legitimate alternatives for developers needing a Parse replacement. \nBye Parse, we hardly knew ya. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:06:48.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
