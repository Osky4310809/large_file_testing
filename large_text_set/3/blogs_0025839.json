The last senior to win was Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith in 2006, who at the time was the eighth senior in a 12-year span to earn the hardware. A greater dependence on underclassmen has contributed to younger stars dominating recent Heisman wins, in addition to the dearth of standout seniors who remain in college rather than turn pro following their junior season. These factors have made the likelihood of a senior winning less and less each season, but that class isn't completely out of the running — certainly not with the 2017 crop that's in contention. The decisions by several notable players to return for their final seasons makes this year's senior Heisman hopefuls among the best in years. We've highlighted 10 seniors with the best chance of winning the award, or at least getting an invite to the Heisman ceremony in New York City in December. J.T. Barrett, QB, Ohio State 2 of 11 2016 stats: 2,555 passing yards, 24 TDs; 845 rushing yards, nine TDs Why he has a shot As he reaches the conclusion of a college career filled with ups and downs, J.T. Barrett might not be able to finally win the Heisman he's been so often linked to. At the very least, though, he is worthy of a Heisman lifetime achievement. Barrett's breakout redshirt freshman season put him in the hunt for the award until he broke his ankle in the regular-season finale, and Ohio State's decision to split snaps between him and Cardale Jones in 2015 sapped any shot of being a legitimate candidate that year. He was again a top contender entering last season, sitting third in OddsShark's rankings in September, but Ohio State's offense regressed over the course of the year, and he failed to finish in the top 10 in voting. It's now or never for Barrett, and what could help his chances are an assault on the Big Ten record books. His 8,846 career yards of total offense is 3,847 behind Drew Brees, and the Ohio State player needs only five total touchdowns to pass the former Purdue quarterback's career mark of 104. Best opportunity for a Heisman moment Barrett threw four TD passes at Oklahoma last September, and Ohio State gets the Sooners at home this season on Sept. 9. That game will put him toe-to-toe with Sooners quarterback (and 2016 Heisman finalist) Baker Mayfield , likely giving whichever passer has the better overall game a major leg up in the Heisman race. Daniel Carlson, K, Auburn 2016 stats : 28-of-32 on field goals, 44-of-44 on PATs Why he has a shot Kickers are people too, though they don't normally get considered for awards other than the Lou Groza (given to college football's top place-kicker). Daniel Carlson has been a finalist for that trophy the past two seasons and should be a favorite to win this year. And if Auburn's offense struggles to produce like it did in 2016, his value could be even greater. Last year Carlson kicked 16 field goals on drives that stalled in the red zone, and he was 4-of-6 on tries from 50 yards out or longer. The Tigers' 18-13 win over LSU—best known for being the final game of LSU coach Les Miles ' tenure—saw Carlson provide every point for Auburn. Best opportunity for a Heisman moment Carlson needs 28 field goals (the same amount he made in 2016) to become the FBS career leader. Such a record-setting kick could come in the SEC title game, the playoffs or a bowl game, but even more notable would be if it were to give Auburn a win over archrival Alabama in the Iron Bowl on Nov. 25. Last season Carlson was 4-of-5 against the Crimson Tide, his team's only scorer in that 30-12 loss. Nick Chubb, RB, Georgia 2016 stats : 1,130 rushing yards, eight TDs; 86 receiving yards, one TD Why he has a shot Had he not suffered a horrific knee injury midway through the 2015 season Nick Chubb may have won the Heisman Trophy or at least gotten a ceremony invite. That same ailment is responsible for why he's not preparing for the NFL draft, instead coming back for another year to prove he can be the same player who had 13 consecutive 100-yard games prior to getting hurt. Chubb looked like he was completely recovered last September when he ran for 222 yards and two touchdowns against North Carolina less than 11 months on from major surgery, the first of five 100-yard games in 2016. But his production (and usage) wavered from game to game as Georgia struggled to figure out its offense with freshman quarterback Jacob Eason and first-year coach Kirby Smart. With Chubb and fellow senior rusher Sony Michel back, the Bulldogs should be far more consistent on offense, and Chubb figures to be the focal point to build around. He enters 2017 with 3,424 career rushing yards, needing 1,836 to pass Herschel Walker for the school record. Best opportunity for a Heisman moment Playing in the SEC provides no shortage of high-profile games for Chubb to participate in, as the last two Heisman-winning running backs (Alabama's Derrick Henry in 2015 and Mark Ingram in 2009) discovered. Before diving into those contests, though, Chubb gets an early campaign-launching opportunity when Georgia visits Notre Dame on Sept. 9. Luke Falk, QB, Washington State 5 of 11 2016 stats : 4,468 passing yards, 38 touchdowns Why he has a shot The turn toward dual-threat quarterbacks winning the Heisman is prevalent in the past decade, with Louisville's Lamar Jackson the latest passer whose win was just as much a product of his running ability as his passing acumen. His 3,543 passing yards were the 11th-most by a Heisman winner. Luke Falk's 2016 passing tally would rank third on that list behind only BYU's Ty Detmer (5,188 in 1984) and Houston's Andre Ware (4,699 in 1989). Washington State's pass-happy offense makes putting up big numbers very easy, and Falk is entering his third full season in that system. A 5,000-yard effort isn't hard to fathom when he gets asked to throw the ball nearly 50 times per game. Best opportunity for a Heisman moment A Sept. 9 visit from Boise State can get Falk on to the radar, but it will be how he does against the Pac-12's best that determines if he can be Washington State's first Heisman finalist since Ryan Leaf in 1997. Quinton Flowers, QB, South Florida 6 of 11 2016 stats : 2,812 passing yards, 24 TDs; 1,530 yards, 18 TDs Why he has a shot Quinton Flowers was the mid-major version of Lamar Jackson last season, a dominant mobile passer who was impossible to stop. The fact he played for South Florida against mostly American Athletic Conference teams kept him from getting more attention outside of when he had 319 yards of total offense against Florida State and then 366 total yards with five touchdowns in beating South Carolina in the Birmingham Bowl. The Bulls are still in the AAC but could be the favorites this year, a possibility made greater by the school hiring former Texas coach Charlie Strong to replace Willie Taggart. That's going to bring more attention to South Florida, and if Jackson struggles to match what he did in 2016, the same Heisman voters who picked him last year might look toward Flowers for a player with similar skills. Flowers' 1,530 rushing yards were only 41 behind Jackson, and he topped the 100-yard mark eight times. Best opportunities for a Heisman moment South Florida's only scheduled game against a power-conference team this season is Sept. 15 versus Illinois, a Friday night affair that should be one of many that will get the Bulls on national television. Their Sept. 21 game against AAC champ Temple, like the Illinois game, is already slotted for ESPN and the same could be the case for their Aug. 26 \"Week Zero\" trip to San Jose State. Harold Landry, DE, Boston College 7 of 11 2016 stats : 51 tackles (22 for loss), 16.5 sacks, seven forced fumbles, one interception Why he has a shot The reigning national leader in sacks was also fifth in tackles for loss, numbers that easily warranted jumping to the NFL after such a tremendous junior season. Yet, Harold Landry decided to stay at Boston College, unhappy with the third-round draft grade he received. \"I realized that the first round was going to be pretty tough to do,\" Landry told Matt Murschel of the Orlando Sentinel . \"And I believe in myself to be a first-rounder so that's why I came back to prove that I could be one.\" The motivation to prove he deserves more attention from pro scouts could also pay off in Landry being a real Heisman contender despite defensive players' difficulty in winning that award. Michigan linebacker Jabrill Peppers finished fifth and Alabama defensive lineman Jonathan Allen was seventh in the 2016 voting. Best opportunity for a Heisman moment In addition to hosting Notre Dame and Florida State, Boston College also gets to play Connecticut in Fenway Park in mid-November. Putting on a show in that unique environment would look great on the Heisman highlight reel, regardless of the opponent.
