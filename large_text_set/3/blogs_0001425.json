The company made the announcement with a tweet yesterday. Factoring in its free users, Spotify now has 100 million subscribers in over 60 markets who can access the more than 30 million songs in its catalog. Thank you to our 50 million subscribers. #Spotify50 pic.twitter.com/eXkOV71bwu \n— Spotify (@Spotify) March 2, 2017 Music Streaming Poised for Growth \nSpotify's achievement is more remarkable when you consider the fact that it extended its reach by 25% in less than six months, according to Reuters . Nielsen says that 2016 was the first year that streaming overtook digital sales. It makes up 38% of audio consumption and becoming a significant source of revenue for the music industry. More growth can be expected in this category. On-demand music streaming in the U.S. rose by 76% in 2016, while sales of digital tracks, digital albums and CDs fell by 25%, 20% and 16% respectively.

The former was launched in 2008 and Apple Music was introduced to users in 2015. Spotify's announcement comes days after Apple CEO Tim Cook announced in a shareholder meeting that Apple Music currently has 20 million subscribers. Jay Z's Tidal is far behind with 3 million subscribers. Apple Music launched last year, and its strategy thus far has been to sign exclusive deals with popular artists like Drake, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift. Spotify and Apple have been locked in a battle for winning over paying subscribers for a while now, with things heating up last year. Spotify allegedly began to penalize artists who signed for exclusive Apple music deals last year, by giving them less prominence on the website and offering them fewer promotional opportunities. Apple is also planning to bring original video content to Apple Music in a bid to attract more registered users.

Its $9.99 a month plan offers 150 million songs. Spotify currently charges users $9.99 a month, as does Apple music.Tech website The Verge recently speculated that Spotify is about to announce a new tier that would offer lossless streaming, similar to what Tidal offers its premium customers. The service is expected to cost $5 more, bringing the total cost of that subscription to $14.99.

It raised a billion dollars in convertible debt last year and is making large payments with interest. The company is expected to go public in 2018, according to TechCrunch 's sources. Until then, giants like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Google ( GOOG ), which also have music streaming services, might well catch up or even take Spotify's number one position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T06:56:17.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
