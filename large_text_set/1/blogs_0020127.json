Workers at Rivercrest Care Centre will have benefits for first time in Alberta. \nBut after learning more about domestic violence, the company decided it was the right thing to do for the employees, who are mainly women. \nHalliday said the benefits outweigh the cost, even in Alberta's tough economy. \n\"We thought it was a reasonable thing to do,\" Halliday said. \"It is for the well-being of our staff.\" \nThe union hopes that provincial governments will take action to ensure that all people can take time off to get the help they need, he said. \nLast year, Manitoba passed a law that allows workers who have been with the same employer for at least 90 days to take leave to seek medical attention for themselves or their children, to contact police or a lawyer or to move to a safe place. \nThe Alberta Federation of Labour has been urging Alberta's NDP government to follow Manitoba's example.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T07:03:05.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
