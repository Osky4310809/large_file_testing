Plus there's always the option of combining several of the fancies into your own multiple if you're chasing a bigger return from a smaller stake. \nThe Opta spotlight has been turned on the FA Cup quarter finals, including Monday's blockbuster clash between Chelsea and Manchester United, so if you're struggling to find a bet on those games then why not see what the stats have to say. \nThere are another three selections in Anytime Angles too, the column where the team identify in-form players around the world who are in fantastic scoring touch but still backable at tasty prices. Edition 25's trio are all priced at 13/8 (2.63) or bigger so should they find the net, then they promise plenty of profit at the advised odds. \nThe guide is published every Friday and is free to all Soccerway members.
