This volatile group of songwriters is all about shenanigans on their new Feed Me Poison EP, a four-song odyssey into a world of weirdo guitar riffs, off-kilter piano arrangements, and random bursts of horns. Songs like “C’est La Vie” are so infectiously poppy that they almost come across as unserious, but it takes a peculiar kind of dedication to pull off a band of this magnitude. \nThe songs on the Feed Me Poison EP came about while OhBree were cranking out demos for a new LP at Sleepless Sound Studio in Philly. According to vocalist/piano player Andrew Scott, “these four songs stood out as an awesome representation of our personality. I love to write songs about weird made up characters, and the dry sarcasm of every member in the band made for a humorous record.” \nAs with lots of bands that specialize in goofball pop — Ween especially comes to mind — not everything is hunky dory below the surface. “We’re always letting our darker and more anxious sounds bust through the seams of our goofy-suit,” explains Scott, neglecting to describe what a goofy-suit might look like. \nFeed Me Poison drops on March 11th, but you can stream the whole EP below. \nFeed Me Poison EP Artwork: Credit: Kate Otte", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T03:20:05.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
