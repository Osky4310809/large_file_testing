And it was as magical and wondrous as you might expect. \n\"Stephen, I met the queen,\" Cox said when the host showed a picture of the two from Cox's Instagram . \"I met the queen!\" \nThe actress explained that she cried before and after meeting Bey, but she managed to keep it together for their actual interaction. And not only that, when Cox caught her eye across the floor of the Staples Center, a pregnant Beyoncé actually got up out of her chair to come greet her. \n\"She got up for me!\" Cox said, getting emotional all over again to Colbert. A post shared by laverne cox (@lavernecox) on Feb 12, 2017 at 10:14pm PST \nCox also talked about her other big moment at the Grammys in the interview, when she told the audience to google Gavin Grimm while presenting an award. Cox explained that Grimm is going to the Supreme Court on March 28 for a case involving trans rights. \n“Anti-trans bathroom bills are not really about bathrooms,\" Cox said while talking about Grimm's case. \"They’re about whether or not trans people have the right to exist in public space. Because if we can’t use public bathrooms, we can’t go to schools. We can’t work. We can’t go to health care facilities. So it’s really about us having a right to exist in public space, and I exist and I have a right to exist in public space.” \nWatch Cox's full interview below.
