He is not a threat and not likely to jump bail given his standing. He has also being a lawyer since 1985,” he said. \nSulieman’s lawyer Chief Bolaji Ayorinde (SAN) also prayed the court to grant the former minister bail on self-recognition. \n“He is a renowned educationist, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Abuja. \n“He has served this country as a minister in 2014. He has been involved in teaching and research for the past 30 years. He has graduated more than 10,000 students. \n“He voluntarily submitted himself to EFCC and never contravened the terms of his administrative bail. \n“I urge your lordship to grant him bail on self-recognition,” he said. \nEFCC’s lawyer Rotimi Oyedepo did not oppose the bail applications. \nHe said: “We leave bail at your lordship’s discretion and pray that your lordship should impose conditions that will compel their attendance in court for trial,” he said. \nRuling, Justice Aikawa granted the defendants bail on self-recognition. \nHe said since the prosecution did not oppose the application, and considering the defendants’ standing in the society, “they will not likely jump bail.” \n“However, their international passports must be deposited with the Deputy Chief Registrar of this court and can only be released on court order,” the judge said. \nHe adjourned till February 23 for trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:34:43.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
