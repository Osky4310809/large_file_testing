However, the talks collapsed after the last round in 2008, with the DPRK declaring the deal void after refusing inspections to verify compliance, which led to a series of new sanctions on Pyongyang, as well as international condemnation. \nChina is willing to make joint efforts with all related sides to play a constructive role in handling the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue and maintaining the stability of the region, Geng said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:49:53.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
