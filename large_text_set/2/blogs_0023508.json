We can confirm that the Mosul airport militarily has fallen and it’s a matter of short time to fully control it,” Numan said. \nAfter ousting the militant group from eastern Mosul last month, Iraqi forces have sought to capture the airport and use it a launchpad for an onslaught into the west of Iraq’s second-largest city. \nThe airport and military complex, which includes barracks and training grounds and sprawls across an area close to the Baghdad-Mosul highway was captured by Islamic State fighters when they overran Mosul in June 2014. \nThe loss of Mosul could spell the end of the Iraqi side of ISIS’s self-styled caliphate, which it declared from the city after sweeping through vast areas of Iraq and Syria. \nThe campaign involves a 100,000-strong force of Iraqi troops, Kurdish fighters and Shi’ite militias. \nForces have made rapid advances since the start of the year, aided by new tactics and improved coordination, military officials say. none", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:42:03.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
