Since the failure of the bill, only 64 percent of Republicans have a positive view of Ryan, while McConnell only received 40 percent approval.   Trump Welcomes Schumer To Bipartisan White House Reception \nFor the first time in his presidency, more voters now disapprove of Trump’s job performance than approve, at 50 percent. \nWithin that statistic, the disparity gap between those who support and those who disapprove of the president is widening. The poll found that 38 percent of voters strongly disapprove of Trump, compared to only 23 percent who strongly approve. \nTrump campaigned on promises to ax former President Barack Obama’s crown jewel, the Affordable Care Act. Now that he has said he will “ let things be on healthcare ,” his GOP supporters have expressed their discontent.   \nEarlier polls found that nearly 90 percent of GOP voters supported Trump’s work thus far, but this most recent poll shows a steep decline, with only 81 percent of voters saying the same this time. The support from Americans who voted for Trump dropped from 92 percent to 84 percent. \nWhile many in the GOP may feel that the healthcare failure is a sign that Trump will not fulfill his promises, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh reminded Republicans how much Trump has done already. \n“I’m here to tell you that Trump has pulled off an amazing number of achievements already,” Limbaugh said. “Getting his cabinet confirmed and some of the things that they’re doing. The jobs that have been created, the factories that have not moved; there’s any number of things here that he said he was gonna do that have been done.” \nGiven that the poll is weekly, Trump could bounce back with strong performances in other areas. However, his push of the healthcare bill has soured many conservatives. “Conservatives across the land do not like Paul Ryan’s proposal because it is ObamaCare lite,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on The O’Reilly Factor . “We don’t like it.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:05:50.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
