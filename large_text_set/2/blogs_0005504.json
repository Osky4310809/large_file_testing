He did relax . !!!! Here's OBAMA and Richard Branson kite surfing and chilling on Branson's private island https://t.co/kwtnNKSm7G … pic.twitter.com/3CWBMW9h1Q \n— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 7, 2017 \nOn the last day of his vacation in the Caribbean islands, the duo battled in the ocean to see who could stay on their kite-board the longest, and the footage is priceless. \nDuring the video, Obama and Branson can be seen gearing up for the waves. After Branson gives the thumbs up, they hit the water and the contest begins. YouTube \nThe first few clips show the former POTUS and the founder of Virgin Group wiping out in the water before getting the hang of the sport. \nNot before long, Branson proves his kite-surfing skills and stays atop his board for an impressive 50 meters. \nObama was confident he could do better than that, though. Giphy \nIn fact, Barack showed Branson what he was made of and stayed on his board for an impressive 100 meters. \nOf course, this made him the winner of the competition — and mostly likely the subject of a ton of upcoming memes. \nI mean, what’s better than badass Barack riding the waves in the Caribbean? \nNOTHING. NOTHING IS. \n— Alice Rose (@alice_isbell) February 7, 2017 \nOK, OK… in reality, Branson gave Barack a break because he was the one who taught the former pres’ how to kite-surf in the first place. \nBranson’s a pro at the sport and said he felt honored to teach Barack how to ride the waves during their trip to his islands. \nAccording to DailyMail.com, Branson learned how to kite-surf with a foil board in preparation for the contest while Barack competed with a normal one. \nBranson said, \nAs you can see in the video, Barack and I both fell many times, but we kept trying again and again and made progress over the days. We were neck and neck until the last run on the last day, when I got up on the foilboard and screamed along for over 50 meters, three feet above the water.

I had to doff my cap to him and celebrate his victory. After all he has done for the world, I couldn’t begrudge him his well-deserved win. \nBranson said he’s going to practice in preparation for the Obamas’ next trip to the Virgin Islands because the duo plans on doing a long kite over Anegada. \nIn the meantime, Barack and his wife are back in Washington DC with the family. I’m sure he’s celebrating his well-deserved kite-surfing victory and gearing up for the next.
