He said authorities believe the bus was stopped on the tracks at the time of the crash, but they don't yet know why. \nBiloxi city spokesman Vincent Creel said emergency responders were still removing injured people from the bus more than 30 minutes after the crash, pulling many through windows. \nWitnesses told WLOX-TV that passengers were senior citizens. Charter buses often carry patrons to one of Biloxi's eight casinos, but Creel said he wasn't sure where the bus was headed. \n\"I want you to know we're doing everything we can to get everyone off this bus,\" Miller said. \nThe CSX train, pulled by three locomotives, was headed eastbound when it hit the bus at a crossing in downtown Biloxi just before 2:15 p.m., pushing the bus about 300 feet down the tracks, Creel said. The single track is the CSX mainline along the Gulf Coast, passing through densely populated areas of southern Mississippi. \nA nearby hospital set up a triage unit at the site to treat the injured, and helicopters were carrying the injured to hospitals that handle trauma cases. \nThe bus was marked as belonging to Echo Transportation, which Texas corporate records show is a unit of a company called TBL Group, based in Grand Prairie, near Dallas . A phone message and an email left for Echo were not immediately returned. \n\"[O]ur thoughts are with all involved,\" Gary Sease, a spokesman for CSX, said in a statement to CNBC. \"The train crew was not injured. CSX is cooperating fully with investigators.\" \n— ﻿CNBC.com contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:53:15.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
