And in an interview that was published over the weekend , Trump noted that NATO was “obsolete,” that he would reconsider sanctions against Russia and would start off treating Putin and Germany’s Angela Merkel on equal ground. \nWell, back in 2014, shortly after Russia invaded Crimea, Trump was singing a different tune about Russia. In a series of interviews in March of that year discovered by CNN’s KFILE, Trump said Mitt Romney was right in 2012 when he said Russia was America’s greatest geopolitical foe and stated that the US should realize that Russia is a great problem and deserves sanctions. \nIn an early March appearance on Fox & Friends , He explained that Romney “was so right” and that “Syria was propped up by Russia.” Trump added that “there are a lot of things we could be doing economically to Russia,” referring to sanctions. \nA couple of weeks later in an NBC interview, Trump said we “should definitely be doing sanctions” and that “Putin has eaten Obama’s lunch.” He also expressed concern over possible military intervention, saying he hoped the president didn’t “do something very foolish and very stupid to show his manhood.” \nAnd towards the end of the month, during another Fox & Friends appearance, he once again praised Romney for his foresight, saying he was right for stating that “Russia’s our biggest problem.” He went on to claim that Russia was involved with Iran and Syria and “virtually every other place.” \nWatch the clip above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:57:11.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
