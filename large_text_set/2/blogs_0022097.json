Jose Mourinho spoke to the media on Friday ahead of the trip to Wembley and confirmed his Armenian ace would not be available to feature in the final: Manchester United @ManUtd The manager says Mkhitaryan will miss the #EFLCup final but Carrick is available. On Jones: \"Let's see and decide tomorrow.\" #MUFC https://t.co/EvtGtWnK0B 2/24/2017, 2:00:03 PM Mkhitaryan was substituted after 25 minutes on Wednesday with what looked to be a hamstring injury, and manager Jose Mourinho had expressed doubt that he would be available for the Wembley Stadium showpiece after the match in France, per Samuel Luckhurst of the Manchester Evening News . The Armenian has been in electric form in recent months, producing six goals and five assists in his last 16 matches for United. His absence will be a significant loss for the Red Devils as they seek to win their first major piece of silverware under Mourinho, because of the pace, creativity and flair he brings in the final third. In his stead, the likes of Juan Mata , Anthony Martial and perhaps even Wayne Rooney will need to up their games.
