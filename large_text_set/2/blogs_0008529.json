Coreau deflected Jared Spurgeon’s slap shot behind the net, but Eric Staal knocked it in front of the net and Parise whacked it out of the air for his 13th of the season. \nMinnesota struck first on Mikael Granlund’s power-play goal with 6:59 remaining in the first period. Mikko Koivu fired a shot from the right faceoff circle that skidded through traffic. Granlund’s tip attempt trickled off the left post, but he got a second chance and poked it in with a two-handed lunge for his 16th goal of the season. \nNino Niederreiter pushed the lead to 2-0 less than 3 minutes later with his team-leading 19th goal, also on the power play. Koivu fed the puck across the front of the crease and Niederreiter buried it into an open net. \nDetroit cut the lead to 2-1 at 6:56 of the second period as Anthony Mantha took advantage of a missed defensive assignment to score his 13th of the season. At the end of a long shift for the Wild, Xavier Ouellet found a wide-open Mantha in front of the net, and he tucked the puck between Dubnyk’s pads. \nCharlie Coyle restored Minnesota’s two-goal lead with a breakaway goal at 14:14 of the second. Jason Pominville flung an outlet pass that Coyle corralled as he danced around defenseman Nick Jensen. Coyle then deked twice and fired a wrist shot over Coreau’s left shoulder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:39:51.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
