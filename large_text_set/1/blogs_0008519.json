The Weeknd was previously dating model Bella Hadid up until November 2016 when the pair reportedly broke up due to being too damn busy. You know, the usual excuse when famous people split.\nWhat’s also awkward is Selena is friends with Bella, or maybe was. The two kicked it backstage at the Apple Music Festival in 2015 that, coincidentally, The Weeknd was headlining. Thus making that “Your replacement is closer than you think” meme once again relevant.\nSelena with Bella Hadid & friends at the Apple Music Festival tonight – September 22nd, 2015! #GomezUpdate pic.twitter.com/rBw5D7axBT \n— Selena Gomez News (@MyLifeIsSelG) September 22, 2015 \n\nHowever, despite the “these friends ain’t loyal” aspect to this budding new romance, both fans of Abel and Selena are freaking the hell out. Please note these are teenagers and this is the kind of sh*t they live for it. So just let them have this piece of joy before you know what happens in nine days and everything just turns into oran…darkness.\n\nOHMYGOD SELENA AND ABEL ARE DATING? I AM HERE FOR IT.
