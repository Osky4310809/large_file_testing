Starbucks seems to think so. That’s because Starbucks will be introducing vegan overnight grains to 600 of their New York locations starting today, with the potential for the protein-packed dish to become a staple at locations across the country . Since Starbucks’ “protein bistro box” is currently the chains best-selling lunch option, it makes sense that they’d decide to pursue other healthy, protein-rich alternatives to add to their menu. \nAnd since the overnight grains are made with steel oats, quinoa, and chia seeds soaked in coconut milk and topped with shaved coconut and sliced almonds, this vegan option is both healthy and delectable. Twinkling lights still on the tree, ginger-nutmeg-cinnamon-clove-&-tangerine spice still in the cup. ❤️ #HolidaySpiceFlatWhite \nA post shared by Starbucks Coffee ☕ (@starbucks) on Dec 28, 2016 at 8:21am PST \nThis may be the coffee giant’s healthiest option ever, and we’re so happy that it’s vegan friendly. And with six grams of protein you can feel good about splurging on your morning coffee and breakfast. Although Starbucks already has oatmeal, we’re excited that we can decide between the classic oats and these overnight grains.\nA post shared by Starbucks Coffee ☕ (@starbucks) on Apr 22, 2016 at 10:10am PDT \nSince Starbuck just announced that they’ll be hiring 10,000 refuges over the next five years, you really have no excuse to not spend your money on this delicious vegan breakfast. We just hope that the grains are successful enough to be introduced to menus everywhere. A girls gotta have her grains, after all.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:09:43.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
