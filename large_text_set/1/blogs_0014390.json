The talented triple threat (she models, sings, and acts, we loved her in Mad Max !) took to Instagram to show off her new hairstyle . The Stylist Daniel Moon Ramirez, who is a mastermind of color, is responsible for the star’s platinum locks as well as her new powder blue heart. This dynamic duo is extremely creative, and we can tell the love is genuine.\nDon’t let the soft style fool you, though, Zoë Kravitz is one tough woman , who has taken on Hollywood, politics, and cultural injustices . She gives us heart eyes for all the right reasons.\nI u @majormoonn \nA photo posted by Zoë Kravitz (@zoeisabellakravitz) on Jan 16, 2017 at 9:59am PST \nThe best thing about undercuts? They’re totally hidden if you want to glam it up on the red carpet! We’re loving her look at Elle’ s launch party for the Women in TV issue, featuring our girl Zoë!\nJonathan Leibson / Getty Images The cover girl of Elle Magazine ‘s February 2017 Wome in TV issue posed with her long flowing blonde braids.\n\"There has to be something positive that can come out of [the election]. Already it's helped me want to connect with everybody. When I go to the deli or I'm talking to a waiter or my Uber driver and they say, \"How are you?,\" I've answered in an honest way for the first time. Like, \"Oof.\" Even that felt good. Let's let everything come to the surface, even with people we come in contact with for a moment. This situation can help us be a little bit more awake with each other.\" —Zoë Kravitz.
