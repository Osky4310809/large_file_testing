The pop-up lets users know when a story’s accuracy is questionable before they share it. \nUsers in regions including the US have reported seeing the warning, advising them that “before you share this content, you might want to know that the fact-checking sites, Snopes.com and Associated Press disputed its accuracy.” \nThe alert then allows the user to share the story or cancel.
