From there, investigators bet that he would again head to Ecuador, where he had previously been deported four times after serving stints in state prison in 1994, 2001, 2005 and 2008. \nHis photo was widely circulated in his native country, and he was finally spotted and captured early Thursday by local police and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials, police said. \nIn addition to the Loomis gold flake heist, Nivelo, who specialized in targeting unattended delivery trucks, was suspected in a recent spree that dates back to last May on the Upper East Side, where he made off with a variety of electronic equipment and Jimmy Choo shoes .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:43:44.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
