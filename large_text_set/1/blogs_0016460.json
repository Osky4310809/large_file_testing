Banton II \nFamily photo of Dr. William C. Banton II. Dr. William C. Banton was a trailblazer in St. Louis public health \nFamily photo of Dr. William C. Banton II \nFamily photo of Dr. William C. Banton II. \nDr. William C. Banton II’s decades of work in public health did not pay much. \nBut his wife said he was not motivated by money and that private practice was not always as satisfying as his passion for the prevention of disease. “He could picture a healthier community, which would lead to better lives for everybody,” said Dr. Milagros Roman Banton, his wife of more than 59 years. \nWilliam Banton, a longtime doctor and public health official, died of heart failure on Dec. 31, 2016, at his Town and Country home. He was 94. \nHe was buried Jan. 6 at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery with full military honors. \nDr. Banton was a pioneer in the community, claiming a series of firsts for African-Americans in health and military positions. \n“He was busy trailblazing — opening doors for minorities,” his wife said. \nRelatives said he was beloved by his patients and consistently optimistic. \nDr. Banton was born in Washington, D.C. He attended Dunbar High School and Howard University. \nIn a 1986 Post-Dispatch profile, Dr. Banton described a clash between the desire of his parents, Amy and Clarence Banton, that he become a doctor and his joining of the Christian Science Church, which trusts in faith for healing. He said he chose medicine after his prayers failed to prevent his mother’s death from injuries in an accident in 1941. \nAfter earning a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts and science, he entered the Howard University College of Medicine in 1943 as a member of the Army Specialized Training Program . He earned his degree in 1946. \nHe interned at Homer G. Phillips Hospital in St. Louis and then completed a residency at Robert Koch Hospital in St. Louis County. \nHis wife said that he had a private practice and was also a staff physician with the St. Louis Division of Health for 16 years. He later directed the city’s tuberculosis program and established its first mobile screening unit. \nWhen the Korean War started, Dr. Banton volunteered and was commissioned as a captain with the Medical Corps of the U.S. Air Force. He was on active duty from 1950 to 1952, and spent decades more in the reserves. \nThe Bantons met when she was a resident at Homer G. Philips and he was a consultant or attending physician, Milagros Banton recalled. Dr. Banton was “very, very friendly, with a charming smile.” \nIn 1970, Dr. Banton received his master’s degree in public health from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. His wife said he had been offered a job as health commissioner of St. Louis. “He wanted to be a good chief, so he’s going back to school,” she said. \nAfter his graduation, he was appointed as the first African-American to be commissioner. \nHe then designed St. Louis County’s Department of Community Health and Medical Care, becoming its first director in 1973. \nIn 1973, he also became the first African-American promoted to brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve. \nDr. Banton resigned the community health position in 1979. \nThat same year, after protests over the racial makeup of the Veiled Prophet organization, Dr. Banton became one of its first three African-American members. \nHe also served on the board of trustees of John Burroughs School. \nHe pushed for a state law that would create the Missouri Department of Health and would later serve as a medical consultant to the agency. \nIn 1987, he was elected president of the St. Louis Metropolitan Medical Society, the first time in 150 years an African-American held that position. \nAt the time, Dr. Thomas J. Cooper, a former medical society president, affirmed his confidence in Dr. Banton to handle the challenges of medical leadership. \n“One man can do only so much, and our president-elect knows that he’ll need the help of many like-minded individuals,” Cooper said. “But if there’s anyone who can organize our many-factioned medical society to rally behind badly needed public health reforms, well, I’d put my money on Bill Banton.” \nIn 1988, Dr. Banton was appointed to a national task force to combat tuberculosis. He also headed the Missouri Advisory Committee to Eradicate Tuberculosis. \nHe served on St. Louis’ Task Force on Infant Mortality and was a board member of the St. Louis Regional Medical Center, was a faculty member of the St. Louis University School of Medicine and did private philanthropic work. \nIn addition to his wife, survivors include their two children, Dr. Michael R. Banton of Ballwin and Michelle R.B. Saddler, of Evanston, Ill.; four children with his first wife, the late Ruth Chandler: William C. Banton III and Barbara C. Ndosi, both of the Minneapolis area, Stephen C. Banton of Wildwood, and Richard C. Banton of St. Louis; 10 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. \nRobert Patrick • 314-621-5154", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T08:08:24.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
