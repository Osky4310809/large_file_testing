Wisconsin, ranked seventh in the polls only two weeks ago, has dropped five straight to unranked teams. Very un-Wisconsin-like. \nEntering Thursday’s game, Iowa was 2-17 against ranked Wisconsin teams. \nThanks to Jason Bohannon, Iowa still has distant dreams of making the NCAA Tournament . His 3-pointer on a broken play following a botched rebound attempt by the Badgers gave Iowa the lead with less than 10 seconds remaining. Bronson Koenig took a long 2-pointer that fell short, Iowa grabbed the carom, and the game was over just like that. The Hawkeyes outscored Wisconsin 7-0 down the stretch. \nIt was brutal for Greg Gard’s team. Former UW coach Bo Ryan must have been chewing on his shirt watching the final few sequences. Here’s Bohannon’s winner.

It was a weird and frustrating game for a Wisconsin team that was thought to be the best in the Big Ten as recently as two weeks ago. \nNow Wisconsin finishes its regular-season slate with a home game against a Minnesota team that not only projects better in the bracket , but also hasn’t lost since January. What has happened in Madison? \nTo think, this could be even worse. Maybe we should have all seen this coming when Wisconsin needed some minor miracles to make it past Rutgers in late January. Three of the Badgers’ wins this season have required overtime. From 21-3 to 22-8, Wisconsin is skidding and the Big Ten is taking an image hit. \nOr is it? \nThere’s a quagmire that’s growing here, because the Big Ten lacks an elite team, but at the same time it could unthinkably pop eight of its 14 member schools into this year’s tournament field. So is this a good year for the Big Ten? Seems an impossible question to answer. \nThe story of Northwestern’s push to make the NCAA tourney is the best thing to come out of the league this season, but aside from that and the Caleb Swanigan campaign for National Player of the Year, there’s not a whole lot to sell here nationally. Minnesota has had a nice turnaround, but if your league is being defined in good portion by Minnesota and Northwestern , you’re having a down year. Michigan State just lost to Illinois . \nMaryland , once 20-2, has lost four of its last seven. \nA month ago, Wisconsin had Ethan Happ right on Swanigan’s heels for league player of the year. On Thursday, Happ’s unreliability at the foul line was a contributing factor to UW losing the game. \nIowa now has hope of making the tournament, thanks to its bevy of top-50 wins. Michigan is fairly anonymous but well in the field at this point. \nIf you’re trying to predict an outcome in the Big Ten tournament, good luck. But I have to say, this is fun, right? The conference having this gooey center of unpredictability is going to almost certainly give us an entertaining crapshoot in Washington next week. As for seeding and selection, there’s still so much to sort out here. We love March because of the tournament, but I also love it for the way teams get shifted and flipped in the final 10 days prior. \nThe Big Ten is a kaleidoscope of capriciousness. It’s going to have a litany of teams between the 7 and 12 lines and maybe almost nobody better than a 5. It doesn’t make for a great year for the league, but it does create a memorable one. If eight from this union do find their way into the bracket, that well set a conference record.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T12:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T08:58:14.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
