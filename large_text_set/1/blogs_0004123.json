Mauricio Pochettino’s men saw off a truly terrible Watford side with verve and swagger, running out 4-1 winners at Vicarage Road as they briefly leapfrogged Arsenal into third place in the Premier League table. \nArsenal's comeback is too little, too late \nHarry Kane and Dele Alli both scored twice, with Younes Kaboul’s late goal – borne out of both lackadaisical defending and a feeling the game was already over – the only blot on an otherwise pristine copybook. \nThe victory was sweet, and Pochettino was effusive in his praise of his side afterwards, but one must travel back to 2015 to find the defining result on January 1 for Spurs fans. \nChelsea, under the still-stable management of Jose Mourinho, were the visitors to White Hart Lane and knew that a win would see them extend their lead at the top of the table to three points. After 18 minutes a Diego Costa goal appeared to have set the champions-elect on their way to another victory, but Spurs hit back, equalising through a long-range Kane goal before a Danny Rose strike and Andros Townsend penalty gave Spurs a 3-1 lead at half-time. \nA sublime Kane finish then made it four, though nerves were set jangling by Eden Hazard’s 61st-minute strike. As Nacer Chadli made it five, the noise inside the Lane ratcheted up with each successful pass, and John Terry’s late goal was nothing more than a consolation. Pochettino had shown up Mourinho, and Spurs had dismantled Chelsea. \nThe result, however, is perhaps the exception to the rule. In 21 games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool and Manchester United since the 5-3 victory, Spurs have won just five – beating Arsenal 2-1 at home, City three times, and United once. This chronic inability to triumph in these must-win games has continually hampered Spurs, and ultimately cost the club the title last season. \nWhen presented with the chance to move top of the Premier League with a victory over West Ham in January of last year, Spurs turned in their worst performance of the campaign at that point and lost. \nWinning streak just the start for Chelsea \nTowards the back-end of last season, Pochettino’s men completely folded, failing to win any of their final four games of the season – as they drew 1-1 with West Brom, 2-2 with Chelsea after taking a 2-0 lead, lost 2-1 to Southampton and, humiliatingly, 5-1 to Newcastle. After pushing Leicester City all the way, Spurs finished third in a two-horse race, behind the Gunners. \nNow, then, is the time to start winning these big games. Chelsea will be the visitors again on Wednesday, and Spurs cannot afford to lose if they wish to stay in the title race. Victory over Watford left Spurs 10 points behind the Blues, and if Antonio Conte’s side win in north London then it will be safe to rule Tottenham out of the title picture altogether. \nPochettino has spoken of his desire to win the title at White Hart Lane and his squad has the makings of one that can challenge for major honours on a continued basis. The core is young and talented, and the presence of such seasoned campaigners as Hugo Lloris and Toby Alderweireld adds a steely presence in defence. A run of four consecutive Premier League wins has heightened hopes around the club but victory over Chelsea is now a must - both for the team and for the fans. \nThe Blues hammered the final nail into Tottenham’s Premier League coffin last season as Jamie Vardy and his Leicester team-mates had their party, and revenge cannot be ruled out as a motive. \nAntonio Conte has transformed the Blues in his own image, and they have won each of their last 10 games – including a 2-1 victory over Spurs at Stamford Bridge. \n'Ronaldo has better abs, but Messi is the best!' \nThere is an air of invincibility around them, but Spurs have routinely upended expectations – both for better and worse – in recent seasons under Pochettino, and one must not discount the impact that a home win would have. \nThis, however, is reliant on the jinx being broken; a victory over Chelsea cannot be the exception, the outstanding result in an otherwise mediocre season of results against the top sides. \nIf Tottenham are serious about challenging for the title, and about winning trophies in general, then they must start beating their rivals on a regular basis. It is all very well turning over an abysmal Watford side, but it will mean very little if Chelsea again spoil Spurs’ party.
