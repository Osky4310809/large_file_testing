Full Game Coverage \nCishek, sidelined since microfracture hip surgery in October, will throw his first bullpen session Thursday in another key step, though he's at least several weeks behind Zych. And Simmons, sidelined since March 11 with a sore forearm, played catch for the second straight day Wednesday as he moves toward his own mound return. \nIt's unlikely any of the three will be ready by Opening Day on April 3, but all are progressing and could be ready to help out in the early part of the season. \nZych, rated as the Mariners' No. 14 prospect by MLB Pipeline, said Thursday's outing will be important for him as he's missed most of the past year with his biceps problem. \n\"All the steps have been big, but this is probably going to be the real tell-all to see how it goes,\" said the 26-year-old. \"Hopefully I get a few under my belt and just get comfortable. I'm ready to compete. I'm ready to see what's in there and see where I'm at for real.\" \nCishek won't be game ready for several more weeks at the earliest, but said he'll throw all fastballs off a mound Thursday and \"get a feel for pitching off the slope again.\" Simmons is removed due to injury Mariners' Simmons removed due to forearm strain Shae Simmons is removed from the game due to a right forearm strain after giving up one run on two hits in one-third innings pitched \nAnd after being shut down for 10 days, Simmons -- who was acquired by trade from the Braves in January -- took encouragement from finally being allowed to play catch on back-to-back days Tuesday and Wednesday. \n\"Everything felt good and we'll just keep going,\" said Simmons. \"It'll be day to day until we know for sure it's all good. I'll do whatever throwing program they see fit.\" \nSimmons missed all of 2015 and part of '16 following Tommy John elbow surgery, but again said his current issue is unrelated and minor by comparison. \n\"Having gone through surgery and all that rehab process and just wanting to play and get back out there, it was a little discouraging,\" he said. \"But luckily it wasn't anything serious and everything should be fine.\" has covered the Mariners since 1997, and for MLB.com since 2011.
