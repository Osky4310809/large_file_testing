Paige tweeted at the time that the media was “stolen” and shared without her consent, and on Tuesday she wrote a lengthy note reflecting on the incident on Twitter. \nPaige writes that she and her soon-to-be husband (former WWE star Alberto Del Rio) hope to use the situation to spread awareness for other men and women who fall victim to leaks, and revealed that she contemplated harming herself. \n— PAIGE (@RealPaigeWWE) March 28, 2017 “I put trust in the hands of someone that took advantage of a young girl years ago. It was my mistake and I’ll always take responsibility. But the one thing that was the hardest was thinking ‘my husband is gonna leave me,’ ‘my family will disown me,’ but I’m blessed beyond words to have a family and a husband that stuck by me because they know who I am. They know I’m not a bad person and they held my hands through hell.” “I had days where I wanted to physically harm myself. No only for what millions was telling me but because my family and husband were suffering the same fate from the internet because of my mistake. It made me and Alberto wonder how people who aren’t as mentally strong as us can handle this? How many people have to suffer because of the internet and the cowards behind the keyboard.” “No one will make me feel bad about my mistakes, I already know what they are and I already feel bad. But Alberto and I together can also make a change. My mistake could help people’s future. Think. Before you act. Anyways. Onwards and upwards. Only happiness. No longer talking about anything. Just looking into the future and being happy! I mean come on, I’m getting married? How can I not be happy!!!!” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:32:31.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
