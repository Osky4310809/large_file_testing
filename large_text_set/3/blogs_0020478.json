Each has been selected by electoral colleges, known as election or selection committees, which have increased in size: from 400 in 1996, to 800 in 2007 and then 1,200 in 2012, when just 689 of them plumped for Leung Chun-ying, the current chief executive. These groups are meant to be “broadly representative” of Hong Kong society and include representatives from business and finance; professionals; labour, social services and civil society; and politicians. (Had the proposed semblance of universal suffrage been put in place, some very similar committee would have been convened to screen the candidates.) Earlier in March they nominated three candidates to go through to a final vote. One is a retired judge and two are former members of the current administration. Preparations for the vote have the characteristics of a real election. Woo Kwok-hing, the judge (pictured, right), Carrie Lam (centre), the former chief secretary, and John Tsang (left), the former finance minister, are standing against one another. Each has a manifesto, campaign team and giant billboards. The three candidates take part in debates and newspapers conduct polls to identify whom the public prefers. But China’s central government, which gets the final say, will not let the contest be guided by mere popularity. Mr Tsang is better liked by Hong Kong people but lacks the support of the party. Envoys from the central government in Beijing have reportedly been asking members of the election committee to vote for Mrs Lam. If Beijing were unhappy with the result, it could in principle refuse to appoint the winner. But it is unlikely to come to that, as the election committee has already been carefully weighted in favour of pro-establishment figures, who are expected to vote in line with the party’s wishes. So Mrs Lam can expect to win at least the 601 votes she needs to prevail. Earning a mandate to govern might require something more; any evidence of meddling from Beijing can undermine a chief executive, as Mrs Lam herself has admitted.
