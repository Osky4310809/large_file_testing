Morgan, and Singaporean banks and financial institutions DBS, OCBC, UOB, and the Singapore Exchange.\nSee: Here’s how Singapore’s central bank is bringing fintech to the real world \nThe central bank says it achieved its three goals for this project: create a digital representation of the Singapore dollar for inter-bank settlement, test methods of connecting bank systems to a distributed ledger, and get the MAS Electronic Payment System, known as MEPS+, to work with the DLT for automated collateral management.\nNext, MAS wants to try to improve investment trading and settlement periods with the help of DLT. It also wants to take payments using digital currency cross-border. It’s currently talking to other countries to enable digital currency payments to be settled through central bank accounts.\nMAS has been thoroughly exploring financial technology applications to make sure the Lion City can be a world-class fintech hub.\nIn fact, the IFZ FinTech Study 2017 study (PDF link) by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts found that Singapore ranks first in the world in terms of the right conditions (political/legal, economic, social, and technological) for fintech to grow.\nThis post Singapore’s central bank is ready to use the blockchain for inter-bank payments appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T12:29:42.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
