Jose Mourinho admits his Man United players were physically spent and were fortunate to not go to extra time with Rostov. Jose Mourinho has praised how his side have dealt with a difficult week ahead of their second leg versus Rostov. Jose Mourinho hits out at pundits and former players alike in a passionate defence of Paul Pobga and his earnings. Dan Thomas and Alejandro Moreno dissect the meaning behind Jose Mourinho's comments on Paul Pogba after their FA Cup loss. Jose Mourinho insists Chelsea only have themselves to blame for not being in European competition this season. \nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho is rarely short of things to complain about. \nThe latest issue he has an axe to grind over is his team's fixture pile-up between now and the end of the season. \nThursday's victory over Rostov was their 47th match of the campaign thus far , including the Community Shield. Mourinho has already led his side to victory in the EFL Cup final -- which caused their game at Manchester City to be postponed -- and they are now in the quarterfinals of the Europa League. \nUnited were knocked out of the FA Cup at Chelsea on Monday after four games in that competition, but that tie necessitated the postponement of their trip to Southampton which, like the Manchester derby, is yet to be rescheduled. Those games are likely to be played on or around April 26 and May 17, but no dates have yet been announced. \nWhile Monday's defeat at Chelsea knocked them out of the FA Cup after four games in that competition, United still have 14 matches to play between now and the end of the season. That number would rise to 17 games if they reach the Europa League final in Stockholm on May 24, meaning the April 1 game against West Brom after the international break would kick off a run of 16 games in 54 days -- or, in other words, playing once every 3.38 days. \nThe Premier League has already said it will not extend the season to open up more time for all those matches to be fit into the schedule, meaning the trips to City and Southampton must both be played before United host Crystal Palace on May 21, the final day of the 2016-17 Premier League. \nHere are United's potential fixtures and games yet to be rescheduled between now and the end of the season: DATE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T17:55:14.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
