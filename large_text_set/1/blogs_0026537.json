If you go looking to achieve an orgasm while standing on your head ( now THAT would be a crazy sex story ), someone is bound to get hurt, and, in some cases, break a bone. But while sex-related injuries are nothing new, what scientists have discovered is that there really is a “most dangerous sex position” of all. Care to hazard a guess?\nIt’s the cowgirl position.\nAccording to a new study , women on top are to blame for 50 percent of the penile fractures out there. If you don’t know what a penile fracture is, then consider yourself lucky that you’ve never experienced it first hand.\nA penile fracture is when the penis actually snaps, making for a very audible “cracking” sound, before intense pain and swelling sets in. Tragically, because a lot of men might be embarrassed about the situation, not enough of these penile fractures (and the men attached to them) get to the doctor as soon as they should.\nAccording to the study published in Advances in Urology, some men will wait up to six hours in excruciating pain before seeking medical attention. In waiting too long, men can run the risk of permanent discoloration and deformity of the penis, and, in extreme cases, worse— and you know what the “worse” is that I’m talking about.\nThe study found that the reason for so many penile injuries during cowgirl is because of the weight of the woman when she lands on the penis. As the research explained, “Our hypothesis is that when woman is on top she usually controls the movement with her entire body weight landing on the erect penis, not being able to interrupt it when the penis suffers a wrong way penetration, because the harm is usually minor in woman with no pain but major in the penis.”\nBut cowgirl isn’t the only position that is breaking penises left and right. The study also found that doggy-style is responsible for 29 percent of penile fractures. In that case, men only have themselves and their erratic thrusting to blame. Ease up, guys! If you’re doing it right, she’s not going to go anywhere! Geez…\nWhat this study means to all of us sexually active people in the world is that despite being boneless, penises can break. They’re not as sturdy as we like to believe, and are just as susceptible to cracking, literally, under pressure, again, literally.\nIf you’re having sex and things are feeling sore at all, you need to stop—no matter how close you are to climaxing. One orgasm isn’t worth a lifetime of no more orgasms. Are you picking up what I’m putting down here? \nFind more must-read sex and dating tips!\nFollow Her Catalog on Facebook today.
