After our very own Gulzar’s genteel yet ‘zabardast’ comments (“If you don’t get your feet dirty, the ink of your pen can dry up,”), it was left to Waldman to remind the audience about why we read and write in the first place: “Literature should wake up the world to itself…” The call to direct action did not surprise anybody familiar with the poet’s work. Describing Donald Trump’s inauguration as ‘horrible’, Waldman gave a “shout out to sisters, children and all women marching towards Washington…” It was promptly dubbed the lit fest’s Meryl Streep moment. \nA couple of days earlier, at another lit fest in Kolkata, anguished writers and poets were making similar points. An American poet read out his work, with each verse starting and ending with an impassioned refrain: “There is blood on our hands.” The night was cold. My blood was running colder. Another speaker referred to Trump’s inauguration as an “apocalypse”. In a dignified and moving keynote address, Nayantara Sahgal reminded the spell-bound audience that India is for all Indians and is certainly not exclusively a ‘Hindu India’. The evening’s topic, “Love in the time of vitriol ’, generated a fascinating array of presentations. Haji Syed Salman Chishtey kept his address charmingly tender, quoting Rumi and using his expressive hands to make pertinent points about the 800-year-old, non-discriminatory traditions at Ajmer Sharif. There was Sahitya Akademi Award winning writer-poet Jerry Pinto sharing his ‘My prejudice is better than yours’, work. Sandip Roy recounted a personal encounter with a Muslim taxi-driver that, to him, encapsulated the true meaning of love while Ram Rahman relived his past via the poignant love story of his remarkable parents. And then, there was welcome and unexpected mirth, as veteran actor Barun Chanda commented, “There are two things all Bengalis must suffer at least once during their lifetime – malaria and poetry.” \nLiterature should wake up the world to itself, American poet Anne Waldman told the audience at Jaipur Literature Festival \nAs invitees left the venue after expressing solidarity and hope by lighting candles, they were sniffling and wiping tears. Yes, the mercury had indeed dropped dramatically, in more ways than one. At about the same time, a teenager was being aggressively targeted across social media. Zaira Wasim, a 16-year-old actor who has won the hearts of India in this year’s biggest film, ‘Dangal’, was struggling to cope with waves of hate directed at her for meeting Mehbooba Mufti, and accepting the chief minister’s description of her as a ‘role model’. For that ‘crime’, Zaira was mercilessly trolled to the extent she was forced to apologise and delete an innocuous post. Irony! Today, that single word – inclusion – has become dangerous. \nAnybody using it publicly is dubbed anti-national. It is a loaded word, with deep political connotations. But, while leaving the peaceful garden attached to the beautiful St John’s Church in Kolkata (Lord Brabourne’s grave is in the cemetery), where so many speakers had attempted to interpret ‘inclusion’, I felt weary and sad. Yes, we can continue to meet at similar venues in different cities, light candles, sing songs, talk solidarity and oneness…but what happens when we walk out, holding on to our sentiments and shawls, hugging ourselves against the biting chill? Here’s what: We climb into our waiting cars, driven by men who work long hours and need the money to send to their families in the village of their birth. We go home and are served food cooked by people we hire to feed us. Our bathrooms are cleaned, our dogs walked, our clothes washed, our gardens tended…by the poor. They represent the real ‘majority party’ in India. And we do not include them in anything. They know just one religion – poverty. Political pimps exploit them – have been doing so for years. But wait a minute. We exploit them, too. So what ‘inclusion’ are we talking about? Till the day our domestics don’t sit at the table and eat with us. Till the day we don’t ‘allow’ them to use ‘our’ bathrooms. Till the day they are expected to stand and never sit in our presence. Till the day we don’t feel outraged if they believe they can share our sofa…sorry, till the day we transform this blatant inequality and treat our staff as equals, let’s console ourselves with poetry. I’ll skip malaria, though, thank you! \nDonald Trump is not the only villain in the world. All of us are equally guilty. DISCLAIMER : Views expressed above are the author's own.
