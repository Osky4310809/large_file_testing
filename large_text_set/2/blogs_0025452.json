What do you get a man who's just reached 1,000 games as a football manager - and who has also won three league titles, three Champions Leagues and three domestic cup competitions? \nIn short, what would you get Carlo Ancelotti for reaching that milestone? \nA cake? Too boring. A custom printed tea mug with a list of his achievements on? Too rubbish. A medal? He's got enough of those. What's he got? We can see ribbons so it must be good... (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nSee, it's a tough one. But trust those efficient Germans to come up with something equal part thoughtful, creative - and tasty. \nTo mark the Italian's huge achievement, the Bayern board must've consulted the city's best producers of salty beer house snacks - who produced a giant PRETZEL spelling out \"1,000\". (Photo: @BavarianFBWorks/Twitter) \nAlthough it looks good, we've got to admit it took few squints and stares to make out the numbers on the doughy treat. \nIt certainly rivals this season's other novelty-sized edible gifts - notably Jurgen Klopp and his giant Cornish pasty. \nAnd with Bayern players on the pitch making the occasion with a 8-0 home win against Hamburg, Carlo can certainly kick back this evening and enjoy it with a beer or three.
