March 13, 2017 A post shared by Jerrod Blandino (@jerrodblandino) on Mar 12, 2017 at 12:27pm PDT \nIt's a peach revolution! Too Faced founder Jerrod Blandino just leaked that there are more peach products coming exclusively to Sephora. The offering already includes blush, eye shadow, bronzer, highlighter, and lip oil . This first iteration grew a crazy-obsessed fan base instantly. \nThe new lineup seems to include more palettes (cream blush?), bottles (primer?), and lipstick tubes. Hard to tell, but we'd love to hear your guesses on what's inside the pretty packaging. \nFans are already freaking out. One Instagrammer wrote: \"What?!? How am I supposed to remain calm?!\" \nSince peach makeup is the hottest trend of Spring 2017 , you're going to need to get all of these on your face when they launch. We reached out to Too Faced for more info, and we will keep you posted as details emerge!
