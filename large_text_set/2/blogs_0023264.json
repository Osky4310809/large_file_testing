The singer/actress, who stars in two nominated films’ Hidden Figures and Moonlight is blowing our minds with her dress tonight. The Elie Saab stunner is sheer black, white and silver and covered with delicate and intricate birds. The details include bronze beads on the main skirt and filagree on the outer skirt. The bodice is completely sheer, the skirt is slinky, and then the outer skirt is made of layers of black tulle.\nVALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images Monáe accessorized the frock with a gold chunky choker (can she also win Most Epic Choker tonight? SWOON!). She is also rocking a gorgeous pixie haircut with a gilded vine headband.\nGetty Images/Steve Granitz We haven’t gotten a look at the shoes yet but if the rest of the outfit is any indication, they’re probably FIERCE. Monáe has been KILLING it on the red carpet lately. Like this checkered gown she wore to the Critics Choice awards :\nGetty Images/Steve Granitz Or this polka dot dream at the Golden Globes:\nGetty Images/Frazer Harrison Monáe will literally never disappoint on the red carpet. Whether she’s creating a new trend, or revitalizing an old one, Monáe will always look eclectic and gorgeous wherever she goes. Good luck tonight, Janelle!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:42:24.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
