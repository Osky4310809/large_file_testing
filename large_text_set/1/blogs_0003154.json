(Photo: Joel Brackenbury/Facebook) More One man’s plea to a British grocer has shoppers divided. When shopper Chris Cooke was visiting Tesco’s Salford store recently, he spotted two women in an aisle, wearing their pajamas. Their clothing enraged him so much that he snapped a picture of the duo and posted a note to the company’s Facebook page about it. Chris Cooke’s post on inappropriate dress in a grocery store has struck a chord and garnered divided opinions. (Photo: Joel Brackenbury/Facebook) More “Dear Tesco, please can you put a rule in place that people like this will not be served in your stores,” he wrote. “It’s bloody disgusting. This was at 7 pm last night in your Tesco Salford store and I have seen other people dressed similar on a regular basis. I mean who doesn’t have time to get changed into clothes to go shopping.” The post has since been deleted but not before a Tesco customer care representative issued a response. “Many of our customers have told us that they feel uncomfortable when they see other shoppers wearing unsuitable clothing in our stores and we do try to find a balance that everyone is happy with,” the representative, Rukshana, replied to Cooke. “Although we don’t have a formal dress code in our stores, we rely on our management team to use their discretion and common sense,” she continued, before adding that the chain would log Cooke’s feedback for review. While some users agreed with Cooke’s sentiments, many were quick to fire back. Facebook user Joel Brackenbury attached an image of Cooke’s post and issued another letter to Tesco alongside it, slamming Cooke and his view on appropriate dress. “Dear Tesco, can you please put a rule in place that people like Mr. Cooke will not be served in your stores,” Brackenbury wrote. “I for one find it uncomfortable to have to shop alongside people who spend their time taking photographs of strangers minding their own business rather than just ignoring things that do not affect them in any way, and have seen other people before making complaints on a similar basis. I mean who doesn’t have the time to just ignore these women and carry on shopping.” Many other Facebook users agreed with Brackenbury and sounded off on the post. “I think people should concentrate on their own day to day life rather than those around,” Ricky Dunn commented back . “They are clothed and minding their own business. I also do Tesco runs in lazy day clothes — each to their own!! Get a life.” We have reached out to Tesco for comment and will update when we hear back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:38:49.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
