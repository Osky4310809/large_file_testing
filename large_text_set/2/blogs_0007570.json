So   7:38pm Family food packs were immediately brought to Surigao for distribution to the families affected by the magnitude 6.7 earthquake that hit the province on February 10. Robinson Niñal/Presidential Photo   Authorities have improved the distribution of assistance in quake-hit Surigao after criticisms on the slow delivery of aid, Malacañang said. Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said victims were expecting the relief goods as early as 5 a.m. but they were only distributed nine hours after. Abella attributed the delay to the decision of local officials to give away relief goods when President Rodrigo Duterte arrives.

Distribution was initially hampered by an inadequate distribution system. The victims were already expecting the relief goods as early as 5 a.m., but the local government made a judgment call to wait for the president who arrived by 1 p.m.,” Abella said. “Three thousand family food packs were then successfully shared after DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) Caraga officials, local government, barangay officials and Surigao City mayor worked out a more efficient distribution system,” he added. Abella, however, did not elaborate on the new system.
