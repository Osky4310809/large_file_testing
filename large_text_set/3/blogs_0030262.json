Check back at the end of every month for a new roundup of products the HelloGiggles team tried and fell in love with, the best of the very best, and newest releases we’ll never be able to live without. \n1. Best Serum: Organic Wear Bright Boost Oil Elixir , $12.99 Target I know some of us automatically think that our skin care regimens have to lean towards the pricier side, but this elixir from Physicians Formula is proof that we don’t have to spend a ton of cash. At first I was attracted to the pretty floral bottle that literally reminds me of a magic potion, but the serum itself is SO NICE. It moisturizes without feeling greasy, is an easy addition to whatever skin care routine you have already going on, and it is a dual-purpose product! You can totally put it in your hair to combat frizz. HELLO! Plus, the mongongo nut oil ingredient gives it a nice scent that isn’t too strong.\n2. Best Blush: Benefit Cosmetics Galifornia , $29 Benefit Cosmetics I was already screaming with excitement when we first got a sneak peek of Galifornia . First of all, it has that iconic adorable Benefit packaging, and the blush itself looks like a glorious ray of sun. It’s not your typical pink blush either, as it’s accented with gold specks. Yes my friend, that means you get just the right amount of subtle shimmer with your rosy cheeks. OBSESSED WITH YOU, GALIFORNIA!\n3. Best Highlighter: Too Faced Love Light , $30 A post shared by Too Faced Cosmetics (@toofaced) on Mar 21, 2017 at 9:54am PDT \nWhen I think of Love Light, the first thing I do is sigh heavily, because this makeup makes me feel some kind of way . #1: Not only is the packaging heart-shaped, but it has shiny, defined edges that remind me of the crystals sitting on my altar at home. TOTAL Sailor Moon vibes, people. #2: The highlighter gives you a natural glow, but is also super buildable AND versatile. Sometimes I’ll skip my cheekbones and only apply them to the inner corners of my eyes — a look that is particularly new for moi. It’s also the kind of product that you’ll want to collect in all shades. SORRY WALLET, NOT SORRY.\n4. Best Eyeshadow Palette: Tarte Make Believe in Yourself , $40 Tarte Cosmetics \nTarte’s entire unicorn-themed collection is something to write home about (hi, have you seen those golden unicorn horn brushes ??), but this eyeshadow palette is BONKERS. I went to Palm Springs and it was my go-to palette the entire time. (I brought three palettes to use, BTW.) It has nine metallic shades, one matte, and in the center, a holo white shade that can double as a highlighter. I tend to use it on my brow bone or as a base if I only want to do a winged eye.\n5. Best Lip Stain: Makeup Geek Showstopper Creme Stain , $12 A post shared by Makeup Geek (@makeupgeekcosmetics) on Mar 28, 2017 at 1:08pm PDT \nY’alls, I was pleasantly surprised by this new lip stain from Makeup Geek. It’s as rich and pigmented as your average liquid matte lipstick, but feels light, as if I’m wearing a freaking lip balm! It’s kind of trippy, in the best way. My fave shades are Mambo, a pinkish berry, Flamenco, a rich red, and Cha Cha, a sweet, rosy pink. Love how they all have dance-themed names, AND even more, how affordable they are at 12 doll-hairs each!\n6. Best Lipstick: Reina Rebelde Bold Lip Color Stick , $16 A post shared by REINA REBELDE® (@reinarebelde) on Feb 25, 2017 at 7:09pm PST \nReina Rebelde is a newer, Latin-inspired makeup brand, and I’ve been having a lot of fun exploring their line. Their Bold Lip Color Stick has become the #1 lipstick I reach for in these past few weeks. The shade that I’m nonstop wearing is Brava. It’s a deliciously rich red, aka my forever signature color. And I love that it comes in crayon form. Perfect for travel and quick application, since the crayon shape helps act like a liner. Yes, I also wore that the whole time during my aforementioned Palm Springs trip.\n7. Best Lip Care Product: Nurse Jamie NuLips RX , $26 Nurse Jamie \nOkay, SO. I’m going to tell you a hack that I do to get rid of dry, flaky lips. I gently brush my flakes away with a slightly wet toothbrush. Gross? Maybe. This cute silicone brush is kind of the same idea, except it’s probably a lot more hygienic than my hack, AND it comes with a nice balm to apply after. Plus, with clients like Kim Kardashian and Jenna Dewan Tatum, Nurse Jamie clearly ain’t no joke, people! I got rid of that toothbrush thang and decided to trust her with my delicate smooch!\n8. Best Nail Polish: Floss Gloss “Lipliner” Floss Gloss Floss Gloss has been one of my favorite nail polish brands forever. They were on top of that 7-free ish from the beginning, and always come out with the flyest of the fly shades. Their latest, Lipliner, is a dusty rose — which is perf, because we’ve been seeing this pinkish, neutral shade all over the place in the lip color scene. Meaning, you’ll be color coordinating your lips and claws like crazy! Plus, they have the sickest Insta in the game.\n9. Best Eyeliner: The Vamp Stamp , $25 The Vamp Stamp If you caught our Facebook Live testing this baby , you already KNOW that HG staff is all over this innovative tool. I will admit, I’m a winged eyeliner SNOB, and this totally blew me away. It basically acts like a stamp that creates the perfect winged eye. No artistry needed. All you have to do is stamp it and fill in. It almost makes me ANGRY how amazing it is! You can also choose from a medium wing and a larger flick. They’re also coming out with a smaller size, named Kitten, so you’ll have more instant cat-eye options to choose from!\n10. Best Moisturizer: GlamGlow Glowstarter Mega Illuminating Moisturizer , $49 A post shared by GLAMGLOW (@glamglow) on Mar 28, 2017 at 12:26pm PDT \nClearly, I’ve been having a ~moment~ with GlamGlow since they made my fave moisturizer list TWO months in a row! THIS LOVE IS SERIOUS! They came out with three options (Pearl Glow, Nude Glow, and Sun Glow) of this new Mega Illuminating Moisturizer that not only hydrates, but gives you a nice RADIANCE. So, my current regimen includes applying their matte Volcasmic Moisturizer ( which I wrote about last month ) during the day before putting on my makeup, and then this one (in Pearl Glow) before bedtime. I’ve been using this religiously on my neck and décolletage because I want my bosom to glow!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:16:58.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
