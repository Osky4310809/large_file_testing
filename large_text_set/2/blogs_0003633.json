The biggest change however, takes place at the back but isn’t shown in this instance. \nNot that it is any mystery as the Civic Hatchback has already been revealed in full several months ago . The five-door hatchback’s rear is just as bold in appearance as the front, with equally large “outlets”, a tailgate spoiler and even twin exhaust pipes (as seen on European market models ). The hatchback’s interior will be carried over from the sedan, with the same layout and switchgear. \nHonda Thailand did not reveal any specifications of the Civic Hatchback, but it is expected to be powered by the same powertrain as the sedan. This includes the 1.8 i-VTEC and 1.5 VTEC Turbo petrol engines, which are mated to a CVT to drive the front wheels. The model, like the sedan, will be built in the Kingdom . \nFor those who are expecting Malaysia to be the next recipient of the Civic Hatchback, don’t hold your breath . Katsuto Hayashi, managing director and CEO of Honda Malaysia had previously stated that the company has no plans to do so, although with enough demand, that may change. \nGALLERY: Honda Civic Hatchback (European market) 2017 Honda Civic", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:45:03.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
