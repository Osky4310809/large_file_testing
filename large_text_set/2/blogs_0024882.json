Take Ginnifer Goodwin, for example, who is in excellent form on this year’s red carpet.\nThe Once Upon A Time star looked very fairytale-esque in a tiered, red, long-sleeved gown by Zuhair Murad with Sophia Webster shoes — in fact, she looks like she’s channeling the Queen of Hearts! The high collar is sassy and regal, something we can totally see a queen wearing as she yells, “Off with your head!” (Not that Goodwin or her character in Once Upon a Time would ever say that.) The touch of sheerness is sexy and playful at the same time, and we love it! Also, can we please borrow that deep red Tyler Ellis clutch? Red on red on red (and yes, we noticed the red nails!).\nGetty Images/Kevork Djansezian We’re also all about Goodwin’s jet black pixie cut and fierce smoky eye that contrast with the red gown so excellently.\nGetty Images/Frazer Harrison Goodwin’s 2016 film Zootopia is nominated in the Best Animated Feature category, and she was also nominated for a People’s Choice award for Favorite Animated Movie Voice. Together with husband Josh Dallas, the two seemed like something right out of a storybook.\n\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images But although Goodwin and Dallas were all smiles, Goodwin acknowledged that it’s a particularly difficult day, following the death of actor Bill Paxton at age 61 . Paxton and Goodwin had starred together in Big Love , which aired from 2006-2011.\n“It was hard to come here, it felt wrong to come and celebrate anything,” Goodwin told People on the Oscars red carpet on Sunday. “But [husband] Josh [Dallas] reminded me that Bill loved all things Hollywood history and he would want you to be here.” And Goodwin isn’t the only actress rocking red at this year’s ceremony. Loving star Ruth Negga stunned in a high-collar dress with a semi-sheer neckline and low shoulder pads.\nGetty Images/Kevork Djansezian Keep those bright reds coming ladies!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:31:19.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
