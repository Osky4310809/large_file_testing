That same year, he and Hannity began a 12-year run as co-hosts of the popular program \"Hannity & Colmes,\" which brought Colmes both fame and ridicule. \nColmes, who acknowledged that he was a minority voice on the conservative channel, was often mocked as being too nice and easily overshadowed by the ever-aggressive Hannity. \nThe liberal media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Media likened him to the hapless Washington Generals, the dependable losers to basketball's Harlem Globetrotters.

Savenok / Getty Images, file \nIn his best-selling book \"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,\" Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, imagined Colmes' earning his salary by \"adding toner to the copiers and printers, loofah-ing Roger Ailes in his personal steam room, and ordering Chinese food for editors working on misleading video packages.\" \nColmes was aware of the criticism, but he said getting mean wasn't his style. \n\"People say to me, 'Why don't you fight fire with fire?'\" he said in 2003. \"You fight fire with water, not fire.\" \nPundits and colleagues on both sides of the aisle remembered Colmes on social media on Thursday, among them Republican political consultant Karl Rove, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and conservative author Ann Coulter. \n\"Sad. We had some great times on Hannity & Colmes. Alan Colmes was fair & funny while hewing to his core beliefs. Condolences to Jocelyn,\" wrote Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump. Sad. We had some great times on Hannity & Colmes. Alan Colmes was fair & funny while hewing to his core beliefs.
