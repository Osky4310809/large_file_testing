Hameed Ali (retd) Dr Junaid Muhammed (Former member of the House of Representatives, Second Republic) I have never had any serious opinion either way in the entire uniform wearing saga. Basically, it is understood that when a man is given an appointment he should observe the norms, the ethics and other things which the appointment requires. But the CG of Customs has refused to do these and has not advanced any reason for his inability to wear the uniform. I know people who are civilians who have never worn uniform until when appointed as the Customs CG. But there are also heads of security agencies, who were former military officers, and yet wore uniform. However, the matter, as far as I am concerned, does not account to misbehaviour that warrants his resignation. I believe the CG should have simply been called to order. He should have been instructed by his boss on what to do and how to do it. I believe that even among armed robbers, there is a code of conduct. The idea that this government allows the issue of uniform to fester into a big controversy is worrisome. It has now reached a level where members of the National Assembly are calling for his resignation. I think the President or other people to whom the CG is answerable should have called him to order. This is my own observation. Another issue is that, there are some political appointees in the present government who do not have any experience of such positions. Something has to be done about this. Mr. Bamidele Salam (Legal practitioner) Yes, the Senate is right to call for the removal of Comptroller General of Nigeria Customs. The Senate may pass a resolution on any matter within its legislative powers. Every public officer is required to respect the laws of the land and institutions of government. The Senate is the highest law making body in the country and they are there to represent the whole of Nigeria; he should respect the fact that Senators are representing Nigerians. The act of the Customs CG in refusing to honour a lawful summon by the Senate is unfortunate and condemnable. It may set a bad precedent if condoned by the Senate. I believe the President should act on that resolution and remove him. If not, it will give others the effrontery to disrespect the lawmakers and this may put our democracy in jeopardy. The CG is morally and legally wrong to refuse to wear the customs uniform which bears his rank. The Customs and Excise Act requires all officers to wear their ranks. The Comptroller General is a rank created by law. The rank is affixed to the uniform of the customs, which is a paramilitary organisation. The CG should not have accepted the appointment if he knew that he did not want to identify with the organisation he is leading. Charles Nwajiani (Legal practitioner) The Senate action is not justified; it is wrong. Putting on a uniform in Ali case is discretional. When you summon him, he has the right to either put on the uniform or not. The Senators are not the appointing authority, the appointing authority is the President, who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and there is no law stating who he is to employ to head the Customs unlike The Police Act which specifically states that the President shall choose a senior member of the Police Force unlike the Customs which gives the President the prerogative to chose whomsoever he deems fit just like the State Security Services. You cannot compel Ali to wear the uniform: you are not the appointing authority and you cannot fire him. It is a settled issue. They should not bring in their ego, and they are beginning to mess up the upper legislative chamber and bringing the Senate to ridicule. In any case, there is a defined position in the Senate that it should not go into any matter that is in court. I am surprised that with the caliber of lawyers in the Senate, it still delved into a matter that is in court. Mashood Erubami (President, Voters Assembly) Senateâ€™s call for the sack of the CG of Customs is misplaced and inappropriate. It has no reserved right under the law to demand the sacking of a government appointee for not appearing before it or wearing a uniform. The Senate can merely call on the President to relieve an appointee through a motion passed on the floor; it is, however, not all motions passed that are implementable. Chief Chekwas Okorie (National Chairman, United Peoples Party) If retired Colonel Hameed Ali has any honour left, he should have resigned without anybody prodding him. The call for his resignation or removal is not extreme; it is in order. If he has principles and he feels because of these principles he cannot wear the uniform after dropping his military uniforms several decades ago, he should not have taken up the appointment of the office of Comptroller-General of Customs. The office of the CG of Customs is a rank, it is not just an appointment. It is not like any other political appointment; it is a rank within a paramilitary organisation and there is an insignia of that rank. If he feels it is beneath him to wear the uniform, he can choose to leave the service. It is wrong for him to be the most senior officer of Customs and he is not wearing the uniform and he expects all other officers to be proud of their uniform when he is not proud of it. Osazee Edigin (Civil rights activist) The Senate calling for his sacking is apt in order to instill respect for the citizens of Nigeria. It will also send a clear message that the Senate truly represents the power of the people. Ali should respect the Senate and identify himself properly with the Customs Service by putting on his uniform, instead of running to the court for a restraining order. The disposition of the Comptroller General of Nigeria Customs Service, Col. Hameed Ibrahim Ali (retd.) to the directive by the Senate, amounts to denigration of democracy. The Senate represents the people of Nigeria, hence, their resolutions and decisions are a direct mandate from the people whom they represent. It is true that the wearing of a uniform does not connote efficiency, but it has become imperative as a means of identity for the Nigeria Customs Service and its leader must lead by example. Ali draws his salary from the service and enjoys every other benefit that comes with the office. There is no need for the issue of putting on the service uniform to be elevated to the level of national discourse. The people whose taxes are used to pay him have spoken through their representatives, it is expected that he respects the Senate by appearing before it in uniform. Furthermore, if he is ashamed to put on the uniform, he should also be ashamed to draw salary from the service. Ali should serve as a good example to junior officers by wearing his uniform. It will create some level of affinity between him and his subordinates. The lacuna Ali intended to close by the new policy thrust (retroactive payment of duties) is not the fault of Nigerians but that of Customs officers. Why should Nigerians be made to pay for the ineptitude of the Customs Service? However, the major reason for this hullabaloo is not unconnected with the appointment of non-career paramilitary personnel to head such a service. If a career officer had grown to the position of a Comptroller -General, he would not have any difficulty putting on his uniform. Ali, as a retired military officer, wore a uniform while he served in the military. So, why is he finding it difficult to wear another uniform now in the service of his father land? I think ego is at play here and possibly a display of executive rascality. Heads of other paramilitary outfits do not have a challenge wearing the uniforms of their various services, why is Ali having the problem? If it is not enshrined in the Customs Service enabling Act to make it mandatory for every officer, irrespective of the rank to put on the uniform, I think, this episode should activate an amendment procedure to compel compliance in order to avoid a similar drama in the future.
