Better yet, when's the last time you've even seen a potato skin? Your fourth-favorite childhood diner snack has pretty much fallen off the face of the culinary universe. \nAt their best, potato skins as are as good as just about anything else you'd find on the menu at your local watering hole, filling enough to sustain you and greasy enough to line your stomach for another beer. \nBut too many places don't seem to understand the pitfalls of the potato skin, namely the potato-to-topping ratio. The skins need to have enough substance to hold up the weighty toppings, but not so much starch that you're essentially eating a loaded baked potato. \nOn the list of all-time greatest bar snacks, potato skins rank somewhere between nachos and the days-old bowl of overly salted nuts. So how do you launch potato skins into the Bar Food Hall of Fame? Just turn them into nachos. \nSlice the skins relatively thin, deep fry them and use them as a starchy, crispy bed for the absurd amounts of gooey cheese, sour cream, chives, bacon, and whatever the hell else you want to put on. \nNostalgia never tasted so good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:51:40.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
