Brown, who was fined $10,000 by the team for the postgame video, apologized to the organization a few days before the AFC title game, which the Steelers lost 36-17. \nAfter the game, it was reported that Brown was seen pouting after a Steelers touchdown, a report that was later recanted . \n“There’s been a lot of reports, a lot of different people saying a lot of different things. You guys know the truth,” Brown said on the video Wednesday. \nBrown, who enters the final year of his current deal, finished with seven catches for 77 yards in the loss to the Patriots. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the fourth consecutive season after catching 106 passes for 1,284 yards and 12 touchdowns. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:49:44.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
