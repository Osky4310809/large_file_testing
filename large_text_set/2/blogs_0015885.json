They are not allowed to have any contact with their son. \nOn Jan. 11, police responded to a Berea home — belonging to Simko’s grandparents — where the couple had been raising their son, the news station reported. \nDrugs and syringes were found on the property. \nHeroin from friend nearly killed Staten Island mom as son cried \nDowdy told police he and Simko were in bed with their son around 10:30 p.m. when they noticed his lips started to turn blue, the Washington Post reported. \nIn audio from the 911 call, a man’s voice — likely Dowdy’s — can be heard pleading with the dispatcher to send someone quickly while shouting at a woman nearby. Charles Dowdy and Danielle Simko, both 31, were arrested after their son overdosed on heroin inside their Ohio home. (Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department) \n“I think he was sleeping and I think what happened was he rolled over and I don’t think he could breathe,” the man says. “I think he was just, like, in the pillow and suffocated.” \nHe tells the dispatcher the boy is his 7-year-old son, though in the police report the child’s birthday indicates he’s actually 8, the newspaper reported. \n2 arrested after cops find cache of weapons, drugs in Queens home \nAfter first responders found the boy’s pulse, he was rushed to the Southwest General Medical Center where staff discovered a small bag of heroin and prescription pills tucked inside his sock, Cleveland.com reported. A urine test showed heroin in the 8-year-old’s system. \nPolice questioned Dowdy, who admitted to using the drugs in the house earlier that day, according to records cited by the news website. \nOfficers arrested both of the boy’s parents at the hospital.
