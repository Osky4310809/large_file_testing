His plan is to spend time in the 30 states he has yet to visit. \nThe CEO and co-founder of Facebook kicked off his Year of Travel challenge Monday in Dallas where he took an opportunity to combine work and charity. \nIn a Facebook post, Zuckerberg said he spent the day in Oak Cliff planting a garden with locals as part of a Day of Service in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. (Facebook) (Facebook) \n\"Oak Cliff is a food desert, so the garden we worked on is going to be a source of fresh fruits and vegetables for the community,\" said Zuckerberg. \"Service events like this are a great reflection of Dr. King's spirit and his life's work.\" \nHe worked on the garden alongside a group of students from the School for the Talented and Gifted, a Dallas magnet college preparatory that requires freshmen to take computer science classes. \nZuckerberg also made a stop by the Dallas Police Department where he met with officers to discuss how social media is changing law enforcement. (Facebook) \nFacebook and new technologies, he said, have opened the doors to build better accountability and trust in communities, but it's a double-edged sword. Police face new challenges that didn't exist before those technologies were created. \n\"The officers had good ideas for how we can help them connect with their communities and keep people safe, and I'll be taking a lot of them back to our teams,\" said Zuckerberg. \nThere's no word on where he'll head next, but Zuckerberg said he plans to meet with other members of the Texas community over the next few days.
