Gen. H.R. McMaster, outlined his reading list for military professionals in a 2013 interview with the McKinsey company. \nThe reading list was originally distributed by Thomas Ricks of Foreign Policy and is organized by subject matter. McMaster preceded the list saying: “we need leaders who can adapt and innovate. As Sir Michael Howard has said—and I’m paraphrasing—we’re never going to get the problem of future war precisely right. The key is to not be so far off the mark that you can’t adapt once the real demands of combat reveal themselves, and you need leaders who can adapt rapidly to unforeseen circumstances. They need to be able retain the initiative as well as sustain the types of campaigns that require a broad range of capabilities—rule of law, development of indigenous forces, and military support for governance, for example.” General grounding \nThere are several essential reads for professionals involved in military affairs: \nCarl von Clausewitz, On War . The author uses a dialectical approach to understanding war without being prescriptive. \nMichael Howard, War in European History . This book is excellent, as is anything by this author. \nElting Morison, Men, Machines, and Modern Times . The author discusses the limitations of emerging technologies—specifically, he argues that instead of taming our environment, technology has further complicated it. \nWilliamson Murray, The Making of Strategy: Rulers, States, and War . This book helps connect military action to strategy. \nThucydides, The History of the Peloponnesian War . The Greek historian shows that the drivers of war—fear, honor, self-interest—haven’t changed over time. Innovation and the world wars \nMuch has been written about World War I, World War II, and the interwar period—and about how these events changed the nature of war. The following are favorites: \nMarc Bloch, Strange Defeat \nRobert A. Doughty, The Breaking Point: Sedan and the Fall of France, 1940 , and Pyrrhic Victory: French Strategy and Operations in the Great War \nTimothy T. Lupfer, Dynamics of Doctrine: The Changes in German Tactical Doctrine During the First World War \nWilliamson Murray, Military Innovation in the Interwar Period Memoirs and biographies \nIt is important to understand how leaders have adapted and thought about war and warfare across their careers. The Autobiography of General Ulysses S. Grant: Memoirs of the Civil War is perhaps the best war memoir ever written. The following are some other significant titles: \nCarlo D’Este, Patton: A Genius for War \nDavid Fraser, Knight’s Cross: A Life of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel \nMatthew B. Ridgway, The Korean War Selected histories of military campaigns \nFor selected histories of wars and military campaigns, the following are some of my favorites; I’ve also included recommendations on contemporary threats: Ancient warfare \nDonald Kagan, The Peloponnesian War Seven Years’ War \nFred Anderson, Crucible of War: The Seven Years’ War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754–1766 The American military profession and the American Revolution \nDavid Hackett Fischer, Washington’s Crossing \nDon Higginbotham, George Washington and the American Military Tradition and The War of American Independence Civil War \nJames McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era Franco–Prussian War \nMichael Howard, The Franco–Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870–1871 World War II \nRick Atkinson, An Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942–1943 ; The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943–1944 ; and the forthcoming The Guns at Last Light: The War in Western Europe, 1944–1945 \nGerhard Weinberg, A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II Korean War \nT.
