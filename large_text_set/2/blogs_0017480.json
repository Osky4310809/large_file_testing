Officers handcuffed her and took her to the Midtown South Precinct, according to police. \nThere she was searched and placed in a cell and denied the right to call her family. \nAfter several hours, two officers handcuffed her again and transported her to a Brooklyn precinct stationhouse, the lawsuits says. \nThere she was strip searched and her hijab was once again taken from her. She said a police officer also took her picture on his cellphone without her consent. \nAfter a few hours passed, officers interrogated her and demanded that she \"confess to what she did,\" the lawsuit says. \nMusa, who had never been arrested before, repeatedly insisted to officers that she had done nothing wrong. \nThe officers \"nonetheless interrogated her for more than an hour, seeking to get her to confess to something.\" \nThe lawsuit says that at about 12:30 a.m. — after more than six and a half hours in custody — officers released her without any charges. Musa said she had to find her own way back to her Midtown apartment from Brooklyn. \n\"One of the most astounding things here is she was handled by several officers, none of whom wanted to tell her why they were detaining her,\" her lawyer, Aymen Aboushi, told DNAinfo New York. \nAboushi said since the wrongful arrest Musa has exhibited psychological and emotional trauma. \n\"She doesn't like to leave her house,\" he said. \"She gets very apprehensive and has panic attacks when officers come near her.\" \nThe NYPD and the city Law Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:38:50.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
