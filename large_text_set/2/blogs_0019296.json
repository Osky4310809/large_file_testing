There was an anarchic brilliance to Tuesday's 5-3 clash, a dizzying collision of two teams that excelled in attack and who defended disastrously. The sense may be that whichever is the least flawed at the back will progress. \nJohn Stones contrived to sum the occasion up. Culpable for Monaco's third goal, he secured redemption by volleying in City's fourth. The hosts had been 2-1 and 3-2 down, raging at the wretched referee and enduring a pronounced self-destructive streak, especially when they conceded three minutes after Sergio Aguero scored the first of his two equalisers. \nBut they had spirit and they had creativity. For much of the match, City's defence looked embarrassingly poor. Willy Caballero was responsible for Monaco's first goal, Nicolas Otamendi for their second and Stones for their third. Yet the Ligue Un leaders were equally generous. They conceded twice from corners. Their defence struggled against Leroy Sane, who squared for Raheem Sterling to score the first and ended the night by tapping in from an Aguero pass to make it 5-3. \nLike Arsenal, City conceded three goals at home to Monaco in a Champions League round of 16 tie. Yet by delivering five goals of their own, they are slight favourites to reach the quarterfinals. Manchester City dug themselves a deep hole but in the end, their high-octane attack made up for their poor defence. \n2. Aguero becomes the hero after early frustration \nAs they tend to do, the City crowd booed the Champions League anthem before kick-off. Their grievances with UEFA and officialdom were apparent again at half-time when they booed the referee. If the first may seem counter-productive and outdated -- the sense is that Guardiola wishes they would not regard UEFA as the enemy -- the second was more understandable. \nNot for the first time, City could rue the actions of a referee because for all their defensive issues, they should have scored a second goal in the first half. When Kevin de Bruyne provided an incisive through-ball, Aguero was clearly brought down by Danijel Subasic. The yellow card was brandished, but not to the Monaco goalkeeper. \nAguero appeared to be tumbling before contact was made but the contact was so firm he would have been upended anyway; it was so clear that a referee at this level should not miss it. Instead, the Spaniard Antonio Mateu Lahoz booked Aguero for diving. The Etihad faithful's relationship with the Mateu Lahoz didn't improve when he gave Monaco a spot kick; amid an abject display, it may have been one of his few correct decisions. \nOut of luck in the first half, Aguero's fortunes changed sharply in the second. When the excellent Sterling found him advancing down the inside-right channel, his shot was crisply struck but straight at Subasic. Yet the Croatian fumbled, not guarding his near post. The shot slipped off his fingers and in. \nThe goal ended Aguero's 580-minute drought in Champions League football but he only had to wait 13 minutes to strike again, volleying in David Silva's corner on the full. He'd scored hat-tricks against Steaua Bucharest in a qualifier and Borussia Monchengladbach in the opening group game, but has now failed to find the net in nine of his previous 10 games in the competition itself. This was an illustration that a man who'd recently lost his place to Gabriel Jesus still remains one of the world's top strikers. \nRadamel Falcao was superb for Monaco, scoring two fine goals, but his missed penalty proved costly. \n3. Falcao finally excels in England \nMonaco boasted a strike partnership of opposites, the 30-something and the teenager, the man with a past in the Premier League and the boy who may have a future. Radamel Falcao and Kylian Mbappe were twinned in attack and on the scoresheet, too. \nThere have been few better goalscorers in mainland Europe in the last decade than Falcao but few worse forwards in the Premier League. His time in England produced a mere five goals in 41 games for Manchester United and Chelsea but Tuesday's brace means he's now struck six times against English opposition and in rather fewer matches. \nSeemingly a flop during his time in the Premier League, Falcao regained his spark on his return to Monaco. Guardiola believes Falcao's fine form, in a season that has yielded 22 goals, owes much to Monaco's crossing. It was apparent when he flung himself at Djibril Sidibe's centre to score with a spectacular diving header. \nA second cross should indirectly have led to a second goal for Falcao. Sidibe fed the ball in from the flank and Falcao went to ground as Otamendi challenged. Yet his penalty kick was tame and saved by Caballero; this, it seemed, was the impotent forward more familiar to English audiences. \nBut then came an illustration of the brilliant finishing that brought him 155 goals in his first 200 games for European clubs. Falcao no longer has the speed he boasted before a cruciate ligament injury but he had just enough pace to hold off Stones, the skill to turn away from him and then the brilliance to chip Caballero. \nIf Falcao ended up enjoying an excellent evening, Mbappe's was outstanding. Billed as the new Anthony Martial, the 18-year-old illustrated why, with solo runs that provided reminders of the former Monaco forward. He is dangerously quick, so much so that he may accelerate out of Monaco to a big-spending club this summer. In the meantime, he could hasten their progress to the latter stages of this competition in three weeks' time, having surged on to Fabinho's free kick to rifle in Monaco's second goal. \nRichard Jolly covers the Premier League and Champions League for ESPN FC.
