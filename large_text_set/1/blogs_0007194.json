The prices mentioned are inclusive of GST, and include a three-year/100,000 km warranty (whichever comes first). \nThe Teana you see here is the 2.5XV that is fitted with the more expensive of the two packages. Therefore, the list of mods start with a full Nismo bodykit, consisting of front and rear bumper spoilers (with red accents and Nismo badging), side skirts, a bootlid spoiler, as well as engraved exhaust finishers. \nAlso part of the package is a set of Nismo sport spring, which sees a reduction of the ride height by 30 mm. This is complemented by Nismo LMX6 18-inch alloy wheels wrapped with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tyres that are an inch larger compared to the stock rims on the 2.5XV, or two inches in the case of the 2.0XE and 2.0XL. \nMoving inside, everything remains unchanged from before, and contrary to what you see in the photos, a dashboard signed by Nismo Super GT500 racing drivers – Tsugio Matsuda and Ronnie Quintarelli – is not included with either Nismo package. \nNo changes under the bonnet as well, with the 2.5 litre four-cylinder petrol engine continuing to produce 173 PS at 6,000 rpm and 234 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm, with an Xtronic CVT handling power delivery to the front wheels.
