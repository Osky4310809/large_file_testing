(Instagram Photo / @dogsofamazon) Dogs are a big deal at Amazon. And on #NationalPuppyDay , which is apparently today, it’s worth noting just how big.\nThe official @AmazonNews Twitter feed did just that with a tweet saying that there are over 2,000 dogs registered at the tech giant’s headquarters in Seattle.\nDID YOU KNOW: There are over 2,000 dogs registered at our Seattle HQ? That means every day is #NationalPuppyDay ! pic.twitter.com/g3H2snfFVH \n— Amazon News (@amazonnews) March 23, 2017 \nAnyone who works for Amazon or has wandered past any of the company’s offices around Seattle probably wouldn’t be surprised by the number — even though that many dogs easily outsizes the human workforces of many other tech companies in the region.\nDogs are everywhere at Amazon; all shapes, sizes and breeds. Just check out the company’s special “Meet the dogs of Amazon” page on its “working at Amazon” website. Some 40 dogs are profiled on the page, with their favorite toys — pizza pillow! — and loves — long naps in the sun! — highlighted next to each cute photo cutout.\n(Amazon screen shot) The dog love started way back when there was just one four-legged “employee” at the company. The story of a corgi named Rufus is also chronicled in detail on the Amazon site.\nThe dog “belonged to Amazon’s former editor-in-chief and principal engineer, and he accompanied them to the office every day.” Rufus, who passed away in 2009, even had an Amazon building named after him. And he’s a big reason why reception desks are stocked with biscuits and some water fountains around campus are set at dog height. And don’t forget the dog park on the 17th floor of the Doppler tower.\n(Amazon screen shot) Before you go get yourself a puppy for your workspace, add the @dogsofamazon Instagram feed to your daily scroll. Dogs (and office furniture/carpet) never looked so damn cute.\nhi everyone! i'm whiskey, an 8 week old mini aussie puppy. you can't drink me haha. #aussie #aussiepuppy #dogsofinstgram #dogsofinsta #dogsofamazon #puppies #puppiesofinstagram \nA post shared by The Life of a Coporate Dog (@dogsofamazon) on Feb 6, 2017 at 7:12pm PST \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:21:07.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
