She gave birth the following year, and after taking some time off for motherhood, she’s now returning to acting. Rani will be starring in the Yash Raj Films production Hichki , to be directed by Siddharth P Malhotra and produced by Maneesh Sharma . \nHichki , we’re told, is about a woman who turns her biggest weakness into her biggest strength. Rani says: \nI was looking for a script that would challenge and excite me, and Hichki came my way. Each of us has a weakness that pulls us back. It could be a disability or any condition but if we just look at it as simply as a hiccup, we can emerge as a winner. It won’t come in way of achieving our dreams. Hichki is built on this positive premise and I decided to take it up. \nSiddharth P Malhotra has, in the past, directed We Are Family for Dharma Productions. Karan Johar wished him best of luck for his new film: So it's out finally my next film as a director titled \"Hichki\" for @yrf starring #RaniMukerji produced by #maneeshsharma need ur wishes \n— siddharth malhotra (@sidpmalhotra) February 27, 2017 \nFun fact: The media mixed up the two Sid(d)harth Malhotras, and thought Rani’s next film would be opposite actor Sid Malhotra: Note to journalist- this is complete fiction ! pic.twitter.com/31jqwZf8aI \n— Sidharth Malhotra (@S1dharthM) February 27, 2017 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:31:50.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
