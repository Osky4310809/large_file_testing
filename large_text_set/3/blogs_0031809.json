Full Game Coverage \nThat's why Duffy has so enthusiastically supported KC Pet Project, a nonprofit charitable organization that takes in thousands of pets a year and is one of the largest no-kill animal shelters in the country. \nBut, as Duffy points out, the KC Pet Project facility, which is located near Kauffman Stadium, is woefully inadequate for its needs. So Duffy has jumped on board to get behind a crucial vote in Kansas City on April 4 that would provide finances to build a new KC Pet Project facility. \n\"I've done a couple of promotional videos for it,\" Duffy said. \"I'm passionate about whatever they're passionate about, whether it's dogs, cats, animals of all species. They genuinely care.\" Danny Duffy hangs with Sadie (right), his beloved Alaskan Malamute. (Danny Duffy) \nDuffy visits the facility often and knows first-hand that it desperately needs to be replaced. Question 3 on the ballot for April 4 is a bond initiative that would provide funding for a new building -- the present facility is over 45 years old and originally was designed as a construction shed for equipment to build Arrowhead Stadium, the home of the Kansas City Chiefs. \n\"That's the thing,\" Duffy said. \"They do such a good job that every dog is still wagging its tail over there. But they could use a new facility big time. \n\"I know they're one of the largest [no-kill shelters]. They do whatever it takes to mend animals no matter what condition they show up in, and they have an incredible adoption rate. They've got my support 100 percent. \n\"I don't see why [the vote] wouldn't pass. I don't see why people wouldn't want to help out man's best friend.\" \nDuffy, who has had a love-hate relationship with Twitter over the years and has dumped his account several times, is back on Twitter (@Duff805) for one reason: To support the Kansas City community in helpful movements such as the KC Pet Project vote. https://t.co/qhlIFLH879 #RaiseTheWoof KC! Vote YES on QUESTION 3 APRIL 4th! Help these pups out!! â€” Danny Duffy (@Duff805) March 25, 2017 \n\"Nothing really gets to me anymore in terms of trollers on Twitter,\" Duffy said. \"It's a good opportunity for me to use the platform for good. It would be irresponsible for me not to.\" \nDuffy presently has an Alaskan Malamute named Sadie. But he's been an animal lover all his life. \n\"My house growing up was literally like a zoo,\" Duffy said. \"We had cats, dogs, rabbits, birds, you name it. Always loved animals.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:13:29.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
