So we played over the top of them and played on the counter attack and it worked incredibly well. \n“I expected us to come here and give a right good account of ourselves and we did. My heart was in my mouth at times, but my keeper only had one big save to make.” \nKlopp made nine changes, throwing in teenagers Joe Gomez, Ben Woodburn and Ovie Ejaria, as well as right-back Connor Randall, who hadn’t played a senior game this season. \nBut that should not take anything away from a Wolves side who came with a game plan – and executed it perfectly. \nThey had the perfect start, scoring after just 53 seconds, as Liverpool’s fragile defence imploded on its first test. Richard Stearman celebrates his opener (Photo: Getty Images) \nHelder Costa whipped over a free-kick from the right flank and veteran defender Stearman jumped in between dozing duo Divock Origi and Georginio Wijnaldum to head past Loris Karius. \nAnd it could have got a whole lot worse as Costa, on a season long loan from Benfica made a slalom-style dash through ­Liverpool’s defence, but shot wide under pressure from Woodburn. \nThe youngster was a constant threat and Lambert had his heart in his mouth when the star crashed into an advertising hoarding in front of the Kop, appearing to injure his ankle. He limped gingerly back on and, in the closing minutes of the first half, played the killer pass that put Wolves 2-0 ahead. \nBefore that, Stearman had been booked for a foul on Wijnaldum, then was at the centre of a penalty storm as he blocked off Ejaria in the box. Weimann's goal put the tie beyond Liverpool's reach (Photo: Alex Livesey) \nReferee Craig Pawson ignored Anfield’s protests – and ­Liverpool’s misery was compounded 10 minutes later. \nRoberto Firmino lost the ball on the edge of the Wolves area and Lambert’s stars broke rapidly on the counter attack. \nDefender Matt Doherty found Costa, who evaded Moreno’s desperate lunging challenge and played a stunning pass into the path of Weimann, who coolly rounded Karius and slotted home. \nKlopp chucked on Philippe Coutinho at the break and he proved an instant upgrade for the Reds. But Liverpool couldn’t create a decent clear-cut chance. \nCoutinho, fresh from his new long-term contract deal, superbly picked out the raiding Moreno on the hour, but, although the Spaniard nudged the ball past Wolves keeper Harry Burgoyne, it ran out of play. Sturridge did little after coming on as a sub (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nDaniel Sturridge arrived five minutes later, but it was Wolves who almost went 3-0 ahead as substitute Jon Dadi Bodvarsson poked an effort at goal only for Karius to block. \nKlopp saw his stars finally nick a lifeline goal after 86 minutes, as Origi fired in from close range at the far post after a game of head tennis, following Sturridge’s corner. \nSeconds later, Liverpool almost snatched an equaliser but Burgoyne made a brilliant stop with an outstretched leg to deny Origi. \nAt the other end, Lucas denied Bodvarsson a certain goal and the final whistle sparked wild scenes of celebration among the 8,000 travelling Wolves fans. poll loading If Liverpool lose to Chelsea on Tuesday, is their season over? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T19:55:58.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
