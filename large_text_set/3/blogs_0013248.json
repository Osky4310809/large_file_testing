Amy Schumer’s The Leather Special premiered on Netflix March 7 , and reviews of it on the online streaming service are very, very bad.\nAdvertisement \n\nThe first stories about the low star ratings on the special were reported on fairly straightforwardly, like in this post by Decider, who stated that “33 subscribers gave it 5 stars, 17 gave it 4 stars, 22 gave it 3 three stars, 85 gave it 2 stars, 710 users give it 1 star, and 9 gave it zero stars.” Decider allowed that “a chunk of these negative reviews can be attributed to misogyny—female comics are frequently criticized for making certain jokes that men make all the time,” then added that “a large percentage of these terrible reviews are being written by self-proclaimed Schumer supporters.” Oh, someone on the internet labeled themselves as something? That’s binding.\nAn article from Splitsider points in a completely different direction. It appears that the bad reviews are a concerted effort amongst organized trolls:\nAdvertisement \n\nA quick Reddit search — particularly in the alt-right r/The_Donald subreddit — tells a very different story than what the above outlets are reporting, with posts like this one and this one encouraging people to give Schumer’s 2016 book a bad review on Amazon, plus all of these calls to give her special a one-star review:\nTo those that still have Netflix; Netflix just added a new Amy Schumer special, please go and 1 star that piece of shit .\nAmy Schumer has a new special on Netflix and it has 1.5 stars… Can we get it down to 1? \nAmy “1 Star” Schumer has a new Netflix special. You know what to do \n‘Amy Schumer: The Leather Special’ is on Netflix. You know what to do, folks. \nThis is very similar to what happened to the trailer for the female led Ghostbusters after it was posted on YouTube . Haters built automated bots to down vote it, making it the most unpopular trailer in YouTube history.\nAmy Schumer responded to Splitsider’s report, and seems far more enraged by journalists than trolling:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:04:29.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
