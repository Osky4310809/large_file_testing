King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 11 hours ago 18 The time has come for the very first Wednesday Question of 2017! We decided to kick this one off with a pinch of sax and ask ya this: What's the greatest rock or metal song to feature a saxophone? Make sure that your favorite falls into the category of rock and metal and that the sax is used at some point and you're all good. Apart from that, standard rules apply.THE RULES: Post only one suggestion per comment after checking that your favorite wasn't already nominated (Ctrl+F and all). Multiple nominations of one song create heavy confusion, since on one hand it's unfair to the given track to take into consideration only the most upvoted nomination, but seeing that multiple nominations allow one user to give two or more votes to the same tune, it's also unfair to other nominees not to discard it. Vote up the ideas you support and vote down the ones you dislike. We'll sum up your votes by Friday and bring you another traditional UG top list. Show us what you got now!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:28:44.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
