We’re not 100% sure if the images are authentic, but they do look legit, don’t they? \nActually, even without the sole official teaser image released by Fuji Heavy Industries so far, it’s easy to imagine what the next XV would look like – combine the new-generation Subaru Impreza hatchback with the rugged, SUV-inspired styling cues from the outgoing/current XV (roof rails, black cladding, under guards), plus a higher ride height, and you’ll have something like the above. \nThe leaked images also show rims that follow the XV theme – black with silver “holes”– and the jacked-up hatch’s signature orange colour. \nThe shape is familiar, but the reigning Japan Car of the Year sits on an all-new platform . Compared to the XV that we know, the new one sports C-shaped headlamps and taillights, a prominent character line that flows over both wheels and just beneath the beltline, as well as the latest ‘Dynamic x Solid’ cues showcased on the XV concept from last year. \nReports mention that the XV will have two NA boxer engine options in its domestic market – a 115 hp 1.6 litre and a 154 hp 2.0 litre unit. If true, they would be the same FB 1.6L and 2.0L units offered with the Impreza sedan/hatch in Japan and Singapore . \nThe new XV’s debut would be of interest to Malaysians, as the car has been confirmed for local assembly and a fourth quarter launch this year , following the footsteps of the outgoing car, which has been rolling out of Tan Chong’s Segambut plant since 2012 . \nSame same but better, I reckon. Like what you see? \nGALLERY: Subaru XV Concept", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:56:55.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
