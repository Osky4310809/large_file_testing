This may not occupy them when discussing venture capitalists, or sports or financial crises. But come elections and the air is abuzz with caste calculations, caste chemistry, or pure casteism.\nThis time around it was different in Uttar Pradesh, and it needed BJP to drive this home. Modi called the caste bluff, and not just the Yadav bluff, and won. He did well because he got his sociology right. It was always known that Yadavs number, at best, no more than 11% of UP’s population, but everybody behaved as if they were the dominant majority and could win seats on their own.\nIn Mainpuri, where Yadavs are probably at their best at a respectable 18%, the Samajwadi Party (SP) won. Before we jump to conclusions let us take in other places, like Ghazipur and Jaunpur, where with an identical population profile, SP lost. Obviously numbers were not enough, nor is it as if every Yadav voted SP. In Jaunpur, for example, it was a Yadav, but from BJP, who swung the seat away from those other Yadavs in Akhilesh’s camp.\nWest UP has roughly 9% Jats but is widely considered to be a Jat stronghold, for reasons never made clear. Yet the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), headed by the son of legendary Jat strong man Charan Singh, lost every seat in that part of UP but the one in Chaprauli. However, in other West UP constituencies like Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Saharanpur and Agra, which had the same percentage of Jats, RLD was nowhere in sight. Interestingly Kapil Dev Agarwal, a Baniya by caste, won in Muzaffarnagar.\nNot only is it a fact that no caste numerically dominates any constituency but, as we just found, caste votes are also divided. This truth is demonstrated election after election, 2015 Bihar being the latest example. At that time BJP did a caste deal with Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in the hope of winning over the subaltern castes. The calculation failed as LJP managed to win but two of the 40 seats it had contested and it actually figured much worse than in its previous outings.\nModi wisely changed his tack in UP. He set out to unshuffle the caste cards and pull in everybody. BJP fielded every caste: It was a hand that very few ever dealt during election time. There was a smattering of Yadavs, but also Brahmins, Baniyas and Rajputs as well as Kushwahas, Kurmis and Shakyas, Musahars and Dosadhs. If one were to talk in caste terms then all castes, from forwards to backwards to SCs received equal opportunity treatment. This made both caste chemistry and caste arithmetic look silly, but what stands out instead is sociology.\nThe reason why Yadavs and Jats looked larger than life till about two decades ago was these two were socially the best endowed of all the peasant castes. They were the most literate, had the most land, leading to better connections with police and bureaucracy. As a result, they acted as patrons for the rest and conduits for the less privileged to reach out to the bigger world.\nSo, if a rural Kurmi or Saini wanted an application forwarded to get a water connection, a ration card, or a job as peon, the first port of call would be either a Jat or a Yadav. This gave the impression, to both outsiders and insiders, that certain areas were dominated by Jats or Yadavs. The elementary mistake they all made was to confuse social prominence with numerical majority.\nAfter seven decades of democracy many things have changed. Land reform and reservations have upturned old social arrangements radically. There are no landlords, only a swarm of owner cultivators. Literacy and urbanisation have, over the years, created a class of literati and virtuosos among non-Jats and non-Yadavs too. They are now as well-equipped as anybody else to push applications for urban jobs or stand up to a local cop.\nThis has led to the collapse of the old vote banks where one had to just win over the notables to one’s side. In those days it was patron versus patron and this is why Jat and Yadav presence appeared so magnified. This was equally true among the Jatavs, though that process started a little later. In the 1980s SCs like Dusadhs and Musahars went to Jatavs, who were the best positioned among them, for help. Now they no longer need to be so dependent as literacy and urban occupations have come down to their ranks too. Mayawati’s isolation in recent times is, largely, on account of the diminishing charm of her Jatav vote bank.\nUnder these conditions, to think in terms of pure caste numbers or specific caste unities makes little sense. There are still hard core caste peddlers who would like to call Modi’s strategy as a non-Yadav OBC caste consolidation. This goes against the basic rationale of the caste order. Sociologists will tell us that no caste thinks well of any other caste and this can be gauged from the strict inter-marriage and inter-dining restrictions that all castes observe. Admittedly, these features are not quite as powerful as they once were because of urbanisation and literacy, but have not disappeared either.\nTo think then that there is a caste logic that binds diverse communities is clearly fanciful. When such unities emerge, it must be for reasons other than caste, like economic mobility. Nobody is uncomfortable with luck, especially during elections, but a little sociology is more reliable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:59:26.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
