Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia.” \nThat claim, which has been repeated several times by different members of Mr Trump’s team, appears to contradict statements made by senior Russian officials. \nTwo days after Mr Trump’s election victory, the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said his government had been in touch with Mr Trump’s advisers during the campaign. \n“I cannot say that all, but a number of them maintained contacts with Russian representatives”, Mr Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency. Mr Trump’s team immediately denied the claims.
