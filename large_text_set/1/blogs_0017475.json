Because my discontent is not based in hate, it’s based on information and understanding about what it takes to run a government,” Rawlings-Blake added. McGhee had some overarching thoughts on the messaging of this particular campaign: Advertisement \n“We saw a candidate use identity politics—and I’m talking about Donald Trump—who managed to make the dog whistles about who gets to really be an American, who really gets to belong, who really deserves, turn those dog whistles into a bullhorn. And we can no longer be silent about how important it is to finally confront the way the Right Wing uses race and gender to divide us in order to keep the spoils for the billionaires and the wealthy and the powerful.” \nOn a more immediate level, Sarsour deftly fielded several questions about the Women’s March, and predicted that it will be “the largest mass mobilization that any administration has ever seen on their first day.... and potentially the largest protest in US history.” \nYou can watch some highlights from the conversation here: \nAnd if you’re interested, you can watch the whole panel here: Recommended Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T03:41:08.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
