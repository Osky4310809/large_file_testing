He was however brought to the Manila Police District headquarters. \nAccording to lawyer Jude Sabio, Matobato has already posted bail of P200,000 at the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 24. However, he is still undergoing the booking procedure at the MPD while waiting for his release order. \nMatobato had his mugshot taken and had a medical checkup. \nA regional trial court in Digos, Davao del Sur had ordered Matobato and co-accused lawyer Norberto Sinsona arrested for frustrated murder case. It set bail at P200,000. \nThe warrant was approved by Presiding Judge Carmelita Sarno-Davin last March 2. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nLast January, the DOJ indicted Matobato in relation to the ambush of retired agrarian reform adjudicator lawyer Abeto Salcedo Jr. The Digos city prosecutor's office found probable cause in the frustrated murder case and indicted them. \n“You are hereby commanded to arrest Edgar Matobato, who is said to be found at Sagrada Pamilia, Sasa, Davao City, and who stands charged before me with the crime of Frustrated Murder and to bring him forthwith before me as soon as possible to be dealt it with according to law,” Judge Carmelita Sarno-Davin wrote in the warrant. \nThis is the second time Matobato has posted bail. \nSen. Antonio “Sonny” Trillanes IV on Wednesday said Matobato also posted bail for another case in relation to illegal carrying of firearms. \nLast October, Matobato surrendered to the Philippine National Police after a Davao City court issued a warrant for his arrest over charges for carrying a .45-caliber pistol without a permit. \nMatobato failed to show up at a scheduled hearing, prompting the court to order him arrested. Trillanes defended him saying Matobato had no intention to snub his Davao City arraignment. —Rosette Adel Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T11:30:38.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
