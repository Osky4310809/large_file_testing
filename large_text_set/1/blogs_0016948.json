Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIf the title run-in began this weekend - as Jurgen Klopp had claimed on Friday - then it ended too for his Liverpool side with their seismic home loss to bottom-club Swansea. \nThe question now is not whether the Reds can be champions in May, but rather, why they will not. \nAnd chief among the reasons offered by a disbelieving support is the lack of signings in this January window. \nMake no mistake, Saturday's 3-2 victory was something approaching a miracle from the Swans. Yet it always somehow seemed possible, given the Reds’ struggles against sides who defend deep and in numbers in recent weeks. \nThose calling for new faces to freshen up a squad missing key figures such as Sadio Mane, the back from injury but still tentative Philippe Coutinho and political pawn Joel Matip suggest the problem lies with excessive Anfield caution in the winter window.

We do,” the Liverpool manager explained. \n“Yes, on the one side pretty simple. But on the other hand it is pretty difficult. The thing is, the players we want because we think they help us, the clubs don’t sell. It is not about money in this situation, it is the winter transfer window. \n“Clubs are saying, 'No we have half a year to go. We cannot find another player like this. We prefer to take money in the summer than a few pounds more in the winter’. \n“If the right decision is not possible in signing the right player, then you cannot make the wrong transfer. It is not as if there are 20 players out there who could make this team stronger, who are running around and are available. Klopp laid out how hard it is to buy difference-making players in January (Photo: Getty) \n“That is why I say we know the situation, we are prepared to move, but for the right player. \n\"We are not the only side who can decide the outcome of that though, eh? The selling club makes the decision too.” \nLiverpool missed Mane’s pace and unpredictability badly in the first half, and after the break when Fernando Llorente scored two fine striker’s goals, they missed centre-back Matip even more, with Klopp explaining clearance from FIFA for him to play came too late for his inclusion. \nThe man does have a point. \nFew players hit the Premier League ground running because it is littered with physical landmines that are not present in other leagues. Any player who will make a significant difference in the title race at this stage is not recruited easily. Roberto Firmino's two goals... (Photo: Getty) and acrobatic celebration... (Photo: Getty) ...were as good as the day got for Liverpool (Photo: Reuters) \nThose landmines can explode at any time, which is another aspect of English football that is alien to other countries, and Swansea were a spectacular case in point on Saturday. \nIt is easy for fans to moan about Liverpool’s failings – and defensively there were far too many – but the simple truth is we delight in how any team can beat any other in the Premier League, so we shouldn’t be too surprised when it happens. \nIt is a fact that new Swans boss Paul Clement knows more than most. \nAfter spells as assistant manager at Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, he admits to having seen little like the Premier League's competitiveness with those clubs. \n“It’s a fair point, and a question I would get asked when I was in France, Spain and Germany – you don’t tend to get so many shock or surprise results — that is what makes this league so exciting and special,” he said.

Anyone can go anywhere and win lose or draw. \n\"I know what you mean when you say that might not be the case in other leagues. \n“But I am a coach who believes you have a better chance of getting a result if you have good players and you have to work at it on the training field. You have to practice and be organised otherwise you would have no chance coming to a place like this and getting a result.” \nSwansea were certainly all of those, and for their spirit alone - after seeing a 2-0 lead pegged back by two sublime Roberto Firmino goals - they deserved their winner, when Gylfi Sigurdsson capitalised on yet another error. poll loading Where will Liverpool finish this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:51:18.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
