Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDonald Trump’s spokesman has sensationally suggested British spies may have colluded with Barack Obama to covertly surveil the President before last year’s election. \nSean Spicer, communications director for the US leader, repeated a claim that the secretive Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) were drafted in to avoid any “American fingerprints\" on the alleged surveillance \nAlthough the Home Office have refused to comment on the claims one official said called the allegations \"totally untrue and quite frankly absurd.\" \nTrump is under increasing pressure to justify his so far unfounded claims, which his opponents says calls the whole integrity of his administration into question.

Former US President Barack Obama (Photo: Getty/AFP) \n“He didn’t use the NSA. He didn’t use the CIA. He didn’t use the FBI, and he didn’t use Department of Justice. \n“He used GCHQ. What is that? It’s the initials for the British spying agency. \n“They showed simply by having two saying to them the President needs transcripts of conversations involving candidate Trump’s conversations involving President-elect Trump, he’s able to get and there is no American fingerprints on this.” \nA GCHQ spokesman told the BBC the claims \"are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.\" \nIt came after Trump took to Twitter in the early hours of March 4 to accuse Mr Obama of tapping his phones in October. \nHe started his attack writing: \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found.” \nThe tweets continued: \"Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president prior to an election?\" Read More 'How does it feel to work for a fascist?'

Trump has he was spied on (Photo: REUTERS) \nSpicer tried to provide credibility to Trump’s claims today by quoting from a series of articles which discussed surveillance. \nMost, however, were articles which detailed how US intelligence agencies were looking into unusual communications between a computer server in Trump Tower and a Russian bank.
