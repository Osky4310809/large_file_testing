Tory MP Neil Carmichael to rebel on 'meaningful vote' on Brexit deal \nFor that reason, some alarmed Conservative MPs will vote with Labour tomorrow to try to force a “meaningful” vote on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, in 2019. \nThey want it to be early enough for the Prime Minister to be required to go back and seek better terms from the EU if there is no agreement, or if MPs reject the terms she has reached. \nIt has been suggested that, if defeated in Parliament on her exit terms, Ms May would call a snap general election to win a mandate directly from voters. \nBut, asked if she had a “mandate for WTO tariffs”, the Prime Minister’s official spokeswoman said: “There was a decision put to the British people, ‘do you want to stay in the EU or do you want to leave’. \n“And it came back very clearly that people wanted to leave the EU – so, yes, the PM has a mandate to deliver on the decision of the British people.” \nHowever, the spokeswoman suggested WTO tariffs would not be necessary, adding: “We are approaching this with a view that we are going to make as success of this and that we can achieve the right deal for Britain in the negotiations.” \nShe also refused to give ground on Opposition demands for the final vote to be before any agreement is debated – and voted upon – by the European Parliament. \nIt was expected to be “at the outcome of the negotiations, as the process is being taken forward both here and in the EU,” she said. \nAsked in what way “no deal” could be better than a “bad deal”, Ms May’s spokeswoman pointed to the central aims of regaining control of immigration and law-making, while getting the “best possible comprehensive trading deal”. \nThe spokeswoman also hinted that the Prime Minister was unlikely to accept any of the amendments that will be tabled to the Article 50 Bill over the next two days. \nShe said: “We've been very clear, we think this should be a straightforward bill about giving the Government the power to deliver on the decision of the British people.” Read more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:56:28.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
