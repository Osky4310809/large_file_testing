Buhari Niger Delta leaders \nThis came as PANDEF put aside its apparent feud with President Muhammadu Buhari on dialogue, to congratulate him on the capture of Sambisa forest, stronghold of Boko Haram insurgents, by the Nigerian Army. \nBrigadier-General Ikpomnwen lamented that despite the formation of PANDEF to act as the official mouth-piece of the people of the region, some individuals who arrogated to themselves the leadership of the region had been visiting both the President and the Vice President whittling down the powers of PANDEF. \nIkpomnwen, a former Provost Marshal of the Nigerian Army, told Vanguard that “we have a cacophony of voices claiming to be representing the Niger Delta region. That is why you see the Federal Government saying they are searching for genuine leaders. The truth must be said, if I were the President I would be worried by the situation in the Niger Delta. Before now, people were saying there was no body to discuss with in the Niger Delta because of too many groups and individuals parading as leaders. We came up with the equivalent of Afenefere, Arewa and Ohaneze Ndi Igbo and PANDEF was born. One would have thought that would be a relief. \n“What we see are different ethnic groups, traditional rulers and different people coming out to rubbish the whole idea of PANDEF as the spokes-organization for Niger Delta. Some may be saying what they believe for selfish reasons. One would have expected that since unity has always been the problem among the people of the region with diverse backgrounds and cultures, everybody should at this stage recognise the need for the evolution of a group that can speak for everybody, so that the whole arrangement of having one group speaking for everybody would be to work, guide and monitor the leaders. \n“The sad thing about Niger Delta, even after the formation of PANDEF and the President giving recognition almost immediately, other groups who are part of PANDEF were going to see the Vice President and President in Abuja. I think this is deplorable. For us to behave in a way to rubbish the group we formed is not good at all. As an insider in the struggle for Niger Delta, when we are crying that the Federal Government is marginalizing us, we equally know very well that we are marginalizing ourselves.” \nMulade Meanwhile, PANDEF, in a statement through a member of its Central Working Committee, CWC, Dr. Alfred Mulade, said: “PANDEF notes with delight, the capture of Sambisa Forest, stronghold of the dreaded Boko Haram terrorists by the gallant Nigerian military. We must congratulate Mr. President and the gallant soldiers for the gains so far recorded for their successes in uprooting the Boko Haram. It is worthwhile to call to remembrance the joyous return of 21 of the abducted Chibok school girls earlier, and the further release of another Chibok girl recently, all of whom have since been reunited with their families. \n“And now, the reported historic capture of Sambisa forest, considered to be the stronghold of the Boko Haram terrorists by our military. PANDEF wishes to applaud the various coordinated efforts of the Nigerian military, codenamed, ‘Operation Lafiya Dole’, in dislodging these enemies of humanity, that have wrought pains and anguish through the wanton destruction of lives and properties in the Northeast.” Ikenna", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:08:20.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
