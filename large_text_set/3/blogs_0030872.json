FILTER UPDATES Text and Social Videos 12:35 PM (IST) &mdash; SidharthaTOI (@SidharthaTOI) March 29, 2017 12:31 PM (IST) 12 meetings of the GST council were held to make it a process based on consensus and recommendations Arun Jaitley 12:26 PM (IST) Current indirect tax regime being replaced by new mechanism under GST that will be run by new federal system FInance minister Arun Jaitley Prime Minister Narendra Modi is present in the Lok Sabha 12:22 PM (IST) Finance minister Arun Jaitley tables GST bill in the Lok Sabha 11:55 AM (IST) Government seeks powers to levy GST on all rental income \nThe government is arming itself with powers to levy goods and services tax (GST) on all rental income but is unlikely to impose the tax on individuals renting out homes. Currently, service tax is levied on rental income from commercial property, but not levied on residential property. 09:18 AM (IST) Congress likely to move amendments to GST bills \nAt a strategy meeting presided over by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Lok Sabha MPs shared their concern over jurisdiction issues, \"federal issues\" and some other provisions in the GST bills which they felt required improvement. It was decided that Congress will register its reservations on the bills. 09:15 AM (IST) Amenities to employees outside CTC may trigger GST liability \nAn employer-employee relationship is something which is no longer the sole purview of the HR department. Under GST, which is set to be introduced from July 1, the taxman could also be probing into various facets of it. GST would be payable if there is a supply of free goods or services to an employee exceeding the stipulated sum, if an employee avails of a company asset for personal use (say, a car), it would trigger GST. 09:14 AM (IST) \nThe government will create a fund to compensate states for any revenue lost from the new GST during the first five years. 09:14 AM (IST) GST to boost economic growth by 2% \nTouted as the biggest taxation reform since independence, the GST is expected to boost GDP growth by up to 2 per cent. The tax reforms are expected to boost economic growth by about 0.5 percentage points in its first year of implementation. The government also hopes the new taxes will broaden its revenue base and cut compliance costs for companies. 09:11 AM (IST) \nFinance minister Arun Jaitley on March 27 introduced in the Lok Sabha four GST bills that provide for a maximum tax rate of 40 per cent, an anti-profiteering body and arrests for evading taxes in a bid to overhaul India's fragmented indirect tax system. 09:09 AM (IST) \nFrom providing single registration to manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services to self-assessment of tax, the new tax regime provides easier administration and some degree of self policing -- a buyer can only claim a refund if the seller issues an invoice. 09:08 AM (IST) \nBesides creating an anti-profiteering authority that will see the benefit of lower taxes is passed on to consumers, the new legislations provide for setting up a Consumer Welfare Fund. 09:08 AM (IST) \nJaitley introduced the Central Goods and Service Tax or CGST bill which will amalgamate all the indirect central government levies like sales tax, service tax, excise duty, additional customs duty (Countervailing Duty), special additional duty of customs, surcharges and cesses. 09:08 AM (IST) \nCGST provides for a maximum tax of 20 per cent. A similar tax will be levied by states through a separate State-GST law which is not part of the legislations introduced in the Lok Sabha today but would have to be brought by all states in their assemblies. 09:08 AM (IST) \nActual rates would, however, be a four-tier tax structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent as approved by the GST Council. The peak rate of 40 per cent is only an enabling provision for financial emergencies. 09:08 AM (IST) \nA Union Territory GST bill will take care of taxation in UTs of Chandigarh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu 09:08 AM (IST) \nA bill on Integrated-GST — to be levied and collected by the Centre on inter-state supply of goods and services — was also introduced in the Lok Sabha. 09:07 AM (IST) \nThe IGST law provides for a maximum tax of 40 per cent. 09:06 AM (IST) \nJaitley also introduced a fourth legislation called GST (Compensation to States) Bill, 2017 that provides for a mechanism for making good any loss of revenue of states from introduction of GST in first five years of rollout. 09:02 AM (IST) \nLok Sabha is debating the GST bills today.
