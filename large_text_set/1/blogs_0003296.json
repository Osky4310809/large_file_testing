Yet one show that hasn’t gotten as much buzz maybe as its live-action counterparts is Netflix and DreamWorks Animation’s Voltron: Legendary Defender . Based on the 1980s anime Beast King GoLion , the new series follows five unlikely heroes and their flying robot lions who unite to form Voltron and defend the universe from evil.\nLegendary Defender season 1 – featuring the voices of Josh Keaton ( Green Lantern: The Animated Series ), Steven Yeun ( The Walking Dead ), Jeremy Shada ( Adventure Time ), Bex Taylor-Klaus ( Arrow , Scream ) and Tyler Labine ( Deadbeat , Reaper ) – premiered last June to critical acclaim and has garnered a number of award nominations. When we last saw the five Paladins, they’d each been separated to parts unknown after discovering villain Zarkon (Neil Kaplan) used to be a Black Paladin. Now the series is set to return in just a few weeks.\nThe battle between the two sides continues above in the Voltron: Legendary Defenders season 2 trailer. It’s Team Voltron vs. Zarkon, as the Paladins travel the universe in search of new worlds and unexpected allies while trying to bring the lions back together. However, Zarkon seems to be right behind them every step of the way.\n“There is no place in this universe beyond my vision’s reach,” the Emperor of Galra proclaims early in the trailer, though it’s not exactly clear how he is able to follow the Castle of Lions where everyone is holed up. It seems everyone is eventually able to recover their lions, but they’ll also need to think of a new way to defeat Zarkon if they don’t want a repeat of what happened last time. According to an interview with executive producers Joaquim Dos Santos and Lauren Montgomery on EW , the group has “learned from the last fight with Zarkon that they can’t do this thing on their own.”\nAs for the fate of the Black Paladin, Shiro, following their previous altercation with Zarkon, Dos Santos says the character has an arc in the upcoming season and we’ll see how he and the other Paladins were affected by the events. We get a tease in the trailer that Shiro may meet the same end as his alter-ego Sven from the original series or has a cool new astral project power. A lot of questions remain about the Voltron world so let’s hope we get some answers soon.\nVoltron: Legendary Defender season 2 premieres worldwide on Netflix on January 20th, 2017.\nSource: Netflix , EW", "external_links": ["http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Voltron-Legendary-Defender-SDCC-Poster.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Voltron-Legendary-Defender-SDCC-Poster.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Voltron-Legendary-Defender-SDCC-Poster.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Voltron-Legendary-Defender-SDCC-Poster.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Voltron-Legendary-Defender-SDCC-Poster.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Voltron-Legendary-Defender-SDCC-Poster.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3jU4fD4XvI", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Voltron-Legendary-Defender-SDCC-Poster.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1417&h=708&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Voltron-Legendary-Defender-SDCC-Poster.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop", "http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/05/voltron-legendary-defender-season-2-preview-trailer/"], "published": "2017-01-06T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T04:00:20.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
