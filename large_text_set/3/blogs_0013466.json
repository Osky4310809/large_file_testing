The street style was clean, minimal, and neat, and the make-up was in line with the same. From the fresh no-make-up look, some crazy hair, and hair accessories we have it all here for you. \n1. The top knot and frays are working for us really well. \n2. What did we tell you about the crazy hair? \n3. These chopsticks are our new favourites! \n4. The eyeliner that never goes out. EVER! \n5. Extra neat hair and huge glasses. We love! \n6. The top knot seems to have taken over. \n7. Sleek swept-back hair, and clear sunglasses FTW. \n8. Even the half top-knot is doing rounds. \n9. Clean it like a crime scene. \n10. And throw some shade(s).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T05:07:39.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
