Japanese skin care brand Skin Inc. has teamed up with Disney to launch an exclusive serum kit in celebration of the classic film — and it is gorgeous. \nSkin Inc.'s founder shared that the new limited-edition serum was inspired by the story's heroine, Belle, and the new kit is complete with everything you need to unveil a princess glow. The exclusive Beauty and the Beast set comes with three classic Skin Inc. serums: Vitamin A to reduce dark circles, Chlorella to refine skin texture, and hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid to deliver long-lasting hydration. When fused together, the three ingredients act as a brightening elixir to leave you with radiant skin. \nTo make the launch even more magical, the serum is outfitted in a romantic, golden-flecked bottle that resembles Belle's iconic gown, plus a rose-gold pendant stamped with her enchanted flower. It's a gorgeous vanity fixture that's almost too pretty to use. \nYou can snag the limited-edition kit for $90 when it launches on March 15 at iloveskininc.com , only two days before the movie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:02:16.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
