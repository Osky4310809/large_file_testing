By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 22, 2017 1:01 PM BJP leader Yogi Adityanath. (PTI) \nUttar Pradesh elections have acquired greater urgency as they head towards a conclusion and that is reflected in the increasingly volatile statements being made by all concerned. From PM Narendra Modi ’s ‘Kabristaan-Shamshaan, Diwali-Ramzan’ comments to UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav ’s ‘donkeys’ of Gujarat jibe in which he also roped in Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan , there looks to be no end in sight to the war of words. Adding his bit to the equation is the mercurial Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) leader who took the PM Modi accusations against the Samajwadi Party government forward and dubbed its popular free laptop distribution scheme as ‘communal’. The BJP has accused the Samajwadi Party as well as Congress party of playing ‘vote-bank politics’ directed at Muslims and to a lesser extent the Dalits. \nIn an interview to NDTV, Yogi Adityanath, who is known to make comments that are extreme in nature, also said, “Samajwadi Party uses communal grounds to distribute laptops, power. Power supply on Diwali should be four times more than on Eid.” \nFurther details awaited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:08:13.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
