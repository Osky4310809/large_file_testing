Located at the (current) end of the QLINE , big developers like The Platform and Midtown Detroit Inc. are restoring buildings and storefronts, while more houses are getting renovated around the neighborhood. We’ve seen a few different condos listing in the past few months, most between $120-200 per square foot. This one falls right in the middle, with 1,200 square feet and listing for $175,000. The looks of it are nice, but not anything beyond the average flip. There are hardwood floors, a renovated kitchen, and a private basement for storage. There’s a designated parking spot, and it’s located just a couple blocks from the Fisher Building and across the Lodge from the Henry Ford hospital. HOA fees are running at $414 a month. If you work downtown, you can get nice walk to and from the QLINE, which is 8 blocks away. Good investment for the neighborhood? What do you think, readers?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:51:07.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
