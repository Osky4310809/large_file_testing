Let us know on Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag #aboutruby. What is Ruby and Where is it Found? Ruby is one of the four recognized precious stones. The others are emerald , sapphire , and diamond . Ruby comes from the Latin \"rubens\" meaning red. Rubies are made of corundum . Corundum comes in many other colors, but all those colors are classified as sapphires. Pink corundum is sometimes referred to as pink sapphire and other times pink ruby depending on the hue, region, and personal opinion. Ruby gets its red coloring from trace amounts of chromium. The most desirable shade of ruby is a deep red with a hint of blue which is referred to as \"pigeon's blood.\" Many top quality rubies have been mined in Myanmar (formerly Burma), which is where the term \"Burmese ruby\" comes from. Due to Human Right's violations, there are many restrictions in place banning the import of goods from Burma into the Unites States and other countries, impacting the production and sale of Burmese rubies. Thailand is one of the leading hubs for ruby mining and production, with other leading countries including Madagascar, Sri Lanka, and India. Ruby Value Rubies of high quality that are over 10 carats can sell for much more than a diamond of similar size. Some notable large rubies have fetched sale prices upwards of $225,000 per carat. Comparable diamonds of similar or larger size average a sales price around $125,000 per carat. Rubies of this magnitude are significantly more rare than larger sized diamonds, which explains the difference in price. Synthetic Rubies and Ruby Treatments Like emeralds , almost all rubies have some type of imperfection, which helps in identifying synthetics. Synthetic ruby can be identified by its lack of inclusions. The inclusions in ruby are to be expected and are well tolerated. However, when the inclusions impact the transparency or brilliance of the stone, the value dramatically decreases. Simulated rubies were used in jewelry production since the 1850's. These are also known as garnet doublets, where a piece of garnet is fused with a pinkish-red piece of glass. This creates a gem that looks like a much more expensive ruby. A lot of less expensive Victorian era jewelry incorporates these gems. Synthetic \"flame-fusion\" rubies hit the commercial market in the late 1800's. Chemist Auguste Verneuil perfected this method and had his ruby material shown at the Paris World's Fair in 1900. Most modern rubies are treated to improve their color and durability. Treatments include heat treatment, irradiation, and fracture filling. All treatments should be disclosed to the buyer. Ruby History and Lore Throughout history, ruby has been and remains to be one of the most sought after gems in the world. Rubies are referenced four different times in the bible. The bible associates these gems with beauty and wisdom. ​ According to ancient folklore, people of India believed rubies would help them be at peace with their enemies. ​ The first ever functional laser was created with a synthetic ruby crystal by Theodore H. Maiman in 1960. Synthetic rubies are used not only in laser technology, but also in microelectronics. Famous Rubies Until the beginning of the 19th century, red spinels were thought to be rubies. Famous stones including \"Black Prince's Ruby\" and \"Timur Ruby\" were considered to be rubies until it was discovered that they and many other red stones were in fact red spinels. Some famous rubies include the \"Rosser Reeves Star Ruby,\" the \"Edwardes Ruby,\" and the \"De Long Star Ruby\" In 2011, an 8.24 carat ruby ring belonging to Elizabeth Taylor and made by Van Cleef & Arpels sold at auction for $4.2 million, with the price per carat amounting to approximately $500,000. The most expensive ruby ever sold was the \"Hope Ruby\" which weighs 32.08 carats and sold for $6.74 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:41:45.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
