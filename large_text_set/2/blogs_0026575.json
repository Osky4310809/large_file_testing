The operator of the shopper reward program, LoyaltyOne, angered many members last year with its proposal to void unused Air Miles after five years, only to abandon that plan weeks before it was to take effect. “It put a little bit of a black eye on the industry as a whole,” said Patrick Sojka, founder of RewardsCanada.ca, which tracks travel reward programs. Story continues below READ MORE Air Miles collectors who used up points they thought would expire are now outraged Air Miles acknowledged the public frustration, saying card use dropped at the end of last year. Blair Cameron, head of the program, said it’s premature to say whether that will reverse this year, but Air Miles is ramping up promotions to improve its relationship with collectors. Still, the company has reduced the value of miles for some rewards, increasing the cost by about 20 per cent. Cameron said that change affects only 1.6 per cent of redemptions for its Dream rewards program, and does not apply to flights. Last month, Metro said it was considering dropping Air Miles and launching its own loyalty program in its Ontario grocery stores following the consumer backlash. The supermarket chain said the change is one of many it considers when a contract is up for renewal.

It takes trouble with just one loyalty card to test the public’s patience with rewards programs, added John Boynton, chief marketing officer of Aeroplan operator Aimia. “Everybody does a little bit of a double-take,” said Boynton, who joined the company months after it faced a similar controversy. In 2013, Aeroplan found itself in the midst of a public uproar for attempting to invalidate miles that weren’t used over a seven-year period. Some Aeroplan users complained they had redeemed their miles on the premise that they would expire, leaving them with merchandise or trips they didn’t want. Boynton said customer satisfaction has since improved.
