Edith spelled 'restaurant' without having been taught the word, and the parents knew they'd discovered something exciting.\n“We knew there was something special there,” Fuller told Tulsa World , before explaining Edith prepared for the competition by studying words with her family. Anytime she misspelled a word, she would look it up and learn its definition and spelling.\n“Learning the words was so educational,\" the proud mother continued, \"She was able to learn about different countries and cultures and different kinds of food,\" which probably came in very handy with her winning word.\nMaking it through four hours and 18 rounds, Edith's mother's greatest surprise wasn't her daughter's spelling prowess, but rather her impeccable behavior.\n“She likes to move around,” she revealed. “I’m surprised she sat still for so long.” She's only 5 after all.\nBefore Fuller's stunning achievement, the youngest spellers to qualify for the Scripps National Spelling Bee were 6, the spokeswoman said, noting that there is no minimum age to compete in the competition.\nThe National Spelling Bee will begin May 31.\nWATCH: The stroller has been reinvented…and reduced to a unicycle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:08:30.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
