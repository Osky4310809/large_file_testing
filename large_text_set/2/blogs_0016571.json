He was Ambassador and UK Permanent Representative to the European Communities and European Union in the 1990s. \nTheresa May has been criticised for offering a ‘take-it-or-leave-it choice’, insisting she will crash Britain out of the EU if Parliament rejects the deal she has struck. Read more Lords won’t block Brexit, but they defend the rights of EU citizens \nBut Lord Kerr urged the Lords to reject this “Hobson’s Choice”, calling for the Bill to be amended to ensure the Prime Minister could be told to “go back and try harder”. \nHe said: “The Government has given us no undertaking that they will come back to Parliament if the negotiations threaten to break down. I rate the chances of breakdown at well over 30 per cent.” \nAnd he added: “No deal is much the worse deal….a disaster for business and citizens alike \n“If the bravado of the white paper proves hollow, the Government must come back to Parliament before the clock runs out.” \nOn the two-year timetable, once Article 50 is triggered, Lord Kerr said: “The European union is a union of democracies. If this Parliament asked – and our Government conveyed our request – for an extension, in my judgement it would certainly be given.” Peers debated Article 50 late into the night (House of Lords) \nThe country should be braced for a “more difficult” economic relationship with the rest of the world after Brexit, because Britain would be less advantageous to those countries \n“Why should they be so keen to open their markets to us if we are no longer their entry point to a market of 500m. It’s a fact that trade halves as distance doubles. \n“The Government knows all these facts, but has decided to put sovereignty ahead of economic wellbeing,” the peer said.

Andreas Dombret, who is an executive board member for the Bundesbank—Germany’s central bank—told a private meeting of German businesses and banks earlier this week in Frankfurt that even if banking rules were “equivalent” between the UK and the rest of the EU, that was still “miles away from [Britain having] access to the single market”, the BBC reports.
