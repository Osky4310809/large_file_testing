With it being just a week before Christmas, we went from the best feeling ever to the worst news we could have thought of within about a week and a half. \n\"For the first three days after finding out all we were doing was just constantly crying. We were looking at our phone and getting messages off our friends and family supporting us.\" Bailey's family are raising funds to pay for a special day out for the brave lad (details of how to donate at the bottom of the article) (Photo: Hull Daily Mail) Read More \nHe added: \"It's just such a massive shock. I can't put it into words really, because I will just end up crying again. It's the worst news you could get.\" \nBailey lives with his parents and three sisters, Ruby, 10, Lexi-Mae, four, and baby Lacie. \nMr Sneed, a bus driver with EYMS, said the family's worst fears had come true when Bailey went for his MRI scans. \n\"It started about a year ago when he was getting headaches and temperatures and was just feeling unwell a lot,\" he said. \n\"I took him to the doctors and they said to keep an eye on him and take them back. I took him back and they sent him for an MRI. It was awful. \n\"They turned around straight away and said what they had found. They said it was a tumour on his optic nerve.\" \nMr Sneed's colleagues at EYMS and friends, along with Bailey's school, have now started fundraising for the family so they can afford the travel to and from Leeds General Infirmary, along with being able to treat Bailey to a special day out. \nHe said his son would have to endure even more treatment over the next few weeks. He said: \"We have got to go to a neurologist next week and then have a CT scan and another MRI scan. \n\"We are then going to a surgeon at the end of this month. At the moment, they are saying it would not be best to take it all out. They have got to take most of it out and then try and get the rest of it with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\" \nMr Sneed, who said Bailey is not fully aware of the seriousness of his condition, wanted to thank everyone for their support over the past month. \n\"It's come as a massive, massive surprise to the both of us about how much support we have been getting,\" he said. \n\"We usually keep ourselves to ourselves more or less and we were not expecting that amount of support, especially from his school. \n\"You think you are on your own but then something like this happens to and gets to show how much people do care.\" \nIf you want to support the family and treat Bailey to a day out, donate by visiting their justgiving.com page.
