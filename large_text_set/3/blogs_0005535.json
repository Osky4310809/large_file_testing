The Cats were one of two teams who played just two games in four weeks, after they beat the Hawks in thrilling circumstances in the qualifying final. \n“Make no mistake, we still think that winning that first final in the first week of the finals was a good thing to do. But there was a lot of time off, at least from match practice, through that period,” Scott said. \n“On reflection, we would’ve trained a little bit differently. They’re not huge shifts, but the ability to simulate finals-pressure at training is very difficult. Maybe we should’ve tried a little bit harder to simulate that pressure.” \nScott added that it was “completely illogical” to suggest the poor loss to the Swans would be the driving factor behind the Cats’ 2017 campaign. \n“If we had have won the premiership last season, I don’t think we would’ve been trying any less through this preseason — at least I hope now,” he said. \nTHE HEAVY RELIANCE ON ‘DANGERWOOD’ \nA CONSTANT point of discussion last year was the chasm between Dangerfield and Selwood and the rest of the Geelong midfield. \nOf the Cats’ on-ball brigade, Dangerfield and Selwood are the only two ‘elite’ players, according to Champion Data, with Guthrie, Mitch Duncan and Mark Blicavs the next best with ‘average’ ratings. \nScott said the Cats would continue to have big expectations for ‘Dangerwood’, but insisted the club wanted its next batch to show improvement. \n“It’s an acknowledgment of how good those two are. If we can find another two or three who are approaching that level, we’ll have the best midfield of all time,” Scott said. \n“Having said that, we have worked pretty hard to develop a group of players who should be coming into their prime who can go some way to filling that gap. But if the option is to lessen your strength to strengthen the weak, I think that would be a poor way to go. \n“We’d like to get more from all our players. We don’t feel like we have anyone on the list that isn’t in a position to have a career-best year. \n“The 24 to 27-years-olds, those guys that are coming into their primes, we have a realistic expectation that they would play better this year.” An early onslaught set up Sydney’s victory. Source: AAP \nHOLD YOUR HORSES ON HARRY \nHARRY Taylor won a couple of All-Australian jumpers as a defender, but has been flagged as a potential full-time forward for this season. \nAsked if putting Taylor forward could turn into a case of ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’, Scott said: “Absolute there is.” \nBut Scott added that Taylor’s role for the year hadn’t been completely nailed down yet. \n“While he’s done some training there, it’s not a lay down misere that he’ll play there,” Scott said. \n“It’s just we feel it’ll add another string to our bow.” \nNO THIRD MAN UP, NO WORRIES \nTHE scrapping of the third-man up will not influence Mark Blicavs’ output and Geelong’s stoppage tactics, according to Scott. \nThe AFL in December outlawed the third man up tactic for the 2017 season, disallowing Blicavs — clearly the league’s No. 1 third-man up last year — and the Cats from utilising one of their best assets. \nBut Scott said the new situation was not going to have a huge influence on both his side and Blicavs. \n“It was a case of if you can’t beat them, join them — and we had a unique player in Mark Blicavs who’s very athletic and very tall, so it was obvious to use him,” Scott said. \n“The big ruckman will probably have more influence, there’ll be an interesting debate as to the importance of the second ruckman ... and stoppages could be a bit more stable and less chaotic. \n“We have a view, yet to be tested, that maybe the dominant midfielders might profit from this.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T09:06:37.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
