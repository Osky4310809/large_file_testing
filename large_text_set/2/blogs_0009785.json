Taken together, her nails measured 28 feet, 4 inches.\nThat all came to an end when a car crash broke her nails, shortening them to about 4 inches.\n\"The first thing I spotted was a fingernail, and I thought, 'Oh,'\" Redmond told KSL. \"Then I started to cry and said, 'There's one of my fingernails.' A sweet lady picked them up and I told her they were a Guinness world record, so she went around and gathered fragments of fingernails.\"\nRedmond does not intend to grow her nails back out.\n\"It took me 30 years to grow them and to get them to that length and they became the world record, and I probably won't live for 30 more years,\" she told The Telegraph.\nRedmond explained it was difficult to part with her prized possessions.\n\"Losing my fingernails has been the most dramatic thing that's happened in my life,\" she said. \"I think it was my grandson that said, 'Grandma, they are like your baby. You've taken care of them for 30 years and lost them in a second.'\"\n\"The thing that bothered me with losing the fingernails,\" she added, \"was that it becomes your identity and I felt like I'd lost part of that, yet I would always say when people would make comments about my fingernails, you know there's more to me than my fingernails.\"\nWhile the experience was devastating for her, Redmond managed to keep things in perspective.\n\"But then when you think about it, you know our whole life could end in a second, not just part of the body, but your whole life,\" she said.\nShe now realizes how much her fingernails had inhibited her.\n\"I always did everything with them, but now it's so much easier to do things,\" she said. \"The weight is so different. In fact, my hands seem to fly with the weight gone.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:33:54.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
