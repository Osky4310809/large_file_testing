Every Republican favored advancing the nomination and all but four members of the Democratic caucus voted against it. \nThe Senate's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer , and several other members of the party tried, but failed, to delay considering Tillerson because of Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries and temporarily halting the entry of refugees. show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T07:46:58.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
