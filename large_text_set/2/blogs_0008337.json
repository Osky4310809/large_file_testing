He’s such a joy.” \nThe mum has previously been open about her struggles to conceive and her diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) . \nBefore getting pregnant for the first time, she went through intense hormone treatment. \n“I didn’t care how far I had to go,” she told BabyCentre in 2009 . “You hear horror stories and you think it’s going to be hard, but I didn’t care. I just wanted a baby... It was awful, but I just thought: ‘Keep going’. \n“I’m sure any couple that has been through fertility treatment understands what I’m saying.” \nOliver’s honest confession about baby loss comes as she launches the ‘My Rainbow Baby’ bodysuit as part of her ‘Little Bird Clothing’ collection at Mothercare. Mothercare \n“I’m so proud to be launching this gorgeous Little Bird ‘My Rainbow Baby Bodysuit’,” Oliver said at the launch. \n“Tragically one in four women loses a baby during pregnancy or birth and when that happens it changes the lives of so many families.” \nA £1 donation from the sale of each £8 bodysuit will go to Tommy’s , a charity funding research into pregnancy problems that lead to miscarriage , premature birth and stillbirth.
