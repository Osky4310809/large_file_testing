Executives at companies such as L.L. Bean and New Balance have been criticized for speaking positively about the president, while Nike, Asics, and Adidas received praise for speaking out against the president's travel ban.\nEven some couture companies whose clothing First Lady Melania Trump has worn at high profile events have remained quiet, despite publicizing former First Lady Michelle Obama or other celebrities in their clothing, notes Refinery 29.\nIndeed, Plank's announcement has already drawn criticism.\nBasketball star Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors said that he would not be opposed to dropping his contract with the company if their morals diverge from each other.\n\"Are we promoting change?\" Curry said, according to SB Nation. \"Are we doing things that are going to look out for everybody? And not being so self-serving that it's only about making money, selling shoes, doing this and that. That's not the priority. It's about changing lives. I think we can continue to do that.\"\nCurry also reacted to Plank calling Trump an \"asset to the country.\"\n\"I agree with that description, if you remove the 'et,'\" he said.\nAccording to a statement released by Under Armour, Plank will join other top business leaders on the American Manufacturing Council to discuss U.S. job creation. Meanwhile, the company supports diversity and wishes to work with President Trump to influence policies beneficial to both the company and their customers.\n\"We engage in policy, not politics,\" Under Armour said in the statement, according to GQ. \"We believe in advocating for fair trade, an inclusive immigration policy that welcomes the best and the brightest and those seeking opportunity in the great tradition of our country, and tax reform that drives hiring to help create new jobs globally, across America and in Baltimore.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:15:45.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
