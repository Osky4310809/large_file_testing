He's the only man in the world of soccer who is not capable of recognising his own mistakes and makes those mistakes year in and year out. \n\"He's never tidied the up defence, the midfield is a fiasco and the ping pong nonsense that means no-one will ever get the chance to score. \n\"When he took over, we had the best defence in the world, how has he managed to dismantle that? He's dismantled everything. How has he not replaced Tony Adams, one of the world's best captains? Patrick Vieira? \n\"It's all about this new stadium, this empire of insane mediocrity. It's like a tennis culture. It's not the fans' fault. There's just not enough going on on the pitch to get yourself revved up about. Wenger is coming under increased pressure from fans despite the likelihood of a new two-year contract (Photo: PA) \n\"Alexis Sanchez - there's no point in him hanging about. It also explains why the potential in the young players never came about. It's just so easy for them.” \nLydon also claims it is time for Arsenal fans to stay away and claims he would rather see them go down than Wenger get a new two year contract. \nHe added: ”The current mob filling the stadium, instead of us real Arsenal supporters, will stay outside. It can't go on like that. The Wenger Out chorus is getting louder (Photo: AFP) \n\"The new club is awful in its attitude. It really did its best to eliminate us out. They have priced us out. \n\"I get up at 4am every Saturday morning in LA to watch, knowing that an hour and a half later I will be disappointed. It's a game. But you'd like to win it occasionally. \n\"Wenger is clinging on for dear life but the hurricane will eventually blow him off the tree. The prospects look grim. When he does there won't be anybody left available. He;'s slowly but surely unravelling this club. \n\"As me and my mates all agree, we'd rather Arsenal drop back a league and slowly come back again rather than put up with fourth, fourth, fourth. Fourth is the first. From that day on, I lost respect for him.” \nThe full interview will be played on talkSPORT’s Breakfast show from 6am to 10am on Wednesday.
