The Cowboys restructured the contracts of All-Pro left tackle Tyron Smith and All-Pro center Travis Frederick, ESPN reported Monday. \nThe moves will free up around $17.3 million, allowing Dallas to move under a proposed salary cap of $168 million next season, according to the report. Instead of paying Smith and Frederick $24 million in salary for 2017, the Cowboys reportedly will turn around $21 million of that sum into a signing bonus, freeing up cap space. \nFrederick, who has made the Pro Bowl three of his first four years in the league, was due to $14.2 million next season while four-time Pro Bowler Smith was set to make $10 million in 2017. \nThe duo was part of the Cowboys vaunted offensive line that helped rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott lead the league in rushing last season with 1,631 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:16:50.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
