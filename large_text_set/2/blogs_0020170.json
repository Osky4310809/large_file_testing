But moms are so busy that we barely have time to take care of ourselves. So how are we going to find time to make extra money while managing the kids? \nMy name is Jena Apgar and I am a mom, military vet, connoisseur of tea, dynamic speaker, and Level 2 seller on Fiverr. As a Digital Marketing Warfare Strategist, I help hundreds of small businesses launch new products and services through social media, websites and funnels for ecommerce, dentists, lawyers, bloggers and even other marketers. I built up my Fiverr services into a full service digital marketing Agency, Brand Dot Blog, in Dallas, Texas serving small businesses. To this day I have made $5,429.60 as a seller on Fiverr. Most all of that money was created while I was breastfeeding my newborn daughter using my smartphone with just the one hand I had available. \nBut How Did I Get There? \nOne day when I was 8 months pregnant, I was sitting in my doctor’s office reading Child Magazine . Inside was a tip for teenagers to make extra money over the summer; selling on Fiverr.com. No one we knew had ever heard of this company, but the opportunity sounded like a great idea for my teenage daughter. \nMy teenager doesn’t touch a site unless I’ve vetted the company first. Period. Plus, at this point, I’m eight and a half months pregnant on bedrest like a beached whale who can barely move. I’ve got nothing but time. \nThe fact that Fiverr was a global ecommerce company concerned me. Who would be talking to my daughter? Would the messages be appropriate? Are there scam protections in place?\nWhen you hop onto Fiverr as a seller, you quickly learn how simple it is to use and how many safety structures are in place for both buyers and sellers. Having nothing better to do, I started adding more Gigs. I was surprised to see orders start coming in for tasks that were simple for me to do from my smartphone. What started out as an overprotective momma ended as an avenue for me to make money.\nI’m not going to lie, my husband who makes a six figure income annually laughed at the idea of a $5 client. But then he saw the bank account. $5 became $100 that first month, and then $300. At the point I made $800 there was no more mocking and I was able to put my youngest daughter into a top Montessori program. From there, I was able to launch my Digital Marketing Agency full time.\nWhat Did I Really Accomplish? \nThe money made on Fiverr bought me sanity with 8 hours each day to myself. The profits from Fiverr purchased me independence from my husband and a great education for my children.\nOn a regular basis I see moms struggling with finances and wondering how they could make just an extra $100, $200, or $500 each month while staying at home with their children. I always recommend selling on Fiverr.\nThis comes with frequently asked questions: What do I sell? Where do I get started? Is that legit? How much can I expect to make? \nOn March 2nd, 2017, in Dallas, Texas, I will be hosting a Fiverr event to answer these questions and more. I’ll be showing you step-by-step how I got started and the three key components that helped me grow my business on Fiverr: 1) Setting up Gigs that sell, 2) Upsells and Packages and 3) Getting the positive reviews you need.\nJoin us at #FiverrDallas community event in March . Meet other Super Sellers and connect with the larger Fiverr community to learn about new opportunities. \nFor those nervous about change or worried you’ll waste your time, remember that nothing changes until you do. Do the same things, get the same results.
