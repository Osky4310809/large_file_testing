I think they should really read it, understand it, analyze it, and determine what’s fact, what may not be fact,” Waters said. “We already know the part about the coverage they have on him with sex actions is supposed to be true.   \n“They have said that’s absolutely true. Some other things they kind of allude to. Yes, I think he should go into that dossier and see what’s there,” she continued. \nTo her credit, host Ali Velshi pushed back. \n“You say you think them to be true. How are we all going to find out what is true and what isn’t true? Does it help that you think so? Because unless you have information we don’t have, that’s an allegation,” Velshi asked. \n“You understand that I am saying the investigations must be done, the drilling down must be done. We must get to the facts of what it has been about,” Waters responded. “I don’t think you can do the impeachment just because I think or others think. But I think that if we do the investigations, that we will find the connections and I do think that impeachment will be necessary.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T18:29:05.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
