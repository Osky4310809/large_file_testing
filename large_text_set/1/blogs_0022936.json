Addressing their first joint conference after the SP-Congress alliance for the UP assembly elections was announced, sporting matching kurtas and vests, Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi spoke in concert as if they had been singing duets together for a lifetime. Expect the ladies and also the young gents to dance to their catchy song, “UP ko ye saath pasand hai.”\nRahul compared the two parties to Ganga and Yamuna rivers. “Just like you can’t tell where the rivers meet, this alliance will also be that seamless.” That’s some sensational walking back from the slogan Congress was chanting until recently, “Sattayis saal UP behal.” Rahul had complained, “Cycle to hai, uska pahiya chal nahi raha.” Now he was smiling and nodding as Akhilesh promised, “If the hand is with the cycle, and the cycle is with the hand, imagine the speed.”\nNo matter how much BJP accuses the alliance of opportunism the fact is this big new bonhomie between SP and Congress can really win Akhilesh a second term, provided the two parties succeed in transferring their votes to each other.\nNational party Congress seems to have happily accepted the role of second fiddle, with reports that it had even made the same offer to BSP before SP. Of course a Mayawati and Rahul roadshow would have had a completely different vibe. By the standards of political press conferences the one Akhilesh and Rahul gave seemed like it had been choreographed by Farah Khan. It’s hard to imagine Mayawati okaying such a hip beat.\nAnd to those who will be calling out Congress for its changing positions vis-à-vis SP, here was the perfect rebuttal from Rahul: “History static cheez nahi hoti hai, history badalti rehti hai!” It was perfectly true and perfectly hilarious too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T13:18:42.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
