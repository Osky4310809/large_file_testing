Stylist reveals the mistakes you've been making The majority of people wash their hair even when it's not really dirty - but cutting out the shampoo once or twice could make a big difference Share We're washing our hair too often (Photo: Getty) Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nWe all want our hair to look its best , but we've been washing our locks too often. \nSome of us can even go seven days without getting wet, according to a top stylist. \nActress Brie Larson boasted on Instagram that she hasn't used shampoo since the Golden Globes on Sunday. \nAnd Scott Miller, of Bauhaus salons, has claimed she has the right idea, Wales Online reports . \nRoom star Brie Instagrammed a photo of her tousled locks this week, days after having it styled for the ceremony. \nSo we asked Scott, who owns Bauhaus hair salons in the centre of Cardiff, whether we needed to drop our once a day habit. Step away from the shampoo (Photo: Getty Images) \nScott, who has styled the locks of Cerys Matthews and had Priscilla Presley in for a blowdry in November, said: “The majority of people wash their hair every day and it’s probably not dirty. \n“Washing too much makes it more greasy as you stimulate the sebaceous glands and if you strip them away, they just create more oils. \n“Unless you’ve been working really hard at the gym or have been on a building site and it’s covered in dust – you don’t need to wash your hair every day. \n\"There's a big #nopoo movement at the moment, with people boasting about going weeks without shampooing, but for most of us, cutting out one or two washes will make a big difference.\" Salon owner Scott Miller of Bauhaus offers his top tips (Photo: Bauhaus) \nInstead, here’s how often Scott says you should be lathering up… If you have long hair \nThe longer your hair, the less you probably need to wash it. \nIt will take longer for the sebaceous oil to get from the scalp to the ends of your hair. Flat roots? A bit of dry shampoo. We use a really gentle Aveda one at the salons. \nDirty-looking fringe? Wash your fringe. If you’re washing long hair more than twice a week, you may not be washing it properly in the first place. \nYou need clean water (not bath water), you need to shampoo twice with a 10 pence piece-size dollop, rinse really well, towel dry, then use a conditioner. \nIt may seem a long process but it’s quicker than all that blowdrying and re-styling. If you work out \nIf you’ve been at the gym and really worked up a sweat, for hygiene reasons, you need to wash your hair. \nUse a good quality shampoo and treat your hair gently. Try not to pile it on top of your hair with too many bands – if your band has lots of hair in it, it’s the wrong band. A customer at Bauhaus in Cardiff (Photo: Bauhaus) If you have curly hair \nCertain types of curly or Afro hair can be left longer between washes – usually a week. \nIf you have colour in your hair, whatever type, it will also be drier, so will need fewer washes. \nOverall, if you find yourself washing your hair constantly, you could need to change your shampoo. Cheaper products are full of water and sulphates that strip your hair. \nOr you might need a trip to the salon to get rid of your split ends or to find a style that’s more manageable. If you’ve just had a blowdry \nA good blowdry should last you a week. Let it evolve. \nIf it’s curly and has been blowdried straight, it’ll get a bit of a wave in it. \nLet your hair look interesting. It might just need a good brush – leave it another day and you could be surprised at how good it’ll look.
