It wants to finish off Daesh, the so called 'Islamic State' militants. It wants to wipe them out,” Cevik said ahead of his visit to Moscow on February 26, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. \nHe went on to say that “when we finish off Daesh, if the area is properly secured and we know that they will never come back, Turkey will not remain in that country.” \nHe also called the seizure of the northern Syrian town of Al-Bab and Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield in northern Syria “a great success.” \n“It was a very, very successful operation. Nobody would've been able to secure this kind of operation. In 100 days, we've cleared away the entire region – 45km deep into Syria and 90km at length. So, it's a huge area of more than 5,000 square km. That was a big achievement. Al-Bab itself is a very big achievement,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:22:08.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
