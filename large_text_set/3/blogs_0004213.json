And if we could create a 2017-era list of favorites, dear friends Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift would probably top the list. The two have successfully squashed the dating rumors , which is a plus. But while they’re not romantically involved, that doesn’t mean that they lack chemistry.\nIn fact, Swift and Sheeran are so tight that they often get invites to each other’s parties and special events. Since they’re both such sought-after musicians, it makes sense for them to have a few things in common.\nDuring a new interview with Rolling Stone , Sheeran opened up about the friendship even more. According to Sheeran, he’s got some lofty friendship goals with Swift. But first, a little history.\nEd Sheeran opened for Taylor Swift during her 2013 tour, and admitted that the gig pretty much changed his life. For one, he decided to base himself in Nashville.\n“I was on the most amazing f**king tour in the world,” he said to the magazine. “I was just living in a country that I didn’t belong in, in a town I didn’t really know anyone.” The two bonded, and eventually wrote “Everything Has Changed,” which they performed together live on a nightly basis . Shortly after, Swift referred to Sheeran as the “James Taylor to [her] Carole King.”\nSheeran feels just about the same way. \nIn fact, Rolling Stone expressed that he sees them doing a stadium tour together sometime in the future, where they trade off songs. All we can say about that is, yes please.\n“She would be there if everything ended for me,” Sheeran admitted about his buddy. “Taylor is kind of an anomaly in that sense.” We’re so impressed with the fact that despite their busy schedules, their friendship has stayed so strong! We can’t wait to hear more songs by these two in the future.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:07:15.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
