The Mexican forced McDonnell on the back foot with a determined early attack \nStern words from trainer David Coldwell prompted McDonnell to stand his ground in the second and he landed a decent right hand on Vargas, who replied with more thudding body shots.   \nMaintaining a busy work-rate, McDonnell enjoyed success in the third, as he answered with crisp punches of his own. \nMcDonnell was holding his own by the fifth and was denied a knockdown when referee Victor Loughlin ruled a push after Vargas dropped to his knees on the canvas. McDonnell's appeals for a knockdown were ignored by referee Victor Loughlin \nBut Vargas expertly controlled the sixth off the back foot, spearing McDonnell with a straight right hand, and the British fighter's nose was bloodied by the end of the seventh. \nWith Vargas pulling into a comfortable lead, McDonnell desperately tried to turn the fight dramatically in his favour, and briefly bothered Vargas with a right hand in the eighth. The Doncaster desperately tried to close the deficit in the late stages of the fight \nBut the superior firepower lay with Vargas and the effect of his stinging punches was evident on McDonnell's swollen features. \nMcDonnell marched forward in the closing rounds as the home crowd chorused his name, but Vargas had already done enough to claim the WBC belt on two of the scorecards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:12:30.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
