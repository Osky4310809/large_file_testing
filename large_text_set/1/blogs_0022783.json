Neurogenesis sprouts out when you travel to complex, novel, and new surroundings.\nBut First Off, Stop with the Excuses When people hear about traveling experiences they enviously spurt out ‘You are so lucky, I wish I could…’ and follow up with excuses of paying their bills, etc. What it amounts to is just that–excuses.\nMany may think traveling is way out of range for them, expensive and out of financial barriers. Agreed that it is not free, however you do not have to be a millionaire to see many places and build up a wealth of lifetime memories. It is not an impossible fantasy exclusively for the rich.\nSome Practical Saving Tips If you cannot take a trip to Vietnam why not explore a town nearby or tour your own town? Analyze your bank statements; there should be at least something on your monthly expenditure list that you can sacrifice if you save the amounts you spend on weekend takeaways for a year; it will afford a trip you always dreamt about. But if you just work, eat, sleep and pay bills never making time to travel or even share time with friends and family what does your existence amount to?\nHow Traveling Impacts You Traveling is about close encounters with an unusual and new situation. It may be simply finding your way around the surroundings or ordering a meal in a language you not very familiar with. Studies have confirmed [1] the physical and mental benefits of traveling: social engagement, cognitive stimulation, and physical activity.\nTraveling will awaken you to the realization that there are many different cultures and ways of life. You burst with new experiences and insight. New experiences boost cognitive health; your active brain creates new connections as it programs the unusual stimuli into categories. Plunging to explore the world will be an exercise you will not regret.\nPaul Nussbaum from the University of Pittsburg, a neurological surgery professor has affirmed that traveling grows the capacity of the brain as the challenges start to sprout dendrites, which are extensions.

This helps us to assess our lives clearly.\nJust How Amazing Travel is for your Brain Anticipating a vacation sprouts a higher level of happiness than a new shirt according to a Psychological Science Journal. Researchers affirm that waiting for experiences equals to a higher level of happiness than mere material objects. [3] \nA  US Travel Association recent study found that people who take vacation days have higher chances of being promoted at work than those rigidly staying behind their desks. [4] \nTravel is about meeting people, intellectual stimulation via exploring new and interesting things, and new information stretching our understanding of the world. It increases the neural connections and enhances stimulating activity like problem-solving, education, occupational learning. Studies reveal that students living abroad are more likely to solve computer tasks than students who did not travel. [5] \nWe’ll leave you with a quote by Mark Twain, “Innocents Abroad”\n“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime.”\nFeatured photo credit: pixabay via cdn.pixabay.com \nReference [1] ^ Chicago Tribune: Travel as a health regimen [2] ^ Academy of Management: Fashion with a Foreign Flair: Professional Experiences Abroad Facilitate the Creative Innovations of Organizations [3] ^ Association for Psychological Science:  Anticipating Experience-Based Purchases More Enjoyable Than Material Ones [4] ^ Harvard Business Review:  Are the People Who Take Vacations the Ones Who Get Promoted?
