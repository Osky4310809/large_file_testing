After an engine failure reduced Jolyon Palmer to just 15 laps in the morning, Nico Hulkenberg took over driving duties in the afternoon but ended the day hitching a lift back to the pits in a recovery truck when his car broke down. \nHow quick is the Williams? As is so often the case, the picture presented by Day One's timesheet was at once fascinating, confused and confusing. \nOnly four teams have set a lap time under 1:20 at the Circuit de Catalunya this winter - Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull and, after Massa's unexpected burst before lunch, Williams. \nBut Massa's time was set on supersofts during a qualifying-style run and, although better than Ricciardo managed on the same compound, the Red Bull ran off track on its first ultrasoft run. \nTyre corrected, the Red Bull's most impressive time had been set earlier in the morning when Ricciardo produced a lap of 1:20.077 on softs - a fraction better than Mercedes' fastest time on softs in the whole of the first test. \n\"My guess is that we haven't seen the Red Bull Racing car of 2017 yet,\" warned Mercedes boss Toto Wolff. Lewis Hamilton was frustrated at F1 testing in Barcelona, but did have pet dog Roscoe to cheer him up! \nNo more plain sailing for Mercedes? After sitting out the final day of the first test, Lewis Hamilton experienced more frustration on Tuesday morning when he was restricted to just 49 laps before handing over the W08 to team-mate Valtteri Bottas. \nTrackside observers described Hamilton's running as 'scruffy' with the three-time world champion admitting he had struggled to dial in the W08 to the conditions. \n\"As a team, we are not massively happy with the time we had and the car didn't feel great this morning,\" Hamilton said. \nHamilton damaged the floor of his W08 during his running and finished the day fourth in the timesheets. \nMcLaren: From very bad to even worse McLaren's already torrid winter took another turn for the worse midway through the morning session when a new problem was detected on their car's faltering Honda engine. \nThe team have refused to confirm the exact number of engines they have run during the opening five days of testing but even on conservative estimates the team have already used more power units than the four which can be used during the racing season without penalty. \nInsisting that McLaren are giving no thought to divorcing their engine partners, team boss Eric Boullier told reporters he was \"not concerned\" about McLaren's performances. \nBut with just three days of testing remaining before the start of the season, McLaren are still the only team yet to break through the 1:22 lap mark at Barcelona this year while only Toro Rosso have recorded fewer laps. \nThe one upside from Day One's running was that Vandoorne's 80 laps were the highest they have managed in a single test day so far. \nDay One, Test Two Timesheet 1) Felipe Massa, Williams, 168 laps, supersoft tyres, 1:19.7262) Daniel Ricciardo, Red Bull, 89 laps, ultrasoft tyres, 1:19.9003) Sebastian Vettel, Ferrari, 168 laps, soft tyres, 1:19.9064) Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes, 49 laps, soft tyres, 1:20.4565) Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes, 86 laps, 1:20.9246) Esteban Ocon, Force India, 142 laps, 1:21.3477) Nico Hulkenberg, Renault, 57 laps, 1:21.589;8) Kevin Magnussen, Haas, 81 laps, 1:21.6769) Daniil Kvyat, Toro Rosso, 83 laps, 1:21.74310) Stoffel Vandoorne, McLaren, 80 laps, 1:22.53711) Pascal Wehrlein, Sauber, 47 laps, 1:23.33612) Marcus Ericsson, Sauber, 53 laps, 1:23.63013) Jolyon Palmer, Renault, 15 laps, 1:24.790 \nThe Sky Sports F1 Digital team will be providing live commentary from dawn until dusk for all days of winter testing while Sky Sports News HQ will also deliver live updates from trackside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:04:22.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
