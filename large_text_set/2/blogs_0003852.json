Dressed casually in a pair of denim jeans, black jacket and a graphic T-shirt, Bryan nailed the performance and brought the more than 72,000 football fans in attendance to their feet. \nThe chart-topping recording artist definitely set the tone for what is sure to be an unforgettable face off between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons. Not to mention Lady Gaga 's upcoming halftime performance , which is set to include several outfit changes and an airbound entrance. \nLike Gaga, Bryan recently told Rolling Stone he's spent quite a bit of time preparing for the coveted gig. \"I've kind of just been hanging around the house, singing,\" he dished. \"Singing in the stairwell, singing in the shower, singing for my boys. I just tried to get a lot of—I know it sounds like a sports reference—but get a lot of reps in.\"   Elsa/Getty Images \nAs for his nerves, Bryan explained, \"You have to not think about what's going on outside of the stadium. It's almost like, [you] do an unbelievable job for the people in the stadium and then it'll turn into that. It's only a little over two minutes long.\" \n\"Get up there and do what I've always loved to do: sing for people. And try to take it at that—don't overthink it,\" he added. \nLuke also shared with the outlet that he hoped to surprise football fanatics and music lovers with his performance. \"I just hope that when I walk off that stage, people go, 'Man, he really did a great job capturing the anthem,' and 'He really surprised us.' I hope people go, 'Wow, we didn't really think he had that in him,'\" the \"Kick the Dust Up\" singer explained. \nWe'd say he did exactly that! Enjoy the rest of the game, Luke.
