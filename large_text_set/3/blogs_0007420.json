And by the looks of it, they recieved a very warm welcome from one of the countries they are filming in. \nJohn Boyega, who stars in the film, recently shared a photo of him taking part in a traditional 'big luck' ceremony in China. According to Boyega, the production started filming in China earlier today, and was given the ceremony \"to ensure successful filming.\" \nToday we began our China #PacificRimUprising shoot, blessed with a traditional opening ceremony to ensure successful filming  pic.twitter.com/UaTB0nrOCg — John Boyega (@JohnBoyega) March 9, 2017 \nFor the uninitiated, the ceremony traditionally involved lighting incense - as Boyega and a crew member can be seen doing above - while saying prayers in the direction of each of the four cardinal directions. \nThis isn't the first time a ceremony of this nature has been done on a major film set. When beginning production of the 2012 film Life of Pi , director Ang Lee performed a big luck ceremony for his cast and crew, a tradition he reportedly has on each of his film shoots. According to a report from the LA Times , Lee's version of the ceremony ended with him turning on a movie camera and striking a gong. \nHere's hoping that the cast and crew of Pacific Rim: Uprising have a great shoot while filming in China. \nPacific Rim: Uprising is currently being filmed, and is expected to hit theaters February 23, 2018. The original Pacific Rim earned $411 million worldwide, with $101 million of that coming domestically. \nAre you excited for the Pacific Rim sequel?
