The cosmonauts continued their human research program today exploring the various affects of living in space. \nSpacewalkers Shane Kimbrough and Thomas Pesquet will exit the Quest airlock Friday at 8 a.m. EDT to begin setting up the International Space Station for future commercial crew missions. The duo will work outside for about 6.5 hours on the first of three spacewalks scheduled to take place over the next two weeks. \nFriday’s major tasks include disconnecting cables from the Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 ahead of its relocation from the Tranquility module to the Harmony module on Sunday. The latching end of the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator will also be lubricated and computer relay boxes with commercial crew software upgrades will be replaced. NASA TV will cover the spacewalk activities live beginning Friday at 6:30 a.m. \nCosmonauts Andrey Borisenko and Oleg Novitskiy collected their blood, saliva and urine samples today for a metabolism study and an immunity experiment . Researchers will analyze these samples to learn how microgravity affects humans and provide countermeasures to keep crew members healthy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:24:56.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
