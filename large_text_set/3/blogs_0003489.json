NBA Australia \nPublished on Mar. 5, 2017 \nMar. 5, 2017 \nLooking to build on Saturday's 104-100 victory over Memphis to begin their current five-game homestand, the Dallas Mavericks returned to their own floor with hopes of avenging a previous loss this season. \nMORE: Tyler Ulis sinks buzzer-beating three as Suns steal one against Celtics \nWelcoming in MVP favorite Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks tried to move to 2-0 on their homestand. The Mavs also sought revenge for a 109-98 road loss against the Thunder back on Jan. 26, looking to return the favor on their home hardwood. And with 13-time All-Star Dirk Nowitzki moving closer to reaching 30,000 points for his career, the Mavericks (26-36) sprinted to a runaway 104-89 victory. \nSliding swingman Wesley Matthews back into the first unit after he missed two games due to a hip injury, the Mavericks tried to get off to a fast start in front of their crowd. But after surrendering a 7-2 run to start the game, the Mavs found themselves in an early uphill climb. \nSharpshooter Seth Curry then tried to ignite his team, taking charge of the Mavericks’ early scoring duties while pulling the home squad in front. A thunderous slam by Mavs leading scorer Harrison Barnes followed a short time later to get the fans out of their seats. \nNowitzki took matters from there, swishing a three-pointer from the top of the key to put the Mavericks up 16-12 with 6:19 left in the first quarter. The Thunder (35-28) quickly returned fire behind Westbrook, taking a 20-18 edge on the cat-quick guard’s spinning score with 3:51 left in the period. But despite Westbrook’s 14 first-quarter points, the Mavericks took a 28-27 edge into the second stanza. \nStarting the second period with reserve guard Devin Harris’ driving assist to backup big man Salah Mejri for a slam, the Mavs tried to create a separation on the scoreboard. Harris continued to find success off dribble penetration later in the quarter, driving the lane for a reverse layup that put the Mavericks up 34-27. \nEntering the night needing just 38 points for 30,000 in his career, Nowitzki then moved into double figures with back-to-back jumpers. Nowitzki continued to stroke the hot hand from there, answering Thunder big man Enes Kanter score for score at the other end of the floor. Barnes and Curry then lent some assistance at the offensive end, sharing the scoring responsibilities as the Mavericks took a 60-50 lead into the intermission. \nLed by Curry’s 15 first-half points on 7-of-10 shooting, the Mavericks outshot the Thunder through two quarters, 62.8 percent to 46.8 percent. The Mavs also overcame Oklahoma City’s 21-20 rebounding edge and a 38-30 scoring disadvantage in the paint, committing just three turnovers in the half. \nPutting the ball in Curry’s hands once again out of the locker room, the Mavericks continued to build on their lead early in the second half. Barnes then once again brought the fans out of their seats, throwing down an emphatic baseline dunk to highlight the third period. \nFrustration then began to boil over for Westbrook, leading to a technical foul on the perennial All-Star with 8:15 left in the quarter. Meanwhile, the Mavericks continued to build on their advantage, surging to a 76-55 lead after back-to-back triples by rookie point guard Yogi Ferrell and Matthews midway through the third. \nAnd after Westbrook was assessed a flagrant-one foul for running through Barnes with 4:27 left in the period, a pair of lob passes from Matthews and Harris to 22-year-old big man Nerlens Noel sent the Mavs into the fourth with an 88-71 margin under their belt. \nOpening the fourth with another vintage jumper by Nowitzki, the Mavericks tried to close the door on the Thunder early in the final period. The ball continued to find Nowitzki from there, leading to the 7-footer’s midrange jumper to put the Mavs up 92-74. \nThe Dallas lead surged to 95-76 after a three-point from the wing from undrafted rookie Dorian Finney-Smith a short time later. Nowitzki then turned from a score to a facilitator, driving the lane and dishing to Harris on the outside for a three-pointer to put the Mavericks up 100-82. And after Harris’ drive ended in a floater by Noel to go up by 20, the Dallas reserves put the finishing touches on the win once Mavs coach Rick Carlisle emptied his bench with 2:57 remaining. \nScoring 22 points on 10-of-16 shooting, Curry led the Mavericks to the win. Nowitzki added 18 points and 12 rebounds inside, moving just 20 points away from reaching the 30,000-platueau for his career. Barnes pitched in 17 points and five rebounds in the first unit, and Noel added 13 points and five boards off the bench. \nWestbrook led three Thunder scorers in double figures with 29 points on 8-of-24 shooting, grabbing six rebounds and dishing out five assists. But the Mavericks outshot the Thunder for the game, 48.8 percent to 40.2 percent. The Mavs also overcame the Thunder’s 49-38 rebounding advantage, converting Oklahoma City’s 15 turnovers into 13 points at the other end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T07:31:00.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
