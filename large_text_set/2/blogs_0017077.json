The Purple and Gold standard dictated that…it was time for a change,\" Buss said , via Spectrum's Mike Trudell. “This was a difficult decision. I probably waited too long. For that I apologize to Lakers fans.\" The Lakers announced their front office restructuring earlier Tuesday, which ranks among the largest shake-ups in recent franchise history. Kupchak had been part of the Lakers' front office since 1986, serving as Jerry West's right-hand man before taking over as general manager. Jim Buss had been formally a member of the front office since 1998 and had taken over a more active role in decision-making since the passing of Buss family patriarch, Jerry, in 2013. Johnson will have control over selecting the Lakers' next general manager, who will handle most of the NBA 's intricacies. He said he wants to pick a GM who \"u nderstands the CBA, salary cap and the new NBA\" and has \"relationships already with teams, players and agents.\" “I’ve already started. It’s not about quick, it’s about finding the right person who understands the new CBA,\" Johnson said on the search for Kupchak's replacement. Johnson's first order of business will be Thursday's NBA trade deadline. He said he plans on working with remaining members of the Lakers front office, including Ryan and Jesse Buss, the younger sons of Jerry, and Joey West, Jerry West's son. Many of the discussions as Johnson is getting acclimated to the job will center on Louis Williams, perhaps the Lakers' most tradeable veteran asset. Johnson said it will \"take a lot\" for the Lakers to move him before the deadline. Perhaps most promising to Lakers fans will be Johnson's seeming long-term vision. He said ( via TNT's David Aldridge ) he did not want to \"fool\" fans into thinking this would be a quick turnaround. Johnson also went on to praise coach Luke Walton as the right person to lead the team into the future and boast about the Lakers' collection of young assets. \"We have a lot of nice, young pieces on this team. And we've got to develop those pieces. And I love Luke,\" Johnson said (via the Lakers on Twitter). \" We have really good, young talent. We have to develop that young talent. I'm looking forward to getting out on the court with them.\" Like the new article format? !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:33:47.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
