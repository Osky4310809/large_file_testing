Send it to By Jennifer Picht Posted: Friday March 24 2017, 10:53am Photograph: Courtesy CC/Flickr/ Steam Pipe Trunk Distribution \nAccording to officials, an Amtrak train traveling to D.C. derailed after leaving Penn Station earlier this morning. The Acela Express 2151, which was dispatched from Boston, left Penn Station around 9am and reeled off the tracks shorty after. According to witnesses, the train sideswiped a New Jersey Transit train when it lurched off the tracks. \nIt has been reported that all 248 passengers and crew members left the rear of the train safely but at least three people suffered minor injuries. However, FDNY officials are still scoping out the scene. \nAs a result of the incident, Amtrak service in and out of Penn Station is delayed and NJ Transit has suspended its service. Check back with updates. \nh/t DNAinfo \nAll rail service in/out of NY Penn suspended due to a derailed Amtrak train.
