PUBLISHED: 07:44,   08:08, Wed, Jan 18, 2017 \nOn Tuesday Theresa May offered up her 12-point plan for Brexit , which includes offering both houses of parliament a vote in 2019. \nHowever, there is uncertainty over what action No 10 will take if the Commons rejects the Government’s Brexit deal and whether it will mean Britain remaining   or leaving with no clear plan in place. \nSky News anchor Sarah-Jane Mee asked Mr Davis: “If in two years time when this vote goes to Parliament and they vote against it what would happen?” \nA clearly irritated Mr Davis responded: “We don’t intend to vote against it, the whole point of this is to get a good deal…” \nInterrupting Mee said: “But that is the whole point of a vote, you don’t know which way it is going to go!” SKY NEWS David Davis defended   strategy on Sky News Related articles Boris SLAMS critics of May & praises PM's 'clear' Brexit speech \nMr Davis snapped: “Let me finish the point. We are optimistic we are going to get a good deal. \n“We have been very clear about the deal we are looking for. WE have designed a deal which we think will get the support of a very large people who voted to Remain as well as those who voted to leave. \n“The aim is to get as much of the country behind us as we can. \n“And we are confident that we will win that vote at the end.” \nOnce again Mee asked what would happen if the Government did fail to win the vote, given that a majority of MPs campaigned for Remain during last year’s referendum.
