News18 has called it a win for BJP in Uttarakhand. \nCounting trends reveal a clear majority for BJP with 54 seats. Congress, the incumbent party in the state, leads in just 13 seats. Uttarakhand has always seen an anti-incumbency wave in the state but the scale of this victory reveals that the Narendra Modi-wave has spread throughout the state. File image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. AFP \nIt is first time in history that one party has managed to attain such a high lead. It is likely that demonetisation and OROP issue have helped BJP to build on voters' faith. Development was another issue that made people vote in their favour. \nHarish Rawat, who worked as a one man army for Congress, couldn't stand up to BJP’s aggressive strategy. It seems that the inner differences have proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Grand Old Party. \nWhat helped BJP win in Uttarakhand? \nThe victory would prove that the charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has worked and that BJP left no stone unturned to ensure its victory. \nIt was important to win in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh after losing the 2015 Bihar Assembly election. This win should be enough to quieten those who were saying that Modi’s influence was fading. \nIntensive campaigning and star-studded, high voltage rallies have proved to be successful in turning the voter's mind in BJP’s favour. It is clear that Modi's development funda has worked. \nIt is clear that the Kedarnath reconstruction and permanent capital in Gairsain, the major poll issues for Congress, have not managed to influence the voters as BJP has been successful in drawing the lines between development versus corruption in the state. \nThe prime minister had constantly reminded the voters about demonetisation, OROP and surgical strikes and other work done by BJP government in the Centre. \nPossible CM Candidates \nHarish Rawat has constantly played the victim card in the run up to the election, highlighting the fact that the BJP government at the Centre ignored the state, and also tried to derail his government by triggering a constitutional crisis. \nVijay Bahuguna , the former Congress leader was the previous chief minister of the hill state, and the person most likely to become CM again if the BJP does secure a victory. \nBC Khanduri , the a two-time chief minister of Uttarakhand, ascending to the post for a two-year period immediately following BJP's win in the 2007 Assembly election. \nRamesh Pokhriyal is another former chief minister of the BJP, who is contesting the polls this year and has hopes of ascending to the CM's throne. \nAjay Bhatt has been state BJP president since the summer of last year, when nine Congress rebels joined the party. \nFollow the Uttarakhand Election Result 2017 LIVE \n 12  12 am Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T12:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T07:46:58.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
