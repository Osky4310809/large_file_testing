Got it! \nClick the heart, it's called favoriting. Favorite the stuff you like. Got it! ✉ Email \nThe freezer! \nThe mini Dove bars are in the freezer, and my brother can fit two in his mouth at once. No brain freeze or anything. Advertisement \nUpon bolting into my grandparents' house, that's the first thing he does—as an eight-year-old, a twenty-year-old, and, I predict, as a thirty-five-year-old, too. \nSilly brother, to fill up on Dove bars before the really good stuff. That always comes later, when we're sitting in the living room, schmoozing. On neat trays, nestled into mini muffin tins—paper or metallic, whatever Grandma has on hand—are pecan bars (a mini pecan pie, each one) and, for the real prize, marshmallow-topped brownies portioned into two-bite pieces (one-bite, if you're my brother). ♥ + Grandma Joan's Marshmallow Brownies by Sarah Jampel \nIn a house full of treats—crystal bowls of chocolate-covered almonds , a perpetually half-full Jelly Belly dispenser (the age of those beans, I dare not consider), rugelach from who knows where, plastic tubs of toffee from Costco, every cereal a kid could dream of—nothing beat the brownies. They more than made up for all the dinners of egg salad and hummus, both meant to be eaten with a spoon ( the vegetarian option, as far as Grandma was concerned).

Those are partially melted when a thick, hot fudge-like frosting, made from more unsweetened baking chocolate melted with more marshmallows, is poured over top. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Photo by James Ransom \nThe result is a very sweet and rich, triple-layer bar: sturdy bottom; mounds of airy marshmallows with their rounded butts towards the sky; chocolate sauce that sets to a smooth, truffle-like consistency in the fridge. \nYou can tell by now that these are sugary and rich and very chocolatey. I would not recommend giving them to your children if you're about to spend time in an enclosed space, like an airplane. (My parents were brave.) \nSo keep close tabs on the brownies and cut them small, like Grandma does. The good news: You can eat more of them this way.
