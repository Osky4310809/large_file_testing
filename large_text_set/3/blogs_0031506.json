Of course we will miss him, but he and my brother and sister watched our mother fade slowly from cancer many years ago and we would not want that for him,\" he told the Irish Independent. Mr Ryan’s workshop, where he built his own plane and was working on a new project. Photo: Gerry Mooney \n\"He built the plane in the back garden over a 15-year period, and in the end he had to get a crane to lift it out before he brought it to Waterford. \n\"He would go and fly it many times, it was his passion. His current passion was a gyrocopter he had started building. He was always making things or taking things apart,\" he added. \nDavid Snr had also embraced the computer age and was using a 3D printer to print things he scanned, using a 3D scanner he had built himself. \n\"Himself and his brother Gerry started flying in the 1970s out at an airfield near Dublin Airport,\" David Jr explained. \nFlair \n\"But then he began building his own plane, the one he died in. It kept him going after our mother Betty died 17 years ago because he needed something to focus on,\" he added. \nMr Ryan's home is testament to his creative flair, with tools and gadgets lying on benches and tables in the property. \nDavid Sr and Betty had two other children - Gillian, who still lives in Ireland, and Robbie, a well-respected cinematographer who mainly resides in London. \nDavid Jr lived with his father and described how he got the news of his father's death. \n\"I was here working on the computer when I saw two figures at the door. When I answered it I saw they were two gardaí from Donnybrook. They were very good about it. \n\"I used to worry a bit about dad, but he was a great man who was full of energy and enthusiasm. It's odd but Monday was a day I wasn't worrying about him at all,\" he said. \n\"Dad was able to put out a distress call, and the investigators think he developed trouble with the engine. Their investigation will find all that out,\" he added. \n\"He had survived prostate cancer and beaten a kidney ailment as well. He would go to the Cannes film festival with Robbie and be partying with all the stars. Incredible really. A great guy,\" he said. \n\"We would appeal to anyone who may have witnessed this aircraft yesterday to contact us on (058) 48600 to help our inquiries,\" a Garda spokesperson said. Investigations into the crash continue. Irish Independent", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:22:17.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
