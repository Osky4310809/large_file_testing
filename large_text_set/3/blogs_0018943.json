Theresa May \nDavid Lidington, a government minister who is the leader of the lower House of Commons, told the chamber that a police officer had been stabbed on the parliamentary estate and that armed police had shot the alleged attacker in response, adding that there had been “reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity”. \nUnconfirmed media reports said the attacker mowed people down on the bridge in a car before veering towards the parliament building and ramming the railings surrounding the grounds. He got out and attacked the police officer before he was shot. \nReports said the attacker was carrying a large knife. \nOne woman was killed, according to medics cited by local media, and several suffered “catastrophic” injuries. \n– How did authorities respond? – \nParliament was put on lockdown, with lawmakers and staff ordered to remain inside. \nDowning Street said Prime Minister Theresa May was safe, and she was seen getting into a car and being driven away from the parliament where she had been holding her weekly question-and-answer session a couple of hours earlier. \nTelevision pictures showed a red air ambulance landing on the grass square opposite the parliament building and other emergency vehicles swarming nearby roads. \nWestminster Bridge and the Westminster Underground station which serves parliament and the surrounding political district, were closed off. \n– What is known about the attacker? – \nFor the moment, very little. Witness reports, which could not be immediately confirmed, described a middle-aged man of Asian appearance who was carrying a large knife. \n– Has anything like this happened in London before? – \nLondon’s transport system was hit by four co-ordinated suicide bomb attacks in July 2005 that left 52 people dead, carried out by British attackers inspired by Al-Qaeda terror network. There was an attempted second wave of attacks two weeks later. \nIn 2013, two Islamic extremists killed soldier Lee Rigby on a London street by hitting him with a car before attempting to behead him. \nLast August, a paranoid schizophrenic knifeman who tried to behead a commuter in a London Underground station in an Islamic State-inspired attack was sentenced to life behind bars. \nIn terms of attacks on parliament, Airey Neave — the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary and a close friend of Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher — was killed by an Irish National Liberation Army car bomb in the House of Commons car park.​​ \nThe latest incident comes with Europe on high alert after a series of deadly jihadist attacks, including the Brussels bombings exactly a year ago on March 22, 2016.
