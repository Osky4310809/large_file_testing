I thought of that often today when, for reasons I still do not understand (was it a Lenten observance?), I subjected myself to the hours-long House Intelligence Committee questioning of FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers.\nYes, it was a spectacle. But not in the way I had assumed. I didn’t learn anything I did not already know about the so-called (mis-called) “Russian Hacking” meme that the Democrats are so eager to disseminate.\nBut I did learn something about the possibilities for political grandstanding that such meetings afford. Democratic Representative after Democratic Representative used his or her time not so much to ask question but to deliver little sermons on the perfidy of Donald Trump and various people associated with his campaign or administration (Rex Tillerson, Mike Flynn, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Carter Page, et al.).\nIt wasn’t quite “ Are you now or have you ever been . . .” but it was close. You don’t have to have that good a memory to have found the whole exercise amusing: Democratic politicians abandoning the “ 1980s asking for its foreign policy back ” in order, suddenly, to castigate Russia as a threat to US national security and even (if you can believe it) wrapping themselves in the flag of patriotism (yes, really) to denounce Donald Trump.\nMy own feeling is that the Dems must be very, very worried to go down that street. And what did it all add up to? Nada. Which is to say, rien. Nichts. Zilch. Nothing.\nRussia was trying to influence the U.S. election. So what else is new? As Director Rogers noted, they been doing that for “decades.”\nThe Russians hacked the DNC and funneled some of John Podesta’s emails to Wikileaks. Embarrassing to Mr. Podesta, no doubt, since they revealed that the DNC really was in Hillary’s pocket and was tilting the campaign against Bernie Sanders. But the Russians also tried to hack the RNC, but the RNC had better security. so that didn’t go anywhere.\nThe Russians don’t like Hillary: so what? Neither do I.\nThere is no evidence, none, that the Russian’s did anything to change votes or affect the outcome of the election.\nThe Intelligence Community is pursuing an investigation into the whole subject but so far has come up with nothing — zilch — to suggest that there was any collusion or “coordination” (Director Comey’s preferred word) between the Trump world and the Russians.\nSo far, too, there is no evidence to support Donald Trump’s Twitter claim that he had been “tapped” by Obama, though the fuzziness of that claim and the huge amount of surveillance in play means that we really don’t yet have a definitive answer to the question, Were Trump or his associates put under surveillance by the Obama administration?\nhttps://pjmedia.com/rogerkimball/2017/03/20/the-nothing-burger-gets-flipped/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDC4Keawv6U", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS2a44F5TgM", "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/03/02/ted_cruz_sessions_meeting_with_russian_ambassador_a_nothing_burger.html", "https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2017/03/20/four-key-takeaways-from-the-house-intelligence-committees-hearings-on-russia-n2301697"], "published": "2017-03-21T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:12:53.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
