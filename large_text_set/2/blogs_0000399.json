They stretch out over time and don’t exactly snap back into shape after a laundry cycle, which means most women are walking around wearing the wrong bra size . But there’s a simple way to figure out if your undergarment actually fits you , and it will save you a ton of hassle the next time you’re shopping for lingerie or deciding whether or not to toss an old standby.\nAccording to Nicole Kivitz a rep for French underwear brand Chantelle , you should be able to fit only two fingers between your back and the band of your bra — any more and your bra is too big.\n“Because 80% of your support is from your band, it should be tight,” Kivitz told Insider . “Most women are actually smaller than they think they are.”\nA photo posted by Denise Bidot (@denisebidot) on Sep 6, 2016 at 7:38pm PDT \nWhen you first buy a bra, says Kivitz, the band should be tight when wearing it on the outermost hook; use the two-finger test to determine if it’s the right size. As it stretches out, you can shift closer to the innermost hook — always using the two-finger method to test fit — and once it’s completely stretched out and on the last hook, it’s time to toss that puppy.\nA photo posted by Chantelle Paris (@chantelle_paris) on Oct 3, 2014 at 1:42am PDT \nOf course, if a super-tight band feels awful to you, you definitely don’t have to follow this rule; it’s a suggestion that will offer you increased support, but you should always listen your own body. Let us know if the two-finger test works for you!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:22:28.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
