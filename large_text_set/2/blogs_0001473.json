We’re still completely enamored by the standalone film, months after its release. Alex Benetel, an Australian photographerm, is now giving us a new Star Wars gift to swoon over. Benetel was lucky enough to be asked by Disney and Instagram to take photos on the set of Rogue One and the pictures are ~truly~ stunning. \nOf the experience, which took place in London in 2015, Benetel revealed that she was the only photographer outside the United States and Canada to attend. As she explained to PetaPixel, “It was an unforgettable, once in a lifetime opportunity. There were only four of us invited and I was the only photographer outside of the U.S. and Canada.” \nCheck out some of the stunning shots: \n\"To strike back\" 'Two Tubes' on the planet Jedha, in front of a crashed X-wing. Last year, thanks to @disneystudios, @starwarsmovies and @instagram I got to visit the set of #RogueOne to take some photographs. It was probably the most surreal, amazing, incredible, out of this world thing I've ever done!! Here is one of the main shots I took on my first day. I actually got to exhibit this piece in front of Gareth Edwards (see my Insta story) last Saturday. The set was absolutely incredible. More photos to come soon!! Only 10 more days until the film is released in the US - (8 in Aus) make sure to book your tickets.
