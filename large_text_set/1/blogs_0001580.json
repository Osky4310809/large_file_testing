They also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) under which these chambers would share information with each other and hold at least four joint meetings of these chambers annually. A large number of the members of these chambers were also present. \nThe meeting decided that the chambers’ presidents would also hold an exclusive meeting with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to share their concerns over the Chinese industrial units along the CPEC route. It regretted the government had not taken the chambers in confidence over the issue.\nMr Abrar Saeed said the accounts of those businessmen who were in the tax net should not be sealed, nor the FBR officials should be given access to their accounts. He said such actions of the FBR were causing disillusionment among the businessmen with regard to the PML-N government.\nMr Bhutta said the local manufacturers’ concerns over the CPEC’s possible effects on the local industry should be addressed forthwith, apprehending that such a situation might hit exports from these cities.\nHe also sought establishment of new varsities’ campuses at such locations in the region that suited these three cities where the industry wanted to benefit from these institutions in terms of research, innovative ideas and human resource.\nThe chambers’ presidents also sought easing of China’s visa policy for local businessmen.\nPublished in Dawn January 2nd, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T09:05:29.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
