He swims in lies to such an extent that he makes “conventional” politicians look lily-white by comparison. He degrades the office of the Presidency, and I don’t say that as a “libtard,” but as a patriotic American. So it’s…nice to see this cowardly bully get a reminder of what America’s about from a truly tough guy (and fellow conservative). \nFor more good times, this from recently: Trump vs SNL: “It is a totally one-sided, biased show.” Here’s Alec Baldwin’s response. \nTrump, continuing to degrade our country, offered the usual bluster: \n“Arnold Schwarzenegger got ‘swamped’ (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT,” Trump tweeted, referring to himself in the third person. “So much for … being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14.

It inspired me every day I was Governor, and I hope it inspires you. pic.twitter.com/QRoOFTZfQ9 \n— Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) January 6, 2017 \nWe are not enemies. We are all Americans. \nArnold, whatever his pluses and minuses, clearly gets what America is truly about. Imagine Trump saying these words. Feeling these feelings. Reacting in this way.
