The article is called Treehouse Partners with Microsoft for the Release of Visual Studio 2017 and is located at http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/treehouse-partners-microsoft-release-visual-studio-2017. Captcha Submit \nOn March 7th and 8th, Microsoft will host a special online event to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Visual Studio and the release of Visual Studio 2017. Day one (3/7) will feature keynotes from Julia Liuson, Brian Harry, Miguel de Icaza, and Scott Hanselman along with interactive technical demo sessions with Microsoft engineers. Day two (3/8) will feature a full day of live interactive training organized into two tracks. \nTreehouse is excited to partner with Microsoft to deliver two sessions as part of the Web Development with Visual Studio 2017 track on Wednesday March 8th (see below for more information). 20 Years of Visual Studio \n20 years ago, Microsoft released the first version of Visual Studio. The first version of Visual Studio combined Visual Basic, Visual C++, Visual J++, Visual FoxPro, and Visual InterDev into one single product. \nOver the years, Visual Studio has grown and matured into a truly amazing IDE (integrated development environment). Today, Visual Studio supports a wide range of languages (C#, VB.NET, C++, F#, JavaScript, Python, SQL, etc.) and allows developers to create applications for the Web, Windows, mobile devices (including iOS, Android, and Windows Phone), Azure, Office, IoT (Internet of Things), and more. Me and Visual Studio \n16 years ago, I started my journey as a developer learning Microsoft’s “Classic” ASP (Active Server Pages) and SQL Server. In the beginning, I used Windows Notepad as my editor and eventually graduated to an editor called TextPad . Life seemed good. But then Microsoft introduced the .NET Framework and Visual Studio .NET. \nDeveloping web applications using ASP.NET and Visual Studio was nothing short of a revelation. Features like IntelliSense, static compilation, and local interactive debugging (just to mention a few) allowed me to create more powerful applications with less effort. Visual Studio still remains an indispensable part of my developer’s toolbox, which now also includes other members of the Visual Studio family, like Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio for Mac . Visual Studio Launch Event Training Sessions \nTreehouse is honored to be partnering with Microsoft to create training for the launch of Visual Studio 2017. I’ll be presenting two sessions as part of the Web Development with Visual Studio 2017 track on Wednesday March 8th. Getting Started with ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio 2017 \nMarch 8th at 9:00am \nASP.NET Core is an open-source (github.com/aspnet/home) and cross-platform framework for building modern web apps using .NET. It is a significant redesign of ASP.NET that is built from the ground up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux. \nIn this module, we’ll create a simple app using both the .NET Core command-line interface (CLI) and the latest tooling available in Visual Studio 2017. Along the way, we’ll also take a look at some of the key new concepts and features that are part of ASP.NET Core and how they compare to the ASP.NET that you know and love. Additional Treehouse Resources and Demo Code \nCode for all of the demos shown in this module will be made available via GitHub . \nWant to learn more about ASP.NET Core? Check out my Treehouse workshop Getting Started with ASP.NET Core (available only to Pro subscribers). Exploring and Migrating to TypeScript \nMarch 8th at 10:00am \nTypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It can help you be more productive and write higher quality code. That’s all great, but migrating an existing JavaScript project to TypeScript can seem like a daunting proposition. \nLuckily, benefitting from TypeScript doesn’t require you to migrate your entire project to TypeScript. You can benefit from TypeScript by making incremental changes to your project. \nIn this module, you’ll learn the basics of the TypeScript language and how to incrementally migrate a project to TypeScript. You’ll also see how Visual Studio 2017 leverages the TypeScript Language Service to provide a rich JavaScript development experience including features such as symbol-based navigation, statement completion, and code refactoring. And you’ll see how to use JSDoc comments and TypeScript Declaration (d.ts) files to refine the TypeScript Language Service’s understanding of your code. Additional Treehouse Resources and Demo Code \nCode for all of the demos shown in this module will be made available via GitHub . \nWant to learn more about JavaScript and ES2015?
