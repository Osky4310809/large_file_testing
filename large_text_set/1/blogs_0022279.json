The second-year forward had the look of an all-star once again, flirting with a triple-double and finishing with 23 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. \nAttached to the balanced stat line were the usual batch of highlight reel plays. Midway through the third quarter, Jokic fought off a Jazz defender and pulled down a defensive rebound with one hand. He pushed the ball up the court himself and dropped a perfect pass on the wing to Danilo Gallinari , who finished in stride with a double-pump dunk. The play gave the Nuggets a 63-47 lead. \nUtah stormed back in the fourth quarter, trimming a lead that had grown to as large as 17 points to 92-88 on a Boris Diaw jump shot with 2:48 left. \nThen Jokic answered again. He was fouled on a tough layup inside and completed the three-point play to put the Nuggets up 97-88. Jameer Nelson , who finished with 17 points, hit a 3-pointer on the next possession, allowing Nuggets fans holding their collective breath to exhale. \nThe Jazz had their hearts ripped out Monday night when Oklahoma City star Russell Westbrook buried a game-winning shot with 1.4 seconds remaining, and Utah arrived in Denver early Tuesday morning to play its fourth game in five days. \nThe Jazz looked anything but fatigued in the opening minutes, building a 22-10 lead with its trademark defensive energy. Former University of Colorado standout Alec Burks provided a spark of the bench during Utah’s early run, punctuating a lob pass with thunderous dunk and scoring six quick points. \nThen the Nuggets found some fire from their own bench. \nDarrell Arthur nailed three 3-pointers in 98 seconds spanning the end of the first quarter and start of the second. Arthur was so hot that Utah guard Joe Ingles overplayed Arthur’s fourth 3-point attempt. The veteran made all three free-throw attempts, sparking a 25-7 run to end the second quarter that gave the Nuggets a 51-39 halftime lead. \nNuggets coach Michael Malone said before Tuesday’s game that a successful quest for a playoff spot in the Western Conference would hinge on his team becoming “an average defensive team instead of a below-average defensive team.” \nDenver looked a little better than average through big stretches against the Jazz, holding Utah to 33 percent (15-of-45) shooting in the first half. \nArthur finished with 16 points and eight rebounds. Derrick Favors led the Jazz with 18 points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T07:01:41.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
