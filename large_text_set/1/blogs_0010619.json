When Swami Om made a comment about her mother, earlier in the show, she boycotted him and didn't speak to him till the day that he was evicted. She is super touchy when it comes to her mother, and all the housemates know it really well. \nDuring a luxury budget task, this week, housemates were asked to call each other and vent our their frustration. In the first half Bani called Lopamudra Raut, and gave her a piece of her mind, and when the roles were reversed in the second half, Lopa did the same to Bani. However she want a step ahead, and said something nasty about Bani's mother which caused Bani to flare up. They both ended up having a massive fight, and Bani kicked Lopa in anger. \nLopa didn't react, and she hasn't asked Bigg Boss to take action against her either. \nWith two weeks left, we wonder if the makers will decide to punish Bani for her act of violence (a clear brech of the rules), or just let things be. Do you think she should be asked to leave? Photo credits: Voot", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T19:13:47.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
