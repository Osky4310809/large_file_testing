Today, at an event in New Delhi, the company has officially launched the mobile payment platform in the country. It is the first platform of its kind in India, as Android Pay and Apple Pay are yet to launch in the country. \nSamsung Pay is a Magnetic Secure Transmission and NFC-based service. It allows users to make contactless payments at PoS terminals. At the moment, the service only supports a handful of devices including the Galaxy S7 , Galaxy S7 edge , Galaxy Note 5 , Galaxy S6 edge+ , Galaxy A5 (2016) and Galaxy A7 (2016) . To make a payment, the user simply has to open the app, select the card, authenticate the purchase using a pin or fingerprint, and then place it near one of the machines at a PoS terminal. \nSamsung Pay works with most credit cards, debit cards and UPI. It also lets you use digital wallets like Paytm to make payments. Samsung says the service is extremely secure, and card numbers and details are not stored on the phone. Samsung also announced launch offers for the Samsung Pay service. They include a 20 percent discount at Pizza Hut, 15 percent at Barista, exclusive discounts at Cafe Coffee Day, and complimentary popcorn and beverages at INOX. Also, you’ll get a five percent cashback and 5X points on HDFC cards, Rs 100 cashback on SBI cards, 20 percent cashback on Standard Chartered, and Rs 200 and a free movie ticket with Paytm.
