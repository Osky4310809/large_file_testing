to open the 2017 IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. (Photo: Michael L. Levitt/LAT Images) Michael L. Levitt/© Michael L. Levitt LAT Images www.latphoto.co.uk Mar 18, 2017 at 10:51p ET 0Shares \nRicky Taylor edged out Joao Barbosa to give Wayne Taylor Racing and Cadillac victory in the Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring and a sweep of the “Florida 36 Hours” with wins in North America’s two premier endurance races. \nTaylor took his Konica Minolta-backed No. 10 Cadillac DPi-V.R to victory over Barbosa’s Action Express entry, following a race-long battle between the two Cadillacs. \nWhile it was, at times, a near mirror-image to January’s Rolex 24 at Daytona, there was no late-race contact or drama, with the Taylor car stretching out its lead as darkness hit. \nThe race-winning pass came with less than three hours remaining when Jordan Taylor got around Filipe Albuquerque for the lead in traffic. \nA call to short-pit the No. 10 Cadillac with 1 hour and 8 minutes to go, just moments prior to the race’s sixth and final full-course caution, kept Ricky Taylor out ahead and en route to victory. \nIt was the Taylor brother’s second consecutive IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship victory, and the first for new third driver Alex Lynn, in his team and series debut. \nBarbosa, Albuquerque and Christian Fittipaldi were forced to settle for second for the second straight race, with the sister No. 31 Whelen-backed entry giving Cadillac a sweep of the overall podium. \nIt came after a charge through the field for defending Prototype champions Dane Cameron, Eric Curran and third driver Mike Conway, after Curran spun the car from the lead in the third hour and lost two laps when it failed to re-fire. \nThe incident initially promoted the No. 85 JDC-Miller Motorsports Oreca 07 Gibson to third, and ran in podium contention for much of the race before setting for fourth, \nThe around-the-clock enduro proved to be a test of endurance for the majority of Prototype competitors. \nThe pole-sitting No. 13 Rebellion Racing Oreca 07 Gibson, who showed the most promise to dethrone the Cadillacs, battled electrical issues, leading to an alternator change and multiple trips to the garage. \nBoth of the Tequila Patron ESM Nissan Onroak DPis retired, first the No. 22 car due to a broken exhaust after running as high as fourth, followed by the No. 2 entry, which went behind the wall early with the continuation of boost-related issues from qualifying. \nWhile the No. 55 Mazda RT24-P recorded a fifth place class finish, following a trip to the garage to repair a coolant leak, brake issues led to a crash easy by Joel Miller, which later rejoined only to be retired due to suspension issues. \nShifting issues, meanwhile, plagued the No. 52 PR1/Mathiasen Motorsports Ligier JS P217 Gibson, which soldiered home to 7th in class, behind the No. 90 Visit Florida Racing Riley Mk. 30 Gibson after multiple trips to the garage with engine and starter motor gremlins. \nPrototype Challenge class honors went to the No. 38 Performance Tech Motorsports Oreca FLM09 of James French, Pato O’Ward and Kyle Masson, finishing an impressive sixth overall. \nIt came in another flawless run for the Brent O’Neill-led team, which as was the case with the Taylor car, scored back-to-back wins. \nFrench crossed the line two laps ahead of the No. 8 Starworks entry of Garett Grist, Maxwell Hanratty and Sean Rayhall, a lineup that was only confirmed on Thursday. \nThe pair of BAR1 Motorsports cars, including the class pole-sitting No. 26 entry, faced setbacks, although both also got to the finish. \nRemarkably, all four of the PC entries had clean races on-track, with no notable incidents. \nIn GTLM, Antonio Garcia put in a starring drive once the sun went down, keeping a brace of Ford GT’s at bay in the final hours to claim the 2017 Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring GT Le Mans crown. \nThe No. 3 Corvette C7.R of Garcia, Jan Magnussen, and Mike Rockenfeller was strong all race after qualifying fifth but came to life in the final hours. The Corvette Racing team used clever pit strategy to catapult to the lead with just over an hour remaining and held off all comers to take home a third consecutive Sebring win. \nIt is the first time a team has claimed three consecutive class wins since Level 5 Motorsports won four consecutive races in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. \nIt was not a straightforward run to the finish in GTLM, as Patrick Pilet’s No. 911 Porsche 911 RSR was consistently the fastest car on track in the night portion of the race, only to be sidelined in the late running. \nPilet had chased down Garcia and begun to apply pressure to the race leader when he abruptly dove into the pits with 31 minutes remaining after suffering a puncture, then compounded the problem when he ran over the air hose leaving his pit stall. \nThe ensuing drive-through penalty knocked Pilet out of contention for the win, and he settled for seventh. \nEven after the demise of the No. 911 Porsche, Garcia still had to fend off Joey hand in the No. 66 Ford GT in the final half hour. \nHand and co-drivers Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais were seeking a Sebring win to go along with their titles at Le Mans and Daytona, but were forced to settle for the second step on the podium. \nThird place went to James Calado in the No. 62 Risi Competizione Ferrari. \nJeroen Bleekemolen secured victory for Riley Team AMG in the No. 33 Mercedes-AMG GT3 after a dominant run throughout the 12-hour race. \nFrom seventh place on the grid, Bleekemolen and co-drivers Ben Keating and Mario Farnbacher swiftly moved up through the field and proved the be the combination to beat in the early going. \nThe only drama in the final hours came when the field was slowed for the final full course caution of the race, bunching up a tight GTD field and forcing all of the leaders to make their final pit stops together. \nThe Riley team turned the car around with a rapid stop and Bleekemolen quickly built a gap en-route to a 4.453-second win over the No. 63 Scuderia Corse Ferrari 488 GT3 of Alessandro Balzan, Christina Nielsen, and Matteo Cressoni. \nThe battle for third turned on its head in the head in the final minutes when Jeroen Mul ran off track in the final minutes and Tristan Vautier came from nowhere to take the final spot of the podium in the pole-sitting Mercedes for SunEnergy1. \nChristopher Mies took fourth in the Land Motorsport Audi R8 LMS, while Mul slid all the way back to 11th in class in the No. 16 Change Racing Lamborghini Huracan GT3. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T05:02:04.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
