She was paid about $20 every other week to provide around-the-clock care. \nProsecutors say she was swindled out of about $205 000 in wages, though the attorney for the Ibechems says they also sent money to her family in Nigeria. \nThe Ibechems agreed to pay the nanny $50 000 as part a plea deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:35:01.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
