Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGeorginio Wijnaldum believes Liverpool have sent “an important message” to their Champions’ League rivals... but must now back it up with top-four level consistency. \nAfter a nightmare three Anfield defeats in a week trashed their hopes of any silverware this season, the Reds hit back with a fine display against runaway leaders Chelsea and were unlucky to only draw rather than take a much-needed victory. \nMidfielder Wijnaldum though, believes it shows his team are back to their intense best, and now he wants his team-mates to back it up by addressing their biggest weakness this season – against the less fancied teams. \nLiverpool visit struggling Hull at the weekend, and the Dutchman who scored their equaliser on Tuesday said of the battling draw against Chelsea: “Of course it was an important message.

That’s the most important thing. If you do it one game and then not the next, it will cost you points. We saw in January that if you are not sharp, if you don’t play how we used to play, it will cost us points.” Liverpool hopes were high as Wijnaldum's goal beat Man City...
