Commandos of the Naval Special Operations Group (NAVSOG), the elite special warfare unit of the Navy, were deployed to secure the Miss Universe candidates and other participants during their trip to a beach resort in Batangas yesterday. \nThe NAVSOG members escorted the beauty queens that also included Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach during their visit to Navy headquarters in Manila and also provided security to the yacht that the contestants boarded on their way to the Pico de Loro Beach and Country Club in Nasugbu, Batangas. \nNavy officials said the security and accommodation it gave the candidates of the Miss Universe 2016 pageant were “a manifestation of the support and commitment to the tourism initiatives of the national government that promote positive image of the country and help boost its economy.” \nThe beauty queens assembled at the Navy headquarters along Roxas Blvd. before they boarded the yacht M/Y Happy Life that was docked at the Commodore Divino Pier. \nOfficers, enlisted personnel and civilian employees were given a brief opportunity to see the beauty queens from various parts of the world in person. \nNavy chief Vice Admiral Ronald Joseph Mercado led naval personnel in welcoming the Miss Universe candidates and pageant organizers, who were accorded military honors upon their arrival.   \nThe Navy said sailors also lined the edges of the pier, demonstrating the traditional “manning the rail,” a method of saluting or rendering honor as the beauty queens passed to board the yacht owned by former Ilocos Sur governor Chavit Singson. \nWurtzbach and Singson were joined by 16 candidates during the visit to Batangas, which is part of the journey of the delegates across the country in the lead-up to the pageant night at the Mall of Asia Arena on Jan. 30. \nThe group arrived at Pico Sands Hotel around 3 p.m., more than two hours after they departed Navy headquarters aboard Singson’s yacht. \nSingson is a major sponsor in the country’s hosting of the 65th Miss Universe pageant. \nThe delegates had lunch and held a private photoshoot at the resort prior to a beach program late afternoon yesterday. \nHandcrafted neckpieces, made out of upcycled Coca-Cola pull tabs by the Artisan Women of Tondo, were presented to the candidates during the program. \nThe group was among the women economic empowerment programs supported by Coca-Cola Philippines under the 5by20 global initiative. \nCoca-Cola Philippines vice president for public affairs and communications Adel Tamano said the event was a welcome opportunity for the local artisans to showcase their products. \nIn Davao City, despite the heavy rains that welcomed another batch of Miss Universe, ethnic dancers and music greeted the candidates at around 1:30 p.m. at the international airport. \nThe candidates traveled by bus to the Eden Mountain Resort where they were treated to a sumptuous lunch. \nAfter the required pictorials at the resort, the candidates were then brought to SM Lanang Premiere where they held a fashion show wearing gowns made by local designers. \nThe Davao ancillary event of the Miss Universe pageant has Phoenix Petroleum Inc. as main sponsor. – With Janvic Mateo, Edith Regalado  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:12:08.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
