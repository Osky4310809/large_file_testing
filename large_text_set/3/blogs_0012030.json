Some high school kids wore red, white, and blue to a basketball game for a patriotic theme night. Guess what happened? They were accused of racism!! Why? Because the opposing team had immigrants on it, and the parents took their patriotism to be anti-immigrant. Nope. Not kidding. \nTruth Revolt has more: \nValley High School had a heated matchup with Des Moines North High School, but the main controversy was due to how the VHS fans dressed. Instead of wearing their school colors — orange and black — they wore patriotic colors. In fact, the students had a patriotic theme night, which they’d done many times in the past. According to IJR , “Des Moines North High School is known for its diverse student population, and critics claimed the red, white, and blue theme was a direct attack on its students who are refugees or have refugee families.” \nOne mom complained about the red, white, and blue on Facebook: \n“For the supporters of one team from a primarily white part of town to paint themselves as the ‘team of the USA’ strongly implies that the other team, the less white team, is less American.” \nAnother posted: \n“ALL participating should have been pulled and banned from ALL VHS extracurricular events for the remainder of the year! As a parent, I’d be mortified that my son or daughter thought this way, acted in this fashion and refrained from taking a stand against this 21st century inexcusable behavior!” \nTR also points that that the school actually apologized for their kids’ wardrobes: \nTo the Students and Staff of North High School: \nIt has been brought to our attention that the decision by the Valley High School student section to wear U.S.A. apparel at our game last night was offensive to members of your community and fan base. We are deeply sorry if we have offended anyone in any way. We have traditionally dressed in such a fashion for great games such as the one last night. Everyone here at Valley has immense respect not only for your team and players but for your community as a whole. Please know that our intent was in no way to offend or demean—just to support our own team in a way we have done before. \nCongratulations on a wonderful season and we wish you nothing but the best of luck in the future. \nSincerely, Valley High School Student Council Leadership \nHas it really come to this, America?
