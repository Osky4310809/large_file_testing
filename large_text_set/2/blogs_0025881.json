This is unacceptable under our Constitution, and unacceptable from a standpoint of basic human rights. This woman is critically ill and in severe pain.\" \nLorena Massoni , a member of Sara's legal team, said they're working on an appeal to get their client back to the hospital: \n\"The medical team and legal team are focused on getting Sara the medical treatment she desperately needs.\" \nWow. \nWe'll keep you updated as we learn more — but, this is just an extremely terrifying example of the lengths Drumpf and his minions are willing to go to forcibly remove people from this country . \n[ Image via Joel Ginsburg/ WENN . ] The Most Embarrassing Celebrity Social Media FAILS!
