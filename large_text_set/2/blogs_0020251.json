The longevity of South Korean women estimated in 2030 is due largely to investments in universal health care, he said. South Korea also led the list for men. \nRead More: Be Nice, Because People Who Care for Others Live Longer \n“It’s basically the opposite of what we’re doing in the West, where there’s a lot of austerity and inequality,” he said. \nEzzati and his co-authors used death and longevity trends to estimate life expectancy in 35 developed countries. The calculation is for a baby born in 2030. The study was published online Tuesday in the journal Lancet. \nWomen were ahead of men in all countries. Behind South Korea, women in France, Japan, Spain and Switzerland were projected to live until 88. For South Korea men, life expectancy is expected to reach 84. Next were Australia, Switzerland, Canada and the Netherlands at nearly 84. \nAt the bottom of the list: Macedonia for women at nearly 78, and Serbia for men at about 73. \nWhile some genetic factors might explain the longevity in certain countries, social and environmental factors were probably more important, Ezzati said. \nRead More: Sitting Too Much Ages You By 8 Years \nThe study estimated that the U.S., which already lags behind other developed countries, will fall even further behind by 2030, when men and women are projected to live to 80 and 83. American women will fall to 27th out of 35 countries, from their current ranking of 25, and men will fall from 23rd to 26th. \nThe researchers note that among rich countries, the U.S. has the highest maternal and child death rates, homicide rate and is the only high-income country without comprehensive health care. \nThe researchers also predicted how much longer 65 year olds in 2030 would live; they guessed that among men, those in Canada would live the longest, surviving another 23 years. Among 65-year-old women in 2030, they estimated that South Koreans would live the longest, another 28 years. \nRead More: AARP President: Paul Ryan’s Medicare Plan Could Hurt Seniors \nIn an accompanying commentary, Ailiana Santosa of Umea University in Sweden wrote that the projections raise “crucial issues” about which strategies are needed to tackle worsening inequality problems. \n“Achieving universal health coverage is worthy, plausible and needs to be continued,” she said. \nThe study was paid for by the U.K. Medical Research Council and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:15:28.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
