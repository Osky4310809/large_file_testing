You may remember when he live-streamed himself and a rotating group of fans watching all of his movies in reverse chronological order for three days straight. His latest, in response to today's inauguration of Donald Trump, is an even bolder stunt. He launched the \"He Will Not Divide Us\" live stream this morning at 9 AM.
