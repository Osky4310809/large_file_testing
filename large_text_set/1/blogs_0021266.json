Judging by these concept pictures, it could be the biggest makeover Apple has given the iPhone in years. Artist Imran Taylor from the Philippines has imagined how the new device will look, taking all of these rumors into account.

BTW, Apple, if you’re reading this, can we just have better battery life? Please?!
