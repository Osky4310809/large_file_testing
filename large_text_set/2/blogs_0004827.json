Marijuana legalization: What Canada can learn from the Colorado experience \nThe City of Calgary created a special panel made up of police officers, Alberta Health Services experts and Rowland to help provide council with policy advice should the bill becomes law. \nThe city's role in that new legal landscape would include oversight of retail store locations and growing operations, and handling any related nuisance complaints. \n\"The most important thing is for the city to get ahead of this so we're not caught flat-footed and we're not having to, for example, close down dispensaries that have already opened once we put in restrictions on where you can retail,\" said Mayor Naheed Nenshi. Employees trim away leaves from marijuana plants to be packaged and sold at a dispensary in Colorado. Calgary is already planning for legalized marijuana. (Associated Press) City wants say in business location \nThe mayor said city council will likely want to control where businesses selling marijuana are allowed to operate.

Maybe we just use the same rules as for the liquor stores, maybe we come up with something different.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:34:34.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
