(AP) – Officials say the first U.S. inmate to receive state-funded sex-reassignment surgery has been moved to a women’s prison.\nCalifornia corrections department spokeswoman Terry Thornton said 57-year-old Shiloh Heavenly Quine was admitted to the Central California Women’s Facility on Wednesday.\nThe prison northwest of Fresno holds about 2,900 women.\nQuine previously was at a men’s prison, although she has been living as a woman since 2009.\nThe convicted killer, who is serving a life prison sentence, underwent the surgery in December after a court settlement.\nHer case led California to become the first state to set standards for transgender inmates to apply to receive the surgery. It also led a federal magistrate to provide transgender female inmates housed in men’s facilities with items such as nightgowns, scarves and necklaces.\n \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:15:23.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
