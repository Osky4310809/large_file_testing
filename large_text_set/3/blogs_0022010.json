Environment World abandoning coal in dramatic style raises hope of avoiding dangerous global warming, says report \nDonald Trump may be planning a revival of the dirtiest of the fossil fuels, but the rest of the planet appears to be going green instead Tuesday 21 March 2017 23:58 GMT Click to followThe Independent Online Steam rises from cooling towers of a coal-fired power plant Getty Images \nAs Donald Trump pledges to put coal miners back to work in the United States, the rest of the world appears to have suddenly started moving in the opposite direction, abandoning the dirtiest of fossil fuels after 10 years of expansion, according to a new analysis. \nBoom and Bust 2017, compiled by US environmental group the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and research group CoalSwarm, reported a 62 per cent fall in the number of new coal-fired power stations being built worldwide in 2016 and a 48 per cent drop in “pre-construction activity”. \nSuch a dramatic slowdown, they argued, meant that the world could now hope to keep global warming to within two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the point at which climate change is thought would become particularly dangerous.

While this suggests at least some emissions would have to be captured in some way, Ministers have not actually decided what they level they will require. \nThe coal industry dismissed the report, insisting that renewable energy was not displacing coal in India and that China was not moving away from it – even though the number of coal-fired power stations is being reduced. \nHowever the Boom and Bust report expressed optimism that the tide was finally turning against coal. Coal power station blamed for thousands of deaths to get £10m subsidy \n“For the first time since the beginning of the global coal boom a decade ago, developments in East and South Asia – in particular China’s wide-reaching restrictions on new coal plants and India’s indication that no new coal power is needed through at least the next decade – appear to have brought global climate goals within feasible reach, raising the prospect that the worst levels of climate change might be avoided,” the report said. \n“More progress is needed and the margin for error is tight, but the results of the past year provide good reason for optimism.” \nIt said the surge in coal power stations over the past 10 years had been “a source of deep concern”. \n“The apparent likelihood that coal combustion would continue to grow for decades appeared to undermine any prospects for preventing irreversible climate change,” the report said.

One is that the Government's decision to phase out coal power is, far from being a risky move, actually putting us ahead of the pack in moving away from the dirtiest form of energy. China plans emergency measures to control worsening air pollution China plans emergency measures to control worsening air pollution 1/2 \nVice-Premier Li Keqiang says that tackling pollution would be a long-term process Getty Images 2/2 \nBAD AIR IN BEIJING \n“Secondly, it should challenge Germany and other Western nations who still rely on coal to adopt a faster timescale to close existing plants. \n“It also highlights that those claiming that it is pointless, our taking action to tackle climate change because Asian countries are still building coal stations, are increasingly wrong.” \nHowever Benjamin Sporton, who runs the World Coal Association, suggested that anyone who thought the coal industry was on its last legs was mistaken. \n“China has been a remarkable example of the role that affordable coal can play in improving access to energy and supporting economic development – the country has achieved universal energy access so has no need for a new coal station being built every week,” he said. \n“Yes, China, is reducing the number of coal-stations but not because it’s transitioning away from coal, instead the new dynamics is a signal of a more developed economy.” \nHe said China’s promises about cutting emissions to date implied coal would “continue to be central to its energy solutions albeit through efficiencies including the use of new coal technologies”. \nAnd, in India’s case, he said it was “simply not true that renewables are displacing coal”. \n“For these countries excluding coal from the energy mix is not an option – it is essential for economic growth and critical in securing energy access,” Mr Sporton said.
