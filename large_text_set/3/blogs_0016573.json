'Leadership help' \nUber has suffered a spate of controversies in 2017, the most serious being ongoing rows over a culture of sexism, and accusations of sexual harassment at the firm . \nAfter being filmed arguing with a driver over falling rates, the firm's co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick admitted he needed \"leadership help\". Earlier this month, he announced that the company was looking for a chief operating officer. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Uber CEO Travis Kalanick may also step down once the firm's new COO is in place \nThe role would have effectively demoted Mr Jones, who was not himself being considered for the position. \nIn an email to his staff on Sunday, Mr Kalanick said: \"After we announced our intention to hire a COO, Jeff came to the tough decision that he doesn't see his future at Uber. \n\"It is unfortunate that this was announced through the press, but I thought it was important to send all of you an email before providing comment publicly.\" \nThe backroom manoeuvrings suggest bigger changes at Uber are on the way. Two separate, well-placed sources at the company have told the BBC that Mr Kalanick will likely step down as chief executive soon after the new COO is in place. \nThe move will be designed to reassure investors ahead of a long-anticipated potential initial public offering. \nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC .
