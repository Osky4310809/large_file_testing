Elba looks over a valley. A young boy stands in the woods. A cloud takes of New York City. Folks with flames run through alley ways. Man in Black throws a jacket off, Elba looks poised. Matthew hears voices in the woods. He draws to guns. The Man in Black questions if he is ready for what's coming. He shoots at him but the Man in Black catches it and says, \"The tower will fall, Roland.\" The young boy wakes up in bed. He's talking to a therapist. He's drawing a man in black and sees the \"Dark Tower.\" The therapists insists that Jake's vision isn't real, until he is startled whn the room shakes. Jake knows he is supposed to do something, but not what. He creeps through an abandoned house until he finds a portal to a desolate world. The Gunslinger finds him. Jake shows him a drawing. The Gunslinger is seen shooting at a mythical element. The Man in Black emerges through a portal and is seen waling down Broadway. The Gunslinger promises he is dangerous. Man in Black kills a man by touching his face. Action sequences ensure, including impressive reloading sequence. Lights overtake the New York City sky. The Gunslinger promises to kill the Man in Black. The fight. The Man in Black moves shards of glass with his mind. Later, Jake is taken in a burning village. The gunslinger is behind asked to look for him but needs to focus. He listens to something, hears his blood drop, a wrench clanging on a wall, and then Jake being taken. He raises his gun, calmly, and shoots into the distance where Jake he been take into. The bullet pierces a portrait, clothes, a wall, a field, and the man trying to take the boy. \nFor more info, check out BD's CinemaCon recap ! \nThe Dark Tower series tells the story of Roland Deschain, Mid-World’s last gunslinger, who is traveling southeast across Mid-World’s post-apocalyptic landscape, searching for the powerful but elusive magical edifice known as The Dark Tower.
