Four lines can all get the same unlimited deal for $45 per line.\nOf course, they mean alternate-unlimited like every other carrier does and you might get throttled at 22GB. We're told it shouldn't happen often, though.\nOn all Verizon Unlimited plans you get our fast LTE speeds. To ensure a quality experience for all customers, after 22 GB of data usage on a line during any billing cycle we may prioritize usage behind other customers in the event of network congestion. While we don't expect to do that very often, network management is a crucial tool that benefits all Verizon customers.\nYou can also add a connected device, like the new Verizon Wear24 or a tablet for an extra $5 per month and the international TravelPass (500 MB/day limit; 2G speeds after that) is available for $10 per day. Last but not least, mobile hotspot is included and you will be able to tether up to 10GB per month before you're throttled way down to 3G speeds.\nThe plan is available starting February 13 and you'll be able to get all the details at Verizon's site .\nThe one big unknown? They call this an introductory plan, so we're not 100% sure how it applies to existing customers. We'll know more on February 13.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:50:12.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
