I'll stand at the pot of boiling water and grab a handful (. . . plus a little more for good measure) and think to myself, \"That looks right; we'll find out!\" But now that I've discovered this ingenious hack, I'll never go back to my uncertain ways.\nThe easiest way to measure out a perfect single serving of spaghetti is to use the hole in the center of your spaghetti spoon . Just take a handful of spaghetti and see if it fits, filling in the extra space as needed, until the bundle fits tightly in the space. And voil√†, you've got a perfect amount just for you. Of course, if you're cooking more than one serving, just repeat the process as needed.\nWho knew that hollow center served such a purpose?! Since you'll probably already be using that spoon to grab your spaghetti noodles, it's even more convenient that you can measure with it, too. Making a solo spaghetti dinner has never been easier.\nImage Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Erin Cullum", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/MyIncredibleRecipes/posts/613682355462191/", "https://api.shopstyle.com/action/apiVisitRetailer?id=17498991&pid=popsugar&pdata=16119370", "https://media4.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/sc4Q-vnPgiMD-yYpULmKDGDCo0w/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/06/21/898/n/1922195/c3feed9f4220c558_hack2.jpg", "https://media3.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/__2Nh0oqx-5bzsZeyGNqfNm9T_I/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/06/21/962/n/1922195/bcc6312d5de323cf_hack-front.jpg", "https://media4.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/q_DdzvsYo2OBu1YzvSHQm4Ntmso/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/06/21/900/n/1922195/4000f19cc0d10804_hack3.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-20T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:51:46.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
