Earlier this month, Trump himself warned that BuzzFeed News would “suffer the consequences” for having published a dossier of unverified claims, initially compiled by a former British intelligence agent, about the depths of the incoming president’s entanglement with Russia.\nOn this, as on so many other things, the question is how exactly a Trump presidency would go about translating aggressive rhetoric into policy. The conventional mechanisms for payback by politicians against the press are mild—reducing access, feeding leaks to competing outlets, making unkind remarks. Trump did his own version of this at his pre-inaugural press conference, refusing to take questions from CNN’s Jim Acosta and barking at him about trafficking in “fake news.”\nAdvertisement \n\nBut the Trump Administration has also demonstrated a readiness to apply pressure to its designated opponents in less conventional ways. As a thought experiment, what could Trump do to impose more severe “consequences” on an individual news outlet, or to hold one “accountable”? If the president wanted to punish BuzzFeed, for instance, and drive it to ruin, what tools would he have?\nIn this, as in other things, the Trump administration might take its cues from the business world. A showdown between a government and a news organization may play out as matter of laws and principles. But a showdown between a corporation in the news and a corporation that publishes the news is often enough a matter of money and power.\nA news organization is only as strong, or as principled, as its financial backers are. One instructive example comes from the career of George Conway, the husband of presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway and a possible candidate to be Trump’s solicitor general . George Conway’s page on his law firm’s website says that he “played a substantial role in prosecuting one of the most prominent defamation cases in recent memory (Philip Morris v. American Broadcasting Cos.).”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T16:29:05.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
