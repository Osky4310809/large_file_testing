(Darryl Dyck/CP) January 3, 2017, 8:30 AM Presented by Presented by Ryan McKenna January 3, 2017, 8:30 AM \nBo Horvat is having himself a decent season, Vladimir Tarasenko was clutch outdoors and a spectacular save by Cory Schneider . \nHere’s three things we learned in the NHL on Monday: Impressive season continues Bo Horvat has quietly been putting together an impressive season with the Vancouver Canucks . \nThe 21-year-old centre scored his 11th goal of the season in Vancouver’s 3-2 win over the Colorado Avalanche . He scored just 16 goals through 82 games games last year. \nA lot of the Canucks’ positives have been overshadowed by the negatives this season, but Horvat’s emergence has definitely been a good development for Vancouver fans. \nThe London, Ont., native leads the team in points with 26 and chipped in with at least one assist during the Canucks' four-game winning streak. \nTarasenk-show Vladimir Tarasenko is one of the NHL's most prolific scorers, and for good reason. \nThe Russian winger broke a 1-1 tie with two goals 1:53 apart in the third period to lift the St. Louis Blues over the Chicago Blackhawks 4-1 in the Winter Classic at Busch Stadium. \nIt was the perfect way for Tarasenko to snap a four-game goalless drought and send the 46,556 in attendance home happy. \nThe 25-year-old has 18 goals and 23 assists in 38 games for the Blues this season. St. Louis (20-13-5) is currently third in the Western Conference's Central Division and in the middle of a six-game homestand. \nTarasenko's 41 points are good for third in NHL scoring. \nGet ready for game time with over 100 menu items delivered right to your door.

Schneider's 22 saves were good for his second shutout of the season. \nSchneider is 11-12-5 this season with a 2.80 goals-against average and .906 save percentage for the Devils, who are seventh in the Metropolitan Division standings. %2Fhockey%2Fnhl%2F3-things-learned-nhl-horvat-heating%2F", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T17:37:23.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
