The same way we’re encouraged to feel terrible about ourselves: through words and pictures.\nPip takes the pictures, Lib does the words.\n(Picture: Phlegm._) They met at uni, bonded over watching Prison Break, and discovered they were twin souls.\nPip is a ‘bit of a hippy at heart’, working as a photographer and selling shoes on Oxford Street to make money. Lib is ‘the female Jim Carrey’, is excellent at making hot chocolate, loves writing poetry, and works pulling pints and serving burgers.\n‘We are just two girls who wanna change the world,’ Pip and Lib told metro.co.uk. ‘We think up weird ways to visualize our topics. It’s the kind of stuff that confuses our parents.’\n(Picture: Phlegm._) They’re working on taking down perfection by tackling smaller issues one by one.\nFirst they created a photo series about it being perfectly okay for men to cry. Because it should be.\nThen they did a project about the objectification of women. Which shouldn’t be happening.\n(Picture: Phlegm._) Gender roles are a massive part of the ideals the artists hope to dismantle, believing that the best way to equality is to forget expectations for both genders and start on an equal playing field.\n‘The more something is exposed, the more normal it becomes,’ say Pip and Lib. We will knock down these silly social ideals, one by one\n‘Each gender have these stupid expectations, just because you a born with a certain body part, you are expected to be a certain way.\n‘It’s bloody ridiculous.\n‘We’ve got to liberate both sexes.’\nThey’ve also taken to the streets to hand out leaflets explaining why the concept of perfection is a load of sh*t.\n(Picture: Phlegm._) ‘It’s a concept which has been made up in dreamworld,’ Pip and Lib told us. ‘People get sucked into it and it damages their perception of reality, believing perfection, is the be all and end all.\n‘If we keep focusing on pretty filters, likes and fitting in, we will miss the world going by.\n‘If we could open people’s eyes, change their desire for perfection, then we would wear party hats for the rest of our lives.’\n(Picture: Phlegm._) For now, they’re working on this dream through just their blog and leaflets, but they hope that one day they’ll be able to make snazzy t-shirts that people can wear as a ‘big fat f**k you to perfection.’\nMore: Arts A gallery has just opened showing artworks drawn using ink made from air pollution \nThis artist is filling Bulgaria's capital with statues of women \nThis artist's incredibly detailed models show the reality of living in a city \n11-year-old conductor is set to become the youngest person to lead a 75-piece orchestra \nTheir mission is simple; to make the world a little nicer, and spread the message: ‘Perfection is an arsehole.
