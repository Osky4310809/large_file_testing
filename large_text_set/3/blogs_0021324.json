Police presence: Officers at the scene of the shooting in Barking (John Dunne) \n“He was no gangster or drug dealer, he was a good family guy. He always talked about how much he loved his mother and wanted to make her proud. \n“He was popular with everyone. I just can’t believe there are people out there in London with guns, you expect it in America but not here.” \nSpeaking outside his home in Dagenham , a relative of Mr Adegbite said the family were “very, very devastated” by his death. \nFriends lay flowers near the scene of the shooting which spelled out his nickname Dutch in front of the floral tributes. \nOne said: “He was not aggressive at all. He was just funny. He was a good footballer at school and was always well liked. He didn’t appear to have any enemies, he was a peaceable sort of guy. He was very cool.” \nAnother said: “He was a good friend and a good guy. We were planning to go to university together and he was going to do ICT (information and communications technology). He was a bright happy person, this does not make any to any of us.” \nThe teenager went to Dagenham Park school before attending Havering College where his friends said he did well in his A levels. Forensics tent: Police at the scene in Barking (John Dunne) \nHe was visiting friends when he was killed and had previously lived on the estate. \nTwo 20-year-old men have arrested in connection with the shooting and police said that enquiries were continuing. Teenage cyclist shot dead ‘in gang attack as children played nearby’ \nWitnesses told how children playing nearby dived for cover after two shots were heard shortly after 7pm on Sunday. \nOne said: “There were two shots, it was so loud. There were children on green space playing nearby and everyone dived for cover. It was really frightening. We just wanted to make sure the kids were all okay.” \nLocal police officers, firearms officers and paramedics found the 18-year-with a gunshot wound to the head. \nHe was taken to an east London hospital where he had emergency surgery, but he died from his injuries. \nHe is the third teenager to be killed in London this year.
