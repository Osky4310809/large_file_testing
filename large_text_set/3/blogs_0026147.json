Tell me you don’t look at the photo of her below and first think, “But isn’t that a picture of Ellen Pompeo? Or maybe Renée Zellweger?” \nNOPE! It’s actually Sia! The singer, who usually opts for more avant-garde looks, kept it casual when she walked into the Los Angeles International Airport on Wednesday in a blush-colored sweatshirt and beige sweatpants. \nBut most surprising is that she made no effort to mask her face, which has become her signature look since becoming a mainstream pop star a few years ago. \nSia has spoken about the reason behind her face-hiding wigs before. On “Carpool Karaoke” with James Corden last year, she said that she chose to hide her face so often because she noticed the thing missing from pop music was mystery. Giphy \nAnother factor that goes into the unique look is Sia’s past struggles. She had actually been a moderately successful singer throughout the late ’90s and ’00s, and suffered a lot from drug addiction and depression during this time. \nWhen she began rapidly gaining fame and success around her 2014 album “1000 Forms of Fear,” Sia made the choice to only appear in front of cameras with her face covered, often by a long black-and-blonde wig.
