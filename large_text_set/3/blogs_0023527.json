Hulu \nAnother day in Trumpâ€™s America, another inch toward dystopian fiction . On Monday, a group of Texas women pointedly dressed as characters from Margaret Atwoodâ€™s The Handmaidâ€™s Tale , donning red robes and white bonnet hats,in protest of various anti-abortion measures being considered by the state senate. Atwoodâ€™s seminal 1985 novel explored the subjugation of women in a near-future ruled by a totalitarian theocracy, which instituted an outright ban on abortion. Sales of the book have skyrocketed since Donald Trumpâ€™s election as president. Women attended legislation sessions at the Texas capitol today dressed in Handsmaid's Tale uniforms.

The specific measures that sparked the protest included SB 415, which would effectively ban any safe and common operations for abortions in the second trimester, and SB 25, which would allow doctors to lie to pregnant women considering an abortion if they detect any anomalies. Advertisement \nItâ€™s just the latest instance of high-profile organization among women rejecting Republican policies, following the massive, global Womenâ€™s March and the demonstration of white resistance at President Trumpâ€™s joint address to Congress. And itâ€™s well-timed free publicity for Hulu as well: The streaming service has a high-profile adaptation of The Handmaidâ€™s Tale slated to debut on April 26â€”and by the day, itâ€™s looking more relevant than anybody couldâ€™ve reasonably feared. A Handmaid's Tale comes to life in the Senate Gallery. #FightBackTX pic.twitter.com/aLAOLRKH2j", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:10:30.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
