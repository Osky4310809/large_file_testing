Perine does the same, and Fernandez then tells the couple to kiss. \nThe cards somehow switch places during the kiss, and Megan pulled the card out of her mouth only to be stunned by a proposal Samaje had written. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T20:34:09.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
