Even outside of resolutions, there is a goatse's buttload of younger readers who are going to be entering the workforce for the first time, and also wondering what \"goatse\" means. Don't look that up. \nSince high school, we've been spoon fed all the basics of jobs and promotions, and I'm not going to regurgitate those nuggets of \"yeah, no shit\" wisdom here. I think the most important pieces of advice are things that those speakers never tell you about. Fuck \"dress for the job you want\" ... you'll be way better off if you understand on Day One that ... Advertisement 5 A Friend In The Industry Only Goes So Far \nI started writing for Cracked back in the olden times of 2010. It's no secret that I had friends in the industry, and that gave me an advantage on knowing how to get started ... where to go, what to do, who to avoid stabbing. But that doesn't mean I was given carte blanche to start slinging dick jokes and making people roll their eyes with articles about poverty and addiction . The people I knew showed me where the door was and politely asked me to not shit on the floor when I walked inside. Ten03/iStock Welcome to Cracked. Run. \nIt's the same with any job. Knowing someone in your industry of choice can only help (if that person isn't considered a massive fuck face by his or her boss). But once you're in the door, it's all on you. A recommendation by them is one thing -- if you suck, it's just their character judgment that gets tainted -- but actively covering your ass if you're a massive shit stain of a worker puts their career on the line, and nobody is willing to do that. It's why once I was in the \"pitching\" stage of writing articles for Cracked, I went through the same process as everyone else. If I screwed up, it reflected badly on my editors ... so they made damn sure their own jobs stayed safe by making sure that I did mine correctly. \nBefore that, I worked a lot of physical labor jobs which saw high turnover, because in general, that's just the nature of that style of work. In order to keep the business staffed, we often had to recruit friends and family to fill the vacuum that was left when a worker said, \"Fuck half of this job and also the other half of this job.\" Virtually every worker was hired on a \"who you know\" basis, and that often led to a surprising problem: \nSee, a lot of people have never worked with their friends before. Or if they have, they're often on the same level in the corporate chain. One of you works the register while the other drops the fries. There's nothing wrong with that (I'll talk more about that later). What creates a problem is when one of you is the boss, and the other is an entry-level worker. You know your friend as the wacky jackoff who once stuck a whip in his asshole and galloped through your apartment, making horse sounds. Seeing him in \"stop screwing around and get this shit done right now\" mode isn't just a shock to the system; it can destroy your friendship. imtmphoto/iStock \"You hear me, you son of a bitch? I will fuck your dick off!\" \nEven if they aren't the boss, it can be jarring to see them switch from \"friend\" mode to \"worker\" mode. It's easy to think, \"It's going to be so awesome working with Chad. We have fun every time we're together. Being able to let loose with him and get paid for it? Holy shit, this is going to be the best job ever!\" Then when you actually start working, you realize he's not the same person in here as he is in the outside world. He's there to do a job, and your insistence on fucking around is impeding that. It boils down to the same lesson: they can get you in the door. After that, it's all on you. \nBefore you even start your job search, though ... 4 Know The Difference Between \"Holding Out\" And \"Entitled\" \nI expend a lot of effort in articles and on Twitter , defending the current generation against dumbass accusations of being \"entitled.\" I've been alive since Nixon got fired for fucking that dog ... or whatever it was that he did. I'm not good with politics. And in that time, I've not seen any one generation being overwhelmingly more \"entitled\" than another. If anything, my own generation (X) gave the others a pretty damn good run for their money in that department. \nThat being said, you have to know the difference between \"holding out for the job I deserve\" and \"entitled.\" Not so that you can defend yourself from accusations or so you'll look better in the eyes of your elders. It's so you don't screw yourself out of an extremely valuable work history. txking/iStock This is the image of you that the world defaults to. You have to change their minds. \nThe difference can feel subtle if you don't know what you're looking at. If you've just graduated college, and you're in a position to shop around for the right company and position, that's holding out. That's smart, because the last thing you want is to rack up tens of thousands of dollars in college loans, finally get your Master's in Sociology, and then wind up working as a porn fluffer. There's nothing wrong with that job, but it's likely not a very good fit for your education and skillset. \nThe thing is, how long can you hold out before you're forced to take virtually anything just to pay the bills? Are you staying with your parents while you search? How long can you live there before you hit an age that makes it creepy? But most importantly, the longer you go without a job, the wider the employment history gap becomes on your resume. And that's not good. That section is as valuable to a company as your actual degree ... in some cases, more valuable, because it tells them if you're reliable. It tells them if you have a history of getting fired or walking out on a job after a few months. No work history at all can mean anything from \"fresh out of college\" to \"sat on his ass for a few years, leeching off of mom and dad.\" It doesn't matter if it's true. It matters how it appears to your interviewer. \nBecause of that, you're going to need to set some realistic goals. Give yourself time to look for the perfect job, but be prepared to take what you can if that shit falls through. There's nothing wrong with taking a \"lesser\" job to make ends meet, while putting out resumes on your days off. I know this sounds like \"yeah, no shit\" advice, but I've seen way too many people pass up a decent offer, while holding out for a golden one. Then six months later, when they're selling aluminum cans to buy more toilet paper, looking back on that old offer with regret. \"I could be wiping my asshole with double ply by now.\" LSOphoto/iStock \"I could have also bought a baby by now!\" \nThat's entitlement -- turning down every job because you think you deserve the best of the best, even when you're in desperation mode and can't afford to do that. It's the feeling of \"I am owed\" when you've yet to invest yourself in the game. Entitlement is the Chad of belief systems. Don't be a Chad. That guy is a piece of douche. \nOf course, you may luck out and actually land your dream job right off the bat. Be careful, even then, because ... ↓ Continue Reading Below 3 You Will Second Guess Even Your Dream Job \nI have a problem with the phrase \"dream job,\" but I know that the problem is my fault. The thing is, I suspect that a lot of people are under the same mistaken impression I've had for years, which is that \"dream job\" means \"stress free.\" It's an easy misinterpretation to make, because you think, \"If I'm doing something I truly love, then it will never feel like a 'job' at all.\" But it's a perception you're going to need to understand before you second guess yourself on the bad days and throw away something awesome. \nLet's say you love cooking. Not just \"love,\" but obsessed to the point that you think you might actually need medication to control the impulses. It's such a joy that you decide, \"Fuck it. I'm going to do this for a living.\" So you start your own business, or you land a good job in the industry, and things are awesome. Until they aren't. One day, out of the blue, you find yourself literally shaking from the stress, and if you don't get a break soon, you might actually boil your own grandmother in frustration. How the hell did it get to this point? \nWell, that's the thing about passion: it breeds competition. Competition with peers, with yourself ... hell, even with your own customers. \"Did this asshole really just say that he's had better cakepie at Tito's Cakehole? Well, let's see what he thinks when I serve him the Cakefucker 2000.\" You're always striving to get better, because ... well, that's how passion works. apomares/iStock \"Yeah, I just played so hard, I created a fucking rainbow . Eat passion, butthole.\" \nFor some people, they work their asses off because they want to be the best. For others, it's because they realize that the world is full of people who want the exact same job, but only a precious few actually get them. Fear of losing that job or business is a powerful motivator when you've staked your livelihood on it. So you take personal responsibility for every success and failure you create. That's a lot of pressure, and it doesn't take long for you to overload yourself. You think you don't need to slow down because it's a job you love right down to the orgasmic core of your work boner, but if you don't learn how to rest it from time to time, your balls are going to fall right off. \nSorry, I got lost in fuck metaphors there. The point is, if you overload yourself, you're going to start racking up bad days. Enough bad days, and before you even realize what's going on, you're thinking, \"Holy shit, did I pick the wrong field? Do ... do I suck at this ? Oh, God, I've wasted my life on something I suck at!\" \nTrust me, if you're good at what you do, and you truly love it, you haven't wasted anything. You've just started to realize that after a certain amount of time, the \"dream\" starts to fade from the phrase, and you're left with the \"job\" part. That's not a bad thing at all. You just have to be prepared for that moment, or it will catch you off guard, and you can easily mistake your stress for catastrophe. It happens with all jobs, good or bad. Everyone needs a break. Please don't boil your grandma. 2 There's A Trick To Creating Your Own Promotion \nWhen it comes to promotions, all the websites, job fairs and Career Days tell you the same basic shit: work hard, be efficient, make yourself noticed, dress for the job you want, make your boss aware that you're interested in the position, don't elbow motherfuckers in the throat. It's all common sense stuff, and that's fine. People have to learn the basics from somewhere. But there's one huge thing they never bring up, and it blows me away that they don't: Make your boss's job easier. fergregory/iStock \"Who put the bong on my desk?\" \nNo, seriously, that's it. There is no better way to be noticed than to be the person who just shoveled a few pounds of shit off of the boss's plate. Of course, it's not quite as easy as it sounds, because there are a few important rules of thumb to keep in mind, so you don't come off like a goddamn psychopath ... or worse, an insufferable ass-kisser. \nFirst, you have to understand that there's a reason a lot of that work is on the boss's desk and not yours. Sometimes, it's because only certain levels of management are allowed to see certain documents. Things like employee wages and the crystal that powers their cold, black hearts. Sometimes, it's because (and this may hurt to hear) you're not good enough to do what they do. That's fine -- they've been trained for their job; you've been trained for yours. So be it. \nBecause of that, you have to be selective about what you take off of their plate. It takes a considerable amount of observation and understanding of their work process. You might not be able to swipe a whole project from them, but you can sure as hell offer to do the grunt work. \"Hey, I noticed that you have to kill a bunch of rats when you first get into the office, before you can start your morning reports. I can take care of that for you, so you don't have to worry about it anymore.\" \nYou can be the most efficient, hard working, reliable employee in the entire company, but the more weight you can take off of your boss's shoulders, the more you're going to be seen as invaluable to them. That's not ass-kissing. It's just smart. But one thing you don't want to do is go balls to the wall with it. \"I've written out a 4000-word plan on how I can make the job more efficient. Let's set up a meeting to discuss my innovative idea.\" Do that, and you're going to come off as a know-it-all control freak. Like you're telling them, \"I know how to do this much better than you. Here's how, you idiot.\" SoumenNath/iStock \"I'm going to need you to fuck just SUPER off.\" \nNo, this is something that's best given in small doses, spread out over time. It's not a grand gesture; it's a consistent work habit. Trust me, if you can shave the boss's workload from 70 hours to 60, you might as well be handing them a bag full of gold. \nBut before you dive into super helper mode, do yourself a favor and ... ↓ Continue Reading Below 1 Know When To Disappear \nWhen I was working the aforementioned shitty pre-Cracked job, I worked with a guy who wanted to be a supervisor really goddamn bad . I was a \"senior\" supervisor, so in order to get the job, he needed a recommendation from me. The method he chose to push that agenda was to be up my ass every second of every shift, and by the end of the week, I had to talk myself out of giving him and his entire family Stone Cold Stunners. \nEvery time I turned around, he was there, and he always started his exchange with, \"Hey, John.\" I heard it up to 40 times per day. The reason I know that number is because I finally hit a breaking point, and just to be a smartass, I would walk into the break room with him following and still talking, and put a tally mark on the whiteboard every time he said it. He got up to around 36 before catching on ... and then still said it four more times after that. \nIt wasn't just annoyance that made me loathe him. It was the fact that as a senior supervisor, I was busy. Every time he stopped me with a, \"Hey, John,\" it was taking time away from my actual responsibilities. See, the higher you go on the chain, the more people demand your time. That comes with the territory of moving up in a company. The more people waste that time, the harder your job becomes. Have you ever worked with a manager who's a short-spoken, rude asshole who always seems like he's trying to escape from conversation? That's likely why. Every second he spends talking to you is another second he has to work in order to make up for that lost time. turk_stock_photographer/iStock \"Stop. You have eight words to explain. Go.\" \nIf you don't want to be seen as the boss's personal nightmare (\"Jesus Christ, what the fuck does he want now?\") then you have to know when to show up with your report, request, question, emergency ... and when to disappear. It's a pretty tight balancing act. Disappear too much, and you look like you're hiding or slacking off -- or worse, you just blend into the background and are forgotten when it comes time for promotions and raises. Don't do it enough, and suddenly you're staring at a whiteboard full of sarcastic tally marks. \nI can't tell you exactly how to pull this one off because it will change from boss to boss, and business to business. What one person considers an emergency, another will consider you an idiot for not taking care of the problem, yourself. Some bosses are control freaks who want all the information, no matter how minor. Others just close the door and jack off to prison documentaries until the shift ends. If you want to move up in the company, you're going to have to learn them. \nUnless it's the jack-off guy. If your boss is doing that, call in sick and then immediately call the police. That dude needs help. \nJohn is the head of columns at Cracked, but more impressive than that: he has a a Twitter thing . \nSubscribe to our YouTube channel and check out The 4 Most Brilliant Displays of Sucking at Your Job , and watch other videos you won't see on the site! \nAlso follow us on Facebook .
