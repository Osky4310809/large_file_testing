The group is calling themselves “water protectors,” had been arrested for trespassing, but are yet to release what kind of charges those arrested would be facing. \nRob Keller, spokesman for the Morton County sheriff’s office, told the Guardian on Wednesday night that it was too soon to say what charges were being filed. In a statement, he claimed that a “rogue group of protesters” had trespassed on private property. \n“A lot of water protectors really felt that we needed to make some sort of stand as far as treaty rights,” said Linda Black Elk, a member of the Catawba Nation. “We basically started to see police mobilizing from all directions. Someone came along and told us we had about 15 minutes before the camp would get raided.” \nWhether this group of vets was involved in the arrests of the “water protectors” or not is still yet to be announced, but the group had stated that they would do “everything within our power to ensure that the environment and human life are respected.” \nOverall, the Morton county Sheriff’s office has made over 700 arrests since the protests reached their height last summer.
