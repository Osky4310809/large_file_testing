Seriously, this house sold in October for $617,500 after listing for $650,000. It had sold for $275,000 five years earlier. For reasons unknown to us, it’s back on the market. It’s a big house - 6,300 square feet, nine bedrooms. It looks to be in good condition. The price this time around? $694,500. The house has five Pewabic fireplaces, including a bright blue one in one of the smaller bedrooms. It also has gorgeous bookshelves in the study and herringbone wood floor in the living room. The solarium has beautiful arched windows and looks out over the big yard. There’s a butler’s pantry with ample storage next to the kitchen, and a plenty of room on the third floor. If you’re interested in seeing the house, and the other that recently sold and just relisted , the Loft Warehouse is having a tour of these Indian Village mansions (and others) on March 25.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:08:13.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
