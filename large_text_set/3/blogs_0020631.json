It happens. The NFL is a business and teams cannot financially keep every player. \nWhat doesn't usually happen when players depart is to have players, or in this case, player's parents, speak out against a player's organization. Unforunately, Ellison's father, Riki, took to Twitter upon his son's departure from Minnesota to call out the Vikings organization saying that it had \"toxic leadership.\" \nVikings Head Coach Mike Zimmer, in speaking with KFAN's Paul Allen about the team, their latest free agent additions and the upcoming draft, addressed such comments made by the elder Ellison. \n\"I tried to call him, unfortunately he didn't return my call,\" Zimmer said. \"I'm trying to get to where his comments were made but he didn't seem fit to call me back.\" \nIt is unclear why Riki Ellison made such comments or who exactly it was that he was referencing but it sounds as though attempts to understand his remarks have been made and he has been unwilling to respond. \nRhett Ellison, who signed a four-year contract with the Giants, played in 15 games with the Vikings last season - six starts - and finished with nine catches for 57 yards and one rushing attempt for one yard and one touchdown.
