(AP) – The City Council in former Vice President Joe Biden’s Pennsylvania hometown is trying to stop a state lawmaker from naming a bridge after Biden. \nScranton Councilman Pat Rogan says he loves Biden “as much as almost every other Scrantonian,” but he says the bridge being constructed is already named for a veteran. \nThe Col. Frank Duffy Memorial Bridge honors the city’s highest-ranking soldier killed in World War I. \nDemocratic state Rep. Kevin Haggerty tells the Scranton Times-Tribune he plans to submit a bill to call the bridge the “Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Bridge.” \nRogan says the council plans to send Haggerty a letter asking him to find another way to honor Biden. \nDemocratic state Sen. John Blake sponsored the 2015 bill to name the bridge after Duffy. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \n\n(Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
