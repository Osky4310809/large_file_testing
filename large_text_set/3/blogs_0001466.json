Nathan Redmond (L) and Dusan Tadic were both on the scoresheet for Southampton \nIt was the perfect start for the hosts as Deeney flicked on Younes Kaboul's long throw for Okaka before latching onto the return ball with a finely-taken volley into the far corner after four minutes. \nSouthampton grew into the game after going a goal down and Gomes was forced to tip Tadic's effort round the post before getting down low to deny Gabbiadini. \nAn end-to-end half then saw Okaka spurn two headers from Jose Holebas' crosses before Etienne Capoue's long-distance effort trickled narrowly wide of the mark. \nThe Saints were level in the 28th-minute through Tadic, who started the attack before latching onto the loose ball inside the box and slotting into the bottom corner. Troy Deeney volleyed Watford into an early lead \nIn the second minute of added time the visitors went ahead following a fine team move, with Redmond rounding it off from 12 yards out. \nAfter the break, Gomes came to the rescue twice to keep Watford's hopes alive, first producing a flying save to tip away Tadic's volley before getting down low to deny Maya Yoshida's close-range effort. \nWatford equalised with just over 10 minutes to go when Okaka turned the ball home following Isaac Success' low cross. \nThe score was level for just four minutes however, as Gomes spilled a Sofiane Boufal effort, with Gabbiadini poking the ball home. \nRedmond then found himself in acres of space down the left, and with Sebastian Prodl backing away, his effort proved too strong for Gomes. \nThere was still time for a Doucoure consolation, but the Saints held on to provide the perfect tonic for their supporters following last weekend's heartache in the EFL Cup final. \nPlayer Ratings \nWatford: Gomes (6), Kaboul (6), Prodl (5), Britos (6), Holebas (6), Cleverley (6), Behrami (5), Capoue (6), Niang (6), Deeney (7), Okaka (7). \nSubs: Success (7), Doucoure (N/A). \nSouthampton: Forster (6), Cedric (7), Stephens (7), Yoshida (6), Bertrand (6), Romeu (6), Davis (7), Ward-Prowse (7), Tadic (8), Redmond (9), Gabbiadini (8). \nSubs: Boufal (6), Clasie (N/A), Long (N/A). \nMan of the match: Nathan Redmond (Southampton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T19:32:12.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
