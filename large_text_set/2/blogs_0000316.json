Because not only had this Beyoncé, Gaga, and Donald Trump-focused account mentioned Bey’s pregnancy on January 28th, they mentioned it long, long ago, in the before time.\nOkay so Beyoncé is gonna announce a pregnancy in February(2017)\n— . (@beyoncefan666) July 22, 2016 In fact, the account almost entirely consists of predictions about the three figures listed above that later came true.\nhello from the future just to let you know america is currently crashing and burning under trumps leadership\n— . (@beyoncefan666) July 24, 2016 Like Bey performing at the Video Music Awards on August 28th.\nAugust 28th...that's all I'm saying\n— . (@beyoncefan666) August 21, 2016 They even knew it would be a medley!\n*cough cough* vma medley\n— . (@beyoncefan666) August 21, 2016 They also predicted when Gaga would release Joanne .\nLady gaga album coming out in October\n— . (@beyoncefan666) August 4, 2016 …And her Super Bowl performance.\nNot long until NFL announce that Lady Gaga will be performing at the Super Bowl\n— . (@beyoncefan666) September 25, 2016 It’s also important to note that this account predicted the UK Brexit.\nIn the referendum 52% vote leave\n— . (@beyoncefan666) June 22, 2016 It’s all pretty eerie at first glance, but as Guardian pointed out, there’s a pretty simple solution to how this all went down. @Beyoncefan666 likely tweeted out multiple possibilities that could play out in different scenarios, like the US election and the UK Brexit, back when their account was still private. All of the freaked out responses to their tweets were posted today and yesterday, so the popular theory is they only went public once Bey released her pregnancy announcement.\nA similar tactic was used in 2014 by an account called “Fifa Corruption” that “predicted” major World Cup events, but followers with fast fingers screen-grabbed evidence of the account posting multiple outcomes before deleting them.\nThis @FifNdhs has tweeted multiple outcomes and then deleted wrong ones #WorldCupFinal #WorldCup2014 pic.twitter.com/OzYDqodOme \n— Suresh Nakhua (@sureshnakhua) July 13, 2014 So, sorry guys — @Beyoncefan666 is probably a fake, and in other news, the Easter Bunny isn’t real, either. But we appreciate their efforts, and will keep our eyes peeled to their account in the days to come, hoping they prove us wrong.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:21:41.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
