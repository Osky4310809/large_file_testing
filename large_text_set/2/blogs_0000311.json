Keke Palmer recently revealed to Steve Harvey, in an ICONIC RANT, how she feels very strongly that Rose could have shoved over a little.

Hell, even KATE WINSLET (and you know what you did) thinks there was enough room for Jack. vine.co ID: 10447341 4. But speaking to The Daily Beast , James Cameron attempted to put an end to the debate. View this image ›\n20th Century Fox “You mentioned Titanic , so I’ve got to ask: the age-old question is whether or not there was plenty of room on that plank-raft for Leo. I say yes, there was,” Daily Beast put to Cameron.\nHe replied: “Look, it’s very, very simple: You read page 147 of the script and it says, ‘Jack gets off the board and gives his place to her so that she can survive’.

OK, so let’s really play that out: You’re Jack, you’re in water that’s 28 degrees [Fahrenheit], your brain is starting to get hypothermia. Mythbusters asks you to now go take off your life vest, take hers off, swim underneath this thing, attach it in some way that it won’t just wash out two minutes later—which means you’re underwater tying this thing on in 28-degree water, and that’s going to take you five to ten minutes, so by the time you come back up you’re already dead. So that wouldn’t work.\nHis best choice was to keep his upper body out of the water and hope to get pulled out by a boat or something before he died. They’re fun guys and I loved doing that show with them, but they’re full of shit .”\nID: 10447488 6. So there you have it. Looks like this is one cold case that’s closed.
