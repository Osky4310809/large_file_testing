(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) \nNEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A 12-year-old boy was arrested after allegedly demanding a chicken nugget from a female classmate at gunpoint earlier this week. \nThe boy, a student at Harlem Democracy Prep School, first approached the girl and asked her for a Chicken McNugget inside a McDonald’s on East 103rd Street on Tuesday. \nThe girl, also 12, refused to share and then walked to a nearby subway station. \nThe boy followed her onto a 6 train and allegedly pulled out a gun, pointed it at her head and again demanded a McNugget, according to police. \nThe girl slapped the gun away and refused to hand over the food. She said she later saw the boy show the gun to a another teen on the train. \nThe victim reported the incident to school staff the following day and the boy was arrested at the school. \nThe weapon was not recovered. It is unclear if it was real.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:22:17.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
