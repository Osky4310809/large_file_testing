Why would anyone call you a doughnut ? Because youâ€™re such a sweet guy? \nPM: No, no. Not a doughnut as in one word. A dough nut , as in two words. A guy whoâ€™s become a nut about dough. And whatâ€™s made me a nut about dough is black money. \nFM: I know what you mean. No sooner do you demonetise to get rid of all the black money than the darn thing comes back in some form or the other. \nPM: Itâ€™s like one of those boomerang things â€“ you think youâ€™ve got rid of it and it comes right back and wallops you on the back of your head. Itâ€™s enough to make one a dough nut. So weâ€™re going to have monetary Trotskyism. \nFM: Monetary Trotskyism? Whatâ€™s that? \nPM: Trotsky said that there must be perpetual revolution. We must have perpetual demonetisation. Thatâ€™s the only way to get rid of black money. \nFM: Perpetual demonetisation? Wow. Thatâ€™s like a perpetual motion machine. Which science says is not possible. \nPM: Science, fience. What does stupid science know about these things? \nFM: So how do we go about setting perpetual demonetisation in motion? I know weâ€™re already planning to demonetise the new 2,000 rupee note once the state elections are over, but what do we demonetise after that? \nPM: For demonetisation to work, itâ€™s got to come as a complete surprise. Even to us. We can do eenie-meenie-mina-moh and demonetise whatever denomination note we end up with, 100 rupees, 50, 10 bucks, whatever. Thatâ€™ll put paid to black money. \nFM: But wonâ€™t all the black money simply go to Switzerland? \nPM: Then weâ€™ll demonetise Switzerland. \nFM: Demonetise Switzerland? What fun. Then people wonâ€™t call us dough nuts. Theyâ€™ll call us cuckoo â€“ as in cuckoo clocks. DISCLAIMER : This article is intended to bring a smile to your face.
