West Ham vs City hardly set the pulse racing (Photo: Dan Mullan) Empty stadiums showed the current opinion of the FA Cup (Photo: Nigel Roddis) Read More FA chief executive says he has no issue with FA Cup squad rotation \nNobody looks forward to West Ham vs Manchester City. Or United vs Reading. Or Tottenham vs Aston Villa. The flat atmospheres in the stadiums prove it. \nTruth is, not many Premier League teams really care about the FA Cup anymore. Just look at Bournemouth's abject effort against Millwall. \nWe would all like to see them go for it, but bowing out of the cup isn't half as heartbreaking for players as it used to be. \nWhich is why the coverage should focus around the teams that actually care about winning. \nSutton United's tie with AFC Wimbledon was everything that the FA Cup should be about. It was a fairytale - and there was a great chance of an upset. Sutton vs Wimbledon had all the ingredients for a classic FA Cup tie (Photo: Getty) Fans crammed onto the terraces at Gander Green Lane (Photo: Clive Rose) The fixture had a great FA Cup storyline that TV companies avoided (Photo: Clive Rose) \nIt would have made for enthralling TV - as would the games involving Barrow, Lincoln and Stourbridge. \nInstead they were snubbed for coverage in favour of rating-hungry producers, who made us sit through City's procession at the London Stadium. \nSo why does the 'magic' of the FA Cup just suddenly evaporate when it reaches the third round? \nIt's alive full and well right from the extra-preliminary round right through to the second round. \nI have been fortunate enough to attend many a great FA Cup night this season. Ninth-tier Consett AFC of County Durham played a match described by one as the ‘biggest in their history’ in a second qualifying round replay against Curzon Ashton. Curzon eventually bowed out of the FA Cup in the second round (Photo: Getty) The FA Cup still means a lot to lower ranked teams (Photo: The FA via Getty Images) \nThe game was frantic, tense and, quite simply, brilliant. \nOver 700 people crammed into a rather basic but pleasant stadium watching the sort of passion and desire we all wished West Ham had conjured up. Curzon edged through 1-0 with thanks to a lucky own goal - but both teams left everything on the pitch. \nAnd that is what the FA Cup should be about. That is what the FA Cup is. It's exactly what we haven't seen - barring Preston's first-half heroics against Arsenal - on TV. \nThe magic of the FA Cup is still there. It's just a shame the TV companies are too scared to go and find it. \nThere is fat chance of it ever happening, but TV bosses need to throw rating projections out the window in the good name of the competition. \nThe public are being cheated of the FA Cup's true romance. poll loading Is the FA Cup still the greatest cup competition in the world? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T20:13:30.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
