Beyond the standard wondering about how Steve Brule-y John C.Reilly’s character will be in the film , one of the more pressing questions is what exactly is this thing? Is it a reboot? A sequel? An elaborate Trivago commercial? Thankfully, Tom Hiddleston is here to set us straight. Thanks Tommo!\nIn a series of promo videos released today, Hiddleston answers the question of whether Kong is a prequel, sequel or reboot. (He’s in the film, by the way. It would be a bit weird if he were doing this and was nowhere in the movie.) Well, he kinda explains. HIddleston’s answer to all three prospects is a general “not quite” rebuttal. So the answer is… it’s not any of those things. Somehow.\n\n\nIn more conclusive promotional video information, a freshly released video from Warner Bros. offers up an extended tease of what’s in store soundtracked by “Kong: Skull Island Groove” crafted by Jay Z producer Young Guru. It’s a nice pairing of Kong crushing action and a quality musical partner. Kong: Skull Island hits theaters on March 10.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:50:54.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
