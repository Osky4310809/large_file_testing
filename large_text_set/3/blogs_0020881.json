The release comes hot on the heels of the sought-after production talent’s eponymous debut album last month. NAV, who is signed to The Weeknd’s XO imprint, also recently surprised fans by appearing as part of the singer’s Starboy tour.\nThe video, set against a woodsy backdrop and shot with fluorescent lighting, sets the tone for NAV’s atmospheric production and unhurried sing-rap vocals. In many ways, the video reflects the song’s subject matter – as NAV reflects on the effects of being sober versus under the influence, the screen shifts and contracts on itself as if to adjust to his mental state. It’s a trippy project suited to the noir-slanted, tropical, R&B-esque soundscape currently dominating Toronto’s popular music scene. Press play to enjoy.\nDon’t forget to also take a look at Nav’s NSFW “ Some Way” video featuring XO label head honcho and singer The Weeknd. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:39:33.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
