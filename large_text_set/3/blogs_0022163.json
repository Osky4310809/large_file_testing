Williams. His profile photo also shows him apparently standing next to Beyoncé with a caption underneath where he describes himself as a “can and bottle recycler, autograph collecter [sic] in new york city and i would love to visit california. Im a good businessman.”\nCaughman’s favorite pastime came to an end Monday night, when he was killed by a knife-wielding suspect who repeatedly stabbed him during a confrontation in Hell’s Kitchen.\nHis killer has since turned himself in to police and charges against him are pending.\nSEE ALSO \nWell-dressed suspect in fatal stabbing surrenders to cops 0:0 The sharp-dressed suspect wanted for fatally stabbing a 66-year-old man... But when he wasn’t walking around town collecting bottles and cans to make money, Caughman was hounding celebrities, usually as they were coming and going from television appearances or doing book signings.\nHe also appeared to have a crush on actress Shari Headley, best know for her role in the 1988 comedy “Coming to America,” starring Eddie Murphy.\nCaughman tagged her in nearly every Tweet that included a picture of him rubbing elbows with a celebrity.\n“Shari. I met a great lady the other day,” he tweeted along with a photo of him standing next to Big Bang Theory star Mayim Bialik. “Love her shari are you good.”\nCaughman even went so far as to wish Headley’s mother a happy birthday in 2013 along with a photo of a birthday card.\n“To Shari Mom,” the card reads . “Happy Brithday. This joyful day is dedicated to you.”\nOn that occasion Headley responded by saying “Thank you so much-God Bless you!”\nSome of Caughman’s other celebrity snaps include hip-hop producer Russell Simmons, comedian DL Hughley and Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas.\nPeople who who live in Caughman’s SRO at Hotel Barbour on West 36th Street said they were not aware of his celbrity obsession, and only knew the deceased man’s day job included collecting bottles and cans to raise money.\n“I’m shocked. He’s a good old man,” said fellow resident Peter Ramos, 35.\n“He keeps to himself. He never fights with anyone. He comes in late because he collects bottle all day.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:48:27.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
