That hasn’t changed.” pic.twitter.com/Itp7GhYwUr \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 6, 2017 \n“He is going to build that wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it,” Conway said. “That hasn’t changed.” Advertisement - story continues below \nIn a Twitter posting earlier Friday, Trump made the same point, while acknowledging that construction money could come out of the U.S. government’s coffers, initially at least, for the sake of expediency. The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nFor the liberal media — still smarting from Trump’s upset victory in November and eager to pile on any chance to make the president-elect look bad — the funding source is supposed to represent a major shift in the Republican’s priorities, as though Trump is betraying the very voters who elected him before he even takes the oath of office. \nThe coverage on CNN – also known to many conservatives as the Clinton News Network – conveyed the tone. \nThe move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall. \nCan anyone remember CNN accusing Obama of breaking a promise like that? (Maybe, “if you like your doctor …”) \nBut here’s the thing. If the conversation has shifted from whether America will have a border wall to squabbling about where the initial construction money is going to come from, Team Trump has already defined the debate – and if the past eight years of Barack Obama have proven anything, it’s that the side that defines the debate is going to win it.
