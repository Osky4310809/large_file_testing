It just took everyone a while to notice she was even gone, which probably says something about her impact as a pundit.\nDash has been accused of doing some ugly things on the road to riches and diamond rings, including her comments that Black History Month and the network BET should be eliminated altogether during a discussion about the lack of diversity among Academy Award nominees.\nDash followed this up a few weeks later with, what else, a totally awkward appearance at the Oscars during which Dash quipped, \"Happy Black History Month!\" to a none-too-amused audience.\nEver since, Dash has been a lightning rod on Twitter , where users took joy in the fact that Dash will no longer have a prominent platform on cable news.\n\"Fox Declined to Renew Stacey Dash‚Äôs Contract and Twitter Rejoiced with Dank Memes\" lmfao\n‚Äî The Great Coppin (@Coppin_Bomb) January 23, 2017\nStacey Dash got fired from FOX?
