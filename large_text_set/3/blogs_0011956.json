Accompanied by Savage's brilliantly simple visuals , Hong Kong activist Alex Chow explains the often-uttered but seldom-understood phrase, \"The media is the message.\" \nFirst published by McLuhan in his 1964 book Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man , the concept has far-reaching implications for the US and Europe's current political situation. Fake news and demagoguery have stormed to the forefront of our social media feeds, a phenomenon we might be able to understand better by looking at McLuhan's prophetic observations of mass media. That's exactly what the Al Jazeera-commissioned short accomplishes . GIF via Vimeo \nTo some, \"The medium is the message,\" evokes musty media theory classrooms or pseudo-intellectual 3 AM arguments in dorm rooms that smell like stale weed smoke. Like a fancy mouthwash, Savage's two-tone visuals cleanse the intellectual palette and make obvious the relevance of McLuhan's theories. Or, if you've claimed to understand the quote since you saw Annie Hall , you can now stop pretending. Watch Marshal McLuhan below. \nSee more of Daniel Savage's work on his website . \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:22:39.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
