Now scientists say they have uncovered the key to staying close – and it appears to be different for men and women. \nMen need to meet up face-to-face and bond over activities, according to the study of students leaving home for the first time, while for female friendships, long phone conversations can bridge the physical distance. \nProfessor Robin Dunbar, who led the work at the University of Oxford, said: “What determined whether [friendships] survived with girls was whether they made effort to talk more to each other on the phone.” \nHowever, talking had absolutely no effect on boys’ relationships, the study found. “What held up their friendships was doing stuff together,” said Dunbar. “Going to a football match, going to the pub for a drink, playing five-a-side. They had to make the effort. It was a very striking sex difference.” Should men invest more in friendships?

They were then followed up nine months and 18 months after the initial assessment. \nSpeaking to journalists on Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston, Dunbar said different friendship styles between genders could be behind the effect. \n“This is about the idea that women clearly have much more intense close friendships,” he said. “They’re very intense, very like romantic relationships – in the sense if they break, they break catastrophically.” \nBy contrast, men tend to have more casual friendships. \n“They tend to have a group of four guys that they do stuff with,” he said. “With guys it is out of sight out of mind. They just find four more guys to go drinking with.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:12:23.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
