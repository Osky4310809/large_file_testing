Or perhaps you need a little pick-me-up when the 3 p.m. slump hits you hard and you feel like crawling under your desk for a nap. This lassi, which makes use of in-season Meyer lemon zest and juice, is definitely the right drink for the job. \nIf you've never had the pleasure of drinking a lassi, you've really been missing out. We've featured several recipes on the site, including an avocado version, a strawberry version, a papaya-cardamom version, and a mango version. I think it's safe to say we are enamored of this simple drink. \nThe Indian yogurt-based drink is thick, creamy, and refreshing. Because the ingredient list is so short — it only calls for four items — this is one of those recipes where you really want to use the best-quality ingredients you can get your hands on. You'll be rewarded with a filling, protein-rich treat. \nFor this recipe you'll need plain yogurt, the zest and juice from about four Meyer lemons, honey, and ice cubes. That's it! You simply blend all the ingredients — including the ice, so make sure your blender is up to snuff — together before pouring into a glass. You can add extra ice cubes and garnish with a slice of Meyer lemon before diving in. \nOne sip of this luscious glass of sunshine and you'll be able to tackle whatever winter throws your way. Shoveling your car out of the driveway? No problem. Taking your pup for a walk in sub-zero temperatures? Let's go, Fido! \n→ Get the Recipe : Meyer Lemon and Honey Lassi from Kitchen Confidante More posts in Delicious Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:43:11.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
