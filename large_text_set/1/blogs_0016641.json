Take note that speed limits across all federal and state roads will be 10 km/h lower as part of Ops Bersepadu , according to The Star . \nFrom January 21 to February 5, the new speed limits will be 80 km/h on federal roads and 70 km/h on state roads, said transport minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai, adding that heavy vehicles will also be prohibited from using highways on January 26, 27, 31 and February 1. \n“In 2016 alone, the number of fatalities due to accidents had risen sharply to over 7,000 deaths,” he said. “This is very worrying. Statistics will remain statistics if we all don’t do our part to reduce the number of accidents.” \nSpeaking of statistics, Liow said that the number of fatal road accidents rose from 6,193 in 2015 to 6,570 last year, while the number of deaths climbed from 6,706 to 7,152. In total, 521,446 accidents occurred in 2016 compared to 489,606 the year before. \nHe also mentioned that 80.6% of those accidents were caused by human error, while 62.7% of fatal accidents involved motorcyclists. “The realities of the figures should be an eye-opener to everyone to adopt a safe and careful attitude when on the road,” he said. \nLiow added that integrated enforcement would be carried out under Ops Bersepadu , with the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety (MIROS) conducting an assessment of the effectiveness of the operation during the festive season.
