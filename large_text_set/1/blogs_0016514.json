Police say they believe Elaine, who did not have custody of the children, abducted Kimberly and Kelly after a domestic dispute. \nKimberly and Kelly were just 3 1/2 years and 10 months old, respectively, when they went missing. Elaine Yates was charged with Child Snatching in the alleged abduction of her daughters over 30 years ago. (Warwick Police Department) \nLast month, Rhode Island State Police said they received a tip about the whereabouts of the mother and her daughters. They worked with the Texas Department of Public Safety to find Elaine Yates living in Houston, Texas under the assumed name Leina Waldberg. \nAfter she confirmed to investigators that she was Elaine Yates, she was arrested and charged with child snatching Monday. \nThe news stunned Russell Yates. “It’s all about my children,” Yates told the Providence Journal. “I just hopefully they’ll want to get in touch with me. They’re adults now, so that’s up to them.” \nElaine Yates was being taken back to Rhode Island, where she will face arraignment Wednesday in Kent Superior Court in Warwick.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:58:39.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
