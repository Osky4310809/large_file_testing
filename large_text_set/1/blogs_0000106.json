I fell asleep in my car and I never saw him that night,” Fawaz told UK paper the Mirror . “The police know ­everything. That’s the most important thing.” media_camera George Michael’s lover Fadi Fawaz has added to confusion surrounding the singer’s death. Picture: News Limited \nLast week Fawaz was quoted by the same paper saying: “I stayed the whole weekend. I was there Friday night and then I found him Sunday.” \nIt followed a series of alarming tweets on Fawaz’s page declaring the superstar singer “wanted to die” and that his surprise death was actually a suicide. \nFawaz stated his Twitter page was hacked, denied he had posted them and promptly closed the entire account. \nNow another UK paper, The Sun , has quoted an anonymous source saying Fawaz was a “leech” and had broken up with Michael 18 months ago. \n“Fadi was a leech from the beginning,” the source claimed. \n“George realised this but I think he deliberately ignored it. He was grateful of the company. George relied on Fadi for many things. media_camera Early days: George Michael and Fadi Fawaz at the Andrew Charlton Pool cafe at Woolloomooloo.

Does this sound like a grieving partner?” \nFawaz is reportedly being interviewed by UK police over the death, which has been ruled to be ‘unexplained’, with more autopsy reports to come. \nFawaz and Michael had spent time together in Sydney, first stopped in February 2012. \nThe pair are believed to have started dating around 2009. \nLittle is known about Fawaz, whose age has been cited as 40, 43 and 46 in stories in the last week. \nAs well as a hairstylist to stars including Naomi Robson and Emily Blunt, he is also a photographer and has pictures, including self-portraits, on his Flickr site. \nMichael previously dated American Kenny Goss from 1996 until 2009 and Brazilian Anselmo Feleppa from 1991 until he passed away in 1993. media_camera", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:29:10.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
