As Beyoncé's \"Single Ladies\" blared from the speakers, the group of women took their places on stage — but Miss Netherlands, Zoey Ivory, couldn't just stand there. The 23-year-old began performing an impromptu dance routine, nailing the iconic video's choreography as best she could without stepping out of line. Her moves immediately caught the attention of eagle-eyed audience members, who shared video of Zoey to social media. You can just see how badly she's trying to restrain herself from getting down on the floor. \nAfter the clip of Zoey's moves went viral, she explained her hilarious actions to reporters . \"They said we can relax during the rehearsal so when I heard the music I was just being me,\" she said. \"At first I didn't even notice that people were looking at me. Then I started to hear the cheering and then I said, 'Oh my God, people are looking at me.' Then I went a little more full out.\" Oh, and she also confirmed that she is, in fact, a single lady .
