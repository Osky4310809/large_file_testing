It’s an opportunity to challenge the government on the NHS. \n“It’s an opportunity to challenge them on the chaos of Brexit . It’s an opportunity to challenge them on the housing shortage. It’s an opportunity to challenge them on zero-hours contracts. That’s what we’re going to be doing.” Jeremy Corbyn arrives at BBC Broadcasting House in London to appear on The Andrew Marr Show. \nAsked if he ever looked in the mirror and said: “Do you know what? I’ve done my best, but this might not be for me”, he said: “I look in the mirror every day and think “let’s go out there and try and create a society where there are opportunities for all. \n“Where there aren’t these levels of inequality. Where there are houses for all and where young people aren’t frightened to go to university because of the levels of debt they’ll get into.” \nMr Marr quizzed the Labour leader on a sticking point of the party’s campaign to hold onto the Cumbrian seat of Copeland - nuclear power. \nThe constituency is home to the Sellafield nuclear plant and next-door to Barrow-in-Furness, home to the shipyard building the Navy's new Trident nuclear submarines. \nSenior Labour figures fear the Conservatives - favourites to win the by-election - will highlight Mr Corbyn's lifelong opposition to nuclear power and weapons.

Your A&E department is at risk.” \nHe said the party would be working hard to protect jobs and pensions in the nuclear industry. \nHe said his aim was to move to a mix of power supply, “but we do have nuclear power and we will for a long time.” Read More \nAsked if he “still agreed with himself” on the idea of decommissioning nuclear power stations, he said: “We have a system which is a mix at the moment. Nuclear power stations last for a very long time. \n“Sellafield is going to be there for a long time as a reprocessing plant anyway, whatever happens.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T12:53:16.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
