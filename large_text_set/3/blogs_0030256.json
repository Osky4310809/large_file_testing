Listen, I’m not afraid of Yoel Romero,” Bisping said. \nWell, Romero would love to believe that he’ll actually fight Bisping as promised but he fired back at the middleweight champion via Twitter to scoff at the idea that he’ll face him instead of waiting around to fight St-Pierre instead. \n“I think Bisping will do as GSP wants,” Romero wrote. “He doesn’t have the heart nor the juevos to fight me. If he did he would fight me in July.” I think @bisping will do as gsp wants. He doesn't have the heart nor the juevos to fight me. If he did he would fight me in July. #ynuevo https://t.co/AOy8wUU548 \n— Peoples Champ (@YoelRomeroMMA) March 28, 2017 \nRomero has been forced to sit and watch from the sidelines as the true No. 1 contender in the middleweight division while the UFC opted to put together the fight with Bisping and St-Pierre. \nRomero has certainly earned his shot at the title, but with Bisping likely to face St-Pierre this year, it’s possible he may be forced to continue waiting to fight the winner or take another opponent in the mean time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:32:27.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
