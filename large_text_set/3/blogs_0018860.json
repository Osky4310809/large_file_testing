The full-back gave a measured response, saying: \nYes, any player is flattered by the interest of Barça, it’s the best club in the world and that is very nice, the fact that I grew up in Barca’s academy also gives me that extra bit of specialty, although I’m now focused on games and the season, the other will come later. \nWhen I left Barca my idea was not to return, because my exit was a bit complicated. I went to live my adventure in England, try to be a footballer and not return. But you don’t know what the future holds and you cannot close doors. Sport Witness noted Bellerin sounded more open to a return than he has previously: Sport Witness @Sport_Witness Seems significant, he's not really sounded up for it in the past. Still, a big ask for Barca to pay what Arsenal would want. 3/21/2017, 4:53:44 PM Per the report, he also said the future of Gunners manager Arsene Wenger could have an impact on his decision, hailing the importance of loyalty. When asked about links with Manchester City , he gave another diplomatic answer: \"I know there has been interest from the City; it's a compliment that a coach like [Pep] Guardiola thinks of me—that's a sign that things are going well.\" The 22-year-old has been an automatic starter for Arsenal at right-back when healthy this season and is widely regarded as one of the top talents at the position. While he hasn't been at his best in the 2016-17 campaign, he remains important for the Gunners. CESAR MANSO/Getty Images Barcelona happen to have a huge need at right-back, with Aleix Vidal suffering a gruesome ankle injury earlier this season. Sergi Roberto has deputised at the position, but he's a more natural fit in midfield and has been exposed in top matches. The Catalans' need and Bellerin's history at the club have led to plenty of speculation, but so far, the player has expressed his desire to stay at the Emirates Stadium at every turn. Newspapers like Mundo Deportivo have bombarded him with the same questions every international break, and so far, the youngster has handled himself well. The speculation and rumours will undoubtedly persist, and most pundits still believe he will return to Barcelona one day. It will take a huge transfer fee to convince Arsenal to sell, however, and a move this summer seems unlikely.
