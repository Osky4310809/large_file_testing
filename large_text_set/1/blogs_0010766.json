What may come as no surprise to cable TV or internet subscribers, Comcast remains among the least-liked companies in American history , according to a new survey from 24/7 Wall Street. From DSL Reports: [The survey] combines data from the American Consumer Satisfaction Index, JD Power and Associates and a Zogby Analytics poll, and lists Comcast as the \"most hated company in America.\" Comcast had made some small strides in the ACSI rankings last year, but even with minor improvements still consistently battles Charter for last place in most customer satisfaction and service studies. \"The company')s internet services received the fourth worst score out of some 350 companies. In J.D. Power's rating of major wireline services, only Time Warner Cable -- recently subsumed by Charter -- received a worse score in overall satisfaction,\" notes the report, which adds that Comcast received the worst scores in consumer costs, billing, and reliability. \"In 24/7 Wall St.'s annual customer satisfaction poll conducted in partnership with Zogby, nearly 55% of of respondents reported a negative experience with the company, the second worst of any corporation.\" Comcast finds itself ahead of numerous banks and airlines, but it isn't alone in the rankings among telecom providers. Dish Network is ranked eighth, the report noting that 47% of those polled reported a negative service experience with the company. Also on the list at tenth is Sprint, which had the worst customer service rating out of the more than 100 companies included in the survey. \"More than half of Sprint customers polled reported a negative customer service experience with the company,\" the study found.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T10:36:26.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
