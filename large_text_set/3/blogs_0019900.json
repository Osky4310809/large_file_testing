Rio Ferdinand pictured with his wife Rebecca Ellison (Photo: Enterprise News) \n\"At the beginning I was drinking a lot at night. We've got a lady who lives with us. She'd go to bed and I'd come down in the middle of the night and drink too much in the first three or four months,\" he told The Sun . \n\"It was a car crash. I was just lucky I had my kids, if I'm honest. \nBut although his children Lorenz, 10, Tate, 8, and Tia, 5, have got him through, he did struggle taking over his wife's role in the family. \n\"When they first went back to sfhool I woke up in the morning scrambling around,\" he said.

Then I've got one of them in the car going, 'Mum wouldn't do this'. \n\"You don't know what to do. You sit there.\" \nRio met his wife when he was just 21 when she worked as an accountant and he was an up-and-coming footballer.

A year later he proposed to her on a holiday to Las Vegas and they tied the knot in 2009 in an intimate ceremony on the luxurious Peter Island. \nIn a new BBC documentary, Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad, the 38-year-old reveals he planned their life around his retirement from football in May 2015. \nRebecca died the same month - just 10 weeks after being diagnosed with cancer. Rio Ferdinand and wife Rebecca (Photo: Rex) \n\"You realise playing football was a f***ing walk in the park compared to telling your kids their mum isn’t coming back. I’ve never had to do something so hard, so emotionally draining and testing,\" he told the The Times Magazine. \nSpeaking about how his kids are coping with losing their mum, he said his little girl is finding it easier than the boys because they're worried about how it will impact him. \n“I realised I wasn’t connecting with my kids about their mum. Especially the boys. My little girl sleeps with me every night. She will say things.

The boys will think, ‘This might makemy dad sad.’ I couldn’t get anything out of ’em.” \nRio, who is now rumoured to be dating TOWIE star Kate Wright , also reveals he drank a lot for a month or so after losing his wife. \n“At the time you think,‘I’m coping.’ You’re sitting there, the kids are in bed, you can’t sleep, but you don’t want to think about anything. That’s when the problems start. I never understood suicide. \n\"Then you sit there and you can understand how people get that low. It’s a lonely dark place. I can easily see why you just slip over that edge.” Rio is now rumoured to be dating TOWIE's Kate Wright (Photo: FameFlynet) \nFollowing Rebecca's death, Rio issued a short statement on the QPR website. \nHe said: \"My soul mate slipped away last night. Rebecca, my wonderful wife, passed away peacefully after a short battle with cancer at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. \n\"She was a fantastic loving mother to our three beautiful children. She will be missed as a wife, sister, aunt, daughter and granddaughter. She will live on in our memory, as a guide and inspiration. \n\"Myself, my parents Janice and Julian, along with Rebecca's parents Lesley and Stephen, would like to thank our families, friends and my club colleagues who have rallied around in these desperate days, weeks and months.\" \n*Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum And Dad is on March 28, BBC1 at 9pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:15:10.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
