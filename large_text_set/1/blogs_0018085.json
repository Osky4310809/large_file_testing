Well, now Korean beauty brands, Peripera, has something for the â€˜90s girls. If you loved Cartoon Network , chances are you have fond memories of three kindergarten students by the names of Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup. Nothing compared to watching The Powerpuff Girls as they defended Townsville, and fought their enemy, MojoJojo. To our delight Periepra has transformed our memories into a beauty line. Exciting isn't it? Here is what the collection contains. Hand cream \nIt has all three of them features on the packaging. Pick one after your favourite character. We love Bubbles. Lip stain \nWe love lip stains, and even more when they come in such cute bottles. Eyeshadow palettes \nDid you ever even dream of wearing an eyeshadow inspired by your favourite Powerpuff Girl? We didn't. Cushion compacts \nWe just have to get our hands on these. Cushion compacts are already having a huge moment, and when they come packaged like this, you want them even more. Mascara \nOh, even your eyelashes are in for a treat. \nYou can find all these products here .Or book a trip to Seoul, maybe?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:09:48.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
