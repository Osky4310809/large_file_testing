It's HillaryBeatTrump.org. \nSample headlines include \"Confused by fake news, Redditers [ sic ]think Trump is president,\" \"Mike Penceâ€™s latest hobby: Gardening with Grindr matches,\" and \"Approval ratings for President Clinton hit 89 percent.\" \nWhile the site's creators are unknown, they appear to be completely serious in their belief that Hillary Clinton should have won the election. The site's about page bids itself as a \"response\" to a \"Constitutional crisis.\" (Note: there is no Constitutional crisis.) They also call Clinton the \"true president.\" \nIt's been over a month since Trump was inaugurated, and people are still refusing to get a grip on reality. It'd be funny if it weren't so sad. \nTake a deep breath, everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:57:40.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
