(Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nVirginia is officially in a funk. \nThe Cavaliers have now lost four in a row and six of their last eight after Monday night's overtime loss to Miami , a team that's now vastly improved its standing while veering away from the bubble. Nevertheless, UVA could probably lose out and still be in the field of 68. But it's the Cavs' seeding that's been taken a beating. Once in the No. 2 seed range, they're now at the No. 5 line — which remember is upset city against a 12-seed Cinderella, typically — and flirting with a No. 6 seed. For a program that won the ACC in 2014 and 2015 and went to the Elite Eight last season, this is the first time in a while a Tony Bennett-steered Virginia team has fallen from elite to mediocre as March nears. \nIowa State got a nice road win in OT at Texas Tech and has moved to the No. 6 line as a likely lock for an at-large bid. None of the Cyclones' remaining games would be considered a bad loss, but similar to Virginia, their seed would be hurt. Texas Tech can no longer get an at-large bid as the Red Raiders' remaining schedule has no opportunities for \"big\" wins. \n► No. 1 seeds: Villanova, Kansas, Gonzaga, North Carolina \n► Last four in: Syracuse, Tennessee, TCU, Clemson \n► First four out: Kansas State, Georgia Tech, Wichita State, Georgetown \n► Others considered for at-large bids (in no particular order): Vanderbilt, Wake Forest, Providence, Indiana, Alabama, Penn State, Pittsburgh, Illinois \n► On life support: Rhode Island, Houston, Ohio State, Georgia, Ole Miss \n► No longer considered: UConn, Texas Tech, Texas, Texas Arlington, Charleston, New Mexico, Boise State, LaSalle, Davidson, Chattanooga, Saint Bonaventure, Saint Joseph's, BYU, Oklahoma, Charleston, Nebraska, Temple, North Carolina State, Stanford, Nevada, Texas A&M, Memphis, Utah, Iowa, Auburn \n► Multi-bid conferences: ACC (10), Big Ten (7), Big 12 (6), Big East (6), Pac-12 (5), SEC (5), A-10 (2), AAC (2), WCC (2). \nMORE COLLEGE HOOPS Undefeated Gonzaga once again No. 1 in coaches poll Conference Leaders \n► Or highest RPI from projected one-bid conferences - (23 total): Vermont (America East), Florida Gulf Coast (Atlantic Sun), North Dakota (Big Sky), UNC-Asheville (Big South), UC Irvine (Big West), UNC-Wilmington (CAA), Middle Tennessee State (Conference USA), Valparaiso (Horizon), Yale (Ivy League), Monmouth (MAAC), Akron (MAC), N.C. Central (MEAC), Illinois State (Missouri Valley), Boise State (Mountain West), Mount Saint Mary's (Northeast), Belmont (Ohio Valley), Bucknell (Patriot), Furman (Southern), New Orleans (Southland), Texas Southern (SWAC), North Dakota State (Summit), Texas-Arlington (Sun Belt), New Mexico State (WAC). \nBanned from participating: Hawaii, Southern Mississippi, Alcorn State, Savannah State, Northern Colorado Transition Schools, ineligible for the tourney: Abilene Christian (Southland), Grand Canyon (WAC), Incarnate Word (Southland), Massachusetts-Lowell (American East) \n*** \nNote: All RPI and statistical data is used from WarrenNolan.com . \nAbout our bracketologist: Shelby Mast has been projecting the field since 2005 and has finished as one of the top 5 national bracketologists for his website, Bracket W.A.G.
