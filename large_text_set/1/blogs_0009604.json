Just when you thought you couldn’t see another black tuxedo, Pharrell Williams comes along to shake things up. Never one to go for the expected, Williams dug into the Chanel archives for his Golden Globes look. Selecting pieces from Pre-Fall 2012’s Paris-Bombay Métiers d’Art show, he brought back a well-loved collection and put his own singular spin on it. With his paisley embroidered white tuxedo jacket, his necktie held in place with a bejeweled broach, and several layers of bling, Williams gave the night its most daring menswear moment. \nThe musician is a longtime fan of the Chanel and has been wearing Karl Lagerfeld ’s designs for years, but his Globes look proved exactly how much he loves the French house. He certainly let his luxury loyalties be known to Ryan Seacrest, schooling the E! host on the Paris-Bombay collection. The only question which now remains is whether the fashion-forward musician has another inventive Chanel outfit waiting in the wings for the after party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T06:39:36.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
