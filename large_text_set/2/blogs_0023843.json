Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWayne Rooney's decision to stay at Old Trafford – at least until the end of the season – is a move that will ensure his legacy at Manchester United will not be tarnished. \nFor make no mistake, if the United and England captain had walked out three months before the end of the season for a mega-money switch to the Chinese Super League his reputation would almost certainly have been trashed. \nAnd it would have been a self-inflicted wound. \nThe hysteria of recent days over the likelihood of him leaving in the midst of a season in which United are still fighting on four fronts would have been nothing to the deluge of abuse that would surely have been poured over him if - as United and England captain - he'd walked out on English football. \nRooney's always been a fighter. His instinct has always been to come out battling when his back has been against the wall.
