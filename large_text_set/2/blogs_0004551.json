To be surrounded with vibrancy all year round has great benefits.” Developers pledge to preserve iconic Shoreditch graffiti wall \nLee Bofkin, co-founder of Global Street Art, said the Chalk Farm estate project was a pilot for a wider programme called “Art for Estates”. The initiative is free and aims to increase the amount of public art in London housing estates. \nHe told the Standard: “We’ve started speaking with other estates around London and we’re looking to expand the programme. \n“London is a great city with a lot of great artists living here and visiting from all over the world. It has been historically difficult to provide artists with great walls to paint. \n“There is an opportunity to do two really good things at once- provide estates with great art and provide artists with great walls.” \nCouncillor Pat Callaghan, Cabinet Member for Housing at Camden Council, said: “This is a community led initiative, which has seen residents and artists working closely together to produce this striking artwork. \n\"We’re always happy to see these sorts of ideas come to fruition as they help create clean, safe and pleasant environments on our estates, and reflect the creativity Camden Town and its environs are famous for.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:14:45.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
