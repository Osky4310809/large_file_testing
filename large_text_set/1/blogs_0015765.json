(Elise Amendola/AP)  55 PM \nJorge Posada is one-and-done. \nPosada received just 3.8% of the vote in first his first year on the ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame, and will be removed from the ballot going forward as a result. \nPosada, who received only 17 votes, needed to get a minimum of 5% of the vote to remain on the ballot for 2018. \nPosada was probably a borderline candidate at best, but his exclusion from the ballot after just one year is disappointing. \nWhile perhaps never \"passing the eye test\" or being considered the best catcher in the game during his 17-year career, Posada's offensive numbers are hard to ignore. \nAmong all-time catchers, he ranks 19th in total WAR (42.7), eighth in home runs (275) and eighth in OPS (.848). \nConsider: Just two of the eight qualifying catchers in MLB this past season posted an OPS that high, Jonathan Lucroy and Wilson Ramos. \nIt is possible, then, that Posada's career playing baseball's most demanding position will be looked upon more favorably as the years go by. \nPosada played during the steroid era, but has said he never took steroids or any performance-enhancing substances, nor was he ever linked to them. \nHis chances of getting even the minimum required votes were probably hurt by the fact that several players from that era — highlighted by Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens — still remain on the ballot and have been bunching up. \nThis year, there were 34 players on the ballot. \nNevertheless, Posada will always be revered as a great Yankee and an esteemed member of the Core Four. He wore his heart on his sleeve and came through with several key playoff hits during the franchise's most recent dynasty. \nFor now and forever, five championship rings and a plaque in Monument Park will have to do.
