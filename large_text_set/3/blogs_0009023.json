Joe Murphy/NBAE via Getty Images Loading recommendations Team Quotes On why he changed the starting lineup: We’re stale. Right now we’re 14-14 since January 1. It’s my job to shake it up and there were some good things about it and overall, at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter who was on the floor for us. We couldn’t guard them off the dribble. That’s the bottom line. We have to solve this puzzle of speed. I mean that’s just the bottom line. Until we start getting places earlier in the mind, we’re going to continue to struggle with it. That’s really our biggest Achilles heel right now: handling speed off the dribble, getting back on defense, all of those things, and being quicker to the ball. All of those speed areas right now we have to get better. -- Coach Fizdale See what Coach Fizdale had to say after the game On the mood of the team: This is our lowest point, I think, this year. If you call this adversity, this is the most adversity we’ve probably faced. I’m shuffling the lineup. We’re on a three-game skid. We just lost at home to Brooklyn. No offense to them, they earned this win tonight but that’s a game we have to win. Credit to them. They really outplayed us, played harder than us, played faster obviously. This is our lowest point. This is the challenge now and we always talk about how this will reveal our character and it’ll test us to see where we are as a team, as a collective unit, and how together we are. This is why I’ve preached being collected all year; it’s why I preached bigger than me because we’re going to hit these points. Ours just happened to be going on at a time that’s not really favorable for us right now with us chasing home court. We’re hitting our adversity. You don’t get to choose when that happens and ours just seems to be happening now and we have to weather the storm. That’s why we have core values, that’s why we say words like ‘all in’ and ‘connected’ and all of those things and now it’s time to live it. -- Coach Fizdale On trying to improve late in the season: We’ve got a lot of things that we are still looking for. During the game, there are a lot of little games being played, a lot of too many things that we are trying to accomplish during the game. We don’t have that much time left to get ready for the playoffs. I think it’s now there has to be one goal, and that’s what’s best for the team, not what’s best for one guy or another guy. What’s best for the team, how we have the best chance of being a great team and making it to the playoffs and that’s it. We have a lot of guys here that have been through it for a lot, and I trust every single one of them that they are going to do the right thing. -- Marc Gasol On the change in starting lineup: We all practice together; we all play together. I don’t think that’s it. It’s more listening and trusting and I don’t know exactly. I wish I could put my finger on it and tell you exactly what it was, but it’s hard. It’s hard because there are too many little things. Defensively, it’s too many breakdowns from way too many places. There are fouls on the ball and then we have one thing and we do something else. -- Zach Randolph Player Notes Per Elias Sports Bureau, the Grizzlies are the first team to shoot 7-of-7 or better from three-point range in a quarter since Cleveland shot 9-of-9 in the first quarter on Nov. 15, 2014 vs. Atlanta. The Grizzlies also shot a season-high 58.3 percent (21-36 FG) in the first half and recorded first quarter season highs in points (34) and field goal percentage (.706). It was their second highest field goal percentage for any quarter this season. Mike Conley (32 points, 9-15 FG) is averaging 29.0 points per game over his last five games. It marked his 13th career 30-point game and eighth of the season. He averaged 32.0 points per game against Brooklyn this season. Brandan Wright started his first game of the season for the Grizzlies. He recorded nine points (4-6 FG) and four rebounds. Vince Carter (1,330) passed Moses Malone (1,329) for 16th in NBA history for career regular season games played. Randy Foye shot 4-of-4 from three-point range, tying a season-high for three-pointers made and scored 14 points in just 16 minutes of play. Sean Kilpatrick led the Nets with 23 points, recording career highs in free throws made (16) and attempted (17).
