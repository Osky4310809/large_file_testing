Although rumblings of a boycott began after Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in November, the numbers swelled after Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., attacked Trump last week as not being a “legitimate” president and vowed to boycott the inauguration, saying it would be the first time he had ever done so. \nTrump fired back and in the course of the controversy, it was revealed that Lewis had also boycotted the 2001 inauguration for former President George W. Bush, a fact Lewis has since said he forgot. Advertisement - story continues below \n“I think he just grandstanded, John Lewis , and then he got caught in a very bad lie, so let’s see what happens,” said Trump. \n“He conveniently doesn’t remember. How do you forget if you go to an inauguration? I can tell you when I was at inaugurations and you don’t forget something like that,” Trump said. \nTrump said he’d be willing to sit down with Lewis but added, “We’re off to a bad start.” \nMeanwhile, Trump’s team echoed his call that if Democrats choose not to attend, they let others do so.
