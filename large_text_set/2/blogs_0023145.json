At 30-seconds long, it’s hard to get a proper gauge of the wider storyline, but what we do know is that Smith will (once again) assume the role of a cop in a preternatural world where humans co-exist alongside weird-looking elves and shotgun-yielding orcs. And no, we’re not talking about the state of Georgia.\nBright was directed by Suicide Squad’s David Ayer (gulp) and also stars Joel Edgerton and Noomi Rapace. Look out for it hitting the streaming platform later this year.\nIn related news, here’s every show coming to and leaving Netflix in March.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:53:00.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
