A study published in the journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection found that marijuana contained multiple bacterial and fungal pathogens that can cause serious infections. The weed samples tested positive for the fungi Cryptococcus, Mucor and Aspergillus, and for the bacteria E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii.\nLet us paraphrase: Smoking weed could give you E. coli. “The mold and bacteria was so widespread and potentially dangerous that the UC Davis academics concluded that they cannot recommend smoking raw or dried weed ,” Dennis Romero wrote in an article published by LA Weekly .\nMarijuana Is Not Safe to Smoke, Researchers Say https://t.co/dzFJT1a3vd pic.twitter.com/UxondsPDRU \n— The New Science (@NewScienceWrld) February 14, 2017 But what about edibles? Romero spoke with George Thompson III, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the university. Thompson stated that cooking weed into baked goods might be safer since the heating process could kill the bacteria and fungus. But he wasn’t sure if concentrates such as wax, honey oil, and dabs that involve heat in the production process of “butane extraction” would be safer.\neggrole / Flickr The danger is greatest with patients with weak immune systems (such as those with HIV or cancer). Thompson told the Sacramento Bee that “for the vast majority of cannabis users, this is not of great concern.” However, he also he stressed that there isn’t really any safe way to smoke marijuana buds, even for those in great health.\nHeath Alseike / Flickr The bacteria and fungi found in the weed samples can lead to serious, possibly even lethal illness. Smoking the mold and bacteria provides a direct path for the infectants to where they can do extreme damage — the lungs.\nWell, at least we finally no the answer to the eternal question: No, we actually cannot have anything nice in life without it being ruined in some way.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:33:23.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
