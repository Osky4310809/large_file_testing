John Guthro \nGary, your question hit like a ton of bricks, the world needs poets and dreamers, the creative people. I read this story as part of my job with Zulama Modern Learning, one of the people who most influenced our program is Don Marinelli, Drama Professor at Carnegie Mellon. Who was instrumental in creating STEAM that’s STEM with an A. Just wanted to let you know, we are trying. Ameelia Brown \nHi Thom Markham, very nice post, \nSource: \nassignment help Philip Rolt \nInteresting post. It’s also important that when research has been done and validated that it is heeded. \nI get frustrated when we know how to make things better but teacher opinion and politicians meddling take us down a different path. Frontiergirl \nIt’s important to note that “teacher opinion” is the MOST important aspect. After all, they are the ones in the trenches who actually know what they’re talking about. Research means pretty much zilch. Teachers often give the powers that be the data that is being looked for just so they can be left alone to do what needs to be done in their classrooms. If the education paradigm was overseen by teachers vs. politicians and psychomatricians, we would start seeing real progress. After all, when you go to the doctor, do you want him/her to use their knowledge and skill to treat you, or the president’s wife’s so-called knowledge? It is totally frustrating as a teacher when people who don’t know what they’re talking about determine what will be taught and how it will be taught. When ex-librarians (oh, excuse me, a president’s wife) decided to instate “No Child Left Behind”, no one listened to the teachers who cried, “BULL-****” Now we are dealing with this fallout. The “different path” that “teacher opinion” would take us down would be educating students to take their place in society as fully functioning and equipped individuals. Teachers get frustrated when they know how to make things better but meddlers with vested interests and little to no classroom experience meddle and take education spiraling downwards….and then say it’s the teachers’ faults. Hogwash. Garreth Heidt \nI enjoy Thom’s posts and just bought his PBL handbook. Here, as with most of what he’s written, I’m on board…except when he gets to the paragraph on redefining smart and writes: “Figuring out how to teach, instill, or elicit these strengths in children as they move through school is the most acute challenge education has ever faced. No one really knows how to design a system that leads to ‘better’ people—and yet that’s the task.” I’d argue that we do know how, and it’s couched in an educational tradition that goes back to the times of Plato…namely, a focus on a liberal education. \nA scan through the literature on “liberal education” in the past decade or so will reveal not only the laments about the abuses the liberal arts have taken in the face of the professionalization of our institutions of higher education (and, I’d even argue, our high schools), but will also reveal a growing number of articles on a liberal education and liberal arts approach as being crucial to success in the ever changing world. \nI’ve championed the liberal arts since I started teaching a middle school humanities course over two decades ago. The curriculum I helped to create is guided by two questions culled from the world of design: “Why are things the way they are?” and “How can we make them better?” The first question guides inquiry, the second empowers students (and all human beings) with agency. \nFor a look at how that curriculum develops and why as well as the books and authors who served as a foundation for this approach (and Gary Burjank, there’s plenty in my curriculum for the dreamers, the poets, and all the arts–The “A” that John Maeda (among others), President of Rhode Island School of Design, helped insert into the STEM acronym to turn it to STEAM), take a look at this– http://www.academia.edu/5013559/STEAM_Power_for_a_Better_Future — a paper I published through the Industrial Designers Society of America for their 2012 Education Symposium in Boston. \nInteresting post. Thank you for sharing this. It’s totally valuable and incredible info! \n>>www.xduce.in Jaimin \nNice post. Enjoyed reading it. \nWe are providing the tools to bring the new dimensions to the traditional teaching with tuvalabs to support the same, its just one drop in the ocean, but there are so many possibilities to diverse the education and break the boundaries of traditional education. Its a long way to go, I am sure we will get there one day. Larryalobo \nHow to create a system to make ‘better people’ is not the same as creating a system that helps or trains people to succeed and for success. If teachers mainly listen to other teachers, is not that an echo chamber of a sounding board of improving an existing system rather than reinventing things to go from teaching to learning? Lots of efforts and impulses in k-12 are around issues of fairness, equality, making up for past wrongs in history, tolerance, diversity, tolerance yet not offending, anti-religion, sameness between the sexes, everyone wins so no focus on competition (not even how to best cooperate), etc. and not as much on how to increase intelligence, academic understanding and performance, etc. Why do I say this? because there is little to no emphasis on study skills, critical thinking skills, skills to get organized, learning to learn skills, etc. New research puts focus on growth mindset, grit, perseverance, resiliency, etc. but you need a change in the system not just an improvement (more of the same but better) for this pivot to happen Sponsored by Become a KQED sponsor Post navigation", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:14:00.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
