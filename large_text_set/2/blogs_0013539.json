Maybe theyâre not conservative or theyâre too far conservative,” she said. Advertisement - story continues below \n“If itâs opposite to what you believe in I want you to give them a hug. And if theyâre somebody online I want you to hashtag #BringJoytotheWhiteHouse. And I want you to put hearts on it. HeartsâŚ Thatâs my number one request,” she said. \nIn addition to asking fans to buy her album I Make the Static , VillaÂ asked that fans go online and spread her message using the hashtag #BringJoytotheWhiteHouse, a place where she hopes she will be invited to sing. \nHer video recounts the positive reaction to her gown was beyond her wildest dreams. Amazing @Joy_Villa put her career in danger 2 support @realDonaldTrump at the #GRAMMYs Plz #BringJoyToTheWhiteHouse to sing! @KellyannePolls pic.twitter.com/1uoZbPsP15 Defense Secretary Mattis Tells Nato It Must Commit To Increased Defense Spending \n“The explosion of my album sales, No. 1Â on iTunes, No. 1Â on Amazon, I could never have foreseen this. Honestly, I did think Iâm going to face a backlash and this that may crush my career. And I said, âYou know, this is what I have to do,'” she said. \nIn an interview with Breitbart, Villa said her gown was a response to the “suppressive atmosphereâ of Hollywood. \nâI was tired of the bullying ,â she said. âI was tired of being pushed down so that I couldnât say my beliefs. And being fearful of losing sales. Losing fans. Losing bookings. Losing contracts and sponsorship. You know, thatâs my day to day. And a lot of my friends have the same thing. And we live in Hollywood, which is supposed to be the most open viewpoint city. But the truth is there was a lot of hate and a lot of negativity and I wanted to change the storyline to love and support and unity as an American.â \nVilla said being a Trump supporter in an industry that is largely against him means hiding what one truly believes. \n“It was really like a closeted feeling. And I know gay Trump supporters in my community who say, âThis feels like being closeted again. I feel like I canât come out of the closet and talk about being a Trump supporter because I will get attacked,'” she said. \nVilla said the positive reaction to her Grammys stunt far outweighed the negativity. \nâHonestly, I did get some hate,â she said. âI got some dirty looks. I got a guy who said, âI would like to step on it.â You know. I got the negativity. But they didnât come up to me and say anything except for that one person. The people who poured their heart and soul and actually came up to me and took photos with me and said, ‘I just wanted to tell you I love you.’‘I love your dress.’‘I love what youâre doing.’ Those were the overwhelming majority that day. Even at the Grammys.â \nVilla said the dress was not just about publicity. It was about changing attitudes. \nâLike hey, maybe if she is proud of what she believes in maybe I can leave her alone. Maybe I can leave my friend alone. Maybe I can leave my brother alone. Maybe I can actually still love them even though they disagree with my politics. Thatâs what we need. A little bit of tolerance,â she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:29:35.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
