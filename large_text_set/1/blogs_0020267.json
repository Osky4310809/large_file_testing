I don’t think kids should be taught that Western society is perpetrating a war on black people.” \nThe program does not have official union support, according to ABC News , and Paslay said he thought it was “a fringe thing, but attracting a lot of headlines.” In an article for Chalk and Talk , Paslay outlined 10 reasons for skipping the celebration. \nCharlie McGeehan, an English and history teacher who has helped organize the program, denied that Black Lives Matter was anti-police (as if “ Pigs in a blanket! Fry ’em like bacon!” were friendly) but spoke of the necessity of “validat(ing) our students’ experiences. Many of my students have had negative experiences with police officers. To ignore that is to deny their reality in a way that doesn’t make sense.”   \nJohn McNesby, president of Lodge 5 of the Fraternal Order of Police, did not agree but apparently wasn’t worried. \n“We don’t agree with it. We think there’s a lot better subjects that could be taught,” McNesby said. “I don’t think too many people pay attention” to the Caucus of Working Educators. \nThe program provides for daily lessons at all levels from kindergarten through 12th, and includes T-shirts, buttons and “The Revolution is Always Now” coloring pages. According to The Inquirer, “The organizers want teachers to think about lessons based on the 13 tenets of the Black Lives Matter movement, from empathy and diversity to transgender affirming and unapologetically black.” \nMany of the commenters on The Inquirer’s story were unapologetically furious about the whole idea.
