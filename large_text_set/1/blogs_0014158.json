For his portrayal, he earned six Emmy nominations and won a Golden Globe.\nThe show continued for two more seasons after Carell left, before wrapping up in 2013. Since leaving, he has found success on the big screen, earning Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his dramatic turn in Foxcatcher , and another Globe nod for his performance in The Big Short .\nBreaking News: \"The Office\" returning to NBC.\n— Steve Carell (@SteveCarell) January 18, 2017 \nWait, sorry. I meant \"Will and Grace\" (Typo)\n— Steve Carell (@SteveCarell) January 18, 2017 \nWhile Carell and The Office may not be returning, the British version is… kind of. Ricky Gervais, who created and starred in the original UK Office , is resurrecting David Brent, the character Michael Scott is based on, for the upcoming Netflix mockumentary David Brent: Life on the Road .\nThis article originally appeared on EW.com \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T03:21:53.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
