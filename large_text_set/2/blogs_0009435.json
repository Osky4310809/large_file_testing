Alan Pardew Alan Pardew (Photo: Dan Mullan) \nCrystal Palace sacked Alan Pardew in December thinking they'd be better off with Sam Allardyce at the helm. It's not quite turned out that way. \nSince Pardew's exit Palace have picked up a paltry four points from eight games and they now have an escape job of their own on their hands. \nThe 55-year-old is not a manager you'd want in charge for a long-term project, but in the short-term he has previous for breathing new life into a club. Gary Rowett Gary Rowett (Photo: Nathan Stirk) \nHarshly sacked by Birmingham City last year, Gary Rowett has been out of a job since mid-December. \nHe was doing a good job at St Andrew's when the Birmingham board decided it was a good idea to bin him and bring in Gianfranco Zola. \nSwansea were said to be seriously considering Rowett as a replacement for Bob Bradley before plumping for Paul Clement last month and Rowett is sure to be in Leicester's thoughts if Ranieri is canned. Mark Warburton Mark Warburton (Photo: PA) \nMark Warburton is fresh on the market after his bizarre exit from Rangers over the weekend. \nRangers issued a statement on Friday night announcing they'd accepted Warburton's resignation, before the Englishman sensationally came out and said he knew nothing about the statement and claimed he hadn't resigned. \nThe following day Rangers' chairman, Dave King, revealed Warburton's employment was terminated because he wasn't committed to the club. \nWarburton had a 65% win percentage as Rangers boss and guided them to promotion back to the Scottish Premiership last season. \nRangers failed to provide a credible title challenge to Celtic this season but, all in all, Warburton did a good job at Ibrox and it won't be long before he's back in the game. Avram Grant Avram Grant (Photo: Getty Images) \nAvram Grant is a man with Premier League pedigree and is available after resigning from his position as Ghana boss. \nHe's managed Chelsea, Portsmouth and West Ham in England and knows his way around the top flight. \nIn reality, he's the least likely to be considered out of the five managers in this list, but, then again, remember how much of a surprise it was when Ranieri was appointed as Pearson's successor in 2015? poll loading Will Claudio Ranieri last the season as Leicester manager? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:02:48.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
