While some advocate for elaborate cleansing and pampering rituals, such as vaginal steaming (looking at you, Gywneth!), most professionals recommend simply washing with mild soap and water—or even just water alone—and letting Mother Nature take care of the rest. At the end of the day, though, the best feminine care approach is the one that works for you —after all, you know your body better than anyone else. Unfortunately, for those who prefer a more hands-on approach to cleansing and grooming, there are a lot of products on the market that aren’t all that safe for your sensitive lady parts ( douching , for instance, which has been linked to ovarian cancer, is a pretty big no-no). The new VMAGIC Feminine Lips Stick , however, is not one of them.

It’s made for use on your vulva—or, basically, anything external—but won’t cause any irritation if it gets inside your vaginal canal, since it’s all-natural and is made without chemicals, irritants, and preservatives. Instead, the formula features a handful of organic food–grade ingredients, including olive oil, avocado oil, beeswax, and honey. Supposedly, the Feminine Lips Stick is even safe to eat (although, we can’t guarantee it tastes any good). And, if you're into this sort of thing, last week Khole Kardashian announced in her app that she used another VMAGIC product—the Skin Cream—calling it \"Aquaphor for your vagina.\" Want more?
