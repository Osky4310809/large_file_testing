Well, Gurmeet Choudhary and Debina Bonnerjee are doing just that. The couple are bringing in Gurmeet’s birthday in what looks like Dubai’s Burj Khalifa. Gurmeet has taken a break of five days to spend some quality time with Debina. The lady wished her husband in the most romantic manner posting a snap from the balcony of their room. We see a shirtless Gurmeet looking hot as hell holding some white rises while Debina leans against the balcony. The lady’s post read: Happy birthday to u my love. Wish for u the sun the moon and the stars. It’s ur bday and u never fail to make me feel #ontopoftheworld always. Awww!

I cannot disclose the location as it is sort of a secret. The best part is that my look from Laali Ki Shaadi Main Laddoo Deewana will be unveiled tomorrow.” The actor plays the role of Veer in this rom-com set in small-town India. The film also stars Vivaan Shah and Akshara Haasan. Gurmeet’s last film Wajah Tum Ho made news with the steamy scenes between Sana Khan and him.

Though they have been married for around five years now, they like to spark alive in their romance. Debina often posts lovey-dovey snaps of the good-looking couple. Last year, they posted a cute video where they were seen dancing on the title track of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, which went viral. The actor will also be seen in a play in the UK, where he will play Lord Ram while Debina is seen on &TV’s Jai Santoshi Maa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:24:39.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
