Those who know me know I never let pain or discomfort get in the way of a show, and I am truly heartbroken to have to cancel, but the doctor said I have to rest today so I can make it through the rest of tour. I want to give you my all so stay tuned for further details on a rescheduled show. If you want a refund it'll be available at point of purchase. I'm going to rest now and come back strong to continue the tour. I love you and thank you s much for your support and understanding.” \n(Read more story below.) A post shared by JoJo.
