Saw was instrumental in the expansion and growth of SM’s footwear line and a happy witness to its evolution as a company. “SM started out with just shoes, and now it has become so much more,” he says. \nSaw believes in the importance of being able to grow and learn with your company. “Believing in your company’s vision is necessary, but integrating that same vision into your everyday life is one of the most important aspects of all,” he says as he talks about how SM has helped him grow over the years. \n“It was an honor for me to witness how SM evolved as a brand, and how involved the Sy family was in making their every vision a reality,” Saw says as he narrates how the family of entrepreneurs hold on to the vision of providing shoes to every Filipino. He goes on to tell the story of SM, from its humble beginning in downtown Manila, to conquering major cities in the country and the international arena. \n“After saying all of that, I can say that shoes will always be one of the group’s top priority – it’s in our DNA,” Saw declares. \nAccording to Saw, Coson was the driving force behind the success of SM’s footwear brands. “Mrs. Coson saw the need to do things above and beyond the company’s capacity – despite our leadership position at the time – in order to ensure long-term success. Thus, the concept of the Merchandise Business Unit was formed. This unit enabled SM to focus more on what was important – growing the shoes and bags business strategically and tactically,” Saw explains. \nAs the head of the department, Saw makes sure that the unit’s merchandising, marketing and operations teams are working closely together to be able to execute plans and produce campaigns that would put SM’s shoe and bag business at the forefront. \n“Through the unit, SM was able to strengthen an already bulletproof brand,’’ Saw boasts, adding that SM has become an icon of success for Filipinos, expanding its business endeavors from shopping malls to residential, hotels, commercial and convention centers. Simply Shoes: Reliable footwear for every Filipino \n“Our new project, Simply Shoes, aims to offer quality shoes at affordable prices,” Saw declares. “This is Mr. Henry Sy’s ultimate vision, to bring a piece of SM to communities where The SM Store is not present at the moment,” he adds. \nSimply Shoes is a one-stop shoe shop that offers a wide assortment of affordable shoe selections for the entire family – men, women and children. Its first store opened less than three years ago and as of March it opened its 25th store in Ayala Mall Legaspi. \nIt carries a large assortment of brands for both practical and aesthetic uses, including SM’s iconic Parisian brand. It also carries other brands as seen in SM such as Milanos, Salvatore Mann, Solemate, Sprint, among others. \nNot wanting to leave kids out of the fun, Simply Shoes also carries brands that cater to children, such as Sugar Kids, Tough Kids, Barbie, Fisher Price and other brands. \n“Not only do we want to reach out to communities and give them quality, affordable shoes, we also want to be able to show them that there are bigger and better things waiting for them at The SM Store,” Saw says. \nSM plans to open a total of 100 Simply Shoes stores by 2018, bringing SM shoes and bags a step closer to a lot of communities, especially women, nationwide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:00:08.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
