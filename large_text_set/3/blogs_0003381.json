Hugh Grant is prime minister… again! And here he is. Our Prime Minister. Again.

I’ll go) us the following screengrab from the sequel that will be released on Red Nose Day on March 24 (and on May 25 in the US), she posted confirmation of a particular relationship. \nAre you ready? Here it is. Our pm is still married.
