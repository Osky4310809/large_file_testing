(WBZ-TV) \nThe firefighters escaped and called for help. They could not fight the fire on their own because flames blocked them from accessing their equipment. \n“We’re very fortunate they were able to exit the rear door of the building, but they were not able to get into the apparatus floor or to access any of their gear,” Cotreau said. \nCotreau said the fire started on the first floor near one of the trucks, but the cause is not yet known and may take several days to determine. \n“The investigation is focused on the center bay, where most of the fire damage is,” he said. The equipment burned costs about $3,000 a set according to the Concord Fire Chief. (WBZ-TV) \n\nOne engine was heavily damaged. Another engine and an ambulance both have smoke and heat damage. \nAccording to the chief, the gear damaged runs about $3,000 a set and the engines cost nearly $500,000 apiece. \nIt’s not just the money, though. Firefighters say the helmets that were burned were special to them. \n“We go through a lot of calls with our helmet. Typically when you retire, your helmet is awarded to you. It becomes sentimental to a lot of us.” Soot covered another fire department vehicle after the fire was put out. (WBZ-TV) \n“I don’t think anything is a total loss,” Cotreau said.
