The holiday is celebrated each year on February 20th, though for many of us, it’s an everyday occurrence. Although pets aren’t permitted at Disney Springs , there are plenty of ways to spoil your favorite canine companion during your next visit to the property … just pick up a little something from one of the spots listed below to show them just how much you care. (And yes, most of the offerings here are for dogs, though I do know a cat-lover who has picked up a few accessories and made them work for her feline friends!)\nSprinkles Cupcakes : Their cupcakes for humans are among my favorite baked goods on the planet, so I have a hunch that the doggie version is just as delightful for Fido. At only $3 each, these sugar-free cupcakes topped with a yogurt “frosting” are a smart way to treat your pup.\n\nOrlando Harley Davidson : Is your furry friend “bad to the bone”? If so, accessories from Orlando-Harley Davidson may be your ticket to ride. With leashes, accessories (the black leather cap tops my list!) and toys, you’ll find something fierce.\n\nHappy Hound : I’ve visited this Marketplace location before, but new leashes featuring Disney characters – everything from classic Mickey to the latest Anna and Elsa designs – caught my eye this time around. I also love the magnets and ornaments that let you show the world which breed you adore most.\n\nDisney’s Pin Traders : Need a new tag for your dog? The easy-to-use engraving machine lets you personalize a Disney-inspired design in minutes. It’s a sought-after souvenir that won’t take up too much space in your suitcase. \n\nWorld of Disney : The “Disney Tails” collection has been a fan-favorite for years now. I can’t imagine a more fitting chew toy than one shaped like a Mickey Mouse Premium Ice Cream Bar … can you? The bow tie collection is another winner, especially if you’re four-legged friend is the fashion forward type. \nDid you acknowledge “Love Your Pet Day” this year? If so, let me know how you celebrated in the comments below. If not, it’s never too late!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:05:57.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
