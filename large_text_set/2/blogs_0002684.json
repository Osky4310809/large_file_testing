I think if we auctioned it off it would probably sell for a million. That's a lot for a modern jersey. The key is that you probably have to sell it very quickly because now is the time when people are the most excited and the most fanatic about these kinds of things. Five years from now something else will happen, something else will occur and it will probably go down in value.\" \nWithout the disappearance of the jersey and everything surrounding the Super Bowl, the value of the jersey according to Evans, would probably around $250,000. \n\"But now with all this hoopla, if you could find the right guy you could sell it for a million,\" he said. \nIf it's stolen though? \nWorthless, at least in a auction place like Leland's, he said. \n\"It's such a big story that you couldn't sell it legitimately â€¦\" he said. \"There is probably a black market for sports memorabilia. I'm sure it's not as technical as that, it's just a guy willing to own something like that knowing that it's stolen. But I don't know those people. So to me it's worth zero, but you know, legitimate it's amazing. Illegitimate? It's un-sellable.\" \nThough a million may seem like a hefty sum, it's nowhere near the highest that Lelands has fetched for a sports jersey. The auction house once sold a Babe Ruth jersey to $4.5 million to a private buyer. \nIf Brady's jersey is stolen - and not innocently misplaced - he won't be the only one with some stolen memorabilia. Several piece of Kobe Bryant memorabilia was stolen recently from Lower Merion High School according to Philly.com.
