But imagine you already have a brand and a label, but you need to change it to better fit what your business has become. With an already established group of customers and a public image, does that process then become more difficult or easier to manage? Does the decision become a wise one, or one you probably shouldâ€™ve left.\nThis was the challenge facing three French entrepreneurs, eyewear enthusiasts, and university friends when they decided to change switch up from See Concept to new name IZIPIZI . Itâ€™s also what the three discuss in the mini-doc, above, where they discuss the process and offer advice for anyone wanting (or needing) to do the same.\nIZIPIZI (then known as See Concept) as a brand has become synonymous with easy flair and a less-than-serious outlook to fashion and the wider world.

See Home and See Magnet were then launched for personal use within the home, but it wasnâ€™t until the brand decided to simply design and create their own frames that the brand picked up.\nCool outfit by @onurollstyle ðŸ‘• #seeconcept #mensfashion #outfit #menswear ðŸ‘– \nA photo posted by SeeConcept is becoming IZIPIZI (@izipizi) on Nov 28, 2016 at 11:51am PST \n\nIZIPIZIâ€™s collection now encompasses a broad range for all ages, from reading glasses specially adapted for long-term computer use (scree), sunglasses (sun) as well as the more standard reading glasses, too.\nFor more on IZIPIZI, check out the collection .\nMore Info ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T16:19:30.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
