Expectations that this would be another tight affair were wide of the mark, with both sides storming forward and having clear chances before the visitors took the lead. The strike was a stunner too; Saul stormed down the right wing, cut inside and curled a superb left-footed shot into the far top corner of Bernd Leno's goal. \nBayer tried to hit back quickly, but ended up leaving too much space behind. Centre-back Aleksandar Dragovic's howler let in Gameiro and he expertly teed up Griezmann to ram in the second goal via the crossbar. It should have been 3-0 soon afterwards when the duo again combined intelligently, but this time Leno saved very well from close range. \nSchmidt's young team looked already beaten at that point, but they reacted well after the break and scored within three minutes when Bellarabi fired across Moya from close range. The game continued to be more spread than either manager would have liked and Gameiro soon tricked Dragovic to win a penalty, which he converted himself, only for Moya's error to give further hope to the home fans. \nTorres' late header then made it 4-2 and seems to have killed off any hopes Bayer have of a comeback in the second leg. But then few would have predicted a six-goal thriller at the BayArena. \n2. Sought-after Atleti trio impress again \nIn previous years, Atletico have often progressed in European competition under Simeone by grinding out results, especially away from home. There was little of this on Tuesday, as Los Colchoneros took every chance to attack and were rewarded with four different excellent goals. \nThe game was still pretty even when Saul got the ball far out on the right wing with 17 minutes gone. Then the homegrown midfielder charged forward, hurdling Kevin Kampl's tackle and, as he reached the penalty area, standing up Dragovic before curling a perfect 20-yarder out of the reach of Leno and into the far top corner. It was remarkably similar to his goal in the Champions League semifinal at home to Bayern Munich last season, and a fifth for the 22-year-old in 25 appearances in the competition. Saul Niguez opened the scoring for Atletico Madrid at Bayer Leverkusen with a stunning curled effort in the 17th minute. \nGriezmann is more established at this level, but there were questions when his form dipped last autumn and he looked badly in need of a rest. Since the winter break, though, he has looked revitalised -- and he hammered his shot into the net after Gameiro had taken full advantage of a howler from Dragovic. In doing so, the 25-year-old became Atletico's all-time European Cup top scorer, passing club legend Luis Aragones' mark of 12 goals. \nAtletico's man of the match, though, was Gameiro -- who sprinted behind Bayer's high defensive line again and again. After hitting the crossbar on one break, he next tricked the hapless Dragovic and fell just inside the area, with referee Willie Collum pointing to the spot. Simeone's side had missed their last three penalties in all competitions, including Gameiro against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey, but he stepped up without nerves and hammered the spot kick straight down the middle. \nSubstitute Torres also joined the fun late on, when he got across his marker at the near post to guide in an excellent header from a pinpoint Sime Vrsaljko's cross. All four goals were well constructed and expertly taken. Atletico scored just six goals in seven knockout games when reaching the final last year. Maybe this year they are taking a different approach. \n3. Bayer get some hope from Atleti defence \nAt 2-0 up, Atletico looked in total control of the tie, so it was a surprise to see Simeone's previously solid side give up a goal so quickly after half-time. It came from a well-constructed move, with Kampl spreading the ball wide to the overlapping Benjamin Henrichs and the youngster picking out Bellarabi in front of goal. But the whole left side of the visitors' defence had been quite easily exposed. \nThen at 3-1 ahead it was time for Atletico to seal things up and see out the remainder of the game. But Julian Brandt was able to get the ball over from the left wing and Moya made a complete mess of a cross he should have dealt with easily. The own goal was credited to Savic, but the culpable party was the backup goalkeeper, who had kept his place despite first choice Jan Oblak being fit enough to make the bench. \nAt this point Bayer realised that Atletico are not the watertight unit of previous seasons, with the injured Diego Godin badly missed too. Simeone recognised the difficulty and removed Gameiro to bring on an extra midfielder in Thomas Partey. The final stages then saw waves and waves of home attacks, with Hernandez having at least three chances to make it 3-3. Even after Torres' fourth goal there were some hairy moments at the back. This was Atletico, but not as we know them. \nDermot Corrigan is a Madrid-based football writer who covers La Liga and the Spain national team for ESPN FC.
