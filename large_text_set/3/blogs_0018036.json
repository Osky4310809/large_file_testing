Instead, the video revealed a horrible reality. Williams lay for days naked and paralyzed on the cell floor, with food occasionally tossed in and water kept just out of his reach. Repeated calls for help were ignored by both the prison guards and the medical personnel.\nWilliams was initially arrested in Owasso, Oklahoma, on a misdemeanor obstruction complaint, according to the World . Owasso officers responded to reports that he was suffering a mental breakdown, and he was taken into custody after he refused to obey police orders to remain seated. Instead, Williams reportedly approached officers and told them he wanted them to shoot him. He was pepper sprayed and taken to Tulsa County Jail, where he rammed his head into the door of a holding cell and broke his neck.\nThe state medical examiner ruled that Williams died of \"complications of vertebrospinal injuries due to blunt force trauma\" and was suffering from dehydration, per the World report.\n\"We believe that this prolonged and reckless neglect, in the way that they treated Elliot Williams in the Tulsa County jail, really constitutes one of the worst civil rights violations in U.S. history,\" Williams' estate lawyer, Dan Smolen, told KRMG.\nDefense attorney Guy Fortney indicated to the World that he will be meeting with the current sheriff to discuss future plans, including potentially appealing the decision.\nWilliams' family meanwhile said the ruling, while satisfying, isn't enough. \"No amount of money is going to bring him back,\" Williams' brother Kevin Williams told the World . \"People need to be going to jail. There needs to be criminal charges filed.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:34:33.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
