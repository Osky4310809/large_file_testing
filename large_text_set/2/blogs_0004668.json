When the boat went to retrieve Stewart, he was no longer in sight. Crew members believed Stewart had passed out as well and floated off. \n“He was very close to where he disappeared,” Capt. Jeffrey Janszen, commander Sector Key West, told the Florida Keys News. \nRELATED: ‘Sharkwater’ documentary filmmaker goes missing after surfacing from dive \n“Our hearts and prayers go out to Mr. Stewart’s family and friends, especially his parents Brian and Sandy, and the Canadian community during this very difficult time,” Janszen said in a statement. \nRob’s father, Brian Stewart, said “The Coast Guard has been like family. They have been overwhelmingly supportive.” \nThe Coast Guard command center coordinated 27 searches totaling more than 95 aircraft and surface hours and covering approximately 5,987 square miles, an area larger than the state of Connecticut. \nStewart’s 2006 documentary “Sharkwater,” which examines global shark hunting and its impact on the ocean ecosystem, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and went on to win 40 awards at film festivals worldwide. \nHe was working on “Sharkwater: Extinction.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:01:20.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
