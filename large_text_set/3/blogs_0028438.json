Janssen's only goal from open play was against third-tier Millwall, who already trailed 4-0 (Photo: REUTERS) \nThe Holland international was brought in to provide competition for and back-up to Harry Kane, but has struggled to fit into the Londoners' system. \nEven with Kane injured, manager Mauricio Pochettino has often used attacking midfielder Heung-min Son up front instead, and Janssen’s poor goal record — four of his five have been penalties, and he's still yet to score from open play in the Premier League — will see him offloaded this summer. \nPochettino will be keen to use the cash to strengthen his squad, as last year’s deals had mixed results — £30m Moussa Sissoko is another heading for the White Hart Lane exit, but fellow midfielder Victor Wanyama has been a huge success.
