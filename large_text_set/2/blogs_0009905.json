In the UK, this includes local taxation and import duties, but we pay for everything we make in US dollars. \n“Over recent months, there has been a significant change on the US Dollar to GBP exchange rate. As a result, our existing pricing has become unsustainable and, like many other companies, we have to increase prices for all products priced in GBP.” \nThe new Sonos UK pricing will come into effect on February 23. \nIt’s not a uniform 25 per cent hike — but certain products, such as the Sonos Connect:Amp and Playbar, are going to be a quarter more costly than they were, with £100 being added to their price-tags. (Sonos lists all product price changes here .) \nThe company is not alone in reworking its local pricing as a result of Brexit-triggered changes to the exchange rate of pound sterling. \nLast month Apple raised the UK price of apps by 25 per cent — having already similarly dialed up its local pricing for Macs, back in October . \nMicrosoft has also inflated cloud product pricing for UK enterprise customers in the wake of the Brexit vote, with pricing up to 22 per cent more expensive since January. \nWhile those seeking to escaping the dismal prospect of Brexit by stepping into HTC Vive’s virtual reality were among the first to have to stump up more cash; in August HTC slapped an extra £70 (aka a 10 per cent ‘Brexit tax’) to the local price of its VR headset , hard on the heels of sterling’s post-referendum slump. \nExpect plenty more tech companies to follow suit. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:39:40.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
