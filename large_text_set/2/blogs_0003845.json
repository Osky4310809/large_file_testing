Behind bars: Elliot Nash was jailed for 52 weeks (btp) \nNash admitted assault and two public order offences at Birmingham Crown Court last month. \nHe was jailed for 15 weeks at the same court on Friday. Foul-mouthed: Elliot Nash swore at train staff (BTP) \nPC Nicola Mallaber said: \"Despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Nash had the audacity to deny the offences initially, only changing his plea when the case went to trial. \n\"As the footage shows, his attitude is completely unacceptable and there was absolutely no need for this to have escalated into violence ... all for the sake of a £2.20 fare. Brutal attack: Elliot Nash launches a flying kick at train inspectors (btp) \n\"No member of rail staff should be spoken to in this way or attacked simply for doing their job. We hope this spell behind bars will teach Nash a valuable lesson and make him review his behaviour in the future.\" \nLondon Midland's head of security and revenue protection, Darren Hanley, said: \"No colleague or customer should have to see behaviour like this when travelling by train. \n\"Fare-dodging, anti-social behaviour and violence will never be tolerated by London Midland.
