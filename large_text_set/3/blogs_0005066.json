And now Twitch is about to give streamers another way to make some dough — the video game-based streaming platform announced yesterday that someone watching a streamer play a game can, in certain instances, buy that game right then and there through Twitch. A cut of that sale will go to the streamer, the video game company moves another unit, and everyone's happy! Right? \nso hyped for increased commerce *emote* *emote* *emote* (source) \nBetween this new way to make money from game sales and the already available subscriptions and donations from fans, it's becoming easier and easier to become the dad in that tweet, making his income all through Twitch streaming. How far away are we from a completely Twitch-based economy? What if we all find ourselves in five years waking up at the crack of dawn on Monday morning, pouring ourselves a cup of joe, and sitting down at the computer to play Counter-Strike , forced to make small talk with dickPumper420_xXx about our weekend? Will we write off our capture cards on our taxes? How will our politicians address jobs in a purely stream-based economy? \n\"We will create thousands of jobs when the new Zelda comes out. Countless men and women will be out there grinding for a new PB, that much I can tell you.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:34:40.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
