February 27, 2017 \n10:13 p.m. ET: Gael García Bernal and Hailee Steinfeld presented the animation prizes, with Bernal telling the crowd, \" I'm against any form of wall that wants to separate us.\" Piper won for best animated short, and Zootopia won for best animated feature, with the Disney blockbuster's team emphasizing that the film is about tolerance. \n10:02 p.m. ET: Consider us stung. Lion star Dev Patel introduced Sting to perform his nominated song \"The Empty Chair\" from Jim: The James Foley Story . \n10:00 p.m. ET: Sending a bold message. The Salesman won for best foreign language film, but its Iranian director, Asghar Farhadi , opted to skip the ceremony, and prominent Iranian-American Anousheh Ansari , the first female space tourist, accepted the prize on his behalf. \nShe read a statement from the director, who explained that he was absent because he felt \" disrespected by the inhumane law that bans the entry of immigrants into the U.S. Dividing the world into the 'us and our enemies' categories creates fear.\" \n9:55 p.m. ET: What might have been! Kimmel said that the night's theme is \"inspiration,\" and he praised his own personal hero, David Letterman . \"If it wasn't for David Letterman, I probably would have finished college — maybe I would be a doctor now,\" the host joked. \nIn a taped segment, Charlize Theron praised Shirley MacLaine 's performance in the best picture-winning 1960 comedy The Apartment. Then, the two ladies took the stage to present best foreign language film. \n9:48 p.m. ET: \"We are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life,\" Davis said tearfully in her powerful speech. She thanked Fences playwright August Wilson, who \"exhumed and exalted ordinary people.\" About costar and director Denzel Washington, she said, \"Oh, captain — my captain!\" \n9:41 p.m. ET: Another acting prize, and another expected victory — but still an exciting one nonetheless! Viola Davis wins best supporting actress for Fences . \n9:40 p.m. ET: Mark Rylance ( Bridge of Spies ), winner of last year's best supporting actor Oscar, took the podium to hand out best supporting actress. Rylance said that opposition leads to great performances, adding that women are better than men at \"opposing without hatred.\" \n9:36 p.m. ET: Kimmel introduced Hacksaw costar Vince Vaughn as a \"conscientious objector who decides to work with Mel Gibson anyway.\" (Ouch!) Vaughn then acknowledged the recipients at the Governor's Ball earlier this month, including international superstar Jackie Chan . \n9:33 p.m. ET: It's a commercial break, so you have time to check out Justin Timberlake hilariously photobombing Emma Stone on the red carpet earlier tonight: \n9:31 p.m. ET: Aliens and guns prevail! Arrival wins for best sound editing, and Hacksaw Ridge nabs best sound mixing. \n9:25 p.m. ET: It's not pizza (a la Ellen DeGeneres ' ceremony from a few years back) or Girl Scout cookies ( Chris Rock 's 2016 contribution), but it's something . Kimmel said it's \"un-American\" to watch movies without candy, leading Red Vines and Junior Mints to fall from the ceiling on little parachutes. \"Time to find out how well those Spanx really work,\" Kimmel quipped. — Us Weekly (@usweekly) February 27, 2017 \n9:15 p.m. ET: Ready to make a splash. Dwayne Johnson, part of the Moana voice cast, introduced Lin-Manuel Miranda and 16-year-old Auli'i Cravalho (who voiced the title character) to perform the film's \"How Far I'll Go.\" Too bad she got whacked in the face with a flag! \n9:12 p.m. ET: Kimmel earned a groan from the crowd by joking that currently incarcerated O.J. Simpson has earned an \"extra slice of baloney on your sandwich.\" 12 Best Dressed Stars at the Oscars 2017 \n9:10 p.m. ET: Real-life heroine! Hidden Figures stars Taraji P. Henson , Janelle Monáe and Octavia Spencer introduced Katherine Johnson , the real-life former NASA employee who Henson played in the film, and the crowd gave Johnson a standing ovation. The group then presented best documentary to O.J.: Made in America , and director Ezra Edelman dedicated the film to the families of victims Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. \n9:07 p.m. ET: Another Trump jab! According to Kimmel, Doctor Strange was nominated for best visual effects and also named \"Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\" \n9:03 p.m. ET: This is that great time of the night early in the ceremony when the critically panned movies start earning awards before the more heralded films. Case in point: Kate McKinnon and Jason Bateman presented best makeup and hairstyling to Suicide Squad , giving the lambasted blockbuster a trophy before the more favorably received La La Land . Next, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them won for best costume design. Oscars 2017 Red Carpet Fashion: What the Stars Wore \n8:54 p.m. ET: Kimmel told all serious journalists to leave the room, as \"fake news\" won't be tolerated. He added, \"Fake tans, we love.\" \n8:48 p.m. ET: The first award is for best supporting actor, and the winner here is no surprise: Moonlight 's Mahershala Ali . The actor got emotional and acknowledged his acting teacher for emphasizing the characters. \"I'm so blessed to have had the opportunity,\" Ali said of working on the powerful drama. \n8:41 p.m. ET: Kimmel called out Meryl Streep and joked that she has \"phoned it in for more than 50 films.\" He asked the legendary actress, nominated this year for Florence Foster Jenkins , to stand up as the crowd applauded her 20 career nominations. \"Nice dress, by the way — is that an Ivanka?\" Kimmel joked to Streep, who gave a powerful speech at the Golden Globes last month condemning President Trump's actions. Oh just 20 nominations for Meryl Streep! #Oscars https://t.co/Hmv5Sb3M9P pic.twitter.com/I7JdsCni1v — Us Weekly (@usweekly) February 27, 2017 \n8:39 p.m. ET: Kimmel referenced last year's #OscarsSoWhite controversy, saying, \"I want to say thank you to President Trump — I mean, remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?\" He added that in Hollywood, people aren't discriminated against based on where they're from: \"We discriminate against them based on their age and weight.\" \nThe host pointed out that he wouldn't be able to bring the country together tonight: \"There's only one Braveheart in this room, and he's not going to unite us either. Mel [Gibson], you look great — I think the Scientology is working.\" (To his credit, Gibson smiled uncomfortably throughout.) \n8:37 p.m. ET: Kimmel urged viewers to reach out to someone with a different perspective than their own. This led him to address his infamous, long-standing \"feud\" with Matt Damon: \"I've known Matt for so long, when I first met Matt, I was the fat one.\" \nHe then praised Damon for not taking the lead Manchester by the Sea role that would ultimately fetch star Casey Affleck a nomination. Kimmel said that Damon \"made a Chinese-ponytail movie instead. And that movie, The Great Wall , went on to lose 80 million dollars. See, it's so easy to reach out and heal.\" — Us Weekly (@usweekly) February 27, 2017 \n8:35 p.m. ET: Host Jimmy Kimmel took the stage to a \"sitting ovation.\" He told the crowd, \"It's my first time here, and the way you people go through hosts, it's probably my last time here.\" He said there the ceremony is being broadcast in \"225 countries that now hate us.\" \n8:33 p.m. ET: \"I know you know this one, Denzel,\" Timberlake quipped as he segued to a snippet from the Bill Withers' 1977 soul hit \"Lovely Day.\" \n8:31 p.m. ET: The night begins! Justin Timberlake entered the Dolby Theatre singing his nominated Trolls tune , \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\" He continued the performance on stage, complete with some impressive dance moves, and he had the star-studded crowd bobbing their heads along with him. Especially adorable was watching wife Jessica Biel cheering him on from the audience. \n8:27 p.m. ET: Hey, girl.
