They lived and died for our nation.\" By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 26, 2017 11:32 AM PM Narendra Modi held 30th episode of Mann ki Baat on Sunday morning. (Source: PTI) \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi held his 30th radio address of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on Sunday morning at 11 am. In his previous episodes, he has talked about various issues like Board exams and Swach Bharat Abhiyan. In his last episode, PM also talked about individuals who have contributed in the various government policies. In his previous episode, he gave a shout out to IAS officer Param Iyer for emptying a toilet pit in a bid to support the ‘Swach Bharat’ Abhiyan. This was PM Modi’s first ‘Mann ki Baat’ episode since BJP ’s whopping victory in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. The party won 325 out of 403 seats in the state wiping out other political parties like Samajwadi Party, Congress and BSP. \nHere are 5 key takeaways from PM Modi’s 3oth episode of ‘Mann ki Baat’: \n1. All is not over with Bangladesh \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Bangladesh on its Independence Day by saying, “India will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Bangladesh.” This statement came one day after Union Minister Rajnath Singh saying that India is planning to seal its borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh as soon as possible reflecting that all is not over with the neighbouring country. \nYou may also want to watch: \n2. Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru are still an inspiration \nPrime Minister hailed the freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru’s contribution by saying, “Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were not scared of death. They lived and died for our nation.” He added that these icons are still an inspiration for the youth. \n3. Mahatma Gandhi’s contribution was special \nEven though there is no doubt about it, PM Modi re-established the fact that Mahatma Gandhi was a special and unique personality. “We are marking 100 years of Champaran Satyagraha. And this was one of the earliest Gandhian mass movements in India. He returned to India and in two years he went to Bihar and what he did inspire the whole nation,” PM added. \nYou may also want to watch: \n4. New India is the new aim \nAfter winning the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced his idea of ‘new India’ and he once again stated that it will manifest the strength and skills of 125 crore Indians, who will create a Bhavya and Divya Bharat. This was a clear hint that going into the future elections BJP will thrive on the ‘new India’ idea. \n5. Backing digital transactions \nSince his demonetisation drive, PM Modi has time and again talked about digital transactions and online banking. Today he added, “India has extended support to the movement towards digital transactions. People of India have rejected corruption and black money .”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T09:05:01.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
