Chop the garlic and add it to the boiling water with the pasta. In a large mixing bowl, add the yogurt, salt, Italian seasoning, and red chili flakes. Give the mixture a stir. Once the noodles are cooked through, turn off the heat, strain, and return the noodles to the hot pot. Add the butter and toss so the pasta is coated. Carefully add the pasta to the yogurt mixture and stir until the sauce is evenly distributed. Sprinkle with the parmesan cheese and give it another toss. Serve with half a chicken breast on top, a sprinkle of parsley, extra cheese, salt and pepper to taste, and a tiny pinch of nutmeg.
