One evening when Padmini was feeling particularly sad, she walked out of her house and saw a puppy staring back at her. She picked the puppy up and instantly found a reason to continue. Padmini realized helping street animals finally allowed her to find peace. She soon started Mission Possible Pet Adoptions , an animal welfare initiative that rescues homeless animals . Long time family friend and renowned cancer specialist, Dr. Ravindra Kasbekar, joined Padmini on her crusade. Amazingly, Padmini and Ravindra have rescued, treated, vaccinated, and fostered hundreds of animals. Padmini’s house is home to more than 100 rescued dogs and cats at any given point of time. \nIn 2015, Mission Possible Pet Adoptions was officially registered as a trust and has since helped over 1,000 homeless animals into loving, forever homes . Mission Possible Pet Adoptions plans to build a bigger shelter. \n\n\nPadmini believes every animal deserves a chance to survive. Every day, Padmini and Ravindra pick up chicken and broken wheat and head out to feed the strays. Between feeding strays, they spend their time giving medicine to injured dogs and starting saline drips for the sick ones. Padmini and Ravindra also file police complaints against animal abusers and will even wade through garbage to pick up starving puppies. \nIf you feel inspired after reading this story, you can make a difference in the lives of homeless animals just like Padmini simply by volunteering at your local animal shelter. Organizations rely heavily on volunteers to assist with animal care and day-to-day operations. There’s never a shortage of things to do and opportunities are available for people of every skill set. You can help take dogs for walks, give them food and water, and make sure their area is clean. If your preference is helping out behind the scenes, you can volunteer your services by assisting with fundraisers, outreach events or general office tasks. And please, always adopt and never shop!
