As I said, he has very good qualities and I think he’ll make further progress. \n“This French generation has a lot of talent, offensively and defensively. It’s a good thing for the French team and we’ll see what happens.” \n29-year-old Gameiro joined Atleti this season after a hitting 29 goals for Sevilla last term, and revealed the secret to the Madrid club’s recent success has been the passion and intensity instilled by coach Diego Simeone. \n“Simeone teaches a culture of winning. We see that he’s passionate and he passes that on to us before every match,” Gameiro said. \n“He’s someone who lives football, who eats and sleeps football. He’s done great things since he arrived at Atletico and we have a lot of respect for him because he has brought this club to a very high level. I hope he will continue for a long time.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T09:05:38.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
