But one guy just took falling asleep in public to the next level by crashing directly in front of Boston doom metal band Fórn as they played a blistering set in Brooklyn early Saturday morning. The band’s bassist sent footage of the show over to Spin and, sure enough, there’s a dude in a red shirt clearly passed out mere inches away from lead singer Chris Pinto. \n“Apparently, 3 a.m. is too late of a set time for some people, like the dude who is passed out on stage the entire time that somehow none of us realized,” the band wrote on their official Facebook. Based on the fact that it’s almost impossible to nap through such intense noise, some folks were initially worried about the red-shirted sleeper, but the band confirmed to Spin that he is, in fact, “still alive.” Not only that, but he probably got a great night’s sleep. \nCheck out the video above via Pit Full of Shit .
