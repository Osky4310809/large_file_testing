It’s not OK to support oppression. # boycottralphlauren # imwithtomford”\nAnd while some may beg to state the designer had no choice in dressing Melania as the First Lady could have chosen to wear any brand, her powder-blue dress was a custom creation from Ralph Lauren.\n[Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] “The brand designed a custom-made powder-blue dress for the new First Lady, which she wore with matching elbow-length gloves and diamond earrings.”\nThis means the clothing retailer did in fact make the decision to dress Mrs. Trump for her husband’s inauguration. And it seems some of the public is not happy with the brand’s decision to do so as they criticized them online and called for the boycott. One Twitter user even created an account to mock Melania with the handle “First Tramp @callgirlmelania.”\n“Shame on you @RalphLauren for dressing the wife of incoming dictator. Anything for a buck. #BoycottRalphLauren #GrabYourWallet”\nAnother Twitter user said they’re throwing away all of their own Ralph Lauren items in protest of the brand.\n“Shame on you RalphLauren throwing all your garments I own into the trash. #BoycottRalphLauren”\nHarper’s Bazaar also reported on the statement made by a Ralph Lauren spokesperson regarding the boycott.\n“We immediately started to get complaints about Melania Trump wearing [the label]. And people are using the #boycottralphlauren hashtag.”\nHowever, the brand also dressed Hillary Clinton for the inauguration, yet people aren’t protesting the Democrat wearing the brand.\n“Lauren also dressed Hillary Clinton for the inauguration, who wore a white pant suit. The move is thought to show an apolitical stance.”\n[Image by Pool/Getty Images] Glamour also reported on the blow-back over Melania’s outfit, saying not all the responses are negative. Camille Grammer, former wife of actor Kelsey Grammer, also took to Twitter to share her opinion.\n“Politics aside.. Melania’s outfit is superb! Stunning! #dress #RalphLauren”\nAnother Twitter user agreed with Camille as they stated Melania looked stunning in the custom-made dress.\n“Melania Trump looks STUNNING in #RalphLauren inauguration outfit. Can’t wait to see the next four years of her fashion in The White House.”\nWhile some people are trying to force their political ideologies on the designer, Glamour states Lauren has never made his political affiliations known and has dressed numerous First Ladies.\n“Lauren has a history of dressing first ladies, regardless of their political affiliation, having dressed Hillary Clinton, Nancy Reagan, and Betty Ford. As WWD reports, Lauren the man has never endorsed a candidate or disclosed his political affiliation.”\nThe site also quoted a spokesperson from the brand saying the inauguration was an important day for everyone to look their best, and Lauren took an apolitical stance by dressing all Melania, Hillary, and Michelle Obama for the weekend, yet nobody is bringing up the latter two.\n“The Presidential Inauguration is a time for the United States to look our best to the world. It was important to us to uphold and celebrate the tradition of creating iconic American style for this moment.”\nOn the flip side, several designers stated early on that they would refuse to dress Melania if they should be asked. However, it’s noted that the First Lady did not seek them out as the designers statements were hypothetical.\n“Designers such as Sophie Theallet, Tom Ford, and Marc Jacobs have all stated publicly that they would decline dressing Melania Trump should they be asked.”\nIn contrast to those designers who would refuse if asked to dress Trump, others have stated they would love to work with the “beautiful” First Lady. Carolina Herrera, Thom Browne, and Tommy Hilfiger all stated it would be an “honor” to dress her, with Hilfiger saying any designer would be proud to work with her.\n“I think Melania is a very beautiful woman, and I think any designer should be proud to dress her.”\n[Featured Image by Pool/Getty Images]\nRalph Lauren Boycotted After Brand Dresses Melania Trump For Inauguration is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:32:23.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
