Or laughing. The company had a hard enough time trying to convince people not to blow on cartridges; now people like Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann and Kotaku's Mike Fahey are trying to eat  them. They along with many others discovered that the cartridges taste absolutely rancid.\nTurns out Nintendo has decided to intentionally apply a bittering agent called  denatonium benzoate to cartridges. This is safety measure to deter people, specifically children, and perhaps pets from chewing on or eating the bite-sized carts. Although denatonium benzoate is \"the most bitter compound known,\" it is non-toxic. Still, you might want to rinse your mouth out afterwards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T17:20:28.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
