Why? Because if Planned Parenthood gets defunded, safe sex will go out the window. No more safe sex, you guys: Just so we're clear: Trump wants to repeal Obamacare and defund planned parenthood, so millions have no tools to provide safe sex options. \n— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 10, 2017 \nNever mind that Planned Parenthood essentially admitted that their entire raison d’être is abortion, not birth control or “women’s health.” Or that Planned Parenthood has fought tooth and nail against over-the-counter birth control . Wow. Sounds like maybe Planned Parenthood shouldn't have worked to block the GOP bill to make birth control over-the-counter. Shame on them. https://t.co/b92LWBwBiU \n— Eric Spencer (@JustEric) March 10, 2017 \nColor us shocked that Chelsea has no clue what she’s talking about. Our public discourse is garbage, Part MCMXCVI. https://t.co/f7SBaU5Mf5 \n— Jay Cost (@JayCostTWS) March 10, 2017 For loving science so much, progressives sure have a tough time understanding where babies come from. https://t.co/S1rDOnUqld \n— Sean Davis (@seanmdav) March 10, 2017 @chelseahandler so it's the governments responsibility for people to have safe sex 🤔 hmmm \n— Alex Bernardon (@AlexBernardon) March 10, 2017 @chelseahandler just so we're clear…there are many more options than the abortion mill…have you ever heard of a drug store?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:37:51.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
