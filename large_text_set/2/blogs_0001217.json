Then I went downstairs and about 10 o'clock, I had some Weetabix with banana,\" Lallana said. \n\"At midday, my old man was up at my house so he made bacon and egg sandwiches in a bap, so I had two of them. \n\"I got into training at 3pm for recovery and had a yoghurt and a Ryvita-type bread with chicken on and another shake. \n\"We did recovery and then after that, I had pasta, chicken and veg. We travelled to Sunderland, got there about 8.30pm at night and there was a big sandwich station set up for us -- so I had two big sandwiches, packed with meat, and a yoghurt. \n\"Then the next day, on the morning of the game, you eat as much as you can.\" \nBy our reckoning, that's an overall count of roughly 2,680 calories in less than a day -- 680 more than the recommended intake for the average man. \nNo wonder Lallana is all energy. \nChris covers the funny side of the game for ESPN FC in the Toe Poke blog.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:58:38.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
