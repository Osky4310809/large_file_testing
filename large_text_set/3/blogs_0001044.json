Just hrs after @DefineAmerican hosted press conference w/ undocumented immigrants speaking. Un-American #FreeDaniela https://t.co/2tnRIkDmGD — Ryan M. Eller (@EllerRyan) March 1, 2017 \nAt the press event organized by the Immigrant Rights Alliance, Vargas spoke about her fears of deportation and called on the Trump administration to offer amnesty to those in the country illegally. \n\"A path for citizenship is necessary for DACA recipients but also for the other 11 million undocumented people with dreams,\" Vargas said. \nHer father and brother were detained by ICE agents on February 15. Vargas herself was questioned by agents, who showed up with a warrant at her home, but told them she was protected under the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, according to immigration officials. \nAs it turned out, however, Vargas had let her DACA status lapse in November 2016, and only reapplied for renewal in February. According to Peterson, the delay was due to her having to save up the $495 for the application fee. Look at Daniela Vargas, the DREAMER being deported. Was saving $ to renew her DACA. It's 495 to apply. No payment plan. Nothing? — Cristela Alonzo (@cristela9) March 3, 2017 \nVargas was brought to the US from Argentina at age 7. At the time, Argentina was part of the visa waiver program, which allows certain foreigners to stay in the US up to 90 days. Individuals who overstay their visas have no right to a hearing or to contest their deportation unless they are asking for asylum. \nCritics of President Donald Trump’s policy of deporting immigrants who are in the US illegally have embraced Vargas as a landmark case, using the hashtag #FreeDaniela on social media. Release Dany from detention NOW! #FreeDany #FreeDaniela — United We Dream (@UNITEDWEDREAM) March 2, 2017 \n“ICE’s assertion that her detention is ‘routine’ is absurd and seems anything but,” Representative Bennie Thompson (D- Mississippi), the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement on Thursday. “Those like Ms. Vargas just want a better life for themselves and their families.” \n“We are all Daniela Vargas,” tweeted Pablo Manriquez, former Democratic National Committee staffer made famous by WikiLeaks disclosures in 2016. We're All Daniela Vargas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:37:43.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
