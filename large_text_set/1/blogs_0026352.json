It’s official, Iris Apatow is Leslie Mann’s mini-me and her appearance at Sundance proves it.\nOn Friday, the youngest Apatow, stepped out on the red carpet with her parents, Mann and Judd Apatow and she couldn’t have looked more grown up.\nWe barely recognized the 14-year-old actress as she attended the Sundance Film Festival premiere for The Big Stick .\nApatow looked gorgeous in a powder-blue, floral frock, with black tights and cute black booties. It might’ve been snowing in Utah, but the beautiful star didn’t appear to be cold as she shined on the carpet.\nNicholas Hunt/Getty Images As she spent the weekend with her famous family, it was clear that Apatow is SO her mom’s mini-me . They look so similar and we just can’t get enough of them together.\nC Flanigan/FilmMagic/Getty Images It’s been 10 years since we first saw Iris and her sister Maude in Knocked Up and now the youngest Apatow daughter is the spitting image of her gorgeous mother. Their hair, their smile (or little smirk) and cheeks are pretty much identical. \nGeorge Pimentel, C Flanigan/FilmMagic/Getty Images The last time the high-school actress was on the carpet with her mom, we also noticed how similar they look standing side-by-side. It’s not just their gorgeous locks and red pout that match. They have almost the same eyes, too!\nJerod Harris/WireImage/Getty Images Honestly they are basically twins and it’s so darn cute.\n\nA photo posted by @irisapatow on Jan 12, 2016 at 3:09pm PST \nWhat do you think about this mother-daughter duo?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:04:52.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
