The Chameleon Group announced the name and focus of its third restaurant outside of the downtown Austin area: Guild , which is set to open sometime this summer. Look out for a raw bar when Guild debuts. The space will include indoor dining, as well as two outdoor areas, and a private dining room. Guests will also be able to arrange for private tastings right in the kitchen. It’ll start out with dinner, and add on lunch and brunch after it opens. There is no word on the chef as of yet. Guild’s neighbors in the Lamar Central complex include brunch-loving Snooze and Kendra Scott’s jewelry store . Chameleon's C.K. Chin and Stuart Thomajan opened Swift's Attic in 2012, the inventive small plates restaurant in downtown Austin. They followed that up with Wu Chow, the modern Chinese restaurant also in downtown. Once under their umbrella was downtown bakery Delish, but that shuttered last spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:24:37.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
