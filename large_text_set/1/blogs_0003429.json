Now we have established anatomy and the structure,” J Calvin Coffey, a researcher from the University Hospital Limerick in Ireland, said in a press release . “The next step is the function. If you understand the function you can identify abnormal function, and then you have disease. Put them all together and you have the field of mesenteric science…the basis for a whole new area of science.” According to Science Alert , the world-famous series of medical textbooks Gray’s Anatomy has reportedly been updated with the mesentery’s new classification.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:31:25.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
