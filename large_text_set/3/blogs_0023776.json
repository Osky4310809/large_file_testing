There was the sound and reverberations of metal scraping my train,\" Geary said. \nThe glass and metal bent into the train within an inch of Geary's head, he said. \n\"A lot of people were holding their heads because the windows knocked into them. My ears were ringing,\" Geary said. \n\"When it happened, you have a tenth of a second where you're like, 'A bomb hit us!' After that, you feel and hear that sound and it's, 'No wait, a train sideswiped us.' It's almost weirder and crazier,\" he added. \nThe crash rattled the passengers in the derailed Acela, they said. \n\"We were leaving the station. It was literally 15 to 20 seconds later. We were off the tracks. It sounded like we were running over something. You could hear the noise. You could feel it,\" said Tom Steindler, 62, who was heading to Washington D.C.

It hadn’t really gotten any distance. The back of the train was still in the station,\" according Christopher Greenwell, 44, an Englishman who was heading to Philadelphia for a meeting. \nBack on the NJ Transit train, passengers calmly exited but were told little about what happened, they said. \n\"They didn't make a single announcement except, 'No photos,'\" Geary said.

There was some good New York humor,\" Steindler said. \n\"No problems, but some people had spilled coffee,\" Greenwell added. \nAmtrak service in and out of Penn Station was delayed as their officials investigated the derailment, they said. \nNJ Transit suspended its service in and out of Penn Station after the incident, diverting Midtown-bound trains to Hoboken, but cross-honoring fairs.
