By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 21, 2017 1:23 PM Uddhav Thackeray along with family at the polling booth. (ANI) \nThe fiery Maharashtra politics acquires even greater volatility in Mumbai, which is the business capital of India and also because it is packed with one of the largest populations in the country in a very small space. While all eyes are on the 227-member Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, as it is reportedly the richest civic body in Asia with an annual budget of over Rs 37,000 crore, the polling includes 9 other civic bodies across Maharashtra – the polling started this morning. While the Congress is a spent force and Sharad Pawar’s NCP is a bit player, the real fight for power is between Uddhav Thackeray -led Shiv Sena and Devendra Fadnavis’ Bharatiya Janata Party. While both are part of the NDA alliance at the Centre, the civic polls have split them apart and the acrimony between both has surged to even name calling levels. PM Narendra Modi has not chosen to canvass in person for the Maharashtra civic polls, but for BJP this is a very prestigious election as it may pave the way to the general elections as well as assembly elections in 2019. The votes will be counted on February 23 and on that same day the results too will be announced. Here are the most crucial points to ponder about the Maharashtra civic polls: \n1. A total of 3.77 crore voters will determine the fate of 17,331 candidates for 3210 seats – people to vote in 43,160 polling stations spread across the state with 2.76 lakh election staff as well as an equal number of personnel deployed by the police across the state. \n2. Elections are for 10 municipal corporations, 11 zilla parishads and 118 panchayat samitis in the second phase – municipal corporations involved are Mumbai, Thane, Ulhasnagar, Nashik, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur. The first phase for 15 zilla parishad and 165 panchayat samitis polling was held on February 16 where 69 percent voters exercised their franchise. \n3. Districts going to polls in the second phase are Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Pune, Solapur, Nashik, Amravati and Gadchiroli. Elections are being held in 118 panchayat samitis in these districts. \nAlso read: BMC Elections 2017 Live Updates. \n4. Over 1.80 crore electorate eligible to exercise their franchise in the zilla parishads and panchayat samitis while 1.95 crore urban voters will in the 10 municipal corporations. \n5. For 1268 seats of the 10 municipal corporations, there are 9208 candidates (Mumbai there are 2275 candidates and 92 lakh voters); for 11 zilla parishads there are 2956 candidates for 654 seats, and 5167 candidates for 1288 seats in 118 panchayat samitis. \n(With PTI inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:07:56.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
