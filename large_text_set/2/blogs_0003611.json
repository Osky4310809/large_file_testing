Travis Estell | UrbanCincy The former Dennison Hotel at 716 Main St., a 124-year-old structure that preservationists say was designed by famed Cincinnati architect Samuel Hannaford's firm, is being demolished. Columbia REI LLC, a company owned by the Joseph family, has started demolition of the building's interior, said Patrick Crowley , a spokesman for the company. The owners of the former Dennison Hotel began demolition on Monday. Travis Estell | UrbanCincy The building had been fenced off Monday afternoon. Preservationists and the Josephs, who also own several auto dealerships throughout Greater Cincinnati, fought a nearly yearlong battle over the building's fate. Start of demolition is occurring before a hearing set for Tuesday at 1 p.m. in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court to try to get an emergency injunction blocking the Dennison's destruction. A downtown property owner who claimed he would be adversely affected by the building's demolition had filed suit to stop the plan on Friday . In hearings before both the city's Historic Conservation Board and Zoning Board of Appeals, Columbia maintained that it could not rehabilitate the building as office space, a hotel or residential and gain an appropriate economic return. The Josephs own a vast parking lot on the same block as the former hotel. The family said it plans to build a corporate headquarters at the site someday, a notion preservationists have ridiculed as unlikely given that they demolished other buildings more than 25 years ago with the same intent. In the alternative, the family has said it will look at building a mixed-use project with a residential component. Preservationists noted that the Josephs bought the building with the intent to demolish it . Eight developers had expressed interest in the building and said it was economically feasible to rehabilitate it, the Cincinnati Preservation Association's leader said in 2016. Attorneys for the Josephs maintained that no one was interested in such a project. The Historic Conservation Board ruled in June that the building could not be torn down in part because the family did not pursue historic tax credits as it looked at whether the building could be saved. Such credits have been used in many rehabilitation projects throughout downtown and Over-the-Rhine. But in December, the Zoning Board of Appeals said the panel's decision was not backed by a preponderance of the evidence and that the owners would have suffered economic harm if the demolition were not approved.
