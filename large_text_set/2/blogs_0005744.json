He will be seen as Raja and Prem in Judwaa 2, something that Salman Khan did in Judwaa. So when we heard that Salman and Karisma Kapoor, who was also part of the first film, will do cameos in the sequel, we were ecstatic. But a confirmation was needed. So when the media met up with Varun, Sajid Nadiadwala and David Dhawan on the sets of the sequel, a confirmation on the same was sought and the reply left us extremely hopeful. (Also read: Varun Dhawan’&#8217;s Judwaa 2 is different from Salman Khan’s Judwaa, here-how ) \nWhen Varun was asked about the cameos, he pointed towards Dhawan Sr. and Sajid who according to him should answer the question. Sajid Nadiadwala said, “The best thing is saamne se they are saying that they want to be a part of the film. They will not be having a sketched role as a character. They will come in as a special character.” For now, this reply is enough to make us very excited about the film. Go to 5:24 on the timeline of this video and hear it for yourself. \nA tabloid had earlier quoted a source saying, “The icing on the cake is that a special appearance is being written for bhaijaan. Salman has already agreed to step in as a ‘godfather-gunda’ to Varun’s twins.” When Karisma was asked about Judwaa 2, she told DNA, “I have heard that they are remaking Judwaa and it’s exciting. I love Varun as an actor and I am sure he will do a great job”. Will she be part of Judwaa 2 as well? Karishma reveals, “David did mention it to me. So let’s see. I would love to do it.” So far so good.
