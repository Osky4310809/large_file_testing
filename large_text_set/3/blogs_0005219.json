If you really want to see it, the Zero Censorship site has it here . Please be aware, the video is extremely disturbing. \nBoth French and Philippine governments condemned the action for the savage attack that it was. \nJesus Dureza, chief peace adviser to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, said “We grieve as we strongly condemn the barbaric beheading of yet another kidnap victim, German Juergen Gustav Kantner, in Sulu Sunday afternoon,” according to Rappler .   \n“Terrorism has no place in a country like ours and we as a people must confront violent extremism every time it rears its ugly head,” continued Dureza. Dureza also said that, “up to the last moment, many sectors, including the Armed Forces of the Philippines, exhausted all efforts to save his life. We all tried our best. But to no avail.” \nEven German Chancellor Angela Merkel denounced the event through her spokesman, Steffen Seibert. \n“The chancellor condemns this hideous attack that shows, once again, how unprincipled and barbarous terrorists act,” he said. “We’ve all got to stand together in the fight against terrorists.” \nWe do all need to stand together.
