Other winners were Fairullah Mat of Negri Sembilan, who won a Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX, and Sukchart Prom Wichit of Johore and Md Fiah Md Tamin, also of Negri Sembilan, who each won a Kawasaki D-Tracker 250. \nOrganised in conjunction with Malaysia Day celebrations in last year, previous winners of the lucky draw were Dillingster Resli from Sarawak, for September, as well as Azlan Musa from Johor and Badrul Hisham Kumut from Sabah in October. All three won a Kawasaki Z125 Pro mini-moto and were also eligible for the grand prize of a Kawasaki H2. \nIn the November edition of the lucky draw, Kahar Amir from Johor won a Kawasaki D-Tracker, which was presented by Datuk Jeffery Lim, director of Kawasaki Motors Malaysia. The lucky winners today were drawn by Kiyaoki Takano, executive director of Aeon Credit Service, and Kazuhiro Watanabe, deputy general manager, Tokio Marine Insurance Malaysia. \nTo be eligible for the draw, contestants had to purchase a Kawasaki motorcycle from an authorised dealer in 2016, and forward their details. Over 500 new Kawasaki owners participated in the lucky draw. \nSpeaking to paultan.org during the event, Lim said despite soft market sentiment facing the Malaysian motorcycle market this year, Kawasaki Motors Malaysia would “concentrate on the middle and superbike market , because this is where Kawasaki’s strengths are.” Lim also said four new Kawasaki models would be launched this year, including the new Versys X-250 .
