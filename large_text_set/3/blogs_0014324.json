Well, buckle up, Disney Cruise fans, because starting in November, when you hop aboard the Disney Dream, you can join in on the musical action with Belle and friends. \nDisney Cruise Lines just announced the introduction of a new Beauty and the Beast stage spectacular. The musical production will draw inspiration from the live-action film coming out March 17, featuring songs from the original Disney movie as well as two songs from the new film. The production of \"Be Our Guest\" sounds SO good and has been completely reimagined for the stage. \n\"'Be Our Guest' is becoming a multi-course French dinner rooted in imagination and fantasy,\" Disney Cruise Line said. \"Rousing choreography and dazzling visual effects will fill the stage during this full-fledged spectacle.\" ADVERTISEMENT \nThe costumes promise to be elaborate, the music promises to be romantic and charming, and the numbers will undoubtedly be showstopping.
