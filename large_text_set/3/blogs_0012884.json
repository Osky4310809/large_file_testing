The VJ was quite close to television actor Gaurav Chopra inside the house, and rumors were rife that they both were planning to take their relationship forward outside the house. Bani went on to post a Snapchat video of her and Gaurav meeting for coffee, calling him the first person she met after she got out of the house. Yuvraj's Instagram post soon after, on moving on was hinting towards a breakup too. \nBani hasn't been responding to any of the allegations, however she took to Instagram a few days ago and shared a picture of Yuvraj with a cute caption.
