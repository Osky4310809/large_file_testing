The group claimed to identify the bomber and suggested that he was a Pakistani national. \nMurad Ali Shaf, chief minister of Sindh Province, told NBC News that hundreds of people were at the service when the attacker detonated the bomb. \nThe caretaker of the shrine, Syed Mehdi Shah, confirmed that it was a suicide attack and added that the shrine had just started serving food to visitors when the blast occurred. \nThe government and the army medical corps sent teams of doctors with medicine to the scene, according to government officials and Maj. Gen. Abdul Ghafoor, a Pakistan army spokesman. \nThe Pakistan army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, ordered the military to begin rescue operations and to help civilians administer medical care to victims.

Both the injured and their families openly complained about the lack of ambulances and rescue workers, saying victims had to be moved on motorbikes and privately owned cars. \nIt was one of the worst attacks in the past few years on the nuclear-armed country, which has suffered a string of ISIS- or Taliban-based attacks since Monday, splintering a period of increased security. \nSufis, who are a religious minority in Pakistan, are considered heretics by ISIS and Pakistan's Taliban. Thursdays are an important day for Sufi Muslims, which is why the shrine was particularly crowded. \nFarhan Haq, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, condemned the attack and extended U.N. support to the people of Pakistan. \n\"We extend our condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government and people of Pakistan, and wish a speedy recovery to the injured,\" he said in a statement. \"We call for the perpetrators of this attack to be brought to justice swiftly.\" \nThe U.S. State Department condemned a separate ISIS-claimed attack Thursday in Baghdad, Iraq, which killed nearly 50 people. \nThe State Department did not immediately respond for comment about the Pakistan attack.
