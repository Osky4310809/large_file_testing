This insane dumbbell handstand push-up video unquestionably falls into the latter, because no matter how many times we've seen the video our palms get clammy each time it replays. \nMeet Travis Horn, he likes to go by Vegas Balance Guru and it's no secret why. Travis likes to incorporate many different types of equipment into his balancing workouts; doing handstands on stacked bosu balls and sometimes even blindfolding himself before jumping on stacked weights. But the video that truly has our jaws dropped is where Travis stacks two rows of nine dumbbells, climbs on top, and completes two reps of handstand push-ups, seen above. \nWe have barely perfected our handstands , yet this guy is doing push-ups on top of nine dumbbells. NINE. Our neurotic minds are freaking out of what would've happened if the weights collapsed and he fell down with them, or if the basketball knocked into the stack, would they all collapse?! \nWhile some people are commenting about how obnoxious Travis is for taking all the weights from the weight room, we need to talk about his \"grandfather\" in the background. Aside from the fact that he doesn't even flinch at what Travis is doing, he's totally hitting every free-throw shot he takes. Excuse us while we pick our jaws up off the floor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:53:47.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
