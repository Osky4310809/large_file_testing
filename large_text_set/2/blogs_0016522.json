Levine 29.6k Share Tweet Follow Charles Kushner is the father of Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump’s husband. (Getty) \nCharles Kushner, 62, is the father of Jared Kushner, the owner of The New York Observer and Ivanka Trump’s husband. President-elect Donald Trump frequently brought up the Kushner family on the campaign trail, telling supporters that Ivanka converted to Judaism. In addition to being the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, there are also reports that Charles Kushner is part of a group close to buying the MLB’s Miami Marlins from owner Jeffrey Loria. \nForbes and The Associated Press reports that Loria has a “preliminary agreement” with a group to sell the two-time World Series-winning franchise for $1.6 billion. Sources later told ESPN that Charles Kushner is part of the group in talks to buy the team, but his spokesperson declined to comment. Charles Kushner’s younger son, Jared Kushner is also interested in buying the Marlins. \nThe Kushner family rose to prominence in New Jersey after Joseph and Rae Kushner, both Holocaust survivors, came to the U.S. in 1949. However, their family history took an ugly turn in the 2000s, with a sibling rivalry that culminated with Charles Kushner spending time in prison. \nJared Kushner was on Trump’s transition team . ABC News reported on January 9 that Jared Kushner will be a senior adviser to the president, even though he is Trump’s son-in-law. \nPolitico reported that Jared Kushner doesn’t like Chris Christie because of his role in prosecuting his father. That’s why Christie is no longer on the transition team, along with the ongoing Bridgegate scandal. Jared’s distaste for working with Christie even extends to working with those close to Christie, which is why former Congressman Mike Rogers is also out of the Trump team . \nHere’s what you need to know about Charles Kushner. 1. Kushner Built Schools & Named Them After His Parents Charles Kushner in 2014. (Getty) \nThe Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy and Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School are Modern Orthodox Jewish schools that Kushner built and named after his parents. \nKushner graduated from Hofstra Law School in 1979. He also established the Joseph Kushner Distinguished Professorship in Civil Liberties Law at Hofstra . \nWhen Joseph and Rae Kushner arrived in New Jersey, they were among a group of other Holocaust survivors who emigrated to the Garden State and began a career as real-estate developers, reports New York Magazine . It was on the foundation that his father started that Kushner Properties was built. \nJared Kushner told the story of his grandparents’ survival of the Holocaust in his response to Observer writer Dana Schwartz, who called Trump Anti-Semitic. \n“I have a different take-away from my Grandparents’ experience in the war. It is our responsibility as the next generation to speak up against hate. Anti-semitism or otherwise,” Marc Kushner, Jared Kushner’s first cousin, wrote on Facebook . \nKushner also helped his son get into Harvard, author Daniel Golden , who wrote The Price of Admissions: How America’s Ruling Class Buys Its Way Into Elite Colleges . When Jared Kushner was admitted to Harvard, even though he had poor grades, Kushner donated $2.5 million to the university.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:52:05.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
