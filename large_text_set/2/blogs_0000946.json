Now, a new film will look take a closer look at another aspect of the Fab Four — specifically, the relationship between John Lennon and Yoko Ono , as Variety points out.\nThe as-yet-untitled drama will be co-produced by Ono herself, alongside Michael De Luca , known for his work on both Fifty Shades of Grey films as well as the Oscar-nominated blockbusters Captain Phillips and The Social Network . Anthony McCarten has also been brought on-board to pen the script and produce, as he did on the acclaimed 2014 film The Theory of Everything and forthcoming Freddie Mercury and Winston Churchill projects.\n( Read: We’re All Witches: An Interview With Yoko Ono & Collaborators ) \nOno and the legendary Beatle first crossed paths at a London art gallery in November 1966.
