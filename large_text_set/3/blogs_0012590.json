He just valued our flat,’ Lorna Hayward captioned a Facebook photo of him along with her two daughters Elsie and Marnie.\n‘I had warned him, that arriving in my only available slot of the day at 5pm was risky. Nevertheless he rocked up.\n‘In the last hour Dan (who is a complete stranger) has had both my daughters request cuddles, can he hold their hands, if he would watch Peppa with them, does he like cheese, if he was staying the night and the finale – Elsie walking out of the toilet announcing she had just done “her biggest poo yet – it was a bit spikey though, so please can you wipe my bum”.\nHe’s single, FYI (Picture: Facebook/ Dan Stevenson) \n‘Poor Dan.

I also felt it was only right, and fair to the dedicated fans of Dan, to ask if he was single. The answer is YES.
