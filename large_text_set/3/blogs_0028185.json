Chiefly among them is Pee Wee Pumps , a line of dress-up baby heels made from soft cotton. They’re not actual heels, but rather cute plush slippers designed to snag a few laughs and cute Instagram snapshots .\nExcept, there are quite a few moms who are definitely *not* laughing.\n“Do they [realize] that the reason heeled shoes are perceived as sexy is because the heel forces the wearer to walk with chest/buttocks out for balance and an exaggerated arch in the foot mimicking (apparently) feet during orgasm?” one peeved Facebook user wrote in the UK-based group, Let Clothes Be Clothes. \n#PeeWeePumps on #Sale #DIVA STYLE ONLY ****24.99**** Limited Time Save 30% Www.PeeWeePumps.com #igsale #babyheels #babyshower #babygirl #babygift #cutebaby #instababy #babyshowergift #cutebaby #babygift #babylove #newbornshoes #softsoleshoes #cribshoes #highheelinfantcribshoes #babygirlshoes #heelsforbabies \nA post shared by Pee Wee Pumps (@peeweepumps) on May 27, 2015 at 4:45am PDT \nAnd the woes don’t stop there.

There’s “no endangerment” for the babies, she added.\n“It’s like putting a baby into a cute romper or tutu—it’s an accessory and there’s no more to it.” #Look at the little #cutie.
