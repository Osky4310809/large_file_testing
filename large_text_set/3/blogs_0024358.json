On Thursday, she released the throbbing club-ready new single “Mo Bounce,” and it’s the best thing the 26-year-old has released since her glory days of 2014.\nHere’s how her fluctuating career has played out.\nJune 2014 – “Fancy”/“Problem” The summer of 2014 saw Iggy at her most ubiquitous. Following her debut album “The New Classic,” “Fancy” featuring Charli XCX hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks, while her collaboration with Ariana Grande, “Problem,” peaked at No. 2.\n\nOctober 2014 – “Black Widow” Iggy’s hot streak continued with this Rita Ora duet, which reached No. 3.\nJanuary 2015 – “Beg for It” This rushed collaboration with MØ sounded too similar to her hits and stalled at No. 27. The rapper suddenly seemed to be running out of ideas.\nMay 2015 – “Pretty Girls” After months of hype, Iggy’s duet with Britney Spears turned out to be hugely anticlimactic for fans of both stars, and barely scraped the Top 30.\n\nMarch 2016 – “Team” Iggy’s big comeback (and first material from her upcoming second album “Digital Distortion”) signaled a more electronic direction, but it proved to be her biggest flop yet, failing to even reach the Top 40.\nMarch 2017 – “Mo Bounce” After taking some time off following her break up with fiancé, NBA star Nick Young, Iggy is trying for another reboot with the ultra-catchy “Mo Bounce.” It might not restore her to her former dominance, but it’s the strong comeback she desperately needs.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:19:41.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
