Media: MediaOS Video \n\"So disappointed with the way this was handled. I understand this is the mall's fault but still frustrating for someone who drove an hour and half and then stood in line for two hours only to be told that we couldn't get in\" said one commentor . \nAnother commentor posted \"we waited 4 hours and didn't get to see this! We showed up at 4:50am and the mall security ruined it for my girls! Makes me so sad! \nThe comments kept pouring in blaming the mall and security for ruining the event for thousands of people who showed up for the opening. \nLuckily the bakery is here to stay, so hopefully those who missed their chance will still be able to get their hands on an infamous cannoli.
