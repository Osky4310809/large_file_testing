(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) ICE agents outnumbered 5 to 11,000 illegals, cheer new Trump hires By Paul Bedard ( @SecretsBedard ) • 3/22/17 4:24 AM Paul Bedard Washington Secrets The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/headshot-PBedardHR.jpg More \nU.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement unions are cheering President Trump's plan to hire 15,000 new agents, claiming that he has boosted sagging morale by promising to finally help the outnumbered immigration officers — and let them do their jobs. \n\"During my career at ICE I have never had the opportunity to commend a sitting U.S. president, or DHS secretary, but I'm doing so today. Amidst all the hammering from the media, and protests from special interest groups, President Trump and Secretary (John) Kelly haven't wavered, but instead continued steadfast in their support of the rule of law and our officers in the field,\" said Chris Crane president of the union representing ICE. \nIn prepared testimony for a Wednesday Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing to support the new Trump hiring project, Crane revealed just how outnumbered ICE's Enforcement and Removal force, responsible for seizing and deporting criminal illegals, is. \n\"Currently ERO has around 5,000 officers to police approximately 11 million illegal aliens, as well as millions of other lawfully admitted foreign nationals, in 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, Saipan and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We are set up for failure. Compare ICE ERO's 5,000 officers to the approximately 35,000 officers on the New York City Police Department alone,\" he said in his testimony, provided in advance to Secrets. He is the president of National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council 118 of the American Federation of Government Employees. \nThe U.S. Border Patrol isn't much better off. The president of their union, the National Border Patrol Council, said it is 1,743 agents short. \nBrandon Judd said in his written comments, \"The congressionally mandated floor for manpower at Border Patrol is 21,370 agents. We are currently 1,743 agents below this floor. To put this figure in perspective, 1,743 agents is about the size of the St. Louis Police Department and slightly smaller than the Milwaukee Police Department. This lack of manpower is already impacting our operations and the smuggling cartels are exploiting the fact we do not have full coverage.\" \nIn his bid to beef up border security and the deportation of criminal illegals, Trump has pledged to hire 5,000 border agents and 10,000 ICE agents, an unprecedented and swift build up. \nCommittee Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson, in his prepared testimony, said the threat alone of cracking down on illegal border crossings has already had an impact. \n\"Beyond improved morale, early data might indicate that the president and Secretary Kelly's tough stance on security could be resulting in fewer attempts to break our laws and enter this country illegally. In February alone, apprehensions at the southwest border decreased 40 percent—from 31,578 in January to 18,762 in February This is noteworthy because apprehensions usually spike in February,\" said Johnson.
