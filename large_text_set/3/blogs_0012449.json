Scientists have begun to acknowledge that the current rapid trends in species extinction could be indicative of a coming “sixth” extinction . In Earth’s history, five mass extinctions of species have occurred, the most famous extinction is thought to have been caused by an asteroid , but this new period of extinction is being caused by none other than human beings. \nIn the past 200,000 years, humans have been on the planet, 1,000 species have gone extinct. The driving forces behind this loss include climate change , deforestation , habitat degradation , and hunting (all caused by human activity). \nBut what if you could simply help animals every time you send a piece of mail? As explained in a petition on Care2, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Multinational Species Conservation Funds play a vital role in helping to protect the planet’s remaining populations of elephants, rhinos, tigers, great apes, and marine turtles, by creating grants for conservation projects. For example, through their African Elephant Conservation Fund , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provides financial support to the 37 African elephant range states that enables them to carry out essential protection activities, such as anti-poaching programs. For more information on current projects, please see our most recent project summaries. \nTo help support these funds, Congress created the Save Vanishing Species Semipostal Stamp – otherwise known as the “Tiger Stamp” to let consumers support these wildlife conservation programs when they send mail. According to the World Wildlife Fund , since the Tiger Stamp went on sale in 2011, more than 35 million have been sold, raising over $3.7 million for international conservation, all at no cost to U.S. taxpayers . But this important program will expire later this year, unless Congress acts to renew it. Please sign this urgent petition asking your Members of Congress to cosponsor the Multinational Species Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act. This is an easy, effective way to help animals! \n\nFor information and advice on how you can play your part in the fight to end species extinction, check out some of the articles below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T08:20:43.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
