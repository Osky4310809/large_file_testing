Then the ninth month\ncame & they stopped coming around. How long Mama will survive\nthis silent grief? My capacity to make it 1 year\nwithout my mother’s voice is dwindling. Last night\nmy pulse read 90 bpm. 84 bpm. At 3:45am it read 95,\nthen back down to 80. At 157 bpm, I enter tachycardia.\nOnce, at 5, I lived.
