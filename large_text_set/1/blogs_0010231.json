it isn't necessarily a binary choice and we're considering the options.” We may still end up staying in the Customs Union either fully or partly, which would be a disaster Senior Tory source \nHe declined to comment on any rift with the Treasury. \nA senior Tory source said: “It looks like we have won the argument over leaving the Single Market but the messages coming out are suggesting we may still end up staying in the Customs Union either fully or partly, which would be a disaster. \n“It seems that there is a split in the Cabinet and Philip Hammond and the Treasury are fighting hard to keep us in the Customs Union.” GETTY Philip Hammond is reportedly leading an effort to keep the UK in the Customs Union \nPreviously, Mr Davis and Theresa May have refused to clarify what the Government’s position on the Customs Union is although the Brexit Secretary has suggested there are four options including a Swiss cooperation model which allows it to make free trade deals around the world. \nSenior Remoaners including Lib Dem former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Tory former minister Anna Soubry have pressed the Government to stay in the Customs Union as a means of keeping Britain under Brussels rule by the back door. \nMr Clegg publicly mocked international trade secretary Liam Fox for “not having a job” because he claimed Britain would “have to stay” in the Customs Union. Top 50 influencers on Brexit Fri, December 2, 2016 Play slideshow 1 of 51 \nLast night senior Brexit figures made it clear that there can be no compromise on leaving the Customs Union along with the rest of EU control to allow the UK to make free trade deals around the world. \nSenior Tory MEP and Leave Means Leave board member David Campbell Bannerman said:“The customs union forces Britain to put up protective walls of tariffs making food, clothes and shoes more expensive in the UK. These are heavy chains and are not beneficial.” \nMr Campbell Bannerman, a member of the European Parliament’s trade committee, added: “As Canada's new CETA deal shows - you can have access to 99 per cent of the market outside the customs union and with no fees or free movement.” GETTY Ukip's Mark Reckless called the Custom Union a straightjacket \nRichmond MP Rishi Sunak, a former international businessman and member of the European Research Group, said: \"If we stay inside, Brussels will be in charge of our trade policy, and their track record is awful.\" \nFareham Tory MP Suella Fernandes said: “As long as Britain is a member of the customs union, we are unable to strike our own trade deals with countries like the USA or India. \n“It is vital that we leave the Customs Union in order take back control over our trade policy to boost growth and jobs in Britain.” \nUkip called on Mrs May to “clip Mr Hammond’s wings” and described the potential for free trade deals around the world as “one of the key benefits” of Brexit. \nUkip economic spokesman Mark Reckless said: “If the Treasury get their way and keep us in the straightjacket of the customs union and it's common tariffs we will be unable to do this.” \nMeanwhile, Malta’s Prime Minister, whose economy receives massive support from the UK and UK citizens, added his voice to attempts to threaten Britain for Brexit as his country takes over the rotating EU presidency. \nMr Muscat said: \"We want a fair deal for the United Kingdom, but that fair deal needs to be inferior to membership. \n\"It cannot end up better than the current situation.\" \nMuscat added that the other 27 countries of the EU would first agree their own position, once Britain formally notifies them it wants to leave before the end of March, and that only then they would negotiations start with London over the terms. GETTY Malta's Joseph Muscat ditched close ties with the UK to call for Brexit punishment \nHe said he had rarely seen such unity among EU governments as they displayed in the case of negotiations with Britain. \nHis comments comes as EU bosses panic over a series of European elections this year including in France , Holland and Germany which see support for anti-EU parties rocketing up from fed-up voters. \nMr Muscat said there would be only \"one contact point\" for negotiations - the European Commission, which would from time to time consult with EU governments when a political decision would need to be made. \nUnder pressure European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker, also present at the news conference, said the EU needed to show that the departure of Britain did not mean the end of European integration. \n\"If are considering the Brexit case as the beginning of the end, we would make a major mistake,\" he said.
