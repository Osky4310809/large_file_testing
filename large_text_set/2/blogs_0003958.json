Actually, it's EVERYBODY's nightmare!\nA young boy was trying to use the bathroom at his home in Abilene, Texas on January 26 when a rattlesnake slithered up from inside the toilet!\nWe don't know the boy's exact age, but that could ruin potty training for an adult!\nThe child tried to flush the adult Western Diamondback, but that apparently only agitated the poisonous predator. \nRelated: Shockingly, Not The First Toilet Snake We've Heard Of… \nBy the time pros from Big Country Snake Removal arrived, the child's mother had already killed the snake.\nWhile sad that the poor creature died, when your baby is in trouble you do what you have to, ophidiophobia be damned.\nBig Country owner Nathan Hawkins says the snake had found an opening in a relief pipe, which he then sealed. But that wasn't the last shock of the day for the family.\nA further inspection of the property revealed 23 MORE SNAKES, mostly in the storm cellar or below the house.\nEesh! There goes our good night's sleep… Stay safe out there!\n[ Image via Big Country Snake Removal/Facebook . ] \nTags: big country snake removal , perezcious parenting , reptile friends , scary! , snakes , viral: animals , viral: kids , viral: news", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:20:17.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
