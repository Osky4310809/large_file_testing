The company quietly launched this handset in China a couple of months back and it appears that Samsung might soon release it in other markets as well. \nThe Galaxy C7 Pro is a pretty robust mid-range handset with its 5.7-inch Full HD Super AMOLED display, 2.2GHz Snapdragon 626 processor with 4GB RAM and up to 64GB of expandable internal storage. \nIt even features a 16-megapixel front and rear camera as well as a 3,300mAh battery. Samsung has released it with Marshmallow in China but it may receive an update to Nougat in the not too distant future. \nThe FCC filing for the Galaxy C7 Pro (SM-C701F) has now been spotted. This suggests that Samsung is preparing to release the handset in markets other than China. While it’s unclear at this point in time in which markets Samsung is going to sell this handset, it’s likely that the United States might be one of them as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:11:52.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
