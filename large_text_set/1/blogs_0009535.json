Or, as our source put it: ‘It’s a shocking disregard for process and continuity of government.'” \nThe piece was widely shared, but Gizmodo soon added a large correction to the body of the piece. It turns it’s not at all true that Trump told the NNSA appointees they had to leave, he just never asked them to stay. \nAnother NNSA official, speaking on background to Gizmodo and Defense News , has disputed this report as “inaccurate” while confirming that “there have been no discussions between the president-elect’s transition team and any of NNSA’s political appointees on extending their public service past Jan. 20.” In other words, the Trump transition team has not asked the top two NNSA officials to stay on until they can be replaced. \nAfter speaking to our source for clarification, we have updated the story and headline to reflect that, while Klotz and Creedon have submitted their resignations, intend to depart on January 20, and have not been asked by the Trump transition to stay past that date, the Trump team has not explicitly instructed them to leave or “clean out their desks,” as we reported. According to our source, both officials “have expressed [to the Trump team] that they would likely be willing to stay to facilitate a smooth transition, if asked,” as is the tradition for key officials, and have received no response. \nThe headline has likewise been updated to read “Trump Is Letting Go the People in Charge of Maintaining Our Nuclear Arsenal.” \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T18:01:31.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
