From April, the Duo Tone paintwork option will be available across the Bentayga range. \nOn its exterior, the Bentayga Mulliner includes 22-inch Paragon seven-spoke wheels with floating wheel centres, body-coloured lower bodywork and bright chromed lower bumper grilles. \nInside, the Mulliner treatment is arguably more effective; a new Mulliner interior colour split complements the Duo Tone exterior, with the front and rear seats finished is different hide colours, starting with seven suggested colourways, while the hand-stitched hides receive Mulliner embroidery and contrast stitching. \nIn the rear of the cabin, a new Mulliner Bottle Cooler is complemented by Cumbria crystal flutes and an illuminated chilling cabinet, built into the rear centre console. Ombré Burr Walnut Veneer comes exclusively to the Bentayga Mulliner, showing a unique transition from black to burr walnut, while a special veneered panel replaces the standard central fascia. \nMood lighting also gets the Mulliner touch with six different ‘mood’ settings, where illuminated Mulliner tread plates and LED welcome lamps. Owners will get to choose their own ambience, where 15 different colours can be selected, along with brightness levels for the doors, armrests and footwells. \nAlso optional in the Bentayga Mulliner is the Linley hamper, which includes a refrigerator, bespoke Linley fine china cutlery, crockery and crystal glass, and storage area for dry goods. Parts of the package can be removed for use as seats, says Bentley. \nHorology and luxury motoring seem to go hand in hand, and on this front the Bentayga Mulliner can also be specified with the mechanical Mulliner Tourbillion by Breitling clock. Comprising 196 individual pieces, the Mulliner Tourbillion is periodically wound automatically by a high-precision winding mechanism within the car. \nMachined in a choice of yellow, white or rose gold, the timepiece can also be configured with either a mother-of-pearl or black ebony face, along with eight diamond indexes. Finally, as befitting the Mulliner department’s raison d’etre , the Bentayga Mulliner can itself serve as a basis for even more specific customisation. \nA one-off example of the Bentayga Mulliner will be on display at the Bentley stand at the upcoming Geneva Motor Show, where it will feature a unique inlay on its front fascia depicting the Monte Rosa mountain range.
