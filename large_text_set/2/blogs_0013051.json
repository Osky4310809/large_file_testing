Niantic is adding a total of 80 new species to the Pokémon population. \nThe new Pocket Monsters hail from the Johto region in the Gold and Silver versions of the game. The update will land on your phone later this week so stay tuned. We're looking forward to seeing some fresh new Pokémon faces after so long. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R04u9E5INTI?wmode=opaque\">Embedded video</a> \nIn an interview with Waypoint, CEO of Pokemon Go developer Niantic John Hanke confirms trading and battling is coming to the hit game. \nIn fact, at least one of the features should have been in the game at launch, had it not been for server issues plaguing the game. \nHanke confirms this update will be done soon. \" It is what it is. I'll take the massive wave of hysteria we enjoyed, and just deal with the fact that it's caused us to take a bit longer to get the rest of the features up. We're really happy to make our users happy,\" he said. \nWhile player numbers have declined since its release, Hanke also said that Pokemon Go has already made its money back since its release in 2016. \n\"Last year has funded us, you know, indefinitely, really,\" he said. \nThe full interview can be found at Vice . \nThe latest announcement from Niantic is that players will get a \"catch bonus\" depending on the medals you get. Players currently get medals on catching certain types of Pokémon, for instance the Gardener medal for catching grass-type 'mons. \nWith the bonuses, you now have more of a chance to capture certain types of Pokémon. So if you have a lot of water medals, catching water Pokémon will be much easier thanks to the added bonus. Your bonus will be the average of your bonuses for each type a Pokémon has. For instance, the Pidgey is both a normal and flying Pokémon. Your bonus would be the average of your Normal and Flying medal bonuses. Niantic has also stated that this feature will help increase the chances of you landing rare Pokémon . \nNo word however on when the new feature will roll out, though the app is now available in more countries in Europe and most of Africa. India, South Korea and China are still the Pokémon Go holdouts; it's unlikely the app will come to the latter two countries with South Korea citing security concerns and China blocking most Google services. \nNiantic has been on a roll lately with its updates for Pokémon Go. It just announced yet another one, updating the app to 0.45.0 for Android and 1.15.0 for iOS. \nNow, after defeating the gym leader at a gym, you get a short grace period where only you will be able to place Pokémon in the gym. No more having someone take over the gym you fought so hard for right after you've won. \nThe amount of prestige a gym loses after being defeated has also increased but the amount of prestige gained by training at a friendly gym has however been lowered. \nGym battling seems to be less frustrating now you can bring in a whole complement of Pokémon with you when attacking, which makes it a somewhat fairer fight. \nAnother delicious bit of news: Techcrunch just reported that an examination of the app's code has revealed more Pokémon, from the second generation, could be making an appearance. As for the elusive tracker, it has expanded its beta areas in the US so players will just need to be patient as the feature will eventually be released, once Niantic thinks it's ready to go live. \nLooks like we might finally have a reason to blow the dust off our Pokémon Go apps and get back into the game. \nYup, Ditto is now in the wild and being spotted by PoGo trainers all over the world. Absent from the game since launch, fans have been patiently waiting for the purple blob which has the unique ability to change into the Pokémon it’s battling. \nAnd while you might be able to start catching him now, it’s not going to be so straightforward. The little bugger won’t show up as Ditto on the map. Instead it’ll show up as another Pokémon and only reveal itself once you catch it. Check out the video below to see Ditto’s reveal:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:20:52.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
