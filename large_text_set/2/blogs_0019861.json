Chill out on the measurements. Use 2 cups of cold water for every 1 cup of oats (and every 1 cup of oats for every 2 eaters). Precision is not necessary here: Peter uses a squat drinking glass, which he fills once with oats, twice with water. \n2. Take the time to soak your oats. Advertisement Soak the oats in the cold water (remembering the ratio above), along with a good pinch of salt, for 10 minutes. (\"Go take your shower,\" Peter suggests.) Photo by James Ransom \n3. Treat it like risotto. Yes, risotto. \n\"Treat it with a small nod to risotto and grain,\" advises Peter, so that you can monitor and control the consistency: Heat a small kettle or pot of water and leave it to simmer, \"as you would stock for risotto,\" alongside the soaking oats, simmering over medium-heat. \nAs the oatmeal bubbles and thickens, add hot water from the kettle or pot, 1/4 cup at a time, directly into the pan. Let the oatmeal gel—if it's too thick, drizzle in a bit more of the boiling water. Your oatmeal should be ready in no more than 5 minutes. \"You will see that it has unified, and thickened—choose the consistency you want, adding a little more water until you get there.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:25:25.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
