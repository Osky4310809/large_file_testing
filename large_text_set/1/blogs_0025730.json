Tom Conti said it wouldn't surprise him if the council was targeting richer neighbourhoods \nShe told the Standard: “It’s totally ridiculous we are very angry about this. Where are we going to store our rubbish, do we have to pay for a skip? \n“There will be rats and foxes. Because we have a big house we already pay more council tax and should get the services other parts of the borough get. They should discount our council tax for this but that won’t happen. We will not stand for this.” \nAward winning actor Tom Conti, 75, today described Camden’s move as “horrifying”. The Shirley Valentine star speaking at his Hampstead home said: “It’s horrifying the council wastes so much money then doesn’t collect the rubbish. We should all deduct some of our council tax, it’s outrageous. Nicole Farhi said: “It’s totally ridiculous, we are very angry about this. Where are we going to store our rubbish?\" \n“It’s a basic service and it will mean dirtier streets. I don’t know whether they are targeting richer neighbourhoods on purpose but it wouldn’t surprise me.” \nThe streets affected by the move, which Camden bosses claim will save £5 million a year, are home to some of Britain’s best known figures, including footballers Thierry Henry and Olivier Giroud as well as Boy George, Harry Styles, James Corden and Ricky Gervais in Hampstead and writer Alan Bennett and designer Stefano Gabbana in Primrose Hill. \nIn some cases even next door neighbours will have different collection rotas under the plans approved earlier this month. \nProperty developer Stacey Offer, 50, lives on Lambolle Road in Belsize ward and will have her rubbish collected fortnightly, while next door neighbour - because she is technically on a different street - will continue weekly collections. Stacey Offer will have her bins collected fortnightly while her neighbour will have theirs done weekly (Alex Lentati) \nShe said: “It is crazy that next door will have a different collection. Our rubbish already piles high. I am an avid recycler and I hope that some good can come out of this with more recycling but the council tend to dictate to us which we don’t like.” \nJonny Bucknell, Conservative councillor for the Belsize ward, which will be hit by the changes, said: “This is clearly a targeted attack on the perceived wealth in the likes of Primrose Hill and Hampstead. It seems like an attack on the liberal elite of actors, artists and celebrities who live in the area. It’s no coincidence and it is not acceptable. It’s created a bin war.” \nHe added: “People in the north of the borough who pay a fortune in council tax are feeling seriously ripped off. The savings are only £5 million, which is peanuts in the great scheme of local authority funding with a turnover of £1 billion.” \nUnder the changes to collections, to begin in April, food waste and recycling will still be collected weekly across the whole of the borough. Camden Council also claims the move will help enourage recycling. Party-goers dump 85 tonnes of rubbish after New Year celebrations \nBut residents remain to be convinced. George Selley, 23, a teacher of fine art in Hampstead, said: “This plan is ludicrous and seems to penalising the part of the borough which is more affluent and has more celebrities and artists. \n\"Collecting rubbish is a basic service and who discriminate by collecting in part of the borough and not the other. I would gladly pay extra but to dilute the service is ridiculous and is not acceptable.” \nAnother resident, who did not want to be named said: “It’s just a thinly veiled attack on people the council think are privileged. It’s Corbynista really.” \nRupert Terry, the chairman of Redington Frognal Association, another neighbourhood where the fortnightly collection will kick in, said: “Why just pick certain areas? This area, if it is more affluent, is paying more council tax, is more likely to use private hospitals and their own security force. Rubbish collection was one of the things they were actually provided.” \nCamden Council has argued that the storage space outside the properties chosen for fortnightly collections were on average larger and so rubbish would not spill onto the street. \nThe council also carried out a consultation which suggested residents would accept a less frequent collection. \nCouncillor Meric Apak, cabinet member for sustainability and environment at the council said: “Camden Council joins over 76 per cent of local authorities who prioritise recycling and are already delivering fortnightly rubbish collections across the country.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T09:22:51.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
