You are now able to mute directly from your timeline and can also set a time period for how long the content will be muted (one day, one week, one month, or indefinitely).\n\nIn its blog post on the matter, Twitter also mentioned that it is working hard trying to identify accounts that engage in abusive behavior. When the company comes across an account like this, it will limit some of its functionality, such as allowing only their followers to see their tweets. These actions will take place if an account is repeatedly tweeting without solicitation at non-followers or engaging in abusive behavior that violates Twitter’s rules.\nSee also: Google acquires Twitter’s mobile app development division Fabric January 19, 2017 Finally, Twitter is trying to improve the transparency of its reporting process. From now on, you’ll be notified as soon as the company receives your report regarding an abusive account as well as informed if it decides to take further action. You’ll be able to see this in the notification tab on the Twitter app .\nAll of these features will be added via an update in the coming days and weeks.\nDo you think these moves are going to help curb abusive behavior on the platform?
