Voters who reported they supported Trump in 2016 were somewhat less likely to approve of the job he’s done so far. Eighty-four percent of Trump voters approve of the job he’s done so far, down from 90 percent in last week’s poll. \nAlthough the consensus has been Speaker of the House Paul Ryan would shoulder much of the blame, only 10 percent of surveyed voters reported they felt the Republican health care bill’s failure was because of Ryan. \nTwenty-four percent felt House Republicans were to blame, 22 percent said the failure was Trump’s fault, and 22 percent said that House Democrats were to blame for not passing the bill. \nTrump announced Friday that his legislative agenda would move on to other issues, like tax reform, 51 percent of voters agreed that was the best plan. Thirty-seven percent of all voters felt the president should stay the course on replacing the Affordable Care Act, which includes 62 percent of all Republicans. \nThe poll included 1,991 registered voters, and ran from March 24 through March 25. The poll carried a margin of error of 2 percentage points in either direction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:56:26.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
