Plus, the Italian is expecting a fierce test from Swansea City on Saturday. The Blues return to Premier League action atop the table on Saturday, but Conte remained cool on his west London future ahead of his side's clash against the Swans, per ESPN FC's Liam Twomey: Liam Twomey @liam_twomey Conte asked it he's worried about sack after winning title: \"But if you remember I was already sacked this season, by the bookmakers.\" #cfc 2/24/2017, 1:14:46 PM Following Jose Mourinho's dismissal from the Chelsea helm in December 2015, not long after winning another Premier League title, there have been suggestions Conte needs to be wary as his team aim for the English crown. However, the former Juventus chief appeared happy to take on the challenge and said winning the Premier League would be a just reward for facing such a risk, per The Sun 's Fred Nathan : \"It is important to finish the season in the right way, but I am ready to face this risk next season. I am focused as are the players about this. There are 13 games and we want to stay top. It won’t be easy, but I am ready to take this risk, it means we will have won the league!\" Conte already has experience being relieved of his managerial duties after being fired by the first club that employed him, Arezzo, although he chose to take the setback in his stride, per Goal's Nizaar Kinsella: Nizaar Kinsella @NizaarKinsella Conte says being sacked early in his career was \"traumatic\" for him by Arezzo. Just look at what he is doing now... #CFC 2/24/2017, 1:33:15 PM Earlier in Friday's press conference, Conte took the time to pay homage to Ranieri, who was fired by Leicester a day after his side lost 2-1 to Sevilla in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League round-of-16 clash: \nI am very sad because it is our job and I am disappointed for him, he is a friend, a really good man, a really good manager and he won the title only months ago. He reached a dream to win the title and as a coach I am sad. \nFor now, it is better to wait. I understand his frustration and the situation but I will call him, which is natural after this – to talk and to show my disappointment for this decision as I think it is very strong. Conte also commented on speculation linking former Manchester City and Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini with the Leicester City job, per Sky Sports' Paul Vinnell , detailing his relationship with his countryman: Liam Twomey @liam_twomey Conte on Mancini to Leicester: \"It's very difficult to talk about the substitution of Claudio. I know Roberto & he's a really good coach\" 2/24/2017, 1:16:33 PM One aspect of Ranieri's exit from the King Power Stadium that didn't sit well with Conte, however, was the notion that a player revolt may have convinced the club's hierarchy to make a change in leadership. Sky Sports' Vinnell reported players told the club's owners they were unhappy with the tactician following Tuesday's defeat in Seville, although Conte confessed he wouldn't stand for any such behaviour: \nI don’t like to follow this type of story because it is a lack of respect for Claudio. \nIt is not right that the players decide that the manager is sacked or not, if that happens then that means the club is poor and without power. \nI don’t believe or trust in this. I do not want to listen to this type of story as it is frustrating for a manager. Also to imagine the players to decide your destiny is not good. Chelsea lead Manchester City by eight points at the Premier League summit and return to league action after defeating Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 to reach the sixth round of this season's FA Cup. However, the Blues boss finds himself without European football, which has allowed Chelsea to excel in their domestic pursuits, although the manager is missing the added drama of the Champions League, per Kinsella: Nizaar Kinsella @NizaarKinsella Conte says it is an \"advantage\" to not be in Europe and train all week but that it is horrible for him and his players watching it. #CFC Swansea are up to 15th in the Premier League table after winning four of their last six games, three of which came after Paul Clement's arrival at the Liberty Stadium. Speaking about the talents of former Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid assistant manager Clement, Conte said: \nHe has reinforced the team and we must pay attention tomorrow. If you saw the game against Liverpool or Manchester City, you will understand. But I will understand the players understand this and face them in the right way. But for sure Paul has done a great job since coming in. We must pay great attention tomorrow. Chelsea have dropped just three points at home in the league this season and are hoping to extend their five-match unbeaten league run, having drawn 2-2 in their trip to the Liberty Stadium back in September. Conte's side are steamrolling their way to this season's Premier League title as things stand, and even the potential threat of a title-winning curse won't be enough to distract the Italian boss from the task at hand.
