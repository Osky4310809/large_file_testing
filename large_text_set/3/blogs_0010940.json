That's where the Soccerway betting guide could help you with that weekend study up ritual. \nEdition 25 saw a great return of seven winners and it could get even better with two picks still to run on Monday night, advised at 13/8 (2.63) and Evens (2.0). Want to see what they are and the reasoning behind their inclusion? Simply register on site to get a copy. \nOnce you've registered successfully, just log in to your Soccerway account, head to your profile page - the icon is just next to where you enter your login credentials - and you can then download a copy completely free of charge. \nThe best betting minds behind the site come together to produce a range of picks for the upcoming action and once again they didn't disappoint, with winning tips from around Europe. Brighton's 3-0 victory on Friday night go things off to a fantastic start, the Seagulls were put up at 2/1 (3.0) to win to nil. \nThere was also another impressive winner for the Anytime Angles column as in-form Steve Mounie struck for Montpellier inside 13 minutes. The 22-year-old frontman had scored in his previous four consecutive matches but was still available at 13/8 (2.63) to register against a defence who had only kept 2 clean sheets in their last 13 away matches. \nThat match also provided a 10/11 (1.91) winner as both teams found the net, as highlighted in the Top Picks section which almost managed a clean sweep, a last gasp equaliser for Inverness thwarted a win to nil for Partick Thistle at 23/10 (3.30) but Roma's high-scoring win over Palermo also landed at 21/20 (2.05). \nThere were also profitable picks involving Monaco (21/20) , PSV Eindhoven (8/11) and Paris Saint-German (4/5). \nDon't forget there are two more selections still to run on Monday, so be sure to register for your free copy . Once you've done so, you'll get an email letting you know as soon as a new edition is released so you can see the tips before anyone else.
