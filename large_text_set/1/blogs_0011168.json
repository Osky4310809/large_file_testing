They then begin plans for meth manufacturing but Saul Goodman cannot locate satisfactory sites, save for one — a pest control company known as Vamonos Pest . Walter and Jesse use the business's fumigation tent on random houses as a mobile laboratory. Walt cooking in the Vamonos Pest fumigation houses (\" Hazard Pay \") \nMeanwhile, the methylamine flow is disrupted, forcing Walter, Jesse, and Mike to rob a train carrying a large shipment. As the DEA begins to track Mike, and with the recent death of the child , both Jesse and Mike design a permanent exit for themselves from the business. They plan to sell their shares of the methylamine for $5 million each to Declan, a major regional meth producer and distributor. Walt derails Jesse and Mike's scheme when he refuses to sell his share of the methylamine and uses his Heisenberg persona's infamy to cut a distribution deal with Declan and negotiate the $5 million severance for Mike. Jesse is determined to leave the business, irrespective of his financial cut, so Walter enlists Todd as his assistant cook. \nIn exchange for her safety, Lydia arranges for Walt's product to be shipped to the Czech Republic using Madrigal's more obscure branches. Over the next few months, this nets Walt an extraordinary amount of money - so much that, after some pleading from Skyler, he finally decides to retire. Walt leaves the last of the methlyamine to Declan so he could continue, and dropped off the $5 million he owed to Jesse at his door. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle's Drug Empire Edit \nAfter Walt's exit from the drug trade, Lydia was intent on keeping the business going without him, which she believed would be simple. However, Todd can't match the standard set by his predecessor, and to make matters worse, starts a fire in the meth lab, which results in Declan using his own cook, yielding an even lower quality of meth. As dissatisfied customers go elsewhere, Lydia goes to enlist Walt's help, begging him to come back, or at the very least, teach Declan's cook. Walt refuses, and Lydia is later scared off by Skylar. \nLydia enlists the help of Jack's Gang , intending on taking Declan's operation by force if he won't allow Todd to return as cook. Declan refuses, and Declan's crew are all killed by Jack's gang. They seize all the supplies for the meth lab, and take it back to their compound . Todd continues to cook meth, though was never able to match the quality set by Walt, and even \"burned\" the meth, destroying its signature blue color. \nDissatisfied with the consistent disappointment, Lydia decides to try and cut her losses and exit the business. Todd, however, informes her of the rise in quality, and the blue color. Lydia questions whether Walt was working with him, but Todd tells her that they had Jesse held captive. Having no problems with this as long as the meth was up to par, Lydia continued to use Todd while also manipulating his feelings for her to do what she wanted. \nJesse attempts to break out and is caught. The gang decides to punish him by having Todd kill Jesse's ex-girlfriend, Andrea Cantillo . Combined with the continued physical and emotional abuse, and the added threat of them going after Andrea's son, Brock , of whom he was very fond, Jesse gives up and accepts his situation. \nThe continued success of the business, caught the attention of the fugitive Walt, who believed that Jesse had bartered a deal with Jack for his life. Enraged, Walt returns to Albuquerque in order to put an end to their business, and rectify his mistakes. \nKnowing Lydia would keep to her schedule, he arrived at the café he used to meet with Lydia, only to find her meeting with Todd. He interrupted them to pitch a new method of distilling the meth, for a price of $1 million dollars, which he claimed to need to stay ahead of the cops. Walt slyly placed a pack of Stevia, spiked with Ricin, at her table. Lydia feigns interest, and Walt leaves. Lydia orders Todd to have Walt killed, as he is a loose end, believing that once he is gone, she will never be able to be implicated in the meth empire, and thinks nothing of adding the spiked Stevia to her tea. \nWalt heads to the compound that night with the intent of killing Jesse. However, when Kenny pulls a gun, Walt demands that Jack owes him for partnering up with Jesse instead of killing him as agreed. Insulted, Jack orders Jesse to be brought to him, and states that he will kill Walt himself. Seeing the poor state Jesse is in, and realizing that it is his fault, Walt tackles him to the floor, much to the amusement of the gang. Walt then triggers the automated M60 turret that he rigged in his trunk, which tears through the walls of the building, killing all the gang members except for Jack and Todd. Walt is critically hit with his slightly elevated body, taking a bullet for Jesse. Todd, horrified, looks out the window to see what happened. Jesse uses this opportunity to strangle Todd with his handcuffs, killing him in retaliation for Andrea and Drew Sharp 's deaths, and his own imprisonment. Walt confronts Jack, who was also critically hit, and bleeding. Jack attempts to bargain for his life, though Walt hears none of it, and shoots him in the head at point blank range. \nLydia, who has begun to suffer from the effects of the Ricin, calls Todd to confirm Walt's death. Walt answers the phone, and tells her that Todd and the rest of the gang are dead. Walt then proceeds to mock Lydia's sickness, confessing that he poisoned her, and that she would soon be dead, before a rather callous goodbye. Jesse escapes in Todd's car, and Walt goes to the superlab in the hangar, and dies with among the equipment...where he felt the most alive. Aftermath Edit \nThe supply of Blue Sky ceased, as everyone who knew how to cook it was dead, with the exception of Jesse who wanted nothing more to do with the product that had caused him and others so much misery. \nBlue Sky was extremely popular while it lasted, but odds are, true Blue Sky was never manufactured again after Walter White's death.
