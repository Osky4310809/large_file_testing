RSPCA reveals the most bizarre callouts it attended this year \nMr Ellwood said the vet concluded there would have been a minimum of six blows to the head and in 30 years it was the worst case of animal cruelty he had ever seen. \nThe court was told Heathcock thought he could not afford to have the 16-year-old animal put down, believing it would cost Â£300, so they decided to do it themselves. \nJailing them for four months each, chairman of the bench Frances Linsley said: \"This was a barbaric act which was premeditated and caused untold suffering to the dog Scamp.\" \nDominic Tate, defending, claimed Heathcock loved the dog and \"after 16 years of having Scamp and caring for the dog this was not his intention\". \nHe said: \"He did not set out to cause unnecessary suffering.\" \nAdditional reporting by Press Association More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:13:26.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
