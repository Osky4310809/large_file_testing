We are still hurting from her loss. We cherish her memory and legacy as Princess Leia, and will always strive to honor everything she gave to Star Wars .\" \nLast week, it was revealed that Star Wars executives and creators had gathered to discuss the future of the franchise following Fisher's death, and while the CGI option was viable according to visual effects supervisor Michael Fink, \"we have seen moments of success but not full performances.\" Given Friday's statement, producers will charter the saga toward a course that doesn't involve a CGI Leia.
