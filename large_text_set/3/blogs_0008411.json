The charter bus, which was near its destination in Biloxi on a trip from Austin, Tex., appeared to have gotten stuck on the railroad at a crossing and could not move before the train hit it, according to the Biloxi Police Department. About 50 people were on the bus when the crash occurred, around 2:12 p.m., and every passenger appeared to have some injuries, said the police chief, John Miller. “It’s a terrible tragedy,” Chief Miller said at a news conference, adding that the accident was the worst of its kind that he could recall in Biloxi. “It is a terrible, chaotic scene right now, but we have it under control.” A witness who called 911 and ran to the accident described a horrific sight: the locomotive, still running, tearing into the driver’s side of the bus and knocking people out of their seats. \nAdvertisement “I went out there, and I started hearing sirens,” said Bradley Raye, a manager at Hammett’s Auto Electric, which is on Main Street, about 200 feet from where the accident occurred. “I saw a few body parts.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
