Where the band’s last two albums were blasts of coiled anger, here they circle back to a tempered and polished take on their early optimism, trading the harshest sides of Attack on Memory and Here and Nowhere Else for Weezer-like pop (“Internal World”) and romantic jangle (“Modern Act”).

I understand Dylan Baldi wanting to try new things on every record and maybe step back from the noise rock style that popularized them but these songs are just not good.
