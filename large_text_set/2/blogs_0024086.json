Or a whale/polar bear hybrid. Or a big Shih tzu.\nBody piercer cuts off finger because 'she wanted to' We think it looks a bit like an English sheepdog.\nWhen a mass of organic matter washes up on the shore like this it is referred to as a ‘globster’.\nBy the way, the mystery has actually been solved. It’s the body of a whale and it’s in advanced decomposition. It’s believed to have died two weeks ago after being hit by a ship.\n(Picture: Marjorie Cabatingan Aboy) (Picture: Marjorie Cabatingan Aboy)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:10:27.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
