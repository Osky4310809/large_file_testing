Just follow the Rubles. As explosive revelations pour out on a daily basis, the press and the public are focused on how Donald Trump colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. There’s been far less focus on the issue of why they colluded. The question is often left open-ended: why does Donald Trump take every opportunity to praise Vladimir Putin and Russia? What’s in it for him? The answers are not that hard to find, although the story is quite, to use a Russian-adjacent term, byzntine. Anyone who’s paid attention to Donald Trump knows that his allegiances usually boil down to two things: praise for his ego and dollars in his pocket. Or, in this case, rubles. If we pull back to a 20 year birds-eye view of Trump’s financial dealings with Russia, the reasons for his Putin man-crush aren’t very hard to figure out. And many of the connections run through a multi-national bank that, like Trump, was willing to bend the rules for a buck. In 1998, Donald Trump was coming off multiple bankruptcies (we know from his leaked 1995 tax return that he lost $916 million dollars in that year alone) and failed projects that lost his investors tens of millions of dollars. The only bank willing to lend to him was the new property unit of Deutsch Bank. Starting in 1998, Deutsche Bank lent him money for new projects in New York, some of which failed, and some of which succeeded. In 2005, during the height of the real estate boom, Deutsche Bank lent Trump $640 million dollars for his Trump hotel in Chicago. Then the 2008 financial panic hit. This year was crucial in the Trump-Russia nexus. Trump was extremely leveraged and had billions of dollars in loans, tens of millions of which he had given a “personal guarantee” for (I put personal guarantee in quotes because Trump’s money was rarely really his own). The Chicago loan came due and Trump was unable to pay it . Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank, like most other major banks, had made risky bets — and illegal investments — in the mortgage securitization business that were going bad and threatened to bring it down. They were soon facing massive losses and even bigger fines. In Russia, the 2008 meltdown was devastating because it ground world manufacturing to a near halt. The price of oil dove from over $140 dollars a barrel to a little over $30 a barrel. The Russian economy is completely tied to the price of oil — the government gets between 50–60% of its revenue from the oil business. Russian billionaires who had gotten rich off the oil boom years of the housing bubble and multiple middle East wars were now desperate for a way to get their money out of Russia. The Russian mafia oligarchs did this in a couple of ways — one of which was buying and investing in properties overseas. To do this, they needed to partner with companies that could act as a front for them and legitimize them. People like Donald Trump. In 2008, Donald Trump Jr. remarked at a real estate conference that money was “pouring in from Russia,” and that a huge percentage of Trump’s new investment was coming from Russia . So in 2008, Trump was suddenly desperate for cash to fund his loans, and Russia mobster/oligarchs were desperate for a place to park and launder their cash. It was a match made in heaven. Deutsche Bank, by all accounts, was a willing matchmaker. In the years after 2008, Deutsche Bank’s investment division ran a money laundering scheme for rich Russians called stock “mirroring.” It was basically using shell companies to buy stock in rubles and then sell it and buy it with another company in dollars, as a way of moving money out of Russia. It’s worth noting that 2008 was the year that a mysterious Russian billionaire bought a mansion from Donald Trump for twice what Trump paid 2 years before. The billionaire never moved in to said mansion, and some say never even set foot in it. It’s now being torn down. But Trump netted a $50 million dollar profit on the sale — just in time to make a $40 million dollar payment to Deutsche Bank for his Chicago hotel loan. So that’s the big triangle — you had a Russian billionaires with dirty money that they needed to park somewhere, a global bank that desperately needed to make money to recover from the financial meltdown and pay future fines — and a “legitimate” American businessman who desperately needed cash for his insanely ambitious global construction empire. For a while, this marriage of billionaire mobsters and miscreants was a love fest. As the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow approached, Donald Trump tweeted effusive praise for Putin: “Do you think Putin will be my new best friend?” After the pageant, by his own account, Trump schmoozed with basically all of the richest men in Russia and gushed about their willingness to throw money at his projects. These Russian men had essentially “taken over the corrupt system” when Communism had fallen, and in assuming leadership, had turned all of the Soviet Unions institutions and industries into their personal piggy banks. Must have given Trump quite a few ideas. The love fest ended when Putin, newly re-elected as President, invaded Crimea . I think Putin was hoping that he could pull the US and NATO into global conflict that would increase the price of oil and distract the US from its diplomatic detente with Iran. But Obama did not bow to diplomatic pressure. Instead, he imposed crushing economic sanctions on Russia  — including restrictions, and investigations, into its illegal money-laundering scheme through Deutsche Bank. The SEC opened a major criminal investigation against Deutsch Bank. At the same time, the price of oil, which had risen back up into the $100s in 2014, crashed again as the Chinese economy slowed down, the US moved towards lifting oil sanctions on Iran, and US production increased. Oil crashed to $30 again, the Russia economy was hammered (and sickled?). The Ruble fell 70% in value. But this time, the US had more restrictions in place, making it harder for rich Russians to suck their money out of Russia to preserve their wealth. Hard — but not impossible. In recent years, most dirty Russian money — and we’re talking hundreds of billions of dollars worth through Putin and his associates — gets laundered through the Bank of Cypress. Again, worth noting: the bank of Cypress has two Vice chairmen. One of them is Wilbur Ross, Trump’s new Secretary of Commerce. Ross had been working in Russia since the mid-90s, when the US (under Clinton) established a formal investment fund to help Russia transition out of communism and into capitalism. That fund eventually went private, with Wilbur Ross right in the middle of it. Guess who Wilbur Ross brought in to be chairman of the Bank of Cypress? Josef Ackermann, the former Chairman of Deutsche Bank. So it’s not really a mystery why Donald Trump and the Russians have been cozying up to each other for years. They have mutually benefitted from a non stop parade of dirty financial deals that would probably be quite easy to unravel with a look through Trump’s tax returns. But Deutsche Bank, the super dirty go-between in all this, has already cashed in big time on Trump’s election. The Justice Department had multiple law suits against Deutsche Bank over mortgage securities fraud and their Russian money laundering scheme. Obama’s justice department was hoping for a $14 Billion dollar settlement on the first, and a $3 billion settlement on the second. After Trump won, the Obama justice department lost most of their leverage. How could they trust Trump, who owed Deutsche Bank hundreds of millions, to be a fair policeman? So after the election, but just before Trump took office, they settled Deutsche Bank’s fraud cases for $7 billion dollars and $960 million, less than half what they were aiming for. If the Russians did help Trump win, it was a nice thank-you to the bank that had helped them launder countless billions. And if Trump can lift Obama’s sanctions on Russia, it will mean the fire hose of dirty investment money into his projects around the world will be wide open again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T01:02:22.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
