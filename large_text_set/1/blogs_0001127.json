I love language. Praise: The columnist appeared to share praise from a Neo-Nazi account (Twitter) \n\"It's become used so much, it's like a regular word now, it's lost all meaning to me.” \nAfter the show ended she tweeted the clip, writing: \"Call me racist. I don't care. I will stand up for white women being raped because you're scared to offend Muslims.\" \nShe later retweeted a message praising her from an account called AntiJuden SS, which featured a Nazi swastika on its avatar. \nThe tweet read: “Now that is the way it should be told.” \nHorrified followers slammed her on Twitter . @GodofwarTyr @KTHopkins @LBC you're retweeting a tweet from this account?
