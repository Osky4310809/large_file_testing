Man Stabs Mother, Kills Self After High-Speed Chase February 19, 2017 10:35 AM By Rachel Slavik Filed Under: Fire , Rachel Slavik , Shooting , Wisconsin \nHUDSON, Wis. (WCCO) — What started as a homicide investigation Saturday night turned into a high-speed chase with police dodging gunfire. \nAuthorities in western Wisconsin say a man stabbed and killed his mother, started his apartment on fire, then took authorities on a chase through three counties while shooting at police. \nIt all began at a home on the 700 block of North Meadow Drive, where police were called late Saturday on a report of a domestic dispute. When they arrived, they found family members of 28-year-old Logan Reese hiding in a garage. \nThe family members said Reese stabbed his mother at beat a sibling with a stick. \nAuthorities found the mother, 49-year-old Charlene Wold, inside the home. She had suffered multiple stab wounds and was pronounced dead shortly after. \nReese had driven off before authorities arrived. \nAbout an hour later, as deputies were en route to Reese’s home in Glenwood City, a call came in of a fire and an armed suspect. Authorities say Reese set his apartment on fire and took off. \nNeighbors described a scene of confusion and concern for safety. \nFollowing the fire, Reese took law enforcement from multiple agencies on a 50-mile chase, shooting at officers who were pursuing him. \nReese eventually crashed in Minnesota, near Highway 8 in Taylors Falls. He fired more rounds at officers before shooting and killing himself. \nHighway 8 was closed for a time after the shooting. \nThe incident remains under investigation. The Chisago County Sheriff’s Office is leading the investigation in Minnesota. The St. Croix County Sheriff’s Office is leading the investigation in Wisconsin.
