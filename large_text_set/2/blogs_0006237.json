Advertisement \nThe study, published in Biology Letters , was conducted by researchers at Northumbria University who previously studied the most attractive dance moves for men . Now they’re back with similar findings for women. You may not be surprised to learn that the best female dance moves involve movement with the hips and thighs, but arms also play a pivotal role when it comes to attracting men. The video above shows an example of what the study’s results suggest is a “good female dancer.” And these are the dance moves you should avoid: \nSo ladies, if you really want to stand out from the crowd on the dance floor, swing your hips a lot, make asymmetrical leg movements, and mix in some asymmetric arm movements to top things off. The researchers suggest these moves are more attractive because they demonstrate good health and fertility. Hip swaying could be a cue for fertility on a biological level, and independent use of legs and arms shows that you have decent motor control. Of course, it also helps to have rhythm, so don’t forget about that part. You can learn more about the study at the link below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:14:43.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
