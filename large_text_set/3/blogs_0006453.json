Arpan Rai | Posted by Sanjana Agnihotri Class 12th students wrote their first exam on Thursday. 2 They were all smiles after writing an easy English paper. 3 Even the teachers felt the paper was not challenging enough. \nThe Class-12 students who, battling anxiety, went to take the first exam on Thursday, were cheered up by the paper. It was English and while the smile on their faces - seen while they were coming out of the examination hall - in the afternoon said it all, even the the teachers across the city labelled it as \"an easy one.\" \nSome even said even for an average student, it was an easy paper and that they expected a tougher paper. \"My first reaction to the paper was 'Thank God',\" said Chavee Gupta, a student of Modern School, Vasant Vihar, who is now set for her next board exam. \n\"Every question was concise. I am relieved after attempting today's paper. It has instilled confidence in me and I am feeling more positive now,\" Charvee said. The teachers maintained that there weren't enough challenging questions and the paper - \"least bit challenging\" - has disappointed the gifted and meritorious students. While the questions were redundant, the teachers were unhappy with a degraded version of passages which they say could have been the challenge and thought provoking for the students. \nAlso read: CBSE Board Exam 2017 begins today: Mobile app launched to locate exam centre \n\"The passages in board examinations have a student's rapt attention and remain in a kid's mind for a long time. These passages could be on glorious Indian traditions of interfaith concord, syncretic value system, composite culture, family connect besides others, unlike the existing practice,\" Firoz Bakht Ahmed, senior English teacher from Modern School, Barakhamba Road said. \n\"Easily over 75 per cent of students will secure 80. Today's paper has a positive point allowing a dull kid to walk away with 90,\" he said. \nCharu Gupta, another invigilator at Bal Bharati Public School opines that the \"easy going\" paper will give boost students' confidence. \nAlso read: 10 major steps taken by CBSE board that every student must know before entering the exam hall \nKunjan Kaicker, a senior English teacher at Delhi Public School, Mathura Road confirmed that papersetters had clearly stuck to their favourite areas of questioning and the entire paper had just one challenging and tricky question in the speech section but that bullet was dodged by offering a choice in the same question. \nThe easy paper will require individual examiners to be sensible and sincere in the marking scheme which will be anything but lenient, Kunjan added. \nSamarth Gaur and Himani Arora from Bal Mandir senior secondary school are now relieved and at ease for their upcoming nerve-wracking subject. \"I can go home and sleep well because I am expecting good marks from this paper\".
