(Source: Twitter) \nAam Aadmi Party and Youth Congress workers clashed with each other outside Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal ’s forcing the police to intervene in the matter. Congress workers were reportedly protesting outside Kejriwal’s house because they believe no work has been done during his tenure as the Chief Minister. When the situation was getting out of control, Delhi police used water cannon on Youth Congress supporters. \nYesterday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal attacked both Congress and BJP for failing to work for citizens of Delhi in last 20 years. He lends his voice to a video made for party’s municipal election campaign and asked people whether they are happy with the state of cleanliness in Delhi. “Kya aap Dilli main safai se khush hain? Nahi na. Chaaron taraf kooda hi kooda hai. Sharam aati hai Dilli ko desh ki rajdhani kehte hue… Dilli main saaf-safai MCD ki zimmedari hai, Dilli sarkar ki nahi,” said the Aam Aadmi Party in a direct attack on Bharatiya Janata Party who currently governs MCD. \nYou may also want to watch: \n“MCD has revenue from house tax, advertisements, parking, conversion charges etc; but all of this is lost to corruption. Those who ride a bicycle before elections suddenly buy 5 bungalows, big cars and plots after being elected. They steal our money. There is no work that gets completed without paying a bribe. They don’t even give death certificate without bribes,” he added. \nIn the video, he also asked people to compare the work by BJP and Congress in MCD with the work done by AAP government in last 2 years. AAP released its first list of candidates last week and is fighting the election on the agenda of free water, low electricity bills, government school revamp and mohalla clinics. In last year’s Municipal by polls, Aam Aadmi Party won 5 out of 13 seats.
