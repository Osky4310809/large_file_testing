Forex \nThe Nigerian currency appreciated at the interbank market, closing at N307 to the dollar. \nTraders believe that the continued intervention by the CBN have triggered further apprehension among speculators, who anticipate further losses given the continued crash of the dollar. \nSome BDCs in Abuja stopped selling dollar due to the current price in order to curtail further losses, but they were opened to customers willing to sell at N370 to a dollar. \nAn Abuja-based BDC operator, said besides the dollar sales by the CBN, steady supply have been coming in from individuals who had once hoarded the currency for whatever purpose. \nThe President of Bureau De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, said that appreciation of the Naira, especially in Abuja though good, was causing panic among BDCs. \nHe said this was because the CBN presently sells dollars to BDCs at N381 per dollar, and expects them to sell to the public at N399 per dollar. \nGwadabe called attention to the sharp difference between the Lagos and Abuja parallel market exchange rates. \nHe said the Abuja market was smaller in terms of demand, being dominated by civil servants, while Lagos has higher demand as it service most private businesses in the country. \nExperts are of the opinion that the dollar may likely sell even lower than N380 during the weekend as the future looks dim for the rise of the currency.
