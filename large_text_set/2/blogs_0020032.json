So much so, that saying the growth has been exponential might actually be an understatement. These days, smartphones with octa-core processors, crisp 2K displays and even 6 gigs of RAM are nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, chip makers like Qualcomm are working day in and day out to make their next mobile processors big upgrades in terms of performance. Recently, Qualcomm unveiled the Snapdragon 835 flagship SoC, which is expected to be the go-to choice for many premium smartphones this year. The octa-core processor not only packs better performance and enhanced battery life, but is also the brand’s first chip to utilise the 10nm FinFET manufacturing process. All this means that the new chip is one of the most anticipated components in mobile hardware at this time. When can we see a smartphone running on the Snapdragon 835? Or rather, which devices are expected to sport the latest and greatest from Qualcomm? Well, in a bid to put an end to all those questions, we have rounded up all the smartphones that are expected to draw power from the SD835 chipset. Samsung Galaxy S8 / S8+ \nThe Galaxy S8 and S8+ duo might be the reason some other devices have been knocked out of this list… *cough* LG G6 *cough*. Yes, that’s true. It’s being reported that the availability of the Snapdragon 835 for other manufacturers will take a hit as Samsung gobbles up all the initial batches of chips for its upcoming flagship duo. The S8 duo is expected to come with a revamped look. Gone will be the front physical home button in lieu of slimmer bezels, while the fingerprint scanner will move to the back. The S8 and S8+ are expected to ship with 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch QHD Super AMOLED displays respectively, with up to 6GB of RAM and a much improved camera. Owing to the Note7 fiasco, the S8 launch has been pushed back, and we expect the device to be launched in late March. \nRelated read: What to expect from the Samsung Galaxy S8 Nokia 8 \nWith HMD Global at its back, Nokia made a re-entry into the smartphone segment and has launched the Android Nougat-running Nokia 6 . However, the launch of the device is limited to China, and the smartphone is not actually a flagship, but a mid-ranger. While the company might be prepping a global variant of the device, numerous reports have flooded the interwebs about a new Nokia flagship, rumoured to be called the Nokia 8 (or Nokia P1). Apart from sporting the new Snapdragon 835 SoC, the 8 is expected to boast a premium metal build with features like resistance to dust and water, as well as stereo speakers. The brand is expected to equip the phone with a 5.5-inch or a 5.7-inch QHD Super AMOLED display. You won’t have to wait long for the announcement, which is speculated to take place on February 26th. \nRelated read: What to expect from the Nokia 8 Xiaomi Mi 6 \nThe upcoming flagship from Xiaomi was earlier rumoured to go official on February 14th, however as the date came closer, it became clear that this wasn’t meant to be. Now, the Chinese conglomerate is speculated to launch the device sometime in March or April this year. The latest rumours claim that the Mi 6 will be launched in multiple variants, with at least one variant powered by the Snapdragon 835 SoC. Other leaked specifications include up to 6GB of RAM, up to 256GB of storage and a 4,000mAh battery with support for Quick Charge 4.0. Will all the Mi 6 variants make their way to India or not is a question for another day. \nRelated read: What to expect from the Xiaomi Mi 6 HTC 11 \nEven though the HTC 10 ( review ) was a decent flagship, it received a lukewarm response from users due to the lack of any standout feature. HTC is expected to learn from this experience and bring something new to the table with the HTC 11 . The smartphone will purportedly be announced sometime in March or April and is expected to feature the latest hardware available in the market, including a Snapdragon 835 SoC. Other rumoured specifications include a 2K display, and a mammoth 8GB of RAM. OnePlus 4 \nThe OnePlus 3T ( review ) is one of the best Android smartphones available in the market currently, and this means its successor has some big shoes to fill when it launches later this year. Apart from usual upgrades in hardware, there isn’t really much OnePlus can improve in its next device. However, an improved camera and longer battery life are two things we’d surely want from the OnePlus 4 . If there’s anything we want unchanged, it has to be the snappy performance of the device. Google Pixel 2 \nGoogle introduced the first-generation Pixel smartphones last year, and most reviews acknowledged them as the benchmarks for Android flagships. However, there were still some chinks in the armour like their unappealing design and the lack of water resistance. We expect the search giant to cater to these issues in the Pixel 2 , making it a significant upgrade over its predecessors. Just like the Pixel and Pixel XL ( review ), the next-gen Pixel devices are rumoured to make use of Qualcomm’s flagship mobile processor – the Snapdragon 835 in this case. LG V30 \nOver the last couple of years, LG has started releasing two flagships a year. This year, the two flagships are expected to be the LG G6 (read: what to expect from the LG G6 ) and the V30. With the G6 unable to make use of the Snapdragon 835 chip, LG could look forward to implementing it in its other flagship of the year – the V30. In fact, recent reports have claimed this to be the case. Other leaked specifications of the device include a massive 6GB of RAM, as well as dual cameras on both the front and the back. Additionally, the V30 will pack an improved audio experience, which would be a big plus for audiophiles, given the V20 ( review ) is also pretty good when it comes to audio. Worthy Mentions \nModularity took a new turn with the Moto Z ( review ), but it was just the beginning. The Moto Z (2017) is rumoured to take the concept forward, apart from being a more powerful device. This means that the Snapdragon 835 SoC could be running at the heart of the upcoming Moto Z (2017) smartphone. \nLast, but certainly not the least is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 . We know that the Note lineup will not be killed, and it’ll be interesting to see what the brand adds to the series after the Note7 debacle. One can expect Snapdragon and Exynos-powered variants of the device, which won’t blow up spontaneously… hopefully.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:20:31.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
