I think we share that interest and that intention.” \nMrs May will become the first national leader to hold face to face talks with President Trump. \nFor her visit to the White House, the Prime Minister is expected to wear a striking Amanda Wakeley red two-piece suit with matching LK Bennett shoes for her meeting with the president today, championing the work of British fashion designers. GETTY Theresa May said that opposites attract in a speech discussed her relationship with Trump \nAnd asked on the flight how she expected to get on with the brash former tycoon, she said: “Haven’t you ever noticed that sometimes opposites attract?” We both share a desire to see governments working for everyone Theresa May \nMany allies of both leaders expect them to rekindle the level of personal chemistry enjoyed by their predecessors Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. \nMrs May insisted she was determined to strengthen the transatlantic partnership as well as speaking “directly” to President Trump. \n“What is important is having the opportunity to sit down with President Trump and talk to him face to face about the issues, about the interests we share, about the Special Relationship, about the challenges we both face. \n“I will be able to talk directly to him and hear directly from him what his views are,” she said. \n“I am sure I will leave with a very clear picture, I want to give him a very clear picture. \n“I believe what will come out of this will be a very clear determination on both sides not just to maintain the Special Relationship but also to build the Special Relationship in the future.” \nMrs May was enthusiastic about the opportunity to forge a new free trade deal with the US as Britain leaves the EU. GETTY Donald Trump has repeatedly spoken out in support of Britain leaving the European Union \n“We are both very clear we want a trade deal, it will be in the interests of the UK, he will have the interests of the US. I believe we can come to an agreement that is in the interests of both,” she said. \n“There is a limit to how far we can go in terms of a formal free trade agreement until we have actually left the EU. I think there is much we can do in the interim in terms of looking at how we can remove some of the barriers to trade in a number of areas so that we are able to see an advantage to both of us.” \nShe added: “I’m certainly looking forward to this trip. \n“The purpose of this trip - and I am pleased I am going so early in the administration - is to build on the Special Relationship. \n“That Special Relationship between the UK and the US has been important for security across the world and particularly for the West.” \nMrs May promised to be direct in raising points of disagreement with the President. \nShe will press him on the strategic importance of the NATO alliance, which he has raised doubts about. \nAnd she will refuse to endorse his backing for torture in interrogating terrorist suspects. \n“We condemn torture and my view on that won’t change whether I’m talking to you or talking to the President,” she said. GETTY The Prime Minister insisted she wants to strengthen Britain's relationship with the United States \n“We condemn it, we do not believe in torture and that position has been clear for some time and is not going to change.” \nDowning Street officials said the Government was building strong links with the new White House administration. \n“The level of engagement between us and the Trump administration has been much mores extensive than with any other country,” a Downing Street source said. \nOn Thursday Mrs May began her two-day visit to the US with a speech to Republican Party congressmen and women hailing the historic links between the two countries and calling on both nation to lead the world in a period of change. \nMrs May spoke of the long history of British and American partnership, playing an important joint leadership role for the West. \nShe said that in the face of new global challenges the world needed British and US leadership now more than ever. \nThe two nations needed to “renew their special relationship for modern times”, she said. \nIt had long been America’s destiny to bear the responsibility of the leadership of the free world, she told the audience. \nBut the UK was proud to share that burden, she added. The Mexico Wall: Trump gives the go ahead Thu, January 26, 2017 The structures, fences and walls that mark the border between the United States and Mexico as President Donald Trump reiterates his promise to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.
