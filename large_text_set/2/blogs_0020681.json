Live, he's joined by a rotating lineup of musicians, but on record he still handles everything. After almost 20 years on the scene he's earned both the respect of the underground, as well as making some serious inroads into the mainstream. In recent years Joel has also become well known for his work behind the boardsâ€”engineering records for some of the biggest, most well respected bands in punk and metal today. In this second episode of Noisey's new metal show, Noisey Shreds , we caught up with the band before their Brooklyn show at Saint Vitus, and took Joel on a tour of the cobwebs and creatures of the Morbid Anatomy Museum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:18:04.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
