Abraham took his goal superbly, with a perfectly timed run to meet David Cotterill’s cross and guide it beyond the goalkeeper. Bristol City have hence climbed out of the relegation zone but remain only one point ahead of Blackburn, who are placed 22nd (out of 24). Huddersfield, on the other hand, remain six points behind Brighton, with a game in hand. WHAT A WIN TONIGHT !! ❤⚽️ can't describe the feeling buzzing with the goal too. Support again tonight was unreal #BCFC — Tammy abraham (@tammyabraham) March 17, 2017 VIDEO: #BristolCity caught up with Oscar Collins, the ballboy at the heart of @tammyabraham 's goal celebration. https://t.co/FbFBIb4nyY pic.twitter.com/XkzfFiJ0u0 — Bristol City FC (@bcfctweets) March 23, 2017 Meanwhile, Brown appears to have suffered an injury that has kept him out of International duty. He is back at Cobham recovering; hopefully he’ll return to Huddersfield before long. A post shared by Izzy Jay Brown (@izzyjaybrown) on Mar 23, 2017 at 1:22pm PDT Upcoming fixtures: Bristol City - Brentford (A, April 1), Preston (A, April 4) Huddersfield - Burton Albion (H, April 1), Norwich City (H, April 5) Thanks to multiple injuries to first-choice defenders, Fikayo Tomori started for Brighton for the first time in the Championship. Playing at right-back in place of captain Bruno Saltor, Tomori gave a good account of himself and held his own for most of the 2-0 loss to Leeds United, though he did give away a penalty late on, which was converted for Leeds’ second goal and sealed the victory in the 85th minute. Brighton fans seemed pleased with his display nevertheless. Upcoming fixtures: Blackburn (H, April 1), Birmingham (H, April 4) Fulham missed a chance to climb into the promotion play-off places for the second week running, losing 1-3 to Wolverhampton. Tomas Kalas started in defence. Making the play-offs is still a very realistic prospect for them though, as they remain a single point behind Sheffield Wednesday, who occupy 6th place. Upcoming fixtures: Rotherham (A, April 1), Derby (A, April 4) Newcastle’s winless run stretched to three games, after they could obtain nothing more than a goalless draw against Birmingham. Christian Atsu was an 82nd minute substitute. Upcoming fixtures: Wigan (H, April 1), Burton Albion (H, April 5) Jay Dasilva was a 71st minute substitute in midweek for Charlton, against Bradford City. He was called upon once more in the weekend, in the 84th minute of Charlton’s 2-1 loss to Sheffield United. That’s two consecutive appearances, which is massive progress! Fankaty Dabo and Charlie Colkett started in Swindon’s midweek 2-4 loss to Sheffield United, as well as in their 2-1 loss to Bradford City on Saturday. Dabo, however, was hauled off at half-time in the latter game. Against Sheffield, Colkett scored an absolute screamer to make it 1-2 just after the re-start; all his efforts have been in vain though, as Swindon seem earmarked for relegation. League One fixtures continued over the international break as well, with Swindon notching a 1-0 win against Millwall but remaining firmly rooted to 22nd place. Colkett played the whole 90 and Dabo played 70 minutes; Feruz was not involved. @Beeves16 and David Wheater make the @TheLeaguePaper team of the weekend — BWFC Zone (@BWFCZone) March 26, 2017 Massive win today. 6 huge games left ⚽️ — Fankaty Dabo (@FankDabo) March 25, 2017 Jamal Blackman started in goal as Wycombe drew 1-1 against Plymouth, beat Hartlepool United 0-2 and lost 0-1 to Notts County. Alex Kiwomya played 7 minutes in Crewe’s 0-3 win against Crawley but was an unused substitute against Colchester United. Nathan Baxter started in goal for Solihull Moors in their games against Forest Green Rovers, North Ferriby United and Barrow, conceding 7 goals altogether. GERMANY: Andreas Christensen and Borussia Monchengladbach suffered a torrid week, first crashing out of the Europa League on away goals to Schalke (despite a goal from the defender), and then losing 0-1 to Bayern Munich. Upcoming fixtures: Frankfurt (A, April 1), Hertha Berlin (H, April 5) Michael Hector started for Eintracht Frankfurt in their goalless draw against Hamburg. Upcoming fixtures: Monchengladbach (H, April 1), Koln (A, April 4) THE NETHERLANDS: Lewis Baker, Matt Miazga and Nathan started in Vitesse’s 1-0 loss to PSV. Marco van Ginkel started for PSV, making his return from a minor injury. Upcoming fixtures: Vitesse - NEC (H, April 2), Heracles (A, April 5) PSV - Sparta (A, April 1) Bertrand Traore played 81 minutes and scored a goal as Ajax beat FC Kobenhavn 2-0 to progress to the quarterfinals of the Europa League, where they will face Schalke. He then played 67 minutes as a striker in the absence of Kasper Dolberg against Excelsior, for whom Danilo Pantic was an unused substitute. Upcoming fixtures: Feyenoord (H, April 2), AZ Alkmaar (H, April 5) OTHERS: Mario Pasalic played the last 15 minutes in AC Milan’s 1-0 win against Genoa. Upcoming fixtures: Pescara (A, April 2), Granada’s 3-1 loss against Sporting Gijon bore a rare sight; Victorien Angban and Jeremie Boga both started for Granada, for the first time this season. They were both taken off at the same time as well, in 76th minute. Upcoming fixtures: Barcelona (H, April 2), Deportivo (A, April 5) Kenneth Omeruo played the whole 90 in Alanyaspor’s 1-3 win against Bursaspor.
