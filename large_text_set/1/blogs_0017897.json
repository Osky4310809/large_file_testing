We played better than them so I am satisfied. The players did not deserve that. Maybe in the future we will learn from this.” New goalkeeper \nOne thing even Pep seems to be admitting privately is the fact that he does need a new goalkeeper, with Claudio Bravo failing to impress time and time again – and an alternative already being considered. \nThere will be no way back for Joe Hart either, and with several other players underperforming to boot, it could well be all change at City next season.
