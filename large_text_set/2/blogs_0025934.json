His cover of Shawn Mendes’ song earned a turn around from Adam Levine and Gwen Stefani.\nGwen said that his parents must be so proud of him. Gwen said that she would do everything she can to teach what she has learned. Alicia Keys said that he was really amazing. Blake Shelton threw his support towards Gwen. Adam responded that it is obvious that Mark should be in pop. Mark spoke about struggling with being overweight but he is excited to be performing.\nMark picked Adam as his coach.\nWhat did you think of the blind audition? Let us know in the comments section.\nThe Voice Social Media Reactions @Markisaiahmusic You go boooo #VoicePremiere \n— Amber Workman (@amberworkman20) February 28, 2017 \n\nThe kid who just sang on @NBCTheVoice is going to be huge. I was floored by how good he is.\n— Anthony De Rosa (@Anthony) February 28, 2017 \n\n@ShawnMendes would be s proud of you, @Markisaiahmusic !! #VoicePremiere \n— Brian M (@BriansReMorse) February 28, 2017 \n\nGrammy Award-winning artist Gwen Stefani returns as a coach this season, joining megastars Alicia Keys, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton and host Carson Daly.\nThe show’s innovative format features five stages of competition: the first begins with the blind auditions, followed by the battle rounds, the knockouts, the live playoffs and, finally, the live performance shows.\nDuring the blind auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not on looks. The coaches hear the artists perform, but they don’t get to see them – thanks to rotating chairs. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. At this point, the coach’s chair will swivel so that he/she can face the artist he/she has selected. If more than one coach pushes his/her button, the power then shifts to the artists to choose which coach they want to work with. If no coach pushes his/her button, the artist is eliminated from the competition.\nPhoto Credit: NBC\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:38:55.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
