(credit: Joni Dunning Armstrong) \nNEWBURGH, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) — A CSX freight train derailed in an industrial area of Newburgh, NY Tuesday afternoon. \nAuthorities say there are two minor injuries to members of the train crew. \nThe Orange County Office of Emergency Management says the train hit a piece of equipment on the tracks, causing the locomotive and several train cars to derail. \nThere were no hazardous materials on board the train, according to the county OEM. \nIn a statement issued Tuesday, Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney said he was getting “sick and tired of issuing statements about dangerous train derailments — this time only blocks from my office in Newburgh.” \n“I’m glad to hear reports that no one was killed but even one injury is too many,” the statement continued. “It’s got to stop.” \nMaloney called trains carrying hazardous materials “literally a train wreck waiting to happen.” \n“We have to get smarter about how we transport crude oil, and invest in installing positive train control (PTC) on all our trains,” he continued. “The longer we fail to prioritize investing in rail safety infrastructure and technology, the more innocent lives we put in jeopardy.” \nMaloney is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. \nThe investigation is ongoing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:19:37.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
