Accountability is the foundation of any relationship, and without it, the function of my work is counterproductive.”\nBut a year later, Burkhardt is representing Manziel again, although Rapoport says that the quarterback had to “make serious commitments” to the agent.\nManziel, 24, is still facing a misdemeanor assault charge stemming from a domestic dispute last January with his then-girlfriend and spent Tuesday in a Dallas County court. In fall, he reached an agreement with the court to drop the charge if Manziel could meet certain conditions, including the completion of a substance-abuse program.\n\"Everything has been going extremely smoothly and my life is trending upward,\" Manziel told Judge Roberto Cañas, according to the Dallas Morning News . \"So I don't even want to let this get anywhere near the rabbit hole that you were describing. This situation is in my hands. ... I need to get my life in order. These are the things I need to do.\"\nManziel was a first-round pick of the Cleveland Browns in the 2014 NFL draft and made eight starts in two seasons. He threw seven touchdowns and seven interceptions, but checked into a treatment program after his rookie season and had a seemingly never-ending list of off-field problems before he was released in March 2016 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T20:54:05.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
