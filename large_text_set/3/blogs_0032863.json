By Lauren Mazzo | Mar 30, 2017 Topics: \nToday, the U.S. Senate voted on a bill that allows states to block federal funding from abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. In a rare tiebreaker situation, Vice President Pence cast the final vote to support the bill and send the legislation to President Donald Trump's desk. \nThe bill will dismiss a rule put in place under Obama that prohibited states from blocking the use of federal funds for organizations that provide abortions. ICYMI, this was a looming possibility. President Trump (who's anti–Planned Parenthood) promised to defund the organization immediately after taking office. Plus, the Senate—currently split 52–48 with a Republican majority—voted against keeping birth control free earlier this year. And VP Pence made a statement at the March for Life demonstration in January, pledging to keep taxpayer dollars from aiding abortion providers. \nBut just last week, the GOP pulled their new health care bill , the American Health Care Act, just before it went to vote—giving Planned Parenthood supporters and advocates of free birth control the opportunity for a much-needed sigh of relief. Until today. \nThere's something interesting about this vote, though. Every single Democrat voted against the bill, and every Republican, with the exception of two women, voted for it. FYI, there are currently only 21 women in the U.S. Senate . Sixteen are Democrats and five are Republicans. Of those five Republican senators, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska both voted against the bill, meaning only three women voted for the anti–Planned Parenthood bill. \nWhile Planned Parenthood has services available to all genders and sexualities, this legislation specifically targets abortion—which, in nature—only affect female bodies. There's something inherently wrong with a bill that almost exclusively has repercussions for women only getting about 14 percent support from the population it will be affecting. Just let that simmer for a sec. \nIf this news makes you want to run to Canada, well, there's good news: their Prime Minister totally supports women's rights .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:34:40.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
