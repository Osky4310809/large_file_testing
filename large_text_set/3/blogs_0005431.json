It's Going Viral Tweet Posted: Wed, 3/1/2017 - 9:47pm by Cat Pajamas \nDo you believe in ghosts? Well you're about to either have your belief confirmed OR have your eyes opened to some of the creepiest proof a skeptic has ever laid eyes on. One mom's innocent picture of her kids on a fishing trip is going viral thanks to the fact that it 100 percent proves that ghosts are 100 percent real. See for yourself: \nJust as the mom explains in her post, there is clearly a ghost man in the right of the picture next to her son. The detail of the ghost shape is what makes it especially creepy â€” you can see his baseball hat, his buttoned-up shirt, and even the blank stare and smile on his face. It's just too clear to be mistaken as a shadow or an optical illusion. Of course, for every person taking this as definitive ghost proof there are JUST AS MANY skeptics who think this is just another bullsh*t Photoshop job (even if it is a pretty freaking good one). \nIs it me or did it just get very, very cold in here? (source) \nBut why is everyone so thirsty to scream \"Photoshop\" so quickly these days?! Is it because we've all been duped so many times before? (Probably.) In fact, it wouldn't be THAT surprising if this was another bizarre yet genius viral campaign for a movie, or was one of those mean Jimmy Kimmel pranks . But for now, can we all just enjoy the idea that ghosts actually exist? I mean, why do stories always depict ghosts as these evil, heinous \"beings\" that are hell-bent on hurting the living? Maybe they just want to help young children catch big fish! \nO maybe they want to destroy anyone who gets to enjoy the sweet breath of life simply because they know we don't appreciate it. \nOrrrr maybe they just want to have sexy encounters with us at Color Me Mine? \nWhatever the ghosts' real motives for stalking the living are, I'm taking this picture as PROOF that they're real, and I'm never going fishing again. \nWhat do you think of the pic? Is it real or Photoshopped? And if you think it's Photoshopped, why would anyone do that to such a mundane and innocent picture? Let us know on Twitter @Smosh !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T07:34:21.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
