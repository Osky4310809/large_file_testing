Rakhi Sawant got PM Modi’s picture printed on her outfit for an event in Las Vegas \nWe received the news that a video of Rakhi Sawant is going viral on the internet. Now, that should not surprise anyone, but the details of the video gave us a shock. The video shows Rakhi changing clothes in a dressing room, unaware of the camera. The woman in the video looks exactly like Rakhi, and even sounds like her. But there is more to the story…. \nRakhi Sawant is always at the thick of controversy. Sometimes it’s her words that bring her trouble, rest of the times it is her choice of clothing. A lot of times she invites the controversy, but more than that controversy comes knocking at her door. We got in touch with the sassy diva, and asked her about the video, and she was aware that something as malicious as this was going viral. “This is not me,” she exclaimed. “Someone has morphed my face, and has been spreading it on WhatsApp.” she said. Well, we wonder what this controversy has in store next for Rakhi. Fornow, we just can inform you that she claims it is not her in the video. She also added that she was shooting for her upcoming film Before Christmas in Kashmir, all this while. So, is this a scene from her movie? Or someone with malign intentions doing this to Rakhi? \nThis is not the first time an actress has been victimised by a leak of of her personal pictures and videos. Back in August 2014, almost 500 pictures of Hollywood actresses were leaked by someone after they hacked into their icloud accounts. The event came to be known as The Fappening by online trolls. Very recently someone allegedly hacked into RJ Suchitra’s Twitter account, and leaked a few intimate pictures of South Indian actresses. Also, after this, many fake profiles of RJ Suchitra popped up and many more videos of objectionable quality started flooding the feeds. Mona Singh, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Riya Sen have all been victim of leaking of morphed videos in the past.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T17:15:21.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
