Watch | Theresa May's New Year message 04:06 \n\"The social and cultural unions represented by families, communities, towns, cities, counties and nations are the things that define us and make us strong.\" \n“And it is the job of government to encourage and nurture these relationships and institutions where it can, and to correct the injustice and unfairness that divides us wherever it is found.” \nT he piece will be seen as signalling a major departure from generations of Tory thinking that the best way to help the most deprived is to deliver economic growth through the free market. \nIt also indicates Mrs May’s determination to rebrand the Conservatives as the party of the “working class” and confine the Labour Party to electoral irrelevance. \nThe Prime Minister's article previews a speech to be delivered tomorrow that will reveal her vision for reforming British society after almost six months of thinking inside Downing Street. \nIt is designed to build on her promise made on the steps of Number 10 to tackle injustice and “make Britain a country that works for everyone”.

They need an active government that will step up and champion the things that matter to them,” she says. \n“From tackling the increasing lack of affordability in housing, fixing broken markets to help with the cost of living, and building a great meritocracy where every child has the opportunity of a good school place, we will act across every layer of society to restore the fairness that is the bedrock of the social solidarity that makes our nation strong.” \nThe comments will raise eyebrows in the energy sector, which has been alarmed by Mrs May’s interventionist rhetoric and fear the government could adopt price caps, something proposed by former Labour leader Ed Miliband.

The vision formed a central part of his 2010 election campaign but was sidelined as focussed on steadying the economy after taking office. Theresa May Credit: REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth \nM rs May’s speech at a Charity Commision event tomorrow comes after a week in which she has been criticised by some commentators for indecision and lacking a vision for Britain. \nLater this month the Prime Minister will address criticism over her reluctance to reveal her Brexit priorities ahead of the negotiations, to be formally triggered by the end of March. \nElsewhere in Mrs May’s article she criticises Westminster for failing to listen to voters’ concerns - an apparent reference to fears about the level of immigration being ignored. \nShe also hints at a willingness to scale back pensioner benefits, referring to “resentments” growing from having a “more prosperous older generation and a struggling younger generation”. \nShe finishes her piece: “For it is only by being a government that works for everyone that we can tackle the injustice and unfairness that threatens to drive us apart, nurture a new sense of solidarity and citizenship in Britain, and show all those who voted with such hope last year – many who voted for the first time in years, and others for the first time at all – that mainstream, centre-ground politics can deliver the change they need.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:01:01.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
