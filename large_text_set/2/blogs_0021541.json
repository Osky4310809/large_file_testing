You might be happy to hear the latest (and very important ) scientific discovery. According to scientists, obese men last longer during sex than skinny guys do. So if you’re date night consists of a personal large pizza for the both of you, you might be in for a good time. 2 GIF \nResearchers at Turkey’s Erciyes University conducted a study called “Insight on pathogenesis of lifelong premature ejaculation: inverse relationship between lifelong premature ejaculation and obesity” and found that obese men last 7.5 minutes during sex, compared to thinner men’s average of six minutes. This is due to a higher amount of estradiol in their bodies, which is a female sex hormone that can suppress the male orgasm. In case you haven’t put two and two together, a suppressed orgasm means longer sex sessions. 3 GIF \nBefore anyone gets their panties in a twist, no one is saying you should be obese. There are obvious implications to an excess of fatty foods.

Turning those apples into a sugary, delicious, buttery pie every now and then won’t hurt you in the sack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:40:36.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
