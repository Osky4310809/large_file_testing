With only a week and a half until Inauguration Day and the march , the pair is pushing for a last-minute rush of orders to get to rally-goers in time.\nSEE ALSO: Here's why you'll be seeing pink 'pussyhats' during the Women's March on Washington\nIn a conversation with Mashable Tuesday from their 500-square-foot Ann Arbor, MI apartment, which is overflowing with pin orders, Lind and Stevens said they wanted to show support for women's issues and and civil liberties.\n\"Something about the symbol and design is so evocative,\" Stevens said about the pin. \"It starts conversations.\"\nKate Lind and Nate Stevens are raising money through Pincause.\nImage: Pincause\nAnd that's what they want. When Michigan went \"red\" in November, the two realized they needed to understand more about their Donald Trump-voting neighbors.\nThe pins, Stevens said, \"create more of a loving way to start conversation,\" rather than throwing around hate and anger.\nCampaign and election pins are nothing new, but the couple wanted to design something that connected people and \"something that anyone can wear no matter where they are in the country.\"\nThank you Pinners for your support. We love seeing you all doing your lives wearing your #pincauselove thank you for supporting #womensrights #womensmarch\nA photo posted by Pincause (@thepincause) on Jan 10, 2017 at 11:44am PST\nLind said she wanted to create something with a colorful hand from the start. An artist friend came up with a fist, which Lind said felt not quite right. \"We've seen a lot of hate spewed in every direction,\" but she believes \"compassion and love will bring people together.\"\nShe remembered learning ASL in middle school and how perfectly succinct and effective the \"I love you\" sign was.\nThey decided to go with that symbol, and even though they weren't directly connected to the deaf community, they've received touching feedback from people with deaf relatives. \"We have more of a connection to that community now,\" Stevens said.\nMany of us are marching for the next generation. Here's to these young, young women saying \"I marched and things changed\" when they are grey and old. Share the love with all ages #pincauselove #womensrights #womensmarch\nA photo posted by Pincause (@thepincause) on Jan 7, 2017 at 7:10pm PST\nJust a few weeks later, momentum is picking up and more people are posting pictures wearing the pins, including many shots of mothers and daughters flashing the \"I love you\" sign.\n\"It's cool to be raising money through beauty and love,\" Stevens said.\nStart looking out for the pins — the couple hopes they'll be worn at the main march and at rallies all over the country. They said the pins are about creating a community.\nBONUS: As predicted, Donald Trump wakes up and rants about Meryl Streep on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BPGJVO4BGXE/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mlVEYlqeOxWzySFhyAYXyCMKxKA=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F344103%2F545b8d88-a58f-4195-baaf-3659d065a31f.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/1uUBuPxp.jpg", "https://pincause.com/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BO_OEvMBHIe/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/1uUBuPxp.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Sg_1EbGvz8W9-y7oOcnLDcSjtlI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F344103%2F545b8d88-a58f-4195-baaf-3659d065a31f.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-11T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T04:07:03.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
