Opened in 1989, this location carries both seasonal merchandise and a rich history. \nAs offerings change with the seasons, along with the shop’s decor, you can find something special throughout the year. Costumes hang during Halloween Time , and ornaments deck the walls during Holidays at the Disneyland Resort . You will also find the Disney Showcase Annex within the shop year-round, which is the only location in Disneyland park that offers embroidery. If you’re looking to customize items like blankets, kitchen towels and T-shirts with a name or sweet message, this spot is a must-visit.\n\nThis classic building also houses the Main Street Hotel, a hot spot for Victorian residents wishing to immerse themselves in the hustle and bustle of an early 20th century downtown. Talk about a prime view of horse-drawn carriages, motor vehicles and town performers!\nBefore Disney Showcase occupied this corner of Main Street, U.S.A., the famous Wurlitzer Music Hall once stood in its place from opening day until 1968. Yes, there was once a time where you could purchase a piano or organ at Disneyland! Daily concerts also entertained guests in this very shop. The Wurlitzer Music Hall transitioned to “The Legacy of Walt Disney” in 1970 and later became “Disneyland Presents a Preview of Coming Attractions” in 1973. Take a look at this shot of an early Main Street, U.S.A., where the Wurlitzer sign is prominently displayed.\n\nWhat’s your favorite shop to browse on Main Street, U.S.A.?
