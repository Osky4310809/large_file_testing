There are a lot of them, but don’t worry – we’ll take it one old white guy at a time.\nID: 10320381 1. Let’s start with Alabama senator and Trump’s pick for attorney general Jeff Sessions. View this image › \nChip Somodevilla / Getty Images To remember which one Jeff Sessions is, just imagine the look of an old man in a restaurant who’s angry that his soup is too hot.\nID: 10303967 2. Then we have formed Georgia governor Sonny Perdue, who has just been tapped for secretary of agriculture. View this image › \nAl Messerschmidt / Getty Images For Perdue, imagine a man whose soup is just right .\nID: 10376604 3. And then there’s businessman Andy Puzder, the nominee for labor secretary. View this image › \nJason Kempin / Getty Images To remember what Andy Puzder looks like, get a 5-year-old child to draw a man wearing glasses. Snatch the paper away after 30 seconds whether or not the child has finished.\nID: 10304221 4. Next we have former governor of Texas and future secretary of energy Rick Perry. View this image › \nKena Betancur / AFP / Getty Images To imagine what Rick Perry looks like, imagine a celebrity divorce lawyer who actually causes the divorces in the first place. With his penis.\n“That was pretty fun,” he says, as he leaves your bedroom in the LA hills. “By the way, here’s my card.”\nID: 10304307 5. Then there’s Montana representative and nominee for secretary of the interior Ryan Zinke. View this image › \nKena Betancur / AFP / Getty Images To remember what Ryan Zinke looks like, imagine your own face when you see your crush being friendly to someone else.\nID: 10304345 6. Ryan Zinke is not to be confused with former deputy secretary of veterans affairs and nominee to head the VA David Shulkin. View this image › \nDominick Reuter / AFP / Getty Images For Shulkin, imagine a man who just saw his investors being nice to someone else.\nID: 10310672 7. Good! Now for former partner at Goldman Sachs and nominee for treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin. This one’s easy! View this image › \nDrew Angerer / Getty Images To imagine what Steve Mnuchin looks like, think back to that one creepy guy in the club who was wearing sunglasses for some reason, even though he was indoors and it wasn’t even sunny outside. And it was night. \nID: 10303962 8. What about former Exxon Mobil CEO and nominee for secretary of state Rex Tillerson? View this image › \nBen Stansall / AFP / Getty Images To remember what Rex Tillerson looks like, imagine a man who was asked when he was 8 what he wanted to be when he grew up, and replied “an international oil executive.”\nEither that or imagine an angry wizard.\nID: 10304312 9. Yes, that’s a lot of white men to remember! But there’s still more, so stay focused. Next up: retired general and secretary of defense James Mattis. View this image › \nAaron P. Bernstein / Getty Images For Mattis, imagine you are on a plane. You take your seat, get settled, and strike up a friendly conversation with the man next to you. He seems nice!\nAbout a half hour into the flight, though, the kindly man starts telling you a slightly dodgy war story and you get a bit uncomfortable. When he whispers “ and then we crushed them utterly, utterly, utterly ” you accidentally knock over your white wine, apologise profusely, and excuse yourself politely to use the toilet even though the seatbelt sign is on. When you return to your seat, he is sound asleep.\nThat’s what James Mattis looks like.\nID: 10304323 10. Right. Nearly there. What about billionaire investor and nominee for secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross? Spencer Platt / Getty Images, Drew Angerer / Getty Images\n  To remember what Wilbur Ross looks like, imagine a cheeky goblin on his way to do cheeky goblin business.\nID: 10304768 11. Next we have Georgia representative and nominee for secretary of health and human services Tom Price. View this image › \nMark Wilson / Getty Images To remember what he looks like, imagine the man in your life who most loves Christmas.\nID: 10304784 12. Then there’s the new secretary of homeland security, John Kelly. Joe Raedle / Getty Images\n  To remember what John Kelly looks like, imagine a Death Eater who didn’t really bother to look for Voldemort before he got his body back, then kind of turned up with a bullshitty excuse about how he had “always remained totally loyal and committed to helping the Dark Lord’s return to power”. (He was actually sitting around at home enjoying a quiet family life.)\nID: 10331800 13. Next, there’s Vice President Mike Pence. View this image › \nChip Somodevilla / Getty Images If you can recognise ANY of these middle-aged white men, it’s probably Mike Pence. But don’t feel bad if you can’t! These men look remarkably similar. \nTo remember Pence, you could just close your eyes and imagine a cartoon villain, but the problem is, that’s what MOST middle-aged white men look like. Instead, imagine a boss who is very pleased that his younger subordinate, Jacob, let him win at tennis. Then imagine a boss who is very pleased that Jacob lets him win at tennis every single week .\nThere you have it: Mike Pence’s face.\nID: 10303955 That’s it! That’s all of them. Now go forth into the world with a firm knowledge of which white guy is which in Trump’s cabinet.
