We expected them to be quick - we're still not sure how quick we are or how quick Ferrari are.\" Watch as the new Red Bull takes to the track in Barcelona on day one of the first test. \nFerrari, of course, can also not be discounted from the title battle. The SF70-H appears to be just as reliable as the Mercedes, while Kimi Raikkonen topped the timesheets on Day Two on the soft tyre. \nDay Two: Ferrari ahead of Mercedes \nWhere Red Bull hope to make their superiority count is through aerodynamics, which was thought to be the key to success in 2017, led by technical chief Adrian Newey. \nBut even Newey, winner of 10 world championships during his time with Williams, McLaren and Red Bull was wary of the gap his team must make up if they were to claim a first title since 2013. \n\"Undoubtedly, it's still an engine formula,\" Newey told Sky F1's Ted Kravitz. \n\"We're still in a position where one per cent power is worth one tenth of a second, and one per cent aero is also around a tenth of a second. So if you're getting five per cent more out of the engine, you need to find five per cent from aero for the same lap time. \n\"We're still trying, but we don't know. We know what we've achieved over the winter but we have no idea if that's better or worse than our rivals.\" \nThe Sky Sports F1 Digital team will be providing live commentary from dawn until dusk for all days of winter testing while Sky Sports News HQ will also deliver live updates from trackside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:52:51.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
