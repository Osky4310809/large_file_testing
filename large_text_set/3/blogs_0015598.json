He resigned as CEO of Kushner Cos. and as publisher of the New York Observer before joining the White House.\n\nBut the plan to move rankled The Guardian’s reporters, who feared their sources might not have full confidence that they could communicate securely with journalists in the new office. Reporters wondered openly whether the next Edward Snowden would feel safe leaking to The Guardian if it was headquartered in a building linked to the president’s son-in-law, according to one source, who suggested staffers also didn’t like the idea of the new commute. (Dumbo isn’t a particularly easy neighborhood to get to).\nA spokesperson for Guardian US said that the company changed plans when it learned of Kushner’s ties to the building. The company now has plans to move to an office in Midtown Manhattan in May, the spokesperson said.\nThe Guardian has spent the last few months slashing costs through newsroom buyouts. According to two people familiar with the matter, the change in plans has cost the company a nominal amount.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:01:24.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
