I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a guy single handily hand games to teams in the sheer quantity that he has. jvw1982 says: Jan 1, 2017 8:55 PM \nI’m sure he wants to thank the front office for not signing the teams best defender until after the season started for no apparent reason….easy to blame the coach but the front office didn’t do its job either…..I pity the next guy that gets this job…. jets843 says: Jan 1, 2017 8:56 PM \nAll of you people overlook one of the flaws of the Chargers. It’s about time people finally figure out that Phillip Rivers IS NOT a leader/a true QB that can get teams over the hump. Seriously, I don’t care what his passing yardage says, this guy throws INT’s all over the place. It’s time to trade him and start over, no coach will win the SB with that guy.
