Other allegations include Agrawal sending nude photos of herself and others (like her fiancé) to colleagues, analyzing the size and shape of coworker’s boobs, and detailing her past sexual experiences. \nLeibow reportedly filed a legal complaint with the City of New York Commission on Human Rights not long after allegedly being fired for complaining about Agrawal’s workplace conduct.
