After already smashing records over the long weekend , Tuesday’s temperature will likely peak at 12 C, just 0.9 degrees lower than the record high set in 1997 (12.9 C), before dropping to 5 C overnight. A period of rain expected in the afternoon and evening.\nEnvironment Canada predicts a balmy high of 17 C on Wednesday with an overnight low of 7 C. If the prediction holds up, Wednesday’s daytime high is set to blow the previous temperature record for Feb. 22, 11.8 C set in 1981, out of the water.\nAccording to Environment Canada meteorologist Geoff Coulson, the warm weather that the city has been enjoying for the last several days is produced by an air flow from the south.\nThis time of year, Coulson said, the airflow comes predominantly from the north or north west, and is much colder, but the flow mass shifted last Friday, bringing in warm air from the south.\nArticle Continued Below Thursday will have a high of 12 C and a low of 0 C, and Friday will be slightly cooler and rainy with a high of 8 C and a low of 1 C.\n“We’re going to start to see the flow pattern changing again into the weekend,” Coulson said.\nSaturday morning may still feel mild as a result of lingering warm air, but as it begins to dissipate, the weekend will feel significantly colder, with a 70 per cent chance of rain or flurries throughout the day on Saturday and a low of -5 C and a chance of snow overnight into Sunday.\nThe change will be a return to seasonal averages.\nSunday will have a high of 0 C and a low of -9 during the night.\nDelivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.
