Pogo unleashed a career-high 22 points on 6-of-11 shooting from threes that went with seven rebounds as the KaTropa took a 2-1 lead in their best-of-seven series. “I think it’s our defense. Coach Leo (Austria) did a great job on adjusting his rotations, caught us off guard, but it was good that we were able to recover,” said TNT head coach Nash Racela. ADVERTISEMENT Game 4 is on Tuesday night at Mall of Asia Arena. But it’s not just Pogoy, who delivered for TNT, as the veterans stepped up to help the KaTropa stop the usually high-scoring Beermen. Ranidel de Ocampo poured in 24 points, including the game-sealing free throws with 8.1 seconds left. He also had nine boards, and three assists. Jayson Castro had 11 points, 12 assists, and four rebounds, and Kelly Williams also got 11 markers and three boards. After Alex Cabagnot’s three gave San Miguel an 81-80 lead, Danny Seigle turned back the hands of time, scoring on two reverse baskets followed up by a De Ocampo three-point play to once again bring TNT’s lead back to six, 87-81 with 7:23 remaining. The Beermen struggled to find an answer with June Mar Fajardo plagued in foul trouble late. Marcio Lassiter got out of his shooting slump and fired 18 points on a 4-of-10 shooting from threes, to go with nine rebounds and three assists. Cabagnot also scored 18 markers, 11 coming in the fourth period alongside seven boards and seven dimes, while Fajardo finished with 16 points, nine rebounds, and three blocks.
