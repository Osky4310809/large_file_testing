(You need to read this in the little girl's voice at the beginning of Poltergeist II . If you were born sometime after 1986, Google it. Watch the start to see this scene then don't watch the rest. Instead watch the original Poltergeist movie and spend a good hour or so wondering how on earth it got a PG rating). \nWhere was I? Oh yeah that's right. They're baa-aack, and I couldn't be happier. Who's back? Not quite the spirits who move stuff in the Poltergeist movies, but something much, much better to watch. SHARE Abigail Latu-Meafou of the Firebirds.

A quick look at the Suncorp Super Netball action over the weekend was pretty revealing when you looked at the shooting circles of the four winning teams. All bar one had a goal shooter who moved more than she held. \nThis is remarkable because a couple of years ago it seemed netball was heading the way of plonking a tall goal shooter under the post in the hope she could catch and shoot, and bombing the ball into her from all over court. Some players – and teams – did it better than others. Queensland Firebirds did it best of all, winning three Trans-Tasman premierships, including the last two, with the 196cm star Romelda Aiken. \nIt seems, though, as if the tide may have turned. Last weekend, Aiken missed her first senior game since her debut for the Firebirds in 2008. In her place was not a holding goal shooter but a 181cm-short (well, in netball terms anyway) goal shooter, Abigail Latu-Meafou. She was a breath of fresh air, running, dodging and rolling her way to an impressive 28 goals in her first full game at this level. Sure she ran out of puff in the last 15 minutes, but it was great to see a mobile circle in action. \nDon't be surprised to see a move towards mobility in the next few years. A tall goal shooter might give a team the ability to score quickly, but a well thought-out defensive strategy can counter this by forcing the feeders up the court and away from the circle. This forces them into taking risks with longer passes, which gives defenders more time and space for an intercept. That the Firebirds were the only team to win multiple titles with a towering goal shooter points to the fact that it is more difficult than it looks.

First, it takes pressure off the midcourt and gives them extra time to get to the edge of the circle. Secondly it creates more space in the circle for the goal attack to drive into. \nThe Melbourne Vixens are doing this the best at the moment. With Mwai Kumwenda at goal shooter and Tegan Philip at goal attack, they have two playmakers. In their win last weekend over the ladder-leading Giants, they constantly changed up their leads out of the circle, leaving the Giants defenders scrambling to find them and read the play. This is compounded by the fact that they share the shooting load pretty evenly, so defensively you can't just shut one down because the other will keep scoring. \nAnother advantage in returning to a moving circle is the element of surprise. Over the past several years, defenders – and goal keepers in particular – have got used to defending the high ball coming in and not much else. A moving circle forces them to think and react. At the moment, the Vixens have got the jump on just about every other team because they are different, and they are keeping opposition defenders guessing. \nThe biggest upshot of this is that it brings the goal attack back into the game as a viable scoring option and not just a third feeder. To see them reprise their roles as goal scorers makes them a far more entertaining and destructive spirit than anything dished up by Poltergeist .
