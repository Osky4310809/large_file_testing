Snarky comments were made at the expense of each other, ones that were shamelessly enjoyed by thirsty fans. Representatives of that era, Sridevi and Raveena Tandon, recently found themselves pitied against each other in light of their upcoming movies. While Sridevi’s movie has her giving a serious side-face on a poster titled, MOM , Raveena’s zoomed in portrait spells Maatr - The Mother , bang in the middle of her forehead. Speculation was rife that the two actresses –and legends in their own right - were headed for a filmy collision. In fact, at one fateful point, both movies were likely to be directed under the same title, The Mother. \nExcept that we’re living in the Koffee With Karan era, where appropriateness is a celebrated virtue. So, putting all possible potboilers to rest, director of the movie, Maatr – The Mother, decided against the drama. On his decision to steer clear, and also win this battle by a mile, the director said, “We were planning to use the title The Mother for our film, but that title had already been taken and was not available. Also, a movie titled Mother 98 was made in 2000 and we did not want any connection with that. Moreover, we were aware that Boney Kapoor was also making a movie titled Mom . So we felt that our title was the best for our film.” \nFor the uninitiated, the movies do not have overlapping stories. Sridevi’s Mom, explores a troubled relationship between a stepmother and a daughter and the Raveena Tandon-starrer revolves around a rape victim. \nThe question still remains, though – has the crisis been averted?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:19:35.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
