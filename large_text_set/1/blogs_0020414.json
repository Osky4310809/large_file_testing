This time, it was the most dire threat yet to the creaking old place, though the crisis was virtually unknown to its customers and fans, who continued to arrive, as they have for years, “ on foot, by bicycle, boat, car and cab ,” as Tim Sultan wrote in his acclaimed 2016 memoir, “Sunny’s Nights: Lost and Found at a Bar on the Edge of the World.” More than a dozen of the family heirs did not see Sunny’s as a timeless and endlessly surprising pocket of city life in a once-bedraggled neighborhood, but as a parcel of land during a real estate boom that offered unobstructed views of Upper New York Bay and the Manhattan skyline. They were opposed primarily by Tone Balzano Johansen, a 50-year-old Norwegian artist and musician who is the widow of Sunny Balzano, the last in the direct line of Balzanos involved in the bar. Ms. Johansen had helped save the bar after it was wrecked (and she was nearly trapped in the basement) by flooding during Hurricane Sandy .

For high-octane bile, nothing can compare to a family fight over an estate. \nAdvertisement   “Anything that has to do with family, it’s heartaching, heartbreaking,” Ms. Johansen said. Sunny Balzano died last March , but the dispute over the property began years earlier. After the death of a grandfather, the family did not divide the estate. Most of the 18 descendants who own the property, on Conover Street, have wanted to sell it since the 2012 storm. But Ms. Johansen and Sunny refused, along with two Balzano sisters and a brother. Together, they held about 20 percent of the shares. After the storm, Sunny and Ms. Johansen had camped out in their building , which had no electricity for months. A giant gash had been cut into the foundation. Friends and customers showed up to help them rebuild. A benefit concert was held at the Bell House in Gowanus. Internet fund-raising drives raised more money. In all, about $100,000 was contributed. “Many small donations, and a few large ones,” Ms. Johansen said. One of Sunny’s sisters, JoAnn Fiumara, said that the property would have been long gone without their work and their friends. “Thank God for my brother and Tone,” Mrs. Fiumara said. “It’s such a happy place in there. I always feel like I’m home.” Photo Outside Sunny’s. Until last week, it was at risk of being sold at a public auction.

For the first half of the 20th century, Red Hook — a peninsula — was one of the busiest ports in the world. A robust population of longshoremen worked there. That changed in the 1950s and 1960s with the introduction of shipping containers. With no mass transit, and few jobs for the residents, the peninsula became isolated. Desolation crept across the neighborhood in the 1980s and 1990s. Sunny Balzano, who had traveled widely to work as an artist, came home to take care of his father. “My father put blood and sweat into that bar,” Mrs. Fiumara said. After their father died, an uncle who opened the old bar only sporadically essentially turned it over to Sunny. Then he met Ms. Johansen, who had come to New York on a residency at P.S. 1 in Long Island City, Queens. Three decades younger than Sunny, she had left the Pentecostal family that raised her on a remote, rocky island off Norway at age 16 to become a punk. They had a daughter, Oda, now 15. They also created an eccentric, welcoming home for musicians and artists, and anyone else who wandered in. “The wild children came here,” Ms. Johansen said. Last week, after three years in Brooklyn Supreme Court, Ms. Johansen signed a contract to buy the property for $2.6 million. She has six months to raise the money and has started meeting with banks. “A lot of people have got their hearts rooted here,” Ms. Johnsen said. “I don’t take that lightly.” \nEmail: Twitter: @jimdwyernyt A version of this article appears in print on January 25, 2017, on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Sunny’s Bar in Red Hook, Revived After Hurricane Sandy, Is Being Saved, Again.
