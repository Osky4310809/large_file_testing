By Jon Marcus Wednesday, March 22, 2017, 12:36 pm Ed Whitlock, who holds more than 80 age-group world records from 1500 meters to the marathon, died of prostate cancer on March 13. Victor Sailer \nThe deaths and diagnoses of high-profile runners with prostate cancer is bringing fresh attention to the disease, its relative absence of symptoms, and the need for regular screenings. \nCanadian masters legend Ed Whitlock died this month of prostate cancer , five months after he ran a marathon in 3:56:33 at age 85. Don McNelly, who completed 744 marathons and claimed the record for the most marathons run by anyone over 80, died last month in New York after surviving prostate cancer in his 60s.

But that doesn’t mean runners are safe from it. Cancer has passed heart disease as the number one killer of Americans under 85. One in seven men will have prostate cancer, and one in 30 will die of it, says Bradley McGregor, M.D., an oncologist at Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and a member of the faculty at Harvard Medical School. \nTrouble is, it’s hard for men to tell that they have it until too late. \nOther than increased urination, increased urgency to urinate, and pain when urinating, there are few overt symptoms, said McGregor—until the cancer in the prostate, a small gland in men below the bladder, reaches the surrounding bone, often causing hip pain. By then, it can be treated but not cured. \n“One of the difficult things with prostate cancer is it doesn’t produce many symptoms until it becomes what we think of as late stage,” says Tollefson ( who is a first cousin of Olympic middle distance runner Carrie Tollefson). \nThere are some clues about whether men have, or may get, prostate cancer. Men with fathers, brothers, or sons who have had it are at higher risk. So, statistically, are black men. And the chance of getting prostate cancer increases after age 50; most men who are diagnosed are 65 and older. \nExperts generally recommend that all men get regular screenings beginning between ages 45 and 50. That raises a debate over which test is best: the old-fashioned rubber-glove exam to detect an enlarged prostate versus newer tests for elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, whose accuracy is often questioned. \nBut as McGregor, a half-marathoner, puts it, “I don’t think there’s really any controversy over whether a patient should at least talk about this with his primary care provider. The point is to catch it when we can offer intervention.” \nThe good news: being diagnosed with prostate cancer early enough to successfully treat it may lead to especially long lives for runners. \nWhitlock, who became the first person 70 or older to finish a marathon in under three hours, ran his last race in October—the Toronto Marathon, in which he beat the previous record for runners 85 and up by nearly 30 minutes. He died on March 13 in Toronto at age 86. His death, coming so soon after his record-breaking marathon, shocked the running community. \nLittle is known about Whitlock’s health in the months leading up to his death. Tollefson says that even for patients in which the cancer metastasizes into the surrounding bone, survival is usually measured in years rather than months. \nIt’s not the first time a wave of high-profile runners has been diagnosed with or died from prostate cancer. In the 1990s, USATF Masters Hall of Famer Norm Green detected it in time to be treated successfully and return to racing. And runner and author Dr. George Sheehan chronicled his struggle with prostate cancer in his final book, Going the Distance: One Man’s Journey to the End of His Life . He died of it in 1993. \n“When someone famous has a disease it’s going to bring some attention to that disease, absolutely,” McGregor says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:25:31.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
