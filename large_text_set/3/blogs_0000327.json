It was completely accidental! Oh, by the way, the demon left her body, so our plan worked! \nAllegedly, Garcia tried to attack church members with a machete the week before… though, if I knew members of my church were the types of people who would throw me in a fire, then whipping out a machete sounds like pretty damn good self defense. \nHer husband was, as you might expect, devastated: \n“It’s unforgiveable what they did to us. They killed my wife, the mother of my two little ones,” he said. “Now what am I going to tell them? “ \nTell them that irrational religious beliefs in the hands of gullible, violent idiots killed their mother, and those kids should do everything in their power to make sure no one else suffers from that kind of lack of critical thinking ever again. \nIt won’t make them feel better, but they deserve an honest answer. Without religion, their mother would be alive right now. \n(Image via Shutterstock .
