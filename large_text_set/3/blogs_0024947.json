Pat is playing the best golf of his life and we’re inviting all our Austin Chivers came out to support Pat this week. Our Lone Star Chivers have been nothing but aces these days and I would love it if y’all showed up at the Dell to support our boy as he heads into the weekend. In fact, I’ll make a deal with y’all… \nI just arrived at the Murray Bros. Caddyshack Charity Golf Tournament in St. Augustine but if Pat makes the final round on Sunday, and our Chivers represent, I’ll fly back to join you all, crutches n’ all, on Sunday. Get your tickets here ! 8 \nAlso, prayers and well-wishes go out to Jason Day’s mother. The PGA Champion withdrew from play today and announced his mother had lung cancer and had been given only 12 months to live. That heatfelt press conference reminds you that these men are PGA pros second, family first. All the best to you and your mother, Jason. 9", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:24:57.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
