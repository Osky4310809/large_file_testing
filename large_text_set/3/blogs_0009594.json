By: FE Online | Published: March 11, 2017 1:14 PM Uttarakhand Kichcha constituency: Rajesh Shukla from BJP wins; CM Harish Rawat from Congress has lost. (Source: PTI) \nUttarakhand Kichcha constituency: Rajesh Shukla from BJP wins; CM Harish Rawat from Congress has lost. In the wake of election campaigning that been going on for months, the fight continues between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Indian National Congress (INC) and others. While BJP contested the Uttrakhand election without giving a face to their CM candidate, INC has been fighting with current CM Harish Rawat on the front foot. The polling in the state took place in a single phase of February 15 for leadership over the 70 seats. Ever since the polls, BJP leaders have been confident of their victory in the state. Their confidence was boosted by the pre-election opinion polls. On the other hand, current Congress CM Harish Rawat too claims to be re-elected. \nThe exit polls that came out of March 9, took everyone by surprise. The over all prediction about the state shows BJP having an upper hand over INC, while some show a neck to neck competition between the two. \nNumber of voters \nAccording to the State General Assembly Elections 2007 data, there are a total of 83,370 male voters and a total of 73,922 voters. The total voter turn out for the 2012 Assembly elections was 76.50 %. \nWhat are the key issues \nKichha has a constituency that is largely based on agriculture. Paddy and wheat are crops that are grown in this constituency. \nWho was the winner last time \nBharatiya Janata Party won the Kichha Assembly Constituency in 2012, where BJP candidate Rajesh Shukla won the constituency after getting 33388 votes and Indian National Congress candidate Sarwar Yar Khan was the runner up with 25162 votes. \nWho are the competing candidates \nRajesh Shukla (BJP), Harish Rawat (INC), Rajesh Pratap Singh (BSP), Sanjay Singh (SP) and Anil Kumar Sharma, Mohd. Jalees, Sanjay Grover (IND). \nWhy this constituency is important? \nThe constitutency of Kichha is important because current Chief Minister Harish Rawat contests elections from here. As compared to BJP, Congress has a lower winning percentage in this constituency according to past numbers.
