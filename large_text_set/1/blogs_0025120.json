Let’s not forget a certain co-sign from Donald Glover during this year’s Golden Globe Awards, which led to a significant spike in streams. \nSpeaking with The Fader , Migos had this to say about their impact on culture and the meaning behind their upcoming sophomore album, Culture . \n“The new album title is about the culture of Hip Hop music,” said Offset. “It’s time to let the culture be known. It’s time to claim it. And it’s time to claim that we are the Migos, and for people to understand that this is what we did. We did a lot for music. Migos is the culture. Seriously. There are artists that are way bigger than us that get recognition off our flow.” \nDuring the conversation, Quavo also spoke on the creative process of Culture . \n“I want people to know that we great artists and that we’re funny guys,” Quavo said. “We’re multi-talented. We’re very creative. We got long vision. We can make all types of music, all genres. We can dress. We record ourselves. We engineer ourselves. We mixed and mastered the whole C U L T U R E album ourselves.” \nCulture is slated to drop Friday (January 27) through Quality Control and 300 Entertainment.
