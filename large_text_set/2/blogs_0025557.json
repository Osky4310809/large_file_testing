With China now BMW’s biggest market, the company introduced the new, China-exclusive 1-series sedan. (A 1-series hatchback is offered in Europe.) Produced in northeastern city of Shenyang, the new 1-series is said to have been designed with Chinese demands in mind. \n-Looking extremely similar to the Concept Compact Sedan , this 1-series is completely unrelated to the rear-wheel-drive two-door fun machine with the same name the we had here in the United States a few years ago. The China-only 1-series is a front-wheel drive car with a choice of three turbocharged engines, two automatic transmissions, and—perhaps most important—“a highly effective air-filtering function,” on account of China’s dismal air quality.\n- \n-Let’s start with the power. The top-spec 125i has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Next up is the 120i, which also has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four, but this one makes 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Both use an eight-speed automatic transmission. The 125i accelerates from zero to 62 mph in a claimed 6.8 seconds, while the 120i takes 7.5. The third model, the 118i, is equipped with a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, and it saunters from zero to 62 mph in a factory-stated 9.4 seconds. Consumers expect good gas mileage out of a small car with a small forced-induction engine, and BMW claims combined fuel-economy ratings ranging from 37 mpg (125i) to 43 mpg (118i).\n-Tech is also a major focus for the China market, so the 1-series caters to that demand. It offers BMW’s Driving Assistant with collision warning, automatic forward-emergency braking, and park assist. The 1-series also has BMW Connected, which gives drivers assistance with real-time traffic updates and a library of integrated apps.\n- - First Drive: 2015 BMW M135i - BMW Concept Compact Sedan: The Front-Drive Bimmer Sedan Is upon Us - BMW 2-series: Full Specs, Pricing, Tests, Reviews, and More - -The 1-series sedan is a direct response to the Audi A3 and the Mercedes-Benz CLA-class . At 175.4 inches long, 71.0 inches wide, and 56.9 inches high, and with a 105.1-inch wheelbase, the 1-series is smaller than the CLA but similar in size to the A3. Although both of those competitors are sold here in the States, BMW says that, as of now, the new 1-series won’t be. We’re happy to remember the 1-series as a rear-drive, two-door coupe/convertible—we’re not too sad if this 1 gets away.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:29:31.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
