(Photo: Zack Snyder) \nThe photo was posted to Snyder’s Vero account with the caption: “Am I going to stand like a dork in the Lego Batman standee f*** yeah I am” \nSnyder has directed two films featuring Ben Affleck as Batman, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the upcoming Justice League .He has not, however, directed Will Arnett in a Batman film, a tragic turn of events considering he had a hand in casting the character before Affleck was announced. \nWill Arnett showed why he is the one, true Batman in the LEGO Batman Movie , a film which honored the character’s storied existence on movie screens while pushing him forward and evolving. The film has been the highest grossing movie in theaters for both weekends of its short lifespan, dominating Fifty Shades Darker and the Great Wall in the domestic box office. \nWhile Snyder made the financially more successful Batman v Superman (at least, up at this point, but who knows what the future holds) this picture is an obvious concession that he agrees the LEGO Batman is the definitive portrayal of the character and that his version falls just short. Or something like that. \nWe’ll see if Snyder and Affleck nail the character in his next onscreen appearance in Justice League , and whether Arnett had any affect on their direction for Batman, when the movie releases in theaters. \nThe LEGO Batman Movie is now playing everywhere, and if you haven’t seen it, well, what are you waiting for?
