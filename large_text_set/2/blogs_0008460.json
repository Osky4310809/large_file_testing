Tony had chosen the Van versions, the fabrication of which were designed, created and manufactured at the Boulos factory in Ikeja, Lagos. \nOlusegun Adekoya, Quality Control Manager Boulos Enterprises said: “There was a real buzz in the factory, we fabricated the van units under sixteen hours. As production steps up and we become more familiar with the process the manufacturing time will decrease. “It was great to see them drive out, as made in Nigeria means made by Nigerians,” he added. Van \nDesigned for Nigerian roads \nIn her remarks, Mrs. Titi Olodun, Marketing Manager of Boulos explained that the Super Carry van now in its 12th generation is the most tried and trusted 1 ton van in the world, sold in 192 countries since 1961. \n“It is also one of the most reliable in the world and here in Nigeria the launch price at N4.1 million is about two million naira less than any other competitors”. \nShe further disclosed that the pick-up version will be available only on special order, adding that the van and refrigerated units will be the best sellers. \nPowered by Suzuki 1.2 litre petrol engine which is also fitted to the Suzuki Swift, Vitara, Splash, Baleno and Kizashi, the engine is very reliable to the extent that other manufactures buy the it from Suzuki for use in their vehicles. \nThe suspension has been especially designed for Nigerian roads, raising the ride height to a level that allows the vehicle to tackle water impediments and settle on the trailing arms and leaf spring suspension without bottoming out. \nThe Super Carry is backed by a comprehensive warranty and dealer service representation across Nigeria. The Marketing Manager disclosed that Boulos stocks over $5 million worth of spare parts for its products at any given time, so there is never a worry for spares. \n“This moment marks the continuation of more than 57 years of representation of SUZUKI in Nigeria by Boulos Enterprises,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:53:32.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
