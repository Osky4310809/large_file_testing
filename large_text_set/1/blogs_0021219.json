(Photo: Dwayne Johnson/Instagram) More After Dwayne Johnson revealed a first look from the Jumanji set on his Instagram in September, social media exploded. Yes, with excitement, but mostly to call out the fact that Karen Gillan’s skimpy outfit was sexist. Many agreed that the look was inappropriate for jungle trekking and perhaps more appropriate for, say, a nightclub. Well, if Karen Gillan turns out to breathe through her skin in Jumanji, I will truly feel ashamed of my words and deeds. pic.twitter.com/LD6MOrpVlO \n— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) September 20, 2016 The green shorts were short, the crop top revealing, and the boots seemingly inadequate for the task at hand. Meanwhile the male cast members were more stoically dressed and considerably more covered up. Amid recent discussions about sexism in Hollywood and the effect objectifying women in the movies has on young women, Gillan attempted to quell the uproar. Jumanji! Yes I'm wearing child sized clothes and YES there is a reason! The pay off is worth it, I promise! #Jumanji pic.twitter.com/qBshnhwV6K \n— Karen Gillan (@karengillan) September 21, 2016 She tweeted in September: “Yes I’m wearing child sized clothes, and YES there is a reason! The pay off is worth it, I promise!” Now Gillan has doubled down on her reassurances, telling the Hollywood Reporter : “I’ve experienced something similar when I worked on Doctor Who and there was such an uproar about my costume when that was first revealed, so I thought it was happening all over again.” She continued, “But I have to say, I’d never take on a role that was truly gratuitous for no reason. There’s a really valid reason why she’s wearing that. My character is really not happy about it!” Once more, the point appears to have been missed here, as however unhappy her character may be about wearing it, she is still wearing the outfit. Whether or not the plot negates the objectification will be revealed on Dec. 22, 2017.
