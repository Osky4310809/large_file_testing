Migos, of course, just released its highly anticipated album , Culture , and the group’s viral single “Bad and Boujee” featuring Lil Uzi Vert is currently sitting at #1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and is certified platinum . The project and Gilbert’s The Devil Don’t Sleep are both projected to push between 70,000 and 80,000 equivalent album units. Ten singles sales are equal to one album while 1500 audio streams are the equivalent of one album, although the SPS Chart does not include video streams, according to HITS . \n\nAlthough Quavo, Takeoff and Offset aren’t new to the Billboard singles charts (their 2013 “Versace” single peaked at #99 on Billboard), this is the Georgia trio’s first shot at a number one album. Migos’ debut (and only other full-length album), 2015’s Yung Rich Nation , sold 18,082 equivalent album units its first week as it debuted at #17 on the Billboard 200 chart and peaked at #5 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, in addition to landing at #3 on the Top Rap Albums chart.
