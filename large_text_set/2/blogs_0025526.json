Henson is contoured from head to toe. (Photo by Steve Granitz/WireImage) More Taraji P. Henson is no stranger to slaying red carpets. And for the 2017 Oscars , she stepped out in a navy-blue gown, showing off chiseled cheekbones, fit shoulders, and contoured cleavage that made us say “Wow.” The secret behind Henson’s highlighted and contoured head-to-toe glow may have a lot to do with the $15 St. Tropez 3-in-1 Bronzing Powder that her makeup artist used before the Hidden Figures star hit the red carpet. While sharing some behind-the-scenes photos of the products she used, Ashunta Sheriff, Taraji’s go-to celebrity makeup artist, shared: “@sttropez #yourultimatetan thank you for helping me get @tarajiphenson Glowing with #3in1bronzingpowder for #oscars2017.” For Taraji’s face, Sheriff used a foundation brush to blend the bronzing powder along her cheekbones, swooshing the deepest shade from the top of the ear down toward her chin. Sheriff shared that “a subtle contour is added using St. Tropez 3-in-1 Bronzing Powder. I wanted a soft, romantic look, so I opted for Glossier Cloud Paint — a Creme blush in Dusk — then applied Enlight by Danessa Myricks in Halo on cheekbones .” (Photo: courtesy of Kelz PR) More Sheriff also stressed the importance of starting with exfoliated, clean skin. “Before any big award show, I love to begin by using Dermaflash .” She credits the exfoliating treatment with helping makeup look more “smooth, radiant, and glowing” by removing peach fuzz and dead skin cells. A mix of the bronzing powders also seemed to be swiped along Henson’s clavicles, décolletage, and legs. “ I used One Night Only Finishing Gloss by St. Tropez [ $16 at Ulta ] on the body, and I added Danessa Myricks’s Enlight in Halo [ $20 ] on the collarbone and shoulders for highlight,” says Sheriff. We’re here for it. Glow, Cookie, glow!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:41:06.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
