Storm survey determined EF1 rating at Azalea Place apartment complex https://t.co/rZVbMPv0XX — NWS Houston (@NWSHouston) March 29, 2017 \n“The primary threats will be large hail and damaging winds, especially in southwestern Missouri, western and central Arkansas and down into far eastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana,” said AccuWeather Meteorologist Ryan Adamson. \nOn Tuesday and Tuesday night, similar weather conditions enabled the formation of storms which produced golf ball-sized hail, 80-mph wind gusts and several tornadoes. \nSimilar threats are expected in storms that spark farther east on Wednesday and Thursday. \nThere is potential for local power outages as storms will be capable of wind gusts up to 70 mph, which can topple trees and power lines. \nIf possible, care should be taken to protect cars from large hail. \nMotorists should take precautions to avoid storms entirely, as thunderstorms pose multiple threats to those on the road. \nRelated Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:36:53.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
