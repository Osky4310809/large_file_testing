You’ll be shocked to see how they answered. Or not. \nI haven’t heard that much discomfort since the last time Woody Allen and Mia Farrow got invited to the same dinner party.   \nAs jocular of an 11 minutes that Steven Crowder may have given us, it also illustrated perfectly why we should be so suspect when liberals talk about accepting refugees without significant vetting and without caps. Do they want to house them? No, of course not. It will always be someone else, some other community. \nThe thing is that some community will have to deal with the refugees and the strain on resources or the other externalities that come with them. Just not Tribeca, Malibu, Brooklyn or the Hollywood Hills . \nThere’s the rub with liberalism. For all its good intentions, the problems are always farmed out.
