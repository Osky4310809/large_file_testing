Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJose Mourinho is facing a personnel crisis ahead of Manchester United ’s Premier League clash with West Brom this weekend. \nMourinho fears he will be without up to seven players for the Old Trafford clash United must win to keep alive their hopes of securing a top-four finish. \nUnited are currently without injured quartet Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba, while Ander Herrera and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are suspended. \nSkipper Wayne Rooney has been out with a knee injury for the past three weeks and there is no guarantee he will be fit by Saturday, although sources have indicated the 31-year old is ready to return. Chris Smalling and Phil Jones are both crocked (Photo: Getty) \nBut Mourinho may be forced to rush Rooney back to plug a gap in midfield, with the enforced loss of Pogba, Fellaini and Herrera leaving him light there. \nMichael Carrick remains Mourinho’s only fit central midfielder, a position Rooney may have to occupy on Saturday if he is fit and able to start. \nRooney last featured in midfield last season under former boss Louis van Gaal, although versatile defender Daley Blind is also able to operate there if required. \nUnited face a hectic April with games against West Brom, Everton, Sunderland, Anderlecht, Chelsea, Burnley, Manchester City and Swansea.
