Washington University’s Lutheran Student Fellowship hosted the event. \nThe College Democrats quickly assembled their protest, which they even christened “Nothing But Love: A Demonstration of Inclusion.” They announced the event in the college newspaper , where they also eviscerated Fisk for not sharing their opinions on homosexuality, marriage and abortion. \nThe inclusion demonstration kicked-off with the singing of the Woody Guthrie chestnut “This Land is Your Land” and featured numerous speakers who stood before a large rainbow flag. \nOne student, who identified herself as a member of the Lutheran Campus Ministry, said news of the traditional marriage lecture left her feeling “angry, sad and frustrated,” and claimed the “hateful” pastor did not represent the majority of either Christians or Lutherans. \nA member of the College Democrats went further, proclaiming that the pastor’s lecture had propelled her into a state of “shock.” \nFaculty members came to blast the pastor too, with Prof. Jeffrey McCune saying that opposing Planned Parenthood is a racist policy because “when people refuse Planned Parenthood…they’re saying I care more about white fetuses than I do about the services to minority folk.” \nMeanwhile, Fisk apparently violated the students’ safe space because he tweeted: Original Diveristy – Man and Woman in Christ going live in 15 min from Wash U.
