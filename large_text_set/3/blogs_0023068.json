AP:Associated Press 8 A number of England fans let themselves down again during the away clash in Dortmund \nAnd the other day he summed up the national psyche pretty brilliantly – in terms of football and wider life – when he noted that ‘being an island saved us in 1945 but I’m not so sure it’s helped us ever since’. \nKeep up to date with ALL the latest England squad news, gossip and rumours \nSouthgate, however modest his managerial CV, is a bright, articulate, enlightened man who wants to modernise the England team. \nAnd his attitude could not really differ more starkly from many of those who follow the Three Lions abroad. \nLast night, there was a corner of Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion that was forever little England .

Men presumably acting in the twisted belief that they’re honouring their grandparents’ generation, while only disgracing the nation those ancestors served so courageously. Rex Features A large section of the away support could be heard singing Ten German Bombers AP:Associated Press The travelling England fans booed the German national anthem Reuters 8 Gareth Southgate is a bright coach who is trying to revolutionise the England team \nThey booed the German national anthem and as the home support rose in standing ovation when Lukas Podolski he was substituted on his 130th and final appearance, they offered obscene hand gestures to wave him on his way. \nIf they were aware of the sombre news back in Westminster, a significant number of them were not capable of showing any degree of dignity. \nTheir hosts regarded them with incredulity more than anything. They seem pathetic rather than hostile these days. Naked England football fan dances in the stands as his team take on Germany \nAs Southgate’s England head towards Russia – home to the worst of modern-day hooliganism – you shudder to think how it will end up, though. \nThe scenes surrounding the England v Russia fixture in Marseille last summer were horrific enough - and while the English were more sinned against than sinners, the way so many of them act abroad makes them a clear and obvious target. \nIt’s odd that these men book two or three days off work to travel to a foreign nation only to drink gallons of beer in English or Irish boozers and act defiantly when there is nothing to actually defy. Getty Images England were undone by a thunderous Lukas Podolski strike against Germany Getty Images 8 Lukas Podolski scored the only goal of the game as the Three Lions were defeated 1-0 in Dortmund \nNo surrender to an IRA that no longer exists, insults to a Pope who seems in no way relevant to them - and no end of crowing about a war which ended before their parents were even born. \nWe should take Southgate at his word that he didn't hear the offensive chanting - but it was a pity that he didn't. Instead he trotted out a standard FA line encouraging fans to support their team properly at all times. \nThe English police have combined with authorities to massively reduced the number of hardcore hooligans travelling abroad – but the FA could do more to tackle the issue of abusive xenophobia head-on. Russian fans confront England fans at full time in the stadium in Marseille Two England football fans jailed over violent clashes at Euro 2016 in Marseille \nIt doesn’t tally with Southgate’s vision for England - and the new manager, not afraid to speak his mind, will surely realise this. \nSouthgate’s words about 1945 weren’t meant to be about the songs of England’s supporters. \nHe was talking about the arrogance of English football at large – the fact that Premier League players believe they are at the centre of the universe, when they are not. \nHe also added that: “Other countries are quite happy to say nice things to us and then pack us off home at a certain stage and think 'God, we've got rid of them'. That's how it feels to me and I don't like it.” AP:Associated Press An England supporter is pepper sprayed after scuffles with French cops in Marseille at Euro 2016 AP:Associated Press 8 French police used tear gas against England football supporters in downtown Marseille on June 10 \nAgain he was talking about England’s football rather than their supporters – but the same sentiment is true about the fans whenever the Three Lions head home with tails between their legs. \nOut on the pitch, England were half-decent – even though the Germans were playing at testimonial pace, with Podolski afforded a goal on his big night. \nA year ago, we actually reached the high tide of Roy Hodgson’s reign in Berlin when England played brilliantly to recover from a two-goal deficit and defeat the world champions. \nThat was a vibrant performance achieved without the injured Wayne Rooney – but by the time the Euro finals came round, Hodgson was shoehorning his captain into the team and England were descending towards customary humiliation. England fans go head-to-head with police in Marseille England fans kick and punch stricken man on the ground in Marseille \nSouthgate will not make the mistakes of choosing players on reputation and he has placed fitness and professionalism at the heart of his new regime. \nEngland had won on their previous three visits here – but the 5-1 World Cup qualifier and two friendlies counted for little. England have still only surpassed the Germans at one tournament since 1966. \nThe Germans aren’t shy about their triumphs. Schoolkids brought out four gold star banners emblazoned with the years of their World Cup victories - 54, 74, 90 and 14 – and the world ‘Weltmeister’, meaning ‘world champion’, seems to be one of the most commonly-used in the German language. New battle footage of Russian Ultras and England fans in Marseille \nBut, as Southgate noted, the German game is more joined-up, their clubs and national team work in unison rather than opposition. \nAnd the make-up of this young German team - while often operating in slo-mo last night – was testament to the greater opportunities afforded to native talent in the Bundesliga. \nThe Germans were better than us last night, off the pitch more so than on it. \nIt is not unpatriotic to mention this. It would be unpatriotic to ignore it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:57:35.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
