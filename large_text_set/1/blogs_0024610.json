The 19-year-old actress wore a gorgeous, gold, low-cut gown. REX/Shutterstock She had her hair curled and made a bold statement with bright lips and dark eyebrows. REX/Shutterstock \nShe looked stunning, right? Well, Twitter users immediately compared Ariel Winter to Kylie Jenner. People shared images of Ariel Winter on social media and accused the actress of trying to imitate the “Keeping Up With The Kardashians” star. Ariel Winter looks like she is trying to be Kylie Jenner #sagawards pic.twitter.com/9fqzujajIg \n— A Fashionistas Diary (@afdiaries) January 29, 2017 Fans commented on the thread and shared their thoughts on Ariel’s makeup at the SAG Awards, too. Twitter According to Twitter, it looks like people really think Ariel Winter is slowly morphing into Kylie… or at least trying to. Twitter \nThe above tweet translated into English reads, \nAriel Winter has to stop imitating Kylie Jenner. \nOuch. That’s pretty harsh. \nThis isn’t the first time Ariel’s been accused of copying Kylie’s style at an awards show. \nBack in September, Ariel showed up to the Emmys wearing a bedazzled, see-through dress with matching silver earrings and heels. People pointed out the actress actually wore the same dress Kylie Jenner rocked during New York Fashion Week.

EVERYONE, LEAVE ARIEL ALONE!!!! Giphy \n“Modern Family” is nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, so it’ll be a big accomplishment for Ariel and the rest of the cast if the show takes home the gold. \nHopefully people can actually focus on the SAG Awards instead of roasting Ariel about her outfit choices. The girl looks great — let’s just leave it at that. \nI’M HERE FOR YOU, ALEX DUNPHY!
