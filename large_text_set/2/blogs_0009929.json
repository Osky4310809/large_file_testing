I like that\" \nAt 6-foot-4, 327 pounds, Salyer is one of the most coveted prospects in the 2018 recruiting class. He holds offers from dozens of D-I college football programs, including Alabama , Ohio State , Clemson , Oklahoma , among others. \nhttp://www.scout.com/player/198454-jamaree-salyer \nScout.com Evaluation \nSophomore Eval: Immediately Salyer passes the eye test, but there is more to him than that. He is very light on his feet for a young 300-pounder. He is likely a guard or center on the next level and he has the ability to get to the second level, move in space, and get down the field. He is a natural bender, so his flexibility is good. Salyer is still very raw in some areas and balance is one. He needs to have a more solid base and work on his sets. He is strong at the point of attack, he is very smart and he has so much upside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:06:09.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
