People need to stand up and unite and give voice to their concerns,\" Haggerty says.\nBreaking the silence For Americans living in London, the Women's March on London offers an opportunity to protest from afar, and to have a voice when they're away from home. We spoke to a selection of people to hear their reasons for taking part.\nMargie Powell — an American living in London — says LGBTQ rights and affordable healthcare are the issues she'll be championing at the march. Powell's brother identifies as gay and she has a pre-existing medical condition.\n\"You have no right to be silent\"\n\"Sure, it's not happening here, but if London stays silent will racism, islamophobia, sexism, and homophobia cross shores?\" says Powell.\nFor, Tanja Bueltmann — a German historian living in London — this march is important in standing up for what she believes in. \"I believe that, with Trump's election and Brexit, we are at a watershed moment: basic values I believe in are under threat. Brexit is bad, but Trump is something else,\" Bueltmann says.\n\"I am marching in solidarity with the majority of the U.S. population that did not vote for Trump. I am marching for our fundamental rights. I am marching to say: resist!\"\nImage: women's march london\n'Human rights eroded' Catherine McLaughlin, from Essex, is marching because she feels there is a \"real danger\" of human rights being eroded. She's also marching in \"solidarity with friends in the U.S. who will have to find huge resilience, activism and courage in the days ahead.\"\n\"A lone voice, when joined with other lone voices becomes a roar.\"\n\"I'm going to march alongside my daughters who are aged 9 and 11, my sister and on behalf of my mother and grandmother and the amazing women in my family who did everything they could to give their children opportunities to grow and thrive,\" says McLaughlin.\nRuth Davies, a member of the Women's Equality Party in the UK, says that marching has long been important in fighting for the rights of minority groups throughout history. But, she also has a personal reason for marching: her 4-year-old daughter's future.\n\"I've just plain had enough of constant low level sexism we're expected to live with. Why the hell should I raise my daughter to excuse the same crap I had to? How is this still a struggle that needs to be faced?\" she asks.\n\"I'm hoping that this march will inspire. That a lone voice, when joined with other lone voices becomes a roar. If all you have to offer is a voice, a thought, a body, you can still be visible, powerful and amplify positive messages to embolden others to stand up and be counted\"\nWomen's Marches across the globe have BEGUN!

This is why we must march. I am proud to be marching and speaking at the Women’s March on London,\" Neate continues.\nBONUS: Emma Watson takes her fight for gender equality to universities", "external_links": ["https://t.co/XdiouInnkI", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PX7VmwNKsb4yq-bMtRz8X3f88IU=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F355837%2Ffb0f1953-e98d-4fd9-b56b-0063ca8263fa.png", "https://twitter.com/womensmarchlon/status/822485617762246662", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/H4Y9446V.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bOydDWXYfNKKRh4n3ZsOqss9Cho=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F355837%2Ffb0f1953-e98d-4fd9-b56b-0063ca8263fa.png", "https://t.co/LqLcAGfm4k", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/H4Y9446V.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-21T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T10:33:50.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
