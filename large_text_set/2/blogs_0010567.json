Building settlements is a crime, building settlements is against all international laws,\" said Palestinian Tourism and Antiquities Minister Rula Maayaa. \"I think it is time now for the international community to act concretely to stop the Israelis from these crimes.\" \n“If the White House, the ICC, the EU, and the international community generally do not hold Israel accountable,…the leadership will not accept any blame for steps it will take to defend Palestinian people’s rights,” Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said in an interview with the official PA radio station.
