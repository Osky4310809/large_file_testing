Boston Dynamics/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nWe're girding ourselves for our robot overlords, but we're not entirely sure what they're going to look like. \nFortunately, there's Boston Dynamics . This fine Google-owned company creates robots that do the sorts of things we wish we could. \nWho could forget its marvelous robo-dogs ? They carried so much for the US Marines. The only slight drawback is that they made so much noise that the enemy could hear them coming from far away. \nOn Monday, the company officially unveiled its latest creation. It's called Handle. It may, for all I know, be the Messiah. \nFor here is a, well, what? A British fridge door perched on top of discarded parts from a car production line and the wheels from two circus-discarded unicycles. \nYet watch it move and you may experience several sensations, not all of them comfortable. \nIt rolls around. It performs pirouettes that you last saw during the Olympic dressage competition. And it can pick up a 100-pound crate with ease. \nIt also jumps fences and rolls down stairs like a slightly inebriated teen at his first frat party.
