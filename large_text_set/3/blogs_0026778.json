It was a pretty incredible group of people who came through, with French Montana, Denzel Curry, Polica and The Cool Kids amongst the names getting involved in the shoot.\nWe’ve got some exclusive dreamy black and white artist portraits shots for your viewing pleasure, where you can see A$AP Rocky nonchalantly flexing with a blunt in hand and French Montana stunting in some old-school FILA in the slick new shots. Work through your post-SXSW FOMO by scrolling through the gallery above.\nWeiner says the objective of the project is “to photograph as many artists possible in the same exact situation and light throughout the week of SXSW while highlighting the huge spectrum of style, personality and uniqueness that is displayed in both the Vans lifestyle as well as the beast that is South By South West.”\n#HouseOfVans is live at @MohawkAustin for #SXSW! Watch the @Vans Instagram story now for a look behind the scenes! \nA post shared by House of Vans (@houseofvans) on Mar 15, 2017 at 3:00pm PDT \n\nStay tuned for next year’s festival!\nAfter you check out the full gallery, listen to our premiere of Joey Labeija’s new Violator EP, right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:36:39.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
