Snow that falls around major cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina and Atlanta may lead to traffic gridlock. \nAfter the snow leaves on Saturday, a wave of arctic air will arrive and cause remaining snowy or slushy areas to freeze. Removal of snow and ice will be difficult after this occurs, according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski. \nRELATED: Coldest air since at least 1996 to raise risk of frozen pipes, water main bursts in southern US \nRoad conditions continue to deteriorate across parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia with snow, sleet and freezing rain contributing to numerous vehicle accidents across the region. \nNearly an inch of sleet was measured near Jackson, Mississippi by the National Weather Service, slowing travel along I-20. \nLaw enforcement officials are requesting that Alabama residents remain off the roadways in Pickens, Randolph, Autauga, Elmore and Cleburne Counties through Friday night. \nA truck blocking I-55 northbound near Wesson, Mississippi.

Significant icing was occurring on trees and power lines across Wayne County, Mississippi late on Friday afternoon, emergency managers said. \nAll roads in Elmore County, Alabama, will be closed at 6 p.m. EST Friday due to deteriorating road conditions, the county said in a statement . \nThose that must travel in these areas should use extreme caution and allow for extra time to reach their destination amid the icy conditions. \n(Photo/Twitter user @sshawn9195) \nAs of 1 p.m EST, Delta has announced that about 350 flights between Friday and Saturday have been canceled at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. \nAlabama , Georgia and North Carolina all issued state of emergency declarations that went into effect Friday. Road crews were deployed well ahead of the looming storm to begin treating the roads. \nState officials are urging residents to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary. \n\"“We cannot stress enough the importance of staying off the road this weekend,” said North Carolina Public Safety Secretary Erik A. Hooks. “The snow may be fun to play in, but it will be dangerous to drive in. Don’t put yourself, your family or our emergency responders' lives at risk.” In preparation for anticipated winter weather, we have 1,458 employees, 529 DOT trucks, and over 2 million gallons of brine out and about. pic.twitter.com/VS6WTV17Iv — NCDOT (@NCDOT) January 6, 2017 https://twitter.com/SCDOTPress/status/817392373902802944 In D2 - Brine truck that started at mile 138 and treating inside lane back to Columbia County mile 183 on I-20. @GDOTEastTraffic pic.twitter.com/Fl8zhTOalY — Georgia DOT (@GADeptofTrans) January 6, 2017 Richland Maintenance crews loading salt and sand into spreader trucks in preparation for the winter storm; attaching spreader to truck pic.twitter.com/78hLx88etp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:59:21.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
