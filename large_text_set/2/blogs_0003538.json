Suspect: the man allegedly assaulted the woman on the Tube \n“I became aware of a group of men and one of them was ranting and ranting about “f Muslims”. \n“He was shouting about how ‘there are no white people left in London anymore’ and kept saying ‘what is this country becoming?’. \n“Then he looked around and saw my sister’s sign and just went mental – he lunged for her, kicked her and kicked the sign she was holding. \n“He just started going mad and calling her a “liberal leftie piece of s***”. \nThe 6ft 3ins man tried to knock the sign out of Sophia’s hands and, in the process kicked her, whilst hurling abuse, it is claimed.
