Why in the world would you need another measuring cup? I’ll tell you. You need a plunger-type measuring cup for all things sticky, gloppy, syrupy, gooey, greasy, and the like. \n \n \n\nYou know how measuring peanut butter, or shortening, or honey is a mess? No more! (I’m starting to sound like an infomercial. “But wait! Order now and we’ll rush you a second measuring cup absolutely free!”) I was gifted this exact plunger measuring cup about 13 years ago. I’d never even seen one before, but I was immediately hooked. \n \n \n\nIt may seem like a unitasker, but think again. I use it every time I measure any one of these ingredients.\n \n \n\nMeasure from one end for liquids, and the other end for solids (or anything sticky, like honey). \n \n \n\nSet the cup to the amount you need and fill. \n \n \n\nPush the cup to release your measured ingredient. Look at that! Perfect measuring, no mess! \n \n \n\nTo celebrate our measuring friend, we’re making Peanut Butter Bars with Marshmallow Crème Frosting. \n \n \n\nWe’ll use the measuring cup twice; once for peanut butter, and again for the marshmallow crème. \n \n \n\nI’d love to hear if you own one of these and when you use it!\n \n \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:29:56.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
