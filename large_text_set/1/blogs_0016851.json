They push a lot when we play at home. They push a lot when we play away. And, for us, for me, they are the 12th player on the pitch. \n“I hope they continue in this way, to push a lot for our team, my players, in every moment of the game. They are a really important part for us to try and win and try and continue to fight for the title.

This is the most important thing. I know this and I'm pleased for this. \n“For this reason, I'm sure on Sunday that, if Diego starts the game, he'll put all himself into it for this club, the shirt and the fans, and do everything he can to win the game. \n“I can put my hands in the fire. In Italy, if you put your hands in the fire, it means you are certain 100 per cent. I thought the same example was good in English. We can learn. It means you trust 100 per cent the situation.” \nConte diplomatically put Costa’s absence in last week’s win at Leicester down to a back injury rather than his training ground meltdown after his head was turned by a £30m-a-year offer from Chinese club Tianjin Quanjian.

Willian is likely to miss out. \nBut Conte did not offer any long term guarantees although he says he is convinced Costa will stay and help them win the title, and hopes to take advantage this weekend when two of their title rivals Manchester City and Tottenham meet.
