This feature is now available on Nougat on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge , but as we found out after manually updating one of our devices, the screen resolution could default to Full HD on its own after the update has been installed. \nThere’s nothing to worry about: you can switch back to Quad HD resolution from the Settings » Display menu. The setting sticks after a reboot, so it’s more like a minor annoyance than a permanent bug. Of course, some folks might not even notice the resolution has been lowered as the screen remains plenty sharp even at Full HD, but there’s no point in using such a beautiful display at a lower-than-intended resolution, right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T09:01:27.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
