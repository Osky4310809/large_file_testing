Watkins from multiple gunshot wounds. Police say they found him lying face down Saturday in a vacant lot about a block from where he lived in the Austin neighborhood on the city’s west side. \nBefore that fatal shooting, the last one had occurred Feb. 26. \nThe newspapers report the city has recorded more than 100 homicides so far this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T07:03:24.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
