(Photo: Erich Schlegel, USA TODAY Sports) 89 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAUSTIN — Phil Mickelson goes through life on the sunny side of par, an optimist to the nth degree who has a zest for his next journey and is always quick with a thumbs-up for a fan and a smile for another. \nThis week at Austin Country Club, however, he’s been downright giddy. \nFor starters, he’s made it to the weekend of the World Golf Championships-Dell Technologies Match Play for the first time since 2004. He’s obviously got his game in shape. And he likes the golf course. \nBut there is one dark cloud on Mickelson’s horizon. He’s been too good for his own good. \nSCORES: WCG-Dell Technologies Match Play \nThrough three days of this unpredictable event, Mickelson has routed Si Woo Kim (5 and 3), Daniel Berger (5 and 4) and J.B. Holmes (6 and 5) during the round-robin portion of the event. He has never trailed in a match and lost only two holes in three days. But because of his brilliance, he hasn’t played the 16th, 17th or 18th holes this week — not in competition or in practice. \n\"It is a concern,\" Mickelson said. \nHe explained he hasn’t felt the heat of late-match tension. And he could kick himself a bit not going out to hit chips and putts around and on the final three holes to acclimate himself. But Phil being Phil, he finds a positive. \nMORE FROM MATCH PLAY: A lost week for McIlroy at Match Play \n\"I've been able to conserve energy as we head into the weekend because there's potential for four matches if you win them all. I'm not jumping the gun, but there's potential there,\" he said. \"Energy could always be an issue for any player. Being able to conserve some is a good thing. \n\"There's a good and a bad. I'm nervous that I haven't been in a match that has gone the last hole or two and feel that clutch pressure, but also the good is that I have been able to conserve energy heading into this weekend.\" \nIn the round of 16 on Saturday morning, Mickelson will face Marc Leishman, who won last week’s Arnold Palmer Invitational and advanced to the Sweet 16 by winning a playoff with a birdie on the second hole against Lee Westwood and Pat Perez. \nIn other round of 16 matches, world No. 1 and top seed Dustin Johnson, who has won his last two starts on the PGA Tour and is 3-0 this week, faces Zach Johnson, who won the final hole of his match against Brendan Steele to get out of his group; Kevin Na, who won on the first hole of a playoff against Matthew Fitzpatrick, faces Bill Haas, who won on the sixth hole of a playoff against K.T. Kim. \nWilliam McGirt, who hasn’t lost this week, faces a Cinderella type in Soren Kjeldsen, the No. 62 seed. Another Cinderella, Japan Tour star and No. 54 seed Hideto Tanihara, plays Paul Casey, who hasn’t lost this week. \nAnd Jon Rahm, who defeated fellow Spaniard Sergio Garcia to advance, meets Charles Howell III, who won a three-man playoff to move on. Undefeated Brooks Koepka meets undefeated Alex Noren, and Bubba Watson, who hasn’t lost this week, plays Ross Fisher. \nMORE GOLF NEWS: Tiger Woods' mantra for 1997 Masters: 'Just don't screw up' \nMickelson hasn’t won since capturing the 2013 British Open. But he’s as optimistic about his game as he’s been in a while. This week, he said he’s been most pleased with his driving, which has set up his strong iron play from the fairway instead of the rough or under a tree. Once on the green, he’s used the short stick well. \n\"I have become much more efficient or much improved in the last two years inside six, eight feet with my putter. I have not let shots like that go,\" said Mickelson, who did not make a bogey in his match Friday against Holmes. \"For instance, No. 12 today against J.B. It's a four-and-a-half-, five-footer, little bit of turn, right to left. I'm rolling those in consistently now, and I think that's been a real factor in my play this week. \n\"I spent hours and hours working on (my putting) the last few years. I had a dry spell where I did not putt the way I wanted to. Last year I led the Tour until the last few weeks inside 10 feet, which was my goal. That's from spending hours and practicing. The whole thing, drills and technique and putter and roll, alignment, all the details of it. I really spent a lot of time on it.\" \nNow he hopes his weekend will be time well spent. He’s fresh, he’s excited and he’s playing well. \n\"This weekend will be difficult. The guys that play this weekend are obviously playing well because they won their groups,\" he said. \"It will be a continued challenge heading into this weekend. I'm looking for to it. I'm excited. I haven't been to the weekend in match play in a long time. \n\"This is really been fun.\" \nFollow Steve DiMeglio on Twitter @Steve_DiMeglio .
