Instead the time had come to give someone else a go after his seven-year stint, he said. \nMr Fahour will appear before the committee later on Tuesday. The government has proposed the independent Remuneration Tribunal determine the pay and conditions of future Australia Post managing directors. Asked whether that measure could be extended to the national broadband network, Senator Fifield said the situations were different. \n“NBN is a growing business. It’s one of the most complex infrastructure projects in Australia’s history,” he said. \n“There’s strong competition for senior Telco executives.” NBN Co chief executive Bill Morrow’s pocketed $3.6 million last financial year. NBN has also been disclosing its salaries publicly so it hasn’t been subject to the same time of scrutiny, Senator Fifield said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:06:42.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
