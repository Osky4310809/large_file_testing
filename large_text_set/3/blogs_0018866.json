Giroud wants Wenger stay Giroud has backed his under-fire boss (Photo: David Price) \nOlivier Giroud has given his full support towards under-fire boss Arsene Wenger and hopes to see him pledge his long-term future to Arsenal. \nWenger’s position remains in doubt following the team’s failure to secure their position in the top four, writes Mirror Football's Marc Isaacs. \nGiroud, speaking to Canal +, said: \"We want to see Arsène Wenger sign an extension. To continue the adventure, because we support him.\" \nHe added: \"We hope to win the cup and qualify Arsenal for the Champions' League.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T07:45:58.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
