I guess, right? Covers, nobody’s had more covers,” Trump said in the interview published on Thursday .\nWhen the reporter responded by saying Nixon, who stepped down in 1974 under the threat of impeachment, had Trump beat, the president said, “Ok good. I’m sure I’ll win.”\nThe sitdown, which claimed to be on “truth and falsehoods,” touched on other topics, too, like when Trump accused his former Republican rival Ted Cruz’s dad of being in on the John F. Kennedy assassination with Lee Harvey Oswald.\n“Well that was in a newspaper. No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he’s a friend of mine. But that was in the newspaper,” Trump said in the Time interview.\n“I wasn’t, I didn’t say that. I was referring to a newspaper. A Ted Cruz article referred to a newspaper story with, had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast.”\nThe report about Cruz’s father appeared in the supermarket tabloid the “National Enquirer.”\nTrump also maintained his claims that there was vast voter fraud in the last presidential campaign and that thousands of Muslims were cheering in New Jersey streets after the 9/11 terror attacks .\nAt the end of the interview, though, Trump pointed to his success by saying he’s the one in the White House.\n“Hey look, in the meantime, I guess, I can’t be doing so badly, because I’m president, and you’re not. You know. Say hello to everybody OK?” he said, concluding the interview.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:31:35.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
