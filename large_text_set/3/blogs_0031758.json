As an example when Koalas were made a threatened species word went out to developers to put in their applications before it came into law so they didn't fall under the legislation. Many put in incomplete environmental statements just to make the cut. That was early 2012 now FIVE years later, with Koalas even more threatened, these developments are still in play though not commenced. Please put a sunset clause in the legislation so if a project isn't substantially commenced within 3 years of a threatened species being declared that even if the project was put in before the legislation, that it is then considered under the threatened species legislation. This will save Koalas and many other endangered species from opportunistic developers. read petition letter â–¾ \nFederal Minister for the Environment, Please review existing threatened species legislation to further protect animals and habitats from development by inserting a sunset clause that makes aproject fall under the legislation if the project is not \"substantialy Commenced\" within 3 years of the species in the area of the development being deemed \"Threatened\". This will prevent projects continuing to be considered while species within their sphere of inluence become even further reduced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T12:03:01.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
