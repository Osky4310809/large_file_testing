Washington fully funded the early years of Medicaid expansion; its contribution is set to fall to 90% by 2020. The AHCA would gradually roll back this more generous funding. From 2020, any new enrollees eligible only because of Obamacare’s expansion of the programme would cost states as much as conventional Medicaid patients do. Because Medicaid has a high turnover, the number of people attracting the 90% match rate would dwindle over time. The bill also overhauls how the federal government funds the entire programme. It would cap the total amount of funding states receive per person, and link the cap to medical inflation. The reform would encourage states to experiment with ways to make Medicaid better, and more cost-effective. But critics say the real aim is to whittle down the programme. In most states that did not go along with the Obamacare expansion, Medicaid does not provide much of a safety net. In only one, Wisconsin, are childless adults eligible, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a think-tank. In Texas and Alabama parents cease to qualify at just 18% of the poverty line (an annual income of about $3,600 for a family of three). The left worries that states like these have no interest in experimenting with the best ways to help the poor. Republicans respond that it should be up to the states, not the federal government, to decide what to do. The savings in the federal budget from reducing Medicaid funding will help fund about $600bn of cuts to federal taxes over a decade. The question is: will states plug the gap?
