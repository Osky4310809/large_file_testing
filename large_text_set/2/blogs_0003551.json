Marco Rojas of the Victory. Source: Getty Images \nAntonis’ first start was lathered in intelligence, and Wellington were unable to cope with his positioning and movement. His willingness to look, pass and get forward was a feature, and finally presents Tony Popovic with a decision to make - rather than a problem to solve - when Mitch Nichols is 100% fit again. \nGoing back to January 2015, Antonis just made the Asian Cup squad ahead of another midfielder who’s known for using brain over brawn. \nAaron Mooy missed out on that occasion, but his career took off soon after, to the point of becoming Ange Postecoglou’s favourite footballer. \nThere’s a long way to go, but the Socceroos sure would benefit if the same happens to Antonis. Terry Antonis of the Wanderers (R). Source: AAP \nLEAST BEST \nDean Bouzanis made a bad blue with his distasteful abuse of Besart Berisha. \nHe is contrite, and will probably serve serious time to think about it. \nThat will give Thomas Sorensen another chance in goals, after his first-team place evaporated with a Round one red card. \nBouzanis kept his spot because of his cool head when playing out and his ability to hit a long pass as well as any midfielder in the competition. Though, he has detractors thanks to a hot streak. \nOpposition managers (John Aloisi being one) are bemused by his excitement when matters go well for City – if you call running 50 metres to give an opposition bench a spray excitement. \nBouzanis, along with a few teammates, have let emotions tip over the point of control this season. \nIn the end, it’s a blow for City - the list of suspended players as long as any club in the history of the competition. Bouzanis faces lengthy ban 5:55 \nUNSUNG \nOn Friday night, Michael Theo and Danny Vukovic got all the credit for keeping an entertaining contest scoreless, and it’s only fair the keepers get that. They are a unique breed; trust me, I’ve lived it in the green room every Saturday night for the last eight years. \nSo that’s Keepers’ Round done. \nNow, for this weekend – DEFENDERS’ ROUND. \nFrom Thursday to Sunday, it will be a full blown celebration on Fox Sports of what our tall, tough, and uncompromising friends at the back bring to the sport. \nFrom tape around the head to scything tackles to the lack of self-preservation, we’ll honour what these people do, in their own unglamorous, humble manner (Pepe aside) to better their team’s fortunes. \nUnsung no more. Well, at least for a weekend. Sublime Theo denies Sydney 0:28 \nSURPRISE \nIt’s one step removed from the A League, but it’s a little bit of a shock to see Brett Holman still in Australia and not in China for Brisbane’s midweek Champions League test against Shanghai Shenhua. \nAloisi left him at home as Holman is returning from two months off with a knee injury. \nBut you can’t help but think how suited Holman would have been off the bench for 30 minutes on Wednesday against a Shanghai side who will start slick, but no doubt tire. \nEither way, with a Brisbane side back in form against Carlos Tevez, Obafemi Martins and Colombian Giovanni Moreno (a sublime midfielder according to ex-teammates) it is a must-watch.

Source: Getty Images \nUNSURPRISE \nI mentioned him before, and yeah he’s been a little quiet the last few weeks, but all of that was completely forgotten in the last 15 minutes of the Melbourne Derby. \nMarco Rojas, you little bloody genius. \nIt’s no shock to see him burst back to life when it really mattered. \nHe’s in the select bunch of players – including Thomas Broich, Milos Ninkovic, Bruno Fornaroli, Diego Castro, Marcelo Carrusca, Nico Martinez – who we wish, just for a fleeting moment, we WISHED … they were Australian.
