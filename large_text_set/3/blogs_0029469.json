You gave me a dream job that a million girls would want. Getting an offer letter to be an assistant fashion editor — which catalyzed my career — was one of the proudest moments of my early 20s.\nIf I had not met you and joined your team, I would not be in the place I am today: a senior editor, managing a team, and living out the career I've wanted since I was in high school. But the path here wasn't smooth, and you certainly didn't make it easy.\nFor starters, did you really have to make fun of me to my face? I always knew when you were not-so-covertly talking about me with the only other editor on our team. You two would chat via IM, giggle, and toss knowing looks over at my corner. I may have been junior, but that made me feel especially small.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/VPsEPbRHT4d75cjohJxlQlatHsM/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/09/28/888/n/1922153/684548c46be576a4_giphy.gif"], "published": "2017-03-22T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:16:37.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
