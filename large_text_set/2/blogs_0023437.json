They are on their way and will reach by evening,\" the consulate said in a tweet. \nThe accused has been charged with premeditated first-degree murder and his bond has been set at $2 million. \nAccording to Garmin, Kuchibhotla and Madasani worked in the company's aviation systems. \n\"We're saddened that two Garmin associates were involved in last night's (Wednesday night) incident, and we express our condolences to the family and friends of our co-workers involved. Garmin will have grievance counsellors on-site and available for its associates today and tomorrow,\" Garmin said in a statement. \nThe alleged hate crime has sent shocked waves among Indian-American and the Indian community across the United States. \n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Srinivas Kuchibhotla,\" said Jay Kansara, director of Government Relations at Hindu American Foundation. \n\"We are also praying for a speedy recovery for the injured. We call upon the US Department of Justice and local law enforcement to investigate this murder as what it is, a hate crime. \n\"Anything less will be an injustice to the victims and their families,\" he said. \nKansara said that the HAF thanks those who put themselves at risk to stop this attack or to bring the perpetrator to justice. \n\"It is these acts of heroism in our communities that make America great,\" he said. \nA GoFundMe page has also been set up to help raise funds for sending Kuchibhotla's remains to India. \nThe shooting incident comes at a time when hate crimes and acts of bigotry have risen notably during the recent months in America. \nA Jewish cemetery was vandalised in St Louis, Missouri last week and the offices of Jewish civil society organisations have received bomb threats. \nA man was removed from a Chicago-Houston flight after levelling racist taunts at Pakistani and Indian passengers. © Copyright 2017 PTI.
