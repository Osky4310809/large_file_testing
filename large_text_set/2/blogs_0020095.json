When she became pregnant, David tried to trick Uriah into sleeping with her so it would look like the child was Uriah's. Uriah refused. David then plotted to have Uriah sent to the front lines of battle and abandoned by his fellow soldiers; Uriah was killed by the enemy. After Bathsheba finished mourning Uriah, David took her for his wife. But David's actions displeased God, and the baby born to Bathsheba died. \nBathsheba bore David other sons, most notably Solomon . God so loved Solomon that Nathan the prophet called him Jedidiah, which means \"beloved of Jehovah.\" Bathsheba's Accomplishments: \nBathsheba was a faithful wife to David. \nShe was especially loyal to her son Solomon, making sure he followed David as king, even though Solomon was not David's firstborn son. \nBathsheba is one of only five women listed in the ancestry of Jesus Christ ( Matthew 1:6 ). Bathsheba's Strengths: \nBathsheba was wise and protective. \nShe used her position to ensure both her and Solomon's safety when Adonijah tried to steal the throne. Life Lessons: \nWomen had few rights in ancient times. When King David summoned Bathsheba, she had no choice but to sleep with him. After David had her husband murdered, she had no choice when David took her for his wife. Despite being mistreated, she learned to love David and saw a promising future for Solomon. Often circumstances seem stacked against us , but if we keep our faith in God, we can find meaning in life . God makes sense when nothing else does.
