He wants to win and, with PSG as they are now, he cannot win. \nHe’s been in Paris for five years and now has to make a decision: to earn a lot without winning or earn or to become a champion? \nIt's not a question of money: anyone who buys Verratti would pay a lot. Because there is at least one thing for sure: he leaves PSG, it will be for a top European club. \nThere is [interest from Italian clubs], but I somehow doubt that this will be his final destination. The comments come mere days after Di Campli claimed there was \"no doubt\" Verratti would remain at PSG, a situation reported as a blow to suitors Chelsea , Manchester United , Juventus and Inter Milan , per Italian news agency Nansa (via TalkSport ). He has also been heavily linked with Barcelona to act as a long-term replacement for Andres Iniesta, per Corriere dello Sport (via MailOnline's Tom Bassam ). The report added that, given Verratti's importance to PSG, and the fact his current deal still has more than four years left to run, it would take a bid of around €70 million (£60.6 million) to tempt PSG into selling. Verratti signed for PSG from Pescara in 2012 and has since earned a reputation as one of Europe's most talented central midfielders while winning four Ligue 1 titles. Verratti has previously stated his dream is to win the UEFA Champions League with PSG, per Stade 2 (via ESPN FC's Jonathan Johnson ). However, the French outfit have consistently underwhelmed in Europe's top competition, most recently crashing out at the last-16 stage to Barca despite earning a 4-0 lead from the first leg. Bleacher Report UK @br_uk 3/10/2017, 3:04:01 AM Verratti may feel that he would have a better chance of Champions League success at a club like Barca, Chelsea or Juve, and Di Campli has done little to convince that his future lies at the Parc des Princes. Given Verratti's talent both defensively in the middle of the park and on the ball going forward, there will likely be numerous suitors for him in the summer should it emerge that he is eager to leave PSG.
