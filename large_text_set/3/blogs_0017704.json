Yemi Osinbajo \nOpone said the Vice President’s shuttle to the Niger Delta had been impacting positively, as many political and economic decisions had been taken by the federal government, saying the Osinbajo visit to the region will not be meaningful if Ndokwa is not visited as he needs to see the extent of the neglect and degradation of the area over the years. \nThe President General commended the Buhari government for continuing with the Amnesty Programme, “as the decision had brought back peace to the region and it will empower restive youths”. \nHe assured the federal government of peace in Ndokwa, saying the people will continue to exhibit maturity in their agitation. \n“We assure you our people will continue to exhibit maturity in our agitation to redress the marginalization of our people over the years”, Opone said. \nThe President General explained that Ndokwa people had never disrupted or damaged any government property in the cause of their agitation for over 50 years, saying government should reciprocate the gesture. \n“We expect the federal government to reciprocate our peaceful nature by integrating Ndokwa nation in all the programs of the Presidential Amnesty Programmes such as Skill Acquisition, Scholarship, Graduate training programs, Mentoring and Post Empowerment programs”. \nAlso speaking at the occasion, Ossai Nicolas Ossai decried the neglect of Ndokwa and asked for urgent attention to compensate the people. \nOthers present during the visit are the first Vice President, Chief K.C Daphey, the Secretary General, Pastor Jonathan Dike, the Youth Leader, Comrade Lucky Onyia, a representative of the Ndoshimili Development Union (NDU), and the Publisher of Ndokwa Reporter, Mr Emmanuel Enebeli.
