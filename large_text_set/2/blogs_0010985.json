That email proceeded to discuss the minister’s meetings with the heads of the CIA, the FBI and the director of national intelligence. \nA similar message was also received by Johnson from the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia that discussed an upcoming meeting with the Saudi interior minister.   \nA message between Marrone and an unknown individual discussed sensitive information regarding the earnings of Lockheed Martin and joint efforts between Lockheed Martin and Boeing related to the launch of space vehicles and related infrastructure issues. \nLaughably, Johnson sent out a “progress report” speech over his unsecured private email account that discussed the department’s “strides in cybersecurity.” \nEven more hilarious — though a bit frightening — is evidence that Johnson’s name and account were spoofed as part of a “phishing scam” seeking personal information from people gullible enough to believe they could get a piece of an “abandoned fund worth U.S.D. 4.5 million in West Africa.” \nBreitbart noted that some of the emails were heavily redacted, proving they contained sensitive classified information not fit to be released publicly — or stored on a private, unsecured email server, for that matter.
