Respect!\" \nIbrahimovic has had plenty to say since then as well, with an interview he gave to United’s official website seeing him reiterate a belief that he can dominate English football. \n\"I have no individual targets because that I did already,\" he said. \nRio: Man Utd success a matter of time \n\"I have conquered England - it took three months.\" \nUnited will be looking for another talismanic display from the 35-year-old frontman on Sunday when they welcome Liverpool to Old Trafford, with Jose Mourinho’s side looking to cut the gap to their arch-rivals to just two points in the Premier League standings.
