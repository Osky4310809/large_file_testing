Today, the company revealed the smartphone will make its way over to the UK starting on Wednesday, February 1.\nSee also: Huawei CEO Richard Yu talks new partnerships, growth in interview at CES 2017 3 weeks ago The phone will be available first in Vodafone retail stores and on PAYG for the price of £185 without a contract, and will also be available with a contract, with prices starting at £16 per month. You don’t have to go into a brick and mortar store to order the device, though – you’ll also be able to order the P8 Lite (2017) over the phone, if that’s more your thing. Online ordering will be added sometime in the future, but no specific time frame was revealed.\nAs a quick reminder, the Huawei P8 Lite (2017) has a 5.2-inch Full HD IPS screen and sports a Kirin 655 processor, along with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage, with a microSD card slot available for adding even more storage. It also has a 12MP rear camera with an f/2.0 aperture and a 8MP front-facing selfie camera. Other specs of this phone include a 3,000mAh battery and a fingerprint reader on the back. Unlike other new phones on the market, this one does indeed come with Android 7.0 Nougat along with Huawei’s latest EMUI 5.0 user interface.\nThe phone has already launched in other parts of Europe for €240. While it is only available in a black color option at the moment, the company plans to release versions in white and gold in a few weeks. There’s no word on when the device will make its way to the US, but there are reports that it will soon be released in parts of Latin America, where it will reportedly get a name change to the P9 Lite (2017). Hopefully we will have more information on the phone’s market expansion very soon.\nNext: Best cheap Android phones ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:12:41.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
