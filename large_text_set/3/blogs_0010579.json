It's the Nacho show. â€” Major League Soccer (@MLS) March 12, 2017 \nCollecting the ball in his own half, Piatti covered some 40 yards on the dribble before cutting inside to his right foot and firing a low shot past Stefan Frei. It was the first goal of 2017 for Piatti, who scored 21 times over the regular season and playoffs last year. \nBut it wasn't enough for the Impact, who saw Nicolas Lodeiro convert an 83rd-minute penalty before Will Bruin prodded home an equalizer deep in stoppage time to steal a 2-2 draw for the Sounders.
