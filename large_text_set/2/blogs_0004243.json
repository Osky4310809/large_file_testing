Sometime after snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, there’s a good chance Tom Brady had sex with his supermodel wife, Gisele Bundchen. But sometime in between those two things, some rat bastard stole Tom Brady’s Super Bowl jersey , according to ESPN . Yeah! As in, the jersey that the best quarterback of all time wore while engineering the best comeback of all time. The one that may be worth as much as a half million dollars , according to Forbes. \nHow are you going to just swipe your man’s sweaty, grit-soaked jersey from his locker when he isn’t looking and sully the biggest night of his life? “I put it in the bag, and I came out and it wasn’t there anymore,” Brady told reporters Monday. “It’s unfortunate because that’s a nice piece of memorabilia. If it shows up on eBay somewhere, someone let me know so I can track that down.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:29:18.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
