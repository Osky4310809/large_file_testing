PBA IMAGES \nBolstering its roster in preparation for the 2017 PBA Philippine Cup playoffs, Phoenix plucked Karl Dehesa from the free agent pool on Tuesday. \nThe 6-foot-2 shooter was dropped by GlobalPort to the unrestricted free agent list, allowing the Fuel Masters to secure the services of the gunner. \nThe seldom-used Dehesa only appeared for three games this conference, with coach Franz Pumaren opting to field in veteran Nino Canaleta and rookie Von Pessumal. ADVERTISEMENT \nHe averaged 9.5 points on a 34.6 shooting from three, to go with 2.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists last year, before toiling the bench this season. \nDehesa, however, will be fighting for minutes in Phoenix’s loaded guard rotation which already has Matthew Wright, Simon Enciso, Cyrus Baguio, and Mark Borboran. \nBut Coach Ariel Vanguardia welcomed Dehesa’s entry to Phoenix, saying he will fit in seamlessly with his team. \n“He gives us more stability and flexibility in the backcourt while we also prepare for the long term when Matt (Wright) and Norbert (Torres) will be with the Gilas program.” \n“I think Simon and Karl can play together. I’m excited to see them compete in practice and whoever plays better will have more court time,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T10:15:18.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
