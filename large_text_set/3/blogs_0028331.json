The latest of those is a rumored desktop dock for the forthcoming Galaxy S8 . Now a patent filed by Apple suggests the iPhone maker is considering a similar thing, only in the form of a dumb laptop enclosure. \nThe Apple patent, discovered by Apple Insider , was filed in September 2016 and is simply titled \" Electronic Accessory Device .\" \nIt's the details that are interesting, though. The accessory device described offers a display, ports, and a control interface, but does not function without the addition of an \"electronic host device.\" As the image included with the patent filing and pictured above shows, the electronic host device looks very much like an iPhone . \nWith Apple laser focused on making devices as thin as possible, this would certainly be a way to make a future MacBook incredibly thin. It wouldn't need any internal components beyond a few interface circuits, the keyboard, ports, and display. Battery power would come from the smartphone, as would the touchpad input courtesy of the screen.

But with the rate at which mobile device performance is increasing, it seems unlikely such additional components would be necessary. One other point to make if this device became a reality: it would be the first Apple laptop effectively running iOS . \nFor now, this is just a patent, and one that will likely remain an Apple idea until a point is reached where MacBook sales are no longer making sense as a separate product, or competitors try something similar for their smartphones and it proves popular.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:17:10.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
