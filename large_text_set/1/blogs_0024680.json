As usual, Transfer Talk has its finger on the pulse when it comes to which rumours are picking up steam. Check out all the latest deals here . TOP STORY: Pogba key to a Griezmann move to United \nJose Mourinho hopes to take advantage of Paul Pogba's friendship with Antoine Griezmann in order to convince the Atletico Madrid striker to move to Manchester United this summer. \nThe Daily Record reports that United failed to entice Griezmann last year, but hope the France international will change his mind with world-record signing Pogba now on the case. \nThere will be no problem putting a financial package together to satisfy Atletico and Griezmann, but selling the move to the player remains the outstanding issue. \nUnited are said to view Griezmann as Wayne Rooney's long-term replacement at the club due to his tactical flexibility. Although he has only just broken United's all-time goal scoring record , Rooney can leave if an acceptable offer is tabled. Mourinho said earlier in the week that he wouldn't criticise his captain for ending his career elsewhere. Liverpool to move for Durmisi? \nLiverpool may have found a solution to their problem at left-back after Denmark international Riza Durmisi has been linked with a move to Anfield by the Daily Mail. \nJames Milner has done a fine job playing out of position for Jurgen Klopp's side this season, but Real Betis man Durmisi presents a better solution in the longer term. James Milner has been a serviceable, makeshift left-back for Liverpool, but reinforcements could be on the way. \nThe 23-year-old only moved to La Liga from Brondby last summer, but has a £17 million buyout clause making a transfer a legitimate possibility. \nMeanwhile, Bayer Leverkusen and Germany striker Julian Brandt is also on Liverpool's wanted list, as speculation about Daniel Sturridge's future continues. Pato could triple wages in CSL \nJust when you thought it had all gone quiet on the Chinese Super League front, Alexandre Pato has emerged as Tianjin Quanjian's latest target. \nMarca claims representatives of the club -- who were linked with Diego Costa and are managed by Fabio Cannavaro -- will meet with Villarreal chiefs this weekend in an attempt to close a deal for the Brazilian striker \nFormer Chelsea and AC Milan player Pato signed a deal until 2020 with Villarreal when he joined in the summer and is said to earn €2m-a-season, although he could triple that amount in China. ESPN FC's Craig Burley thinks it may be best for both the club and player if Daniel Sturridge moved on from Liverpool. Tap-ins \n- Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic has been linked with a move to Zenit St. Petersburg, but Tony Pulis, always keen to bolster his defensive options, is interested in bringing the Serbia international to West Bromwich Albion. The Daily Mirror reports that Chelsea will field offers for 32-year-old Ivanovic, with Everton also a possibility. \n- Manchester United midfielder Sean Goss is set to drop down a division and join Queens Park Rangers for a fee of £500,000, the Independent reports. The 21-year-old midfielder, who would have been a free agent in the summer, rejected a new contract with United in order to pursue first-team football. \n- Dimitri Payet has agreed terms with Marseille ahead of a move back to France, but a deal is not in place with West Ham United. The Daily Mirror reckons the Hammers turned down an offer of £25m plus £3m in add-ons for the France international, but OM still hope to take Payet on loan with an option to make the deal permanent in the summer. \n- Crystal Palace have agreed a fee of almost £13m to sign midfielder Luka Milivojevic from Olympiakos. A deal for the Serbia international is almost over the line, the Independent claims, with just the percentage of any future sale to agree upon. Milivojevic has won the League and Cup double in Belgium with Anderlecht and in Greece with Olympiakos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T03:24:58.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
