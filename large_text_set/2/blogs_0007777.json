Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJordan Rhodes’ home debut ended in predictable fashion as the prolific Championship marksman kicked off a win that breathed life into Sheffield Wednesday’s promotion hopes. \nSam Winnall added a second, on 79 minutes, stooping to head in from five yards after a break up field by sub Adam Reach and a cross from full-back Jack Hunt. \nAnd Reach gave the scoreline a flattering look three minutes from time when he broke half the length of the field from Winnall’s lay-off before coolly slotting home. \nIt took Rhodes just nine minutes of his home debut to continue with Wednesday what he has done everywhere else he has been in his career - scoring. \nIt was not the prettiest goal the Scotland international will ever claim but it summed up everything about the 6-foot-plus centre-forward who has made goalscoring at the Championship level look the simplest thing in sport. \nRoss Wallace swung over a free-kick from the right-hand touchline and Rhodes slipped between Paul Robinson and Jonathan Grounds far too easily to force in a header from four yards. Rhodes opened his Owls account in the ninth minute (Photo: Rex Features) He celebrated with his dad - Wednesday's goalkeeping coach - Andy Rhodes (Photo: Rex Features) \nPretty it may not have been but it was the 173rd league goal of Rhodes’ career - most coming with Huddersfield and Blackburn. \nAnd on the 299th league start of his career, that marks an incredible strike rate from the 27-year-old who joined Wednesday on deadline day in a loan deal from Middlesbrough. \nThat move could be made permanent and eventually cost Wednesday £10 million although if Rhodes has helped shoot them into the Premier League by then, that will be money well spent. \nThe Owls certainly looked like a team with promotion on their minds as they tore into Gianfranco Zola’s struggling Birmingham. \nTomasz Kuszczak blocked early to keep out Sam Winnall, then the keeper fumbled a long shot from Barry Bannan before Grounds booted clear. \nIncredibly, for all their dominance Wednesday almost gifted Birmingham an equaliser with the visitors hitting the woodwork twice in the space of a minute midway through the first half.
