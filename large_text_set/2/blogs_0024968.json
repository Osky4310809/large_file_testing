(Photo: Richard Cartwright, ABC) \nThe Blacklist/The Blacklist: RedemptionNBC, 9 ET/PT \nThe Blacklist is heading for a winter break, but not before NBC uses this episode — which finds Red trying to discover who has given him a deadly dose of poison — to launch this Blacklist spinoff (10 ET/PT) built around Tom (Ryan Eggold), Scottie (Famke Janssen) and Matias (Edi Gathegi). NBC did not make Redemption available for preview — which, like Red’s dose of poison, is a bad omen, but not necessarily a fatal one. \nHow to Get Away With MurderABC, 9 ET/PT \nThis once-red-hot series wraps up a troubled second season with a two-hour finale that will most likely reveal who killed Wes while setting the show up for its guaranteed third run. So here’s a suggestion: You have a fabulous actor at the center of your show, Viola Davis, who is an odds-on favorite to win an Oscar Sunday. So how about next season, you rely less on gimmicks and storytelling tricks and more on her? \nSun RecordsCMT, 10 ET/PT \nThis new series about the early careers of Sam Phillips, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis is based on the Broadway musical Million Dollar Quartet. Let’s hope it’s better than the musical, which was musically fun but paper thin. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2maubbv NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
