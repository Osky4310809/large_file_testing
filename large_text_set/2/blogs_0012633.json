President Donald Trump shakes hands with retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis \n\"This multinational cooperation through NATO is a clear way for countries to significantly improve their armed forces while ensuring the greatest value for money for their taxpayers,\" said Rose Gottemoeller, NATO's deputy secretary general. \nT he letters of intent, although not legally binding, are the latest sign that European allies are starting to end years of competing national strategies that have left Europe reliant on the United States to provide basics such as refuelling combat planes in the air. Watch | General 'Mad Dog' Mattis sworn in as Trump's Defence Secretary 01:09 \nN ew U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis warned NATO allies on Wednesday they must pay more towards their own defences or potentially see less support from Washington. \nDuplication is also a problem, with EU militaries owning 19 types of armoured infantry fighting vehicles, compared with one in the United States, while wasted funds amount to 25 billion euros a year, according to European Commission data. \nAs part of a broader push to revitalise European defence cooperation in the wake of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and the rise of Islamic militancy on Europe's borders, France agreed to allow Belgian and Dutch jets to fly into its airspace in the case of a conflict with a foreign threat. \nThat means a Belgian jet pursuing an enemy plane would no longer have to turn back at the French border. Auto update 1:27PM Trump lashes out at 'low life leakers' \nM r Trump was up early this morning and fired off a tweet aimed at those leaking sensitive information to the media. The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017 \nT he president is waging war on his own intelligence agencies over “un-American” leaks that revealed that his campaign aides had been in regular contact with Russian intelligence officials and led to the resignation of his national security adviser. \nMr Trump has claimed intelligence agents with a political vendetta against him are responsible for “criminal leaks” aimed at undermining his presidency.
