March 13, 2017 @ 10:00 PM By Alissa Schulman \nRomance in Rovaniemi! As possibly the most tear-filled season of The Bachelor ever came to an end, Nick Viall took Raven and Vanessa to Santa Claus’ official hometown in Finland to meet the reality star’s family and enjoy their final dates on the Monday, March 13, season 21 finale. (Spoilers ahead!) Meet Nick Viall's 'Bachelor' Season 21 Contestants! \nNick’s Family Meets His Girlfriends \nNick had been at this point before — days before a proposal — and it hadn’t gone well for him. His family was not about to let him forget it. Over the course of two days, Nick’s family met Raven (again) and Vanessa, and both days, the sentiment was along the lines of, “Let’s hope these two don’t reject Nick like Andi and Kaitlyn did.” \nSince Raven had already met Nick’s family, she had already formed a bond with his lovable little sister, Bella. Before Bella even met Vanessa, she was already pledging her allegiance to Raven. That makes Us think that day went pretty well, not to mention that Nick’s dad also noted Raven’s “maturity” and Nick told his mom he “more than just really like[s]” Raven. \nVanessa’s meeting was a bit more emotional than Raven’s, with the family voicing their worry that she wouldn’t be ready for an engagement due to her many unanswered questions. Nick’s dad, Chris, was concerned that Vanessa was too close to Nick’s “type,” and that would result in his usual heartache, but after Chris’ tearful one-on-one with her, he was convinced that Vanessa loved his son. \nAt the end of the two days, the family vote was a tossup. These ‘Bachelor’ and ‘Bachelorette’ Babies Will Melt Your Heart \nVanessa’s Last Date \nFor their final date, potentially ever, Nick and Vanessa rode horses through the snow-covered woods, which Nick described as “literally wow.” They rode all the way to Santa’s cabin, where the real Saint Nick welcomed them into his home. Santa asked what they wished for — both said love — and then gifted them a wooden heart with their picture carved into it. \nEven with Santa’s well wishes, Vanessa didn’t feel quite right. That night, she dug for any bit of reassurance she could get, but Nick wasn’t giving it up. Hyperaware that Raven was still in the game, Nick didn’t want to dole out false confidence. (Take note, Ben Higgins .) \nVanessa did not like Nick’s non-answer and ended their last evening together in tears. \nNick felt bad, but not bad enough. He told the camera that he wished he could tell Vanessa what she wanted to hear, but that he was also falling in love with Raven. Mitch Haaseth/ABC (3) The Weirdest ‘Bachelor’ and ‘Bachelorette’ Job Titles Ever! \nRaven’s Last Date \nFor their final date, also potentially ever, Nick and Raven took their relationship full circle and went ice skating since skating is their thing. The date was great and both were laughing and smiling the entire time, but it didn’t “officially” become the best day of Raven’s life until Nick left for a moment and returned with an armload of husky puppies. \nGoing a completely different route from Vanessa, Raven went into the evening wanting to reassure Nick about her hesitation-free feelings. Nick told her he has never questioned how she felt or how sincere her feelings were, which made Raven feel like Nick totally “got” her.
