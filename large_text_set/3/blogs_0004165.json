Ford. (Photo: Getty Images) More When President Donald Trump visited a naval aircraft carrier on Thursday, critics weren’t just talking about his proposed military spending increases. They also had a bone to pick with his choice of outfit: a green jacket and navy cap that had just been given to him by the Navy. Embroidered with the name of the new ship, the USS Gerald R Ford, and his own commander-in-chief badge, the items were a personalized gift to the president. They’re casual souvenirs that might be nice for an afternoon at Mar-a-Lago. The problem, in the eyes of some viewers, is that he chose to wore this faux military attire in front of active service members. The fact that Trump evaded service in the Vietnam War due to heel spurs made this look particularly offensive to some. Trump – who got five deferments from Vietnam — is currently cosplaying as a military man, complete with hat and jacket. \n— Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) March 2, 2017 As a vet, I am appalled to see draft-evading #trump donning a military cap & jacket on a naval aircraft carrier!Insult to navy seal who died \n— K bris (@kbris) March 2, 2017 \"Hey when's Trump getting here? We are NOT giving that piece of shit a uniform. He– what?\" \n*turns head to right* \n— (((DAVE ROSS))) (@davetotheross) March 2, 2017 If a Navy-issued jacket isn’t appropriate for a trip to the Navy, what is? Barack Obama tended to don his own leather Air Force One bomber on military visits. That, too, drew critics who called the look inappropriate and Top Gun -esque . George W. Bush drew metaphorical flak for arriving on an aircraft carrier in a combat suit (before changing into civilian attire for that “Mission Accomplished” speech). It could be worse. At least none of these presidents resorted to wearing their nylon Air Force One windbreakers .
