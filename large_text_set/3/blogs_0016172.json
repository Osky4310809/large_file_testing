David Sirota blames MEAT eaters for climate change, Twitter laughs Posted at 11:01   \nSorry Dave – can we call you Dave? Great. Dave, if we have to choose between ice caps or bacon, we choose bacon. \nJust sayin’. Don’t hate. Many of us will be dead before our kids and grand kids rightly hate us for what we did to them & their future. But that doesn't make it OK. https://t.co/dgpkeIN49n \n— David Sirota (@davidsirota) March 21, 2017 \nWe’ll be dead right? But have had the chance to eat bacon our whole lives? That sounds pretty ok. Trending 'No one cares': Time and People magazine take their ball and go home, no big pre-party for WHCD \nOh, and this editor’s kids love bacon so they’d probably be ok with eating meat over worrying about trying to control something they can’t control in the first place, like climate. Risking a climate apocalypse in order to eat 270 lbs of meat per year is peak America F Yeah https://t.co/Z7YzukHZZB https://t.co/zm3wCKrYRF pic.twitter.com/MKInbXRqps \n— David Sirota (@davidsirota) March 21, 2017 \nNot just climate change, CLIMATE APOCALYPSE. \nSorry man, we’re still not giving up bacon. In terms of the sheer weight of meat eaten, the avg American eats the equivalent of one NBA power forward every year https://t.co/Z7YzukHZZB pic.twitter.com/1R3TmpsOvI \n— David Sirota (@davidsirota) March 21, 2017 \nYummmm … that’s a lot of bacon (we get it, he’s talking about more than just bacon but man, we LOVE bacon). \nIt seems people like Sirota won’t be happy until they can take the joy out of everything in life for some greater good. \nMeh. \nEditor’s note: David Sirota not only had the editor of this story blocked but Twitchy as a whole, blocked. Ya’ know, if he ate more bacon he’d be a much happier person.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:17:22.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
