STAR/File photo \nLEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – After shaking at least six times in the past three days, the Bulusan Volcano in Sorsogon acted up again with eight tremors recorded in the last 24 hours, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said yesterday. \nVolcanologist Crispulo Diolata said the fluctuating volcanic tremors indicated the Bulusan remains abnormal and an underground volcanic activity is ongoing. \n“This indicates that hydrothermal processes are ongoing beneath the volcano, which may lead to steam-driven or phreatic eruptions,” Diolata said. \nHe advised the public to avoid setting foot in the volcano’s four-kilometer radius permanent danger zone. \nResidents near river channels were advised to remain vigilant against lahar flow especially during heavy downpour brought by the prevailing northeast monsoon. \nPhivolcs reminded pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano’s summit, noting ash from any sudden eruption can be hazardous to aircrafts.   \nBulusan has been dispplaying fluctuating volcanic quakes since it last erupted in November.
