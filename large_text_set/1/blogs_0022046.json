(Photo: Nicholas Kamm, AFP/Getty Images) \nSAN FRANCISCO — President Trump dreams of gold-plated U.S. companies planting major manufacturing facilities in the American heartland, pumping out smartphones, cars and other goods. \nDream on. \nEven in the face of what Trump calls a \"very major border tax\" to create more factory jobs in the U.S., most tech hardware makers aren't likely to raise stakes at offshore operations and come home. \nIt's simple — do the math, says Dan Panzica, a senior principal analyst at market researcher IHS Markit who previously was vice president of engineering at Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and a major assembler of iPhones. \nCalculate steeper labor costs for American workers. Recruit and train assemblers in mass numbers. Import key components to make product. And, oh, spend a few billion dollars here or there building automated facilities like those in China and elsewhere to mass-produce iPhones. \n“Production was never here (for major consumer-electronics assembly). There is no infrastructure,” Panzica says. To meet production of more than 200 million iPhones sold annually requires tens of thousands of people, working around the clock, in specialized facilities. “No U.S. city could handle that,” Panzica says. \nHe conceded Apple could do final assembly of a limited edition iPhone in Texas, for instance, to satisfy Trump. Higher labor costs would be offset by savings in transportation expenses, he says.

They left for the Sun Belt under Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush. The Sun Belt manufacturing jobs that replaced them are non-union, pay much less well, have lower benefits, etc.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T20:22:23.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
