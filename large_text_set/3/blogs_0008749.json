The France international was called out publicly by Hammers boss Slaven Bilic and criticised for his behaviour. \nIronically, that galvanised the Croatian boss’s squad and potentially saved West Ham from a relegation scrap. \nWenger has stopped short of questioning Sanchez, who scored Arsenal’s fourth goal against Lincoln yesterday, as the player chases a new £250,000-a-week deal. Wenger and Sanchez have made a public show of shaking hands in training (Photo: Arsenal FC/Getty Images) \nBut the situation is threatening to reach the point of no return for him unless he comes back into the fold – and sharpish. \nWenger left Sanchez out of his line-up at Liverpool and took him off during the five-goal thumping by Bayern Munich in midweek. \nThe star was then pictured laughing and joking on the bench as the Gunners were smashed 10-2 on aggregate. Sanchez was subbed during the 5-1 thrashing by Bayern (Photo: BT Sport) Read More Paul Ince defends Alexis Sanchez for forcing Arsenal exit \nThe source added: “The players are getting fed-up with it. If it came to a straight choice between which side to choose, there is no doubt they would back the manager.” \nThe current crisis comes after Sanchez is said to have received an eye-watering offer from China while their window was still open. poll loading Will Alexis Sanchez be at Arsenal next season? 3000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:59:35.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
