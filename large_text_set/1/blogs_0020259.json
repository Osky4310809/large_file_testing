READ MORE Jan 23rd 2017 4:14PM \nINDIANAPOLIS, Ind. ( WTTV ) — An Indiana state senator is drawing heat after apparently sharing a derogatory Facebook post about this weekend's Women's March. \nIndiana Sen. Jack E. Sandlin shared a post that said, \"In one day, Trump got more fat women out walking than Michelle Obama did in eight years.\" \nSandlin, who represents the 36th District in Indianapolis and Greenwood, took down the message. However, people took screenshots that quickly made the rounds on social media. Jack Sandlin is a member of the Indiana State Senate. This is what we're dealing with. pic.twitter.com/7ZW1bnibnN — whitney (@its_whitney) January 23, 2017 \nSandlin took down the post and said in a separate message on Facebook that he wasn't sure how the post ended up on his page: \n\"Apparently there is an offensive post on Facebook that's attributed to me about women in Washington marching. Not sure how that ended up on my Facebook wall but that certainly does not reflect my opinion of women. People who know me will know that's not my view.\" \nThe explanation post was also later taken down from public view. \nSandlin then issued a public statement about the post that echoed the Facebook apology: \n\"Yesterday, an offensive message related to the Women's March on Washington appeared on my Facebook page. It's unclear to me how this ended up on my page, but I have removed it. This message in no way represents my views toward women, and I sincerely apologize to anyone who may have seen it.\" \nSandlin served on the Indianapolis Marion County City-County Council for six years before being elected to the state senate last November. \nHe spent 20 years with the Indianapolis Police Department and became a deputy chief before he left in 1993. He also spent time with the Southport Police Department and now runs a private investigation agency, according to the biography on his campaign website. \nRELATED: These celebs were spotted at Women's Marches: 33 PHOTOS Celebs spotted at Women's Marches See Gallery Celebs spotted at Women's Marches Madonna performs at the Women's March in Washington U.S., January 21, 2017.
