In another email, he bragged that he had provoked Trump during a GOP debate. \nHarwood has not responded to the questions raised by his emails. \nGlenn Thrush who used to write for Politico will now be covering the White House for the NY Times . He was found to have forwarded stories to the Clinton team for approval. \nNew York Times Magazine chief national correspondent Mark Leibovich was described in the emails as ‘sympathetic’ and gave veto power to the Clinton team over anecdotes he was including in a story. \nMaggie Haberman, now with the New York Times (then of Politico ), was described as ‘friendly.’ \nA memo reportedly created by traveling press secretary Nick Merrill stated, “We are all in agreement that the time is right place a story with a friendly journalist in the coming days that positions us a little more transparently while achieving the above goals.” \n“We have has a very good relationship with Maggie Haberman of Politico over the last year. We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed,” the memo continued. “While we should have a larger conversation in the near future about a broader strategy for reengaging the beat press that covers HRC, for this we think we can achieve our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.” \nOf course we can expect this cabal who was all in for Hillary Clinton to report fairly on the new president, right? \nNo bias here…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:31:31.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
