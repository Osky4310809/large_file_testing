Now Nioh has overcome that in its latest patch, allowing players the option to pause should they play offline.\nAdditionally, the latest update adds new sub-missions, though these only unlock if you've reached the final part of the game.\nHere's the full rundown on the patch notes:\nAdditions:\nAdded new Sub Missions. To play the new missions, you need to have reached the final part of the game. These new missions do not affect the trophy requirements for \"Samurai of Legend.\" Added new Titles.
