So far, the brand’s postpaid subscribers have been left out of the promotional offers. However, today the company announced that it will offer its postpaid users free data surprises starting March 13th. \nAirtel hasn’t yet announced how much data its postpaid users will get as part of the surprise offer. As per the press release, the users will find free data offers through the MyAirtel app, available on both Android and iOS. “We are sending some free data your way, so that you can enjoy India’s fastest mobile network a little more,” said the company in the press release. It’s worth mentioning that Airtel recently celebrated signing two million broadband customers by offering its users free data per month for life, ranging from 50GB to 420GB, depending on a user’s plan. It’s likely that the postpaid data benefits will also be rolled out on a pro-rata basis.
