I’ve been getting offers. So then I talked to Manny and we decided, ‘Let’s do a world tour like [Muhammad] Ali.’ And as long as he’s performing OK, every couple months we’d fight in a different place. And that was very appealing [to Pacquiao],” Arum continued. \nThe veteran promoter said various parties from around the world want a piece of Pacquiao, who, at 38 years old and despite being on the tail-end of his career, still remains a recognizable name. \nAnd Arum wants to capitalize on that until the very end. \n“We have a letter from Russia, wanting Pacquiao to fight some guy who’s pretty good in Russia. Eddie Hearn has called me about fighting Kell Brook in England. And we have all these Mid-Eastern people sniffing around,” he added. \nArum also said that if he would have his way, he’ll have Pacquiao fighting again in July and September – both outside the US too – before closing the year out with a showdown against Terence Crawford in the US. \nBut with Pacquiao a sitting Philippine senator, Arum’s wish might be far-fetched.
