On behalf of all Londoners I warmly welcome Cressida Dick as the new Commissioner of @metpoliceuk . I look forward to working with her. pic.twitter.com/L6EDrqOKWE — Mayor of London (@MayorofLondon) February 22, 2017 \nT he Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “Cressida Dick will be the first female Commissioner of the Met in its 187-year history, and the most powerful police officer in the land. \n\"She has already had a long and distinguished career, and her experience and ability has shone throughout this process. \n\"On behalf of all Londoners, I warmly welcome Cressida to the role and I very much look forward to working with her to keep our capital safe and protected. \n“This is a historic day for London and a proud day for me as Mayor. \n\"The Metropolitan Police do an incredible job, working hard with enormous dedication every single day to keep Londoners safe, so for me it was absolutely essential that we found the best possible person to take the Met forward over the coming years and I am confident that we have succeeded.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:46:04.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
