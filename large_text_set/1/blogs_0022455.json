He'll be filling two open slots for FCC commissioners, all but guaranteeing a Republican-leaning FCC.\nThis afternoon, I was informed that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump designated me the 34th Chairman of the @FCC . It is a deeply humbling honor. pic.twitter.com/Joza18aP33\n— Ajit Pai (@AjitPaiFCC) January 23, 2017\nThe appointment shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, as Pai was previously reported to be among the leading candidates for the job. Pai has been a staunch conservative regarding government regulation, and was among the loudest voices to come out against the FCC's move towards net neutrality, on the basis that the it wasn't legal per the FCC's powers. He also argued that the new regulations would end up doing harm, by reducing incentives for companies to expand broadband networks.\nPai penned a 67-page dissent against the FCC's ruling, concluding:\n\"The threat to Internet freedom has awakened a sleeping giant. And I am optimistic that we will look back on today’s vote as an aberration, a temporary deviation from the bipartisan path that has served us so well. I don’t know whether this plan will be vacated by a court, reversed by Congress, or overturned by a future Commission. But I do believe that its days are numbered.\"\nTurns out, he's almost certainly right. Pai's deep expertise at the FCC and experience with the topic of net neutrality mean he's among the most qualified to execute on the desire to reverse the regulator's efforts—though it could still prove difficult.\nGigi Sohn, a lawyer that served at the FCC as an adviser to Wheeler, who's now at the Open Society Foundation, explained that Pai might be the most effective choice for a quick repeal of net neutrality protections.\n\"Ajit Pa is very smart. He knows the agency incredibly well, having worked there as a staffer and a commissioner. And for that reason, he's extremely scary for those of us that believe the FCC should have a role protecting consumers, promoting competition and ensuring fast, fair and open networks,\" said Sohn.\nPai might be the most qualified person to roll back the regulations, but that doesn't mean he's got an easy road ahead of him. Any effort to change the previous FCC action will almost certainly be met by a legal effort by supporters of the previous regime, which will embroil the FCC in a fight bound to attract the attention of the public.\nMore likely, Pai can exert his power on the FCC's investigations, essentially not aggressively enforcing the rules. He could, for example, end the inquiries into the zero-rating programs of AT&T and Verizon , which some say violate net neutrality principles.\nUNITED STATES - MAY 12: Tom Wheeler, right, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, and FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, talks before the start of a Senate Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee hearing in Dirksen Building on the FCC's proposed budget for FY2016, May 12, 2015.

He then worked as a lawyer for telecom giant Verizon Communications. Pai then went back into public service, eventually ending up at the FCC. Between his work as a lawyer and his service as a commissioner, Pai has spent more than eight years at the FCC.\nPai's appointment is a major victory for the anti-regulation forces in Washington, D.C., including the telecom companies who've been fighting against the FCC's net neutrality ruling. In September, Pai put forward a plan that sought to reduce regulations and offer tax incentives in order to encourage companies to bring broadband internet to rural and underserved areas.\nReaction to Pai's appointment was split pretty clearly along partisan lines, which also tended to either support or oppose the FCC's previous net neutrality efforts.\nBerin Szoka, president of Tech Freedom, a thinktank that advocates for less regulation, said in a statement: \"There’s no better pick to reform the agency and restore its independence and integrity. Pai has already laid out an agenda that should command bipartisan support on a wide range of issues.\"\nComcast offered a similar endorsement: \"This is a terrific appointment for the American consumer and the companies the FCC regulates and we look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Pai in his new role.”\nOn the other side, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts immediately drew a line in the sand: \"We need an FCC that protects consumers, promotes competition, and spurs innovation,” Markey said in a statement. “I will vigorously oppose any efforts by leadership at the FCC to undo net neutrality and broadband privacy rules, undermine E-Rate, or roll back any fundamental consumer protections.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AjitPaiFCC/status/823646831196389376", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fX0W2yUVBtlYswT8tMmAra6ZWU8=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F356101%2F8913cdeb-9d4b-4d01-b638-36e72d700d0f.jpg", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "https://twitter.com/POTUS", "https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A5.pdf", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nyM8a069SjHQFHf5et7qXkKPEPc=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F356101%2F8913cdeb-9d4b-4d01-b638-36e72d700d0f.jpg", "https://twitter.com/FCC", "https://t.co/Joza18aP33"], "published": "2017-01-24T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:31:28.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
