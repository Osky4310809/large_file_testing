The 621 horsepower, V12 engine equipped SUV will be priced at $500,000 - making it one of the top priced luxury vehicles of its type. \nThe limited-edition G 650 Landaulet was presented at a luxury auto show in Geneva . Only 99 of the ultra-luxury G-class vehicles will be brought to market. Other vehicles in the Mercedes Benz line-up will be marketed alongside the Maybach G-Class 650 at lower, more affordable prices. \nThe G-Class 650 vehicles - designed for the ultra-wealthy consumer - will be available after September. Among the Maybach's many features is the well-designed passenger compartment with movable calf and leg rests. The passenger compartment also boasts massage units with heating and cooling functions. Riders laud the sport utility vehicle for its comfort and ease in driving smoothly over rough terrain . The vehicle can move from zero to 60 mph within 6 seconds and can travel up to 150 MPH. \nAfter recalls of 100s of thousands of sedans and SUVs for fire risk, the release of the Maybach G-Class 650 is part of Daimler Benz's visible strategy to strengthen its position as a luxury leader. The problem vehicles - model years 2015-2017 C-Class, E-Class, CLA, GLA, and GLC - will be recalled and repaired throughout the calendar year of 2017. With a reported 354,434 units possibly affected and 307,629 vehicles actually recalled, Benz is fortunate to have the G Class Maybach to bolster their revenue throughout fiscal year 2017. \nThe newest G-Class addition builds upon the reputation of the iconic previously released G-class SUV models – letting consumers know the quality to expect while differentiating its placement among this class of vehicles with an increase in luxury features. The 4-passenger all-terrain vehicle is based on a classic design and is positioned to become a collector’s item. \nIn a rough patch for Daimler Benz, the Mercedes-Maybach’s G-Class 650 rollout puts the Mercedes Benz family of cars back into the marketing space of buzzworthy car sellers. In the 4 th quarter of 2016 , Daimler AG ( DAI ) has managed to sustain recommends for buys and holds by top analysts at JP Morgan Chase and HSBC while garnering a sell recommend from BNP Paribas in November of 2016. As of the 1 st quarter of 2017 the DAI stock price has been rising. As of Tuesday, March 7, 2017, Daimler AG has a 12-month low of $51.97/share and a 12-month high of $72.83/share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T14:07:22.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
