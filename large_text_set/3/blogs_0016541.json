Norway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices.”\nThe report notes that Norway produces its oil slowly and invests in the natural resource wisely, therefore protecting itself from the “boom and bust” cycle that many other economies must endure.\nFinland finished fifth on this year’s list, followed by the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Sweden. The United States finished 14th, down from 13th place last year. Key factors in the US’s drop included precarious immigrant relations, a lack of quality education, concern over campaign finance reform and income inequality, among other issues. To rise in rankings, the report said, the US would need to prioritize these factors.\n“America has lost the edge in educating its citizens for the 21st century; that fact alone ensures a social crisis that will continue to threaten well-being until the commitment to quality education for all is once again a central tenet of American society,” the report reads.\nAn entire chapter of the report – “Restoring American Happiness” — is dedicated to the ongoing slide of Americans’ happiness, focusing on four diminished variables: social support, personal freedom, donations, and perceived corruption of government and business. But overall, decreasing American happiness is being driven by economic causes rather than social ones.\n“The country is mired in a roiling social crisis that is getting worse,” according to the report. “Yet the dominant political discourse is all about raising the rate of economic growth. And the prescriptions for faster growth — mainly deregulation and tax cuts — are likely to exacerbate, not reduce social tensions. Almost surely, further tax cuts will increase inequality, social tensions, and the social and economic divide between those with a college degree and those without.”\nTo fix that, the report suggests “rebuilding social capital,” with top priorities given to campaign finance reform and reducing income inequality. Other focuses should include acknowledging and moving past the “fear created by 9/11 and its memory” – the report cites President Trump’s ban on travel to the US from certain Muslim-majority countries as a “manifestation” of irrational fears gripping the nation – and improved educational quality and access.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, the Central African Republic – a landlocked country slightly smaller than Texas that’s almost the exact geographical center of Africa – was ranked last, preceded by Burundi, Tanzania, Syria and Rwanda.\n“In short, African people’s expectations that they and their countries would flourish under the self-rule and democracy appear not yet to have been met,” according to the report. “Africa’s lower levels of happiness compared to other countries of the world, therefore, might be attributed to disappointment with different aspects of development under democracy.”\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:31:43.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
