Not long ago, production kicked off on Avengers : Infinity War , and fans were quick to welcome shooting with fanfare. Stars like Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans will reprise their beloved roles for the flick which is expected to pair the Avengers with the Guardians of the Galaxy. After all, Thanos is gunning for galactic destruction, and the heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be tasked with stopping the Mad Titan. \nWith production in place, fans have learned bits and pieces about Avengers: Infinity War . Casting calls have been a sought-after source of information, and a new listing gave fans new details about the blockbuster earlier today. \nOver on Backstage.com , the site recently posted a new casting call for Avengers: Infinity War that’s filled with generic requests. A few roles appear to be meant for soldiers while another seems to be looking for someone to act as Black Widow’s body double. However, there are three specific roles requested, and the trio has nabbed lots of attention. \nYou can check out the casting calls below: Warrior Woman (Background/Extra): Female, 20-39. Athletic build, 5’9”-5’11”, waist 26-28, hips 37-39. Looking for someone with a high top fade or willing to cut hair on just the sides and wear a wig. African-American. Vikings (Background/Extra): Males & Females, 18-59. Especially looking for men with long hair & beards. Must be comfortable with fake blood and possibly special effects make-up. Caucasian. Aliens (Background/Extra): Males & Females, 18-50. Tall, slender or athletic build. Must be comfortable being painted (including on your face & any exposed body parts). All ethnicities. \nLooking at the requests, the characters seem to indicate a few familiar locations may be featured in Avengers: Infinity War . The first casting call appears to be connected to Black Panther and Wakanda as the ‘Warrior Woman’ role mostly describes members of the Dora Milaje. \nAs for the second call, the connection between ‘Vikings’ is undeniably related to Thor and Asgard. The third request for aliens is much more difficult to pin down as Thanos could force the MCU’s heroes to fight in space, but fans can’t overlook the fact that the Guardians will be in the movie. The extras could be needed to help introduce the intergalactic team or show-off the larger universe to curious minds like Bruce Banner. Excited for Infinity War ? Rank your anticipation below!
