That’s 40,000 kilometres as the crow flies. But when researchers equipped terns with satellite tracking devices, they discovered that these birds don’t take the shortest path. One individual, tracked in 2015, ended up covering close to 100,000 kilometres – equivalent to more than twice around the planet. \n“Bird enthusiasts have been ringing birds since the 1890s,” says Anders Hedenström at Lund University in Sweden. “But ringing data only tell you where birds have been recaptured. They don’t tell you what they’re up to once they’ve disappeared over the horizon.” \nThanks to lightweight trackers, we can now follow even the smallest birds on their spectacular journeys. What we’re finding along the way is amazing, says Hedenström. “In just a few years, we’ve learned more about migration strategies than from a century of ringing.” Meanwhile, mathematical modelling and molecular biology are also bringing fresh insight into why and how they do it. \nThere is still a lot to learn, but from where these birds really go and how they navigate to the tricks they use to prepare for such epic journeys, the story of avian migration is not standing still. Why bother to migrate? \nIt’s not hard to see why migratory birds leave places such as northern Europe for warmer climes like central Africa as winter draws in: why struggle through colder temperatures, shorter days and scarcer food supplies when you  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:37:19.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
