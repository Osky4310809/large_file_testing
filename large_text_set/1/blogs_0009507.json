She referred to the dossier as an “internet report,” adding that “there’s a lot of crap on the internet, as well all know.”\nConway said we can’t know for sure that this report was mentioned to President Obama and President-elect Trump in a recent intelligence briefing. “We don’t know that for a very simple reason, nobody is allowed to talk about what occurs in this intelligence briefings,” she said.\nShe refuted claims in the dossier that stated that Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen secretly traveled to Prague in August 2016 to meet with Kremlin officials. Conway said she was with the president-elect and Cohen last night and saw Cohen’s passport that proves he was not in Prague in August. In fact, she said, Cohen had traveled with his son to USC to meet with the school’s baseball coach at that time.\nConway went on to say that a lot of people in the mainstream media interfered in the election to help Hillary Clinton win and they failed.\n“On great days we were ignored and on most days we were mocked,” she said.\n–Jessica Simeone\nID: 10304767 Trump blames US Intelligence for allowing “fake news” to leak Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public.

BuzzFeed News reporters in the US and Europe have been investigating various alleged facts in the dossier but have not verified or falsified them. CNN reported Tuesday that a two-page synopsis of the report was given to President Obama and Trump.\nNow BuzzFeed News is publishing the full document so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government.\n— Ken Bensinger, Miriam Elder, Mark Schoofs\nID: 10304425 Trump’s inauguration will have “soft sensuality,” and “poetic cadence,” according to chair of committee View this image ›\nJeff Swenson / Getty Images\nID: 10304392 Top inauguration planner Tom Barrack told pool reporters on Tuesday that the event planners are focused on avoiding “a circus-like celebration” when the new president is sworn in next week.\nPool: Talking about actors… How concerned are you that you have enough performers, people to do readings, songs, all of that? Are you satisfied that you have what you need to fill the day, as it were? A typical inauguration day?\nBarrack: Overwhelmed. We’re fortunate in that we have the greatest celebrity in the world, which is the president-elect; side by side is the current president. … So what we’ve done instead of trying to surround him with what people consider A-listers is we are going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place. It’s a much more poetic cadence than having a circus-like celebration that’s a coronation. That’s the way this president-elect wanted it. I think it will be contributive. It will be beautiful. The cadence of it is going to be “let me get back to work.”\nPool: Tell us what he has told you he wants? What are some specific [things] he wants to be part of the day?\nBarrack: He really wanted it to be about the people, not about him. So his instructions to me — by the way, which is the worst job in America; he gave the best job in America to all the bright people, he gave the party to me —was to figure out how to relate 200 years of history … and couple hundred billion dollars in investments in a moment where we have to build bridges. He knows what his constituency is and he knows you need to reach out to constituencies who have questions, who have doubts. His instruction to me was the campaign is over, I am now president for all the people. I want you to build a bridge and tie them back in. I want to heal the wounds and I want to get back to work on Saturday morning.\nPool: Any new traditions?\nBarrack: It’s a delicate balance between abiding by tradition and the president-elect … having his own fingerprint on a fresh canvas. Mostly he’s abiding by tradition especially in the swearing-in ceremony. In the moment, when you look up that west Capitol entrance and that shift of power, in a moment goes from a very strong powerful man of one party to another very strong powerful man of another — that cadence and tradition of America allowing the power to change like that, it’s sacred. So he’s kept that pretty much the way it is.\n— Katherine Miller\nID: 10304398 Hispanic leaders push Trump team for a Latino cabinet pick in private meeting View this image ›\nAP\nID: 10304355 Approximately 60 Hispanic leaders met with Trump transition officials Tuesday as Sen.
