Not only is rocking these rainbow-like products just a way to solidify your status as a mythical creature, but it's an equally fun way to give any basic lip color new life.\nLime Crime , a brand known for its incredibly vibrant lip hues, has tapped into the recent trend with the release of its Diamond Crushers collection ($19 each). Now, the brand is extending the range with three new colors that will make your lips bling: Black Unicorn, a shimmering oil-slick hue; Cleopatra, a blush-toned rose gold; and Acid Fairy, an iridescent shade with flecks of lavender and mint. The brand is also launching a Black Unicorn bundle ($40) with all three colors so you don't have to worry about picking favorites.\nUnlike other recent top coat launches, Lime Crime's Diamond Crushers are not to be confused with gloss. Instead, the water-based formula functions as a topper that can be worn alone or over your favorite lipstick. Each shade promises superlong wear without drying out your pout. They are also nontransferable so you won't have to worry about your fairy dust lipstick smudging on your clothes.\nRelated:\nThese 2 Products Will Turn Your Matte Lips Metallic in Seconds\nThe exact launch date for these colors is not yet confirmed, but according to the brand website , you can expect them to drop soon. You can also sign up to be notified as soon as they are available.
