Keith Ellison, the new deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and a former supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ failed presidential primary bid, is suddenly in love with Hillary Clinton. \nIn recent weeks, Ellison has repeatedly tweeted and spoken out in support of Sanders’ former primary rival. Sanders supporters and other progressives aren’t too happy about it. Many see it as the latest in a long series of betrayals and disappointments coming out of the Democratic Party. That could be problematic for the party’s wavering efforts to reunite its liberal base with its progressive wing. \nThe Democratic Party establishment has long had a rocky relationship with progressives. While the latter criticizes the party for moving too far to the right on everything from foreign policy to the environment, the Democratic leadership counters that progressives are a bunch of purists who are incapable of compromise. \nRep. Keith Ellison ignores voters and panders to the establishment https://t.co/sxVCVqf3zt \n— OBSERVER (@observer) March 17, 2017 \nNever mind that the Democratic Party’s idea of compromise increasingly rest on the assumption that they get to do whatever they want as long as there are still a handful of issues they can point to and say, “Look, we’re not as bad as the Republicans.” If you don’t like that brand of “we get to do whatever we want and you have to accept it” compromise, well, then you’re just a stubborn and naive purist who’s helping the Republicans win. Of course. \nThings took a turn for the worst during last year’s primary, which pitted progressive folk hero Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton, a candidate many viewed as the epitome of the Democratic shift to the right via Third Way politics and the Democratic Leadership Council. The primary had all the makings of a bitter contest from the beginning, and it did not disappoint in that regard. \nThe vitriolic mudslinging began — for the most part — on social media, where Clinton and Sanders supporters gave each other no quarter. While the candidates themselves stayed above the fray to a considerable extent, their surrogates and operatives quickly got down in the mud. \nThere was the myth of the Bernie Bro , the suspicious security lapse that repeatedly exposed the Clinton campaign’s voter data to the Sanders campaign, the controversy over the Democratic National Committee allegedly rigging the primary in favor of Clinton , and then the contentious Democratic National Convention that saw Clinton officially win the party’s nomination. \nThe schism didn’t end with Clinton’s nomination. Many from the “Bernie or Bust” camp held fast in their refusal to support Clinton, despite efforts of party luminaries to unite and focus on defeating Trump. Even Sanders’ attempts to rally his supporters behind Clinton received a mixed response, with some accusing him of selling out by endorsing Clinton . \nThen the so-called Sanders Revolution entered a new phase, one that envisioned changing the Democratic Party from within. This manifest primarily through the work of Sanders’ nonprofit organization Our Revolution. The hope was that progressive candidates and politicians like Zephyr Teachout, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Keith Ellison, Sen. Cory Booker, and Rep. Raul M. Grijalva would rise to the top of the party leadership while a new wave of grassroots progressive activists would also seek elected office. \nThis plan met with some success, as progressives and “Berniecrats” took over some state Democratic parties and one a few elections. However, there has also been plenty of disappoint and disillusion. Cory Booker lost some of his progressive credentials when his vote against importing more affordable prescription drugs and his ties to Secretary of State Betsy DeVos’s lobbying efforts to drive school voucher and privatization programs began receiving more attention. Even former progressive champion Elizabeth Warren has fallen from grace in the eyes of many progressives after she refused to endorse Bernie Sanders during the primary — but then enthusiastically endorsed Clinton in the general — and remained silent on the Dakota Access Pipeline protests until it obviously became too late. \nAfter progressives faced such a grueling series of disappoints coming from the party that is supposed to represent them — and the above instances are by no means an exhaustive list — Ellison becoming the DNC chair and leading the party in a new direction was the last chance to retain or win back many Sanders supporters and progressives who’d had their fill. \nThen the Democratic Party said “Nah” yet again. If that wasn’t bad enough, Ellison responded to the party that had actively worked against both Sanders and him with a foolhardy “I’m with you!” \nEarly in the race for the DNC chair — which had been vacated by Debbie Wasserman Schultz after leaked emails suggested she had in deed tipped the scales in Clinton’s favor — Ellison was poised to earn an easy victory. He had been endorsed by Sanders, Warren, and several prominent labor unions , as well as establishment Democrats like Sen. Chuck Schumer and political icons like Rep. John Lewis . \nThe Democratic establishment, including President Obama and Vice President Biden, wasn’t having it. Obama, Biden, and others in the Democratic leadership urged former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez to run against Ellison because they feared the latter was too progressive. Perez entered the DNC race in December and quickly gained the backing of the party leaders. \nThere was still hope that Ellison could win, but he ended up losing the race for the DNC chair by a narrow margin in the second round of voting in February. As a gesture of compromise and unity, Perez quickly appointed Ellison as “deputy chair” of the DNC , the duties of which were not exactly clear. \nEllison wasted no time in rewarding the party for granting him his new title. \n“We don’t have the luxury to walk out of this room divided,” Ellison said after hugging Perez, according to a report from the New York Times . “If we waste even a moment of going at it over who supported who, we are not going to be standing up for those people.” \nSince then, Ellison has more or less fallen in line with Democratic Party elite. And progressives have noticed. \nIn a recent opinion piece for the Observer, Michael Sainato — who stridently supported Sanders during the Democratic primary — took aim at Ellison for continuing to “ Cringingly ‘Stand Up’ for Hillary Clinton .” \nSainato focused on several recent tweets issued from Ellison’s official account that praise Clinton. \nRegardless of your spin of HRC, she would never cut Meals on Wheels, CDBG, Weatherization Assistance, LIHEAP, Nat’l Endowment Arts, Big Bird https://t.co/wq681G0gYT \n— Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) March 16, 2017 \nSome of what Ellison says here may be true, but it also suggests a certain ahistoricism — intentional or otherwise — that overlooks Hillary Clinton’s political and public support of her husband and then-President Bill Clinton’s draconian “ Wellfare reform ” that cut social services to millions of Americans who were most in need. \nHonored to stand up for HRC! https://t.co/r3qpoGrTnd \n— Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) March 16, 2017 \nCan’t understand why some (thank goodness only a few) people have a bigger beef with HRC than Trump. I just don’t get it. \n— Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) March 16, 2017 \nTo be fair, Ellison’s newfound love for Clinton didn’t necessarily begin with his appointment as deputy chair. There were earlier tweets, particularly some issued during his run for the chair, that praised Clinton and rebuked her progressive retractors. \nIf You’re Liberal, You Think Clinton Is Corrupt, You’re Rewarding 25 Years of GOP Smears https://t.co/rVeNsWaerC \n— Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) December 22, 2016 \nWhile Ellison’s tweets have gotten many positive responses, it’s clear that they’ve also frustrated many progressives. \n@PJsnorkel @keithellison Too much at stake. The election was stolen from Bernie. If Demos can’t get their act straight, not voting demo. \n— The Girl Has No Name (@MM88Dominicana) March 16, 2017 \nGod lord, he’s become such a tool. @TammyKosiancic @keithellison", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:04:10.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
