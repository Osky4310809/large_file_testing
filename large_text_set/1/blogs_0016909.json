How high their cheekbones sit, or how big their eyes are, or how parallel their shoulders are to the ground, stand out as data to evaluate someone before their knowledge, wit, and big heart do. For this reason, it is assumed that those who are genetically blessed have it easier. Research does back the claim, with several studies that show that certain physical features make people more approachable and endearing. But, there is just as much research about how being good looking can act as an obstacle. The difference is that we are more open to talking about the former, because it fits with our sensibilities, than the latter. It feels shameful to talk about how what is deemed to be an advantage, can also be a hurdle. \nThis is how being attractive poses as a challenge for these twelve women: P, 29 \nI think the most difficult part of me is making male friends. I am a social person. I like meeting new people, and making new friends. But, maintaining a platonic friendship with a guy is always difficult, and has to constantly be negotiated. At some point or the other, attraction happens. Sometimes, it is reciprocated. But, often, it is not. And when that happens, I lose a friend. So, because of this, I also feel so disconnected and isolated from men in general. I would like to get to know them in a capacity other than fathers, brothers, uncles, and lovers. AA, 30 \nWomen are the harshest critics of women. And being good looking puts you in the worst spot. It is assumed that I am a bitch, and it's really sad that it comes from other women. Even other women who are gorgeous looking themselves! I am 30 now, and I have never had a gang of girlfriends, or even a best friend who's stuck around, and I feel it has something to do with how I look. Dessidre, 26 \nBeing attractive becomes troublesome when you have to wonder if someone noticed you because of your work or because of the way you look. Also, it's an issue when you view someone as a friend; but they want it to be more than that, sexually. Most men don't understand just being friends with an attractive woman. There's always an ulterior motive, to get with you. In my case, I think a lot of the attractiveness comes out in the way I talk, or laugh or generally am around people. So, it becomes a little complicated telling the professional appreciation-especially from the opposite sex-from the attractive quotient. Then, there's also the problem of not being taken as seriously because you're just another \"attractive\" showpiece who makes the team look good, pun intended. S, 26 \nPeople assume that you don't care about anything other than looking good. I like to dress up also. Make-up, hair, etc. But, if I start talking about politics, everyone is stunned, because they think how can I even know anything apart from what brand has the best mascara. This includes everyone. Even my teachers in school thought that I wanted to do well for appearances, and not because I actually liked to study. Anonymous, 27 \nChallenges toh bahut hue hain, but not because I was perceived as attractive. I guess I would say the same challenge that any woman faces... eve teasing and of course, molesting. In some rare cases, I would exchange numbers because of professional or official reasons and lo and behold it opens the doors for a flood of hello, good morning, how are you messages. But then again, I guess all women at some point have to deal with such bullshit. It's actually not being attractive, but I think Indian men just don't know how to ask a woman out and use the shittiest of methods to do so. \nOh, and also, other women giving you a full body stare. When I had the energy to dress up in college days, I used to get this stare down by other women which made me very uncomfortable. That, among many other reasons, is why I abandoned dressing up. I think it's equally violating to have women stare at you when you feel you look attractive. It kinda plays with your head, and you think that if everyone is staring at me, it must be me. SM, 33 \nThe worst is when people think that if you look good, you don't have any problems in life. There was this one man who even said it to me. I don't remember how it came up. I think I was telling him about how I am not happy with my job or something. He looked me up and down and said, exactly in these words, \"Look at you! You have nothing to worry about!\" I actually don't even know what he meant by that, but I was offended. I felt dismissed. Like my stress didn't matter as long as I looked good. KS, 34 \nThere is a myth that if you are good looking, you will not be cheated on. I believed this until my boyfriend of 4 years went ahead and slept with someone else. I used to think that I don't need to work on being a good girlfriend because I'm hot. But, when he wanted out, it forced me to become a better person. A pretty face and a good body won't get you love. It might get you a lot of great sex, but if you want to keep a relationship, you have to learn to be a loving person. So, at the age of 29, I had to spend thousands on therapy, trying to figure out where I went wrong, until I realised that I had internalised what most people think - bass ladki gori aur patli honi chahiye (a girls just needs to be fair and slim). Shivani, 36 \nKaun hai yeh jisne dobara mudh ke mujhe nahi dekha (who is that person, who didn't turn back to check me out), who is he? Attractiveness brings the Poo syndrome, I think. Anonymous, 33 \nThe past three months, I was pursued by two married men. I told the one wife about it and she got mad at me. So, I deleted both of them out of my life. I am not sure what makes married men, or any man, think that they can pursue me with such entitlement. It's as if I'm up for grabs. \nI've also been blamed for not reporting professors who tried to sleep with me. The person blaming me said, \"they did it to you, so what are you doing?\" When I asked what she meant, she said that there is something you're doing that's inviting this. I was blamed for people hitting on me in an appropriate manner. Women tend to be catty towards me, and I literally spent my life trying to get out of being judged for having an opinion. Riddhi, 23 \nMost of the times, what we think, our opinions and everything, are just not paid attention to because all you're supposed to do is look attractive, like that's your only job. So frustrating! Also, if a woman is attractive and a little friendly in general, it's a given that she's available. Ayesha, 29 \nOne issue I've had MANY times is the easy way in which men, sometimes friends, insinuate that I got a job or that I'm doing well at work because of how I look. And when I've had issues at work, sometimes people have counselled me to just use my cleavage to fix it! It's extremely regressive and annoying because when I used to have a job, I worked hard. There was this horrible meme I saw a few months ago where there was an attractive woman sitting on a sofa, with bruises on her knees and the caption said, \"Sally worked hard for her promotion.\" The fact that people keep telling attractive, impressionable young women that they can use their looks and bodies to get ahead creates a problem. Because then they think it's okay to do so, and I think it always leaves someone feeling dirty. Anonymous, 32 \nThe first job I'd applied for was for a reputed music magazine. The guy running it was quite well known in the music scene back in the day. When I walked in to his office, he displayed a sense of flamboyance and his attitude was quite boisterous and he asked me straight up if \"I'd be willing to perform favours to get this job.\" What the f***! You're anyway impressionable at that age, looking for your first job, and you genuinely work for something you love, and with someone you respect, and this is what he is?! I am still disgusted, after all these years. I won't name him. There are people out there who still worship him and his \"legacy.\" Picture Credit: Pexels", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:09:52.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
