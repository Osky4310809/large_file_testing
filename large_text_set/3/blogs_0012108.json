While not picking sides in the feud, the Golden State Warriors star took aim at the Queens rapper for what he says is an overuse of LeBron James’ name in some of her lyrics. \nOn the latest episode of Green’s “Dray Day” podcast, co-host Marcus Thompson II asked Green about Nicki Minaj’s “No Frauds” response to Remy Ma’s blistering “SHETHER” track. \nWhile Green’s initial response was one of respect for Minaj even taking a chance in responding, the tone of the conversation shifted when the lyrics of “No Frauds” were dissected. Green believes that Minaj just added her Young Money cohorts to boost interest and hide the fact she didn’t have as potent a response as needed to get back at Remy. \n“Me personally, I can’t really view it as a diss song, I can only view it as Nicki threw some shots in a song,” said Green. “Because you got Wayne on there, and I don’t even know what Wayne was talking about on there. And then you got Drake on there, they’re really just rapping.” \nGreen then took aim at the James name-dropping. \n“Is Nicki Minaj gonna mention [LeBron James] in every song?” said an exasperated Green. “Every song she’s released since June 2016, it’s something about LeBron in it. I mean LeBron is great, but Jesus Christ, at some point it just becomes too repetitive.” \nThe offending lyric Green is referencing is: “They say numbers don’t matter but when they discussin’ the kings/They turn around and say LeBron ain’t got six rings.” \nOther songs where Minaj names LeBron include DJ Khaled’s “Do You Mind” from 2016’s Major Key and DJ Mustard’s Cold Summer track “Don’t Hurt Me.” \nThompson hopped in and suggested that Minaj shouldn’t be considered a Hip Hop artist at this point, calling the response a “violation” of the order of the culture because of the “No Frauds” pop sound. \nGreen did say that he enjoys Minaj as an artist but mostly took shots at the fact she has largely left her Hip Hop roots in the past. \nCheck out the “Dray Day podcast in the link here and check out Episode 5.
