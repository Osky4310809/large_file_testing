Chief Rochas Okorocha \nOkorocha made this statement while interacting with a group of traditional rulers from the state operating under the aegis of traditional rulers in agriculture who paid him courtesy call at his residence. \nHe said: “Civil servants in the state have also been encouraged to get deeply involved in the ‘Back to Land for Agriculture’ programme of the state government. \n“The idea of traditional rulers in Imo State coming together to spearhead the fight against recession through agriculture is most welcome. \n“This is in tune with the rescue mission policy statement of back to land for agriculture which is aimed at boosting the agro-based sector of our economy and thank God, the traditional rulers are taking the initiative to the grassroots.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T10:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:45:53.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
