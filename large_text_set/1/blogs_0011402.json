'Performing is a political statement': who will play Donald Trump's inauguration? Read more \nAs the country came out of the Great Depression in 1941, box office star Mickey Rooney was reassuring, like Franklin Roosevelt. For Barack Obama in 2009, Aretha Franklin’s soulfulness chimed with his promise of change while Beyoncé illustrated excitement was still alive for his second term in 2013. \nNext Friday, the brightest star power booked so far for Donald Trump’s big day – which he insisted this week would be “elegant” and “very special” – is a teenage singer who launched a successful career after appearing on the reality TV competition America’s Got Talent. \nJackie Evancho, 16, has a bright future but perhaps lacks the name recognition of predecessors such as Ricky Martin and Jessica Simpson, who performed for George W Bush in 2001. The Beach Boys said before Christmas they were considering joining the inauguration weekend bill but have not confirmed. And so far, the biggest names linked to it are those who have declined, including Elton John, Céline Dion, Andrea Bocelli and Garth Brooks.

I want the PEOPLE!” \nBarrack said the inauguration will have a “much more poetic cadence than having a circus-like celebration that’s a coronation. That’s the way this president-elect wanted it.” \nThe distinction between a coronation and inauguration has been important to Americans ever since the founding fathers set out the inauguration rules in the constitution (all that is required is the oath). \n“It was very conscious to the people who created the constitution that they weren’t putting in a king that was then there for a lifetime,” said Harry Rubenstein , chairman of the National Museum of American History’s politics division. \nBut the first person to be inaugurated, George Washington, set the bar high for pomp and circumstance. He was the first president and a hero of the revolutionary war, and the ceremony captured the national fervor of winning independence. \nWashington’s ceremony began at his home at Mount Vernon in Virginia and went north to the then US capitol, New York City. There were bands and parties along the route , which set the national celebration tone that persists today. \n“It’s in many respects a national holiday, celebrating American traditions,” Rubenstein said. \nBut it’s also an occasion for the winning political party to celebrate its success. “It’s one party won and one party lost, and people come into town to celebrate their victory,” Rubenstein said.

Tillerson, like other cabinet picks, was grilled at Senate confirmation hearings this week as Trump continued his battles with the media and intelligence agencies. \nThe victors will also celebrate their achievements at balls and parties scheduled throughout the week. Barrack confirmed there will be three balls and a series of private dinners over the weekend but has not announced whether any celebrities would attend. A minor fuss arose over the booking of a Bruce Springsteen cover group , The B-Street Band, to play the Garden State Presidential Inaugural Gala on Thursday. The real Springsteen has been a persistent and vociferous critic of Trump. \nThe list of A-listers who have refused to perform at the main event pales in comparison to the list of stars who have said they will be protesting. \nCher, Julianne Moore and Amy Schumer are due to join the anticipated 220,000 people participating in the Women’s March on Washington , which takes place the day after the inauguration. And during the swearing-in, celebrities including Jane Fonda and Judd Apatow will be raising money for Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union through a telethon called the Love-a-thon. \nThe president-elect has also divided group performers such as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Rockettes, who are performing at the event. A choir member quit, writing a public letter last month saying performing there would be “endorsing tyranny and fascism”. And members of the Rockettes have told reporters the scheduled performance has divided the dance company. \nThis has left Evancho as the only confirmed solo act. \n“We’re going to have a very, very elegant day,” Trump said at a press conference on Tuesday. “The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special, very beautiful. And I think we’re going to have massive crowds, because we have a movement. It’s a movement like the world has never seen before. It’s a movement that a lot of people didn’t expect”.
