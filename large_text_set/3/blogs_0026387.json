File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - Interior and Local Government Secretary Ismael Sueno will meet with leaders of Congress to discuss President Duterte’s plan to appoint barangay officials without calling for local elections. \nSueno said yesterday they would seek the help of the Senate and House of Representatives regarding the proposal of the President to again postpone the barangay polls. \n“He cannot do it by decree or an executive order. It has to be by law,” Sueno said in a radio interview. \nSueno said he had discussed the matter with Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, who told him to meet with other senators on the issue of the barangay elections. \nSenate Majority Leader Vicente Sotto III said members of the majority bloc would hold a meeting today to take up the President’s proposal on the deferment of the barangay polls, which would require action by Congress. \nSotto said Pimentel called for the emergency meeting to take up the options available to Congress.   \nCongress is on a two-month break and will resume sessions on May 2. \nSueno said he plans to talk to Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez to push the President’s agenda. \n“The Speaker is close to the President, he knows what the President wants. I know Speaker Alvarez is supporting the President’s proposal,” Sueno said. \nDuterte wants to postpone anew the barangay elections set on Oct. 23 and instead appoint barangay officials. \nThe President believes that the move would stop the drug menace and corruption at the barangay level. \nSen. Leila de Lima, chair of the Senate committee on electoral reforms, opposed Duterte’s proposal to remove all incumbent barangay officials and appoint officers-in-charge in their place. \nShe said the proposal goes against the idea of barangays being non-partisan government units. \nDe Lima, who is in detention on drug charges, said the people in the barangays should have the option to choose who they want to lead them. \n“As the basic political unit in the country, the barangay serves as the frontliner in delivering basic services to the people. It offers direct and immediate assistance to the community. Barangay officials play a crucial role in providing effective and accountable local governance,” she said. \n“Appointing barangay officials, instead of electing them, goes against the principles of shielding them from partisan politics. That is one of the reasons why barangay elections are held separately from national and local polls,” she added. \nDe Lima said the barangay officials who the President said are involved in illegal drugs deserve due process. \nManila Mayor Joseph Estrada, for his part, supported the President’s proposal to postpone the barangay polls. \nDuterte can delegate the appointment of barangay captains and councilmen to the mayors, Estrada said. \n“I support the postponement of the barangay elections to stop narco-politics at the barangay level,” Estrada said. \nMeanwhile, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) is studying the implications of postponing anew the scheduled barangay polls in October. \n“What are the ramifications of another postponement? We are studying that. The barangay elections have been postponed once, and as a result the incumbent officials are sitting in a hold over capacity,” Comelec spokesman James Jimenez said. – With Marvin Sy, Sheila Crisostomo, Jose Rodel Clapano  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T10:42:22.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
