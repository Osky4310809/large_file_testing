The seventh-generation 5er, unveiled in October 2016 , will be available there initially in two CBU imported variants – the 520d Luxury and 530i M Sport. \nThe 520d is powered by a 2.0 litre turbodiesel with 190 hp at 4,000 rpm and 400 Nm of torque at 1,750 to 2,500 rpm. The oil burner is paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Status quo here. The 530i comes with a 2.0 litre turbocharged petrol engine pumping out 252 hp and 350 Nm from 1,450 to 4,800 rpm, the same motor found in our 330i LCI . An eight-speed ZF automatic transmission sends drive to the rear axle. \nThe base CBU variant, priced at 3,899,000 baht (RM496,638) comes standard with 18 inch wheels, adaptive LED headlamps, auto high beam, Dakota leather upholstery, Comfort Access, a 10.25 inch touch screen (iDrive now with gesture control), the cool new digital meter panel and the fancy Display Key that was first seen with the current 7 Series . \nThe 4,399,000 baht (RM560,352) 530i is the sportier option, as it’s in M Sport trim. The usual M Sport exterior and interior (sportier steering wheel and seats) goodies apply, along with sportier suspension and brakes, plus 19-inch double-spoke alloys in a staggered setup (245/40 front, 275/35 rear). \nAlso included are the panorama glass roof, Parking Assistant, 360 degree camera view, paddle shifters, Harman Kardon surround sound system and a wireless phone charger. \nLike in Malaysia, this is an initial imported batch for early adopters willing to pay higher prices. Thai-assembled G30s will follow. The latest 5 Series should be reaching our shores this year as well. Here’s what’s new compared to the sixth-gen F10, in video form . Full gallery after the jump. \nGALLERY: G30 BMW 5 Series Research BMW Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:51:55.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
