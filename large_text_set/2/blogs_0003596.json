Italy — House prices fell by 0.9% last year while wages grew by 2.1%. It seems that now is a good time to invest in Italian real estate. The market has been declining for almost a decade, but investors are starting to turn towards hard assets in the wake of a domestic bank crisis and uncertainty caused by Brexit. Rome. Pixabay 4. Switzerland — Property prices dropped by 0.7% in Switzerland over the last twelve months, while salaries rose by 2.5%. Despite the improving situation, properties still do not come cheap: the median asking price for single-a family home last year was single-family homes was £970,000 ($1.2 million).

House prices have fallen in Greece for the past seven years as the country grapples with a huge government-debt crisis which has driven down wages, pushed up unemployment, and killed buyer sentiment — apartments in Athens currently sell for as little as £20,000 ($25,000).

The recent sharp decline in home prices in some of the country’s hotspot cities suggests that the affordability gap is closing considerably quicker in comparison to other international regions.
