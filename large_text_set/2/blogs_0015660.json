Lord Mandelson \nE urosceptic MPs accompanied the Bill after it cleared the House of Commons 10 days ago. However it is unusual for Cabinet ministers to go in person to listen to peers’ debates. \nThe MPs will be hoping that they can be a visible reminder to the unelected peers of the will of the people after the country voted to leave the EU. \nJust over 190 peers are due to debate the Brexit Bill – 80 today and 110 tomorrow – in a sitting running late into the evening.

Baroness Evans of Bowes Park \nL ady Evans will urge peers not “try and shape the terms of our exit, restrict the Government’s hand before it enters into complex negotiations or attempt to rerun the referendum”. \nShe will say: “In May 2015 a Conservative Government was elected with a clear manifesto commitment to 'negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU', to 'ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave' and, to 'honour the result of the referendum, whatever the outcome.' \n“The Government has delivered on these commitments. This House passed a Bill to deliver a referendum – without placing conditions on the result. On 23rd June 2016, the British people delivered their verdict. This Bill is not about revisiting that debate.\" Brexit | European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill \n“This Bill is not the place to try and shape the terms of our exit, restrict the Government’s hand before it enters into complex negotiations or attempt to rerun the referendum. \n“This Bill is the beginning of a process and a discussion we will be having in this House and the other place for several years to come.\" \n“Views have been expressed over what might be expected from this House as we scrutinise this Bill. Some have asserted that it will ignore the referendum result and seek to use this Bill to frustrate the process of leaving the EU.

I am confident that Noble Lords will take a constructive approach.” \n“I also know that Noble Lords respect the primacy of the elected House and the decision of the British people on 23rd June last year.” \nL ord Mandelson, a former Labour Cabinet minister, yesterday told the Andrew Marr Show peers to defy the Government and not “throw in the towel early”. \nHe was not scheduled to be speaking in the House of Lords but is understood to have replaced another speaker this morning.
