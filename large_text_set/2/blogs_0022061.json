I moved here when I was 21, ready to pursue my post-graduation in the city, and be a part of the glitz and glamour. Today, even after 10 years when my cab goes past the famous Marine Drive, I tend to look out to the city (on days when there is no traffic blocking my view) and I can still feel the butterflies I felt when I had just shifted base. The thrill of moving to a city where not many people knew me, where I had zero friends, and no past whatsoever was beautiful. However, what was even more amazing was the sense of belonging I felt for the two cities - the one I came from, and the one I moved to. \nMy hometown, Baroda (or Vadodara to be politically correct) in Gujarat, is a small, homely, and traditional place. We grew up with lots of space, amidst many relatives and a whole lot of freedom. Moving to Mumbai meant keeping that sense of freedom, but sacrificing the need for open spaces (hello 1BHK homes), and also a huge sense of loneliness as everyone went about living their own lives. Where my first home was traditional, my adopted one was more cosmopolitan. But, even today, I love the sense of belonging that comes from the two cities; both are extremely different but both are beautiful, nonetheless. \nThis, for me, is clearly one of the best things about moving cities. If you've grown up in one place and you spend the rest of your life is another, there is always this beautiful sense of connect that you feel, which probably doesn't come from staying in the same city all your life. Each time I go back home, I feel like I am going back to my roots, meeting people I've known for a lifetime, having comforting conversations, and each time I come back to Mumbai, my sense of belonging here gets renewed. Of knowing that I wasn't really a part of this city, but I've struggled and made my space, makes my second home all the more endearing and charming. \nAnother great thing is the freedom you get to discover for yourself, and also stay connected with who you really are. I can honestly say that I am a different person in my hometown and in the city, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I am more relaxed, less alert, and also more of an introvert when I am at home. I only talk to the people I like, I am super sheltered and less experimental. While in the city, I am this slightly crazy person running around, fighting with auto walas, talking to new people, and just putting myself in new situations each day. \nI love it, and I wouldn't trade this feeling of being connected to two different places, to two different ways of life, for anything.
