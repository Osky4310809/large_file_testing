But if they come in, we want to say, what websites do they visit, and give us your passwords. So we can see what they do on the internet.\" \n\"If they don't want to cooperate, then they don't come in\" to the United States, he said. \nKelly stressed that no decision had been made on this, but said tighter screening was definitely in the future, even if it means longer delays for awarding US visas to visitors. \n\"These are the things we are thinking about,\" he said. \n\"But over there we can ask them for this kind of information and if they truly want to come to America, then they will cooperate. If not, next in line.\" \nThe seven countries were targeted in president Donald Trump's January 27 immigrant and refugee ban order, which has sense been at least temporarily blocked under court order. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
