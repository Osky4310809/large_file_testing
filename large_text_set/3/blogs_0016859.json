Here’s how everyone’s doing in the real world. 2 \nPeter Ostrum (Charlie Bucket) \nOstrum was just a middle school kid performing plays when he got the role of the classic 1971 film. He called it a whirlwind. “It was sort of like being an exchange student for five months,” he said about his time filming in Munich. He did enjoy working on the film, but realized that acting wasn’t for him. He even turned down a three-picture deal from the studio. He even used to lie and say his brother was the one who performed the role. “Acting was fine,” he said, “but I wanted something more steady, and the key is to find something that you love doing, and that’s what my profession has given to me.” \nSo what was his true calling? Animal care, since he’s now a veterinarian. 3 Cindy Ord/Getty Images \nParis Themmen (Mike Teevee) \nThemmen is still in the performance industry, just not in front of the screen. He now works as a casting director for commercials. After Wonka , Themmen worked on broadway before taking a break from acting at 14 to “just be a kid.” He went to NYU and got his BFA in theater. \nAfter he graduated Themmen started traveling, going to at least 40 countries. He founded Access International, a travel company that sends backpackers on charter flights to Europe. He dabbled in real estate, retail, financial consulting and film production before settling down with his casting job. He even worked as a Disney Imagineer. \nHe’s had a few roles since the movie, such as a small part on Star Trek: Voyager and a ‘featured extra’ role in The Big Lebowski. (he’s in the bowling alley and the title sequence). 4 Cindy Ord/Getty Images \nJulie Dawn Cole (Veruca Salt) \nCole did a little more acting after Willy Wonka , most notably appearing on Angel and the soap Emmerdale . She went on to be a fitness trainer, but now she’s a psychotherapist at a hospice for families and children suffering from illnesses and she really enjoys it. \nShe stays true to Veruca Salt, however. She wrote a book called I Want It Now! A Memoir of Life on Set of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in 2011, keeps up with several social media accounts and makes regular convention appearances. 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T12:05:24.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
