Philadelphia is sending Nerlens Noel to Dallas for Justin Anderson and a first-round draft pick, league sources tell @TheVertical . \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 23, 2017 Dallas center Andrew Bogut will go to the 76ers in the Noel trade too, league source tells @TheVertical . \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 23, 2017 \nJahlil Okafor had been the 76ers big man most involved in trade rumors leading up to the deadline, but Philadelphia moved the more versatile Noel instead. He is averaging 8.9 points, 5.0 rebounds and 0.9 blocks in his third NBA season. He didn’t play the first year after he was drafted because he was recovering from a knee injury. \nAnderson averaged just 6.5 points in 51 games for the Mavericks this season, starting two. Bogut has started 21 of the 26 games he’s played in and is averaging 3.0 points and 8.3 rebounds. Obviously, the draft pick is the key to the deal for the 76ers. Bogut, 32, would not figure to be in Philadelphia’s long-term plans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:45:10.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
