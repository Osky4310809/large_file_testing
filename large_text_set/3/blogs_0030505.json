At first I thought it might be because she didn’t want to play a game that involved putting chips up her nose, but it wasn’t, it was because we showed an old school picture of her and she didn’t like it.”\n“She didn’t tell me, but she said to one of the producers, ‘I’m not happy, I have clearance on all my pictures, I’m not happy you showed that.’ She could’ve just said, ‘Keith I have to go, I’m meeting a friend’, but no, she just stormed without even saying sorry.”\nAnd despite the 49-year-old’s strop, Keith made sure the show went on.\n“We were all shocked, but we were dancing at that time so we just laughed and waved. There’s so much worse we do to people on ‘Juice’ so I’m really surprised that’s what made her walk. I might make it a new thing from now on though, have someone pick up a fur stole and walk off each week.”\nBut while Pamela claimed she was upset about the picture, Keith has his own theory behind her sudden exit.\n“Maybe she needed a poo and she ran off because she didn’t wanna poo herself on telly? So made that excuse.”\nHe added: “She’s a lovely woman, she’s been on three times, I’m sure I’ll see her again and she’ll explain everything.”\n  WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:25:52.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
