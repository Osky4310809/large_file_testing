She wrote: “What if women marched around Inauguration Day en masse?” Now more than 200,000 people have indicated that they plan to attend. (You can register yourself here .) On January 21, the day after Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, they will gather to march in what is expected to be the largest demonstration linked to Trump’s inauguration. \nEarly on, there were a few highly publicized derailments with the planning—including concern that the founding participants were all white women ; unhappiness with the original name, which many felt ripped off an African-American women’s march held in Philadelphia in 1997 ; and a permit issue . They have all since been resolved with the introduction of diverse, experienced leadership and some subsequent branding changes. \nDespite these setbacks, for many the march feels like a place where they can channel their energy toward something good that they hope will get noticed and result in some kind of change. According to the organizers, their message is: “We are watching you, President-Elect Trump, United States House of Representatives, and Senate. We are an organized group that intends to hold the U.S. government accountable for your leadership and decisions that will impact all Americans. We hope that women and men will join together to rally in Washington, D.C.” \nFor those who are planning to make the pilgrimage to D.C., we’ve outlined what you need to know. The below covers everything from how to get there and where you can stay to what to wear and what to bring—we’ve even addressed what you can do if marching isn’t possible. \nWhen is it? The march will be held on January 21. It will start at 10:00 a.m. EST and end at 5:00 p.m. Sister/solidarity marches will also take place in every state and several other countries. \nWhy is this happening? According to the march organizers, the demonstration—note it’s not being dubbed a protest—isn’t actually anti-Trump in essence. It is, however, a response to the comments about women, minorities, and other groups that were made by the president-elect during the campaign. It’s for any person, regardless of gender or gender identity, who believes women’s rights are human rights. \nWho is going? Gloria Steinem and Harry Belafonte are serving as honorary cochairs. Planned Parenthood, UniteWomen.org, Girls Who Code, Amnesty International, Sierra Club, and many, many more organizations and groups are partners—and celebrities including Cher, Scarlett Johansson , Chelsea Handler, Hari Nef, Zendaya , Amy Schumer , and Olivia Wilde , to name a few, have said they plan on attending or staying involved. \nHow do I get there? Many people are traveling via buses coordinated by local organizing groups in each state. Updated info about transportation from each state is available via email, Facebook, and state websites. Most states have organizers that can help answer questions and facilitate group travel via buses or carpools. Marchmatch.org is another place people can go for transportation assistance. Skedaddle , a website and app that allows you to start or join rides in professionally driven vehicles to any destination, is also helping women get to the march. \nWhere can I stay? Many hotels in the D.C. area are either booked up or incredibly expensive—but there are still vacancies a few miles away in Arlington, Virginia. Use Expedia to search for listings—the Courtyard Marriott Alexandria Pentagon South and the Residence Inn Marriott Arlington Courthouse show vacancies as of press time. Tripping.com also has suggestions. \nWhere will the march start and where will it go? An official route has not been released as of yet for security reasons, but as of right now, it’s looking like people will gather at the intersection of Independence Avenue and Third Street S.W., near the U.S. Capitol. The walk will probably follow Independence Avenue toward the Washington Monument. \nWhat do I wear? It’s likely going to be very cold and very crowded. Dress in layers and wear comfortable shoes you can walk in for long periods of time. Information on what size bag (if any) and whether or not you should pack snacks and water is not available from march organizers as of yet, but we’ll continue to update this post as we find out more. \nShould I bring my children? The decision as to whether or not you should bring your kids is a personal one, and only you know best. On the one hand, if your child is old enough, this could be an amazing experience for him or her to witness and be a part of, but on the other, there will be lots of walking and there could be limited access to bathrooms. According to organizers, there will be Porta-Potties set up along the route, but you never know what the lines will be like—so keep all of this in mind when weighing the options. For more information on marching with children, you can visit this Facebook page set up for parents planning on attending. \nHow can I stay up to date? You can follow along on Instagram , via Twitter , and sign up for the demonstration’s newsletter. \nHow can I help if I can’t go? Organizers are hoping to raise $2 million to pay for the march. You can donate money or buy T-shirts to lend financial help if you’re unable be there on the ground but want to be there in spirit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:50:18.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
