By Wesley Yin-Poole Published 25/01/2017 \nMovie director Kevin Smith is in the next Call of Duty DLC. \nReally. \nActivision put out a trailer for the 90s-themed Rave in the Redwoods, the next chapter in the Zombies portion of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, and at the end the brains behind the likes of Chasing Amy, Mallrats and Clerks turns up with a machine gun and a line of dialogue. \nHere's the official blurb for the DLC: After escaping the terrifying Zombies in Spaceland, our heroes are transported to an abandoned campground... the perfect site for Willard Wyler's next horror masterpiece. Set in the '90s, the four actors find themselves in brand new roles, along with some fresh new threads. Together, they'll team up to take on endless hordes of raver zombies and the mysterious Slasher, who's on the prowl to add more \"trophies\" to his collection. With the help of some brutal new weapons and even director Kevin Smith (!), our heroes just might be able to put an end to the madness in the Redwoods. \nThere you go. Kevin Smith is in COD. What a time to be alive. \nRave in the Redwoods arrives first on PlayStation 4 on 31st January 2017 as part of the Sabotage DLC pack.
