A very specific style. \nThe 24-year-old actress, daughter of the late Carrie Fisher , posted on her Instagram page Saturday a photo of her Scream Queens co-star and rumored boyfriend cuddling in matching lamb onesies. \n\"Happy birfday to my #numberonesie ,\" she wrote . Photos \nDebbie Reynolds & Carrie Fisher's Mother-Daughter Moments \nThe two, who play love interests on Scream Queens , have not commented on the nature of their relationship. They first sparked real-love romance rumors in early December after co-star Keke Palmer posted a photo of the two making out on Snapchat . \nLautner had over the past few weeks supported Lourd throughout her grief as she dealt with the losses of her mother and grandmother, actress Debbie Reynolds , who died within one day of each other in December. \nThe actresses were honored with a joint funeral last month. Lautner accompanied Lourd at the service. A week later, the two vacationed together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. \nShe had last month posted on her Instagram page a photo of her with friends, all dressed in animal onesies . She tagged several people, including Lautner and stepfather Bruce Bozzi , who is married to her dad Bryan Lourd , Fisher's ex. \n\"This group of onesie clad supremely supportive humans (and many others #notpicturedbutinthepicture) are the kings and queens of my world #gratefulfortheirgreatness #friendsfindingthefunny,\" Billie wrote.
