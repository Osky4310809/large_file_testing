In addition, the company stated that it would clearly label GMO ingredients in those products that contain them, “independent of actions taken (or not) by the federal government.” Consumer Demand Is Challenging the Dairy Industry \nIt’s a major step forward that is indeed a sign of changing consumer attitudes and an attempt to protect itself from steep losses facing competitors, like General Mills, which sells yogurts under the Yoplait, GoGurt, Annie’s and Liberté brands. \nTotal retail yogurt sales in the U.S. fell by 17 percent in the fiscal second quarter results reported in December 2016, 3 but General Mills’ brands, in particular, have underperformed because they’ve failed to respond to consumer demands. \nWith no organic options until recently and a large offering of “light” and “low-calorie” yogurts that are quickly falling out of favor with Americans, president and chief operating officer Jeff Harmening acknowledged fundamental shifts would be necessary to “give customers what they want from their yogurt,” 4 which is more natural, grass-fed and organic varieties. \nEven with a switch to non-GMO ingredients, conventional yogurt leaves much to be desired. It’s far too high in sugar and/or artificial sweeteners to be healthy, and most of the milk comes from cows living in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) instead of on pasture, which negatively changes its nutritional value. \nNot to mention, most of it is pasteurized. Truly healthy yogurt is organic, unsweetened and made from raw 100 percent grass-fed milk, which is difficult to find commercially (although yogurt made from organic, grass-fed milk is becoming more popular). \nThat being said, I applaud Dannon for its forward-thinking pledge to get GMOs out of its primary yogurt brands. Not surprisingly, however, Big Dairy does not. Industrialized Dairy Takes Aim at Dannon’s GMO-Free Pledge \nIndustry groups including the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) and American Sugarbeet Growers lashed out at Dannon for their non-GMO pledge. \nGenetically engineered (GE) feed dominates the industrial dairy industry, despite mounting concerns that it’s not safe for people or the environment. \nIn addition to risks from the genetic engineering itself, glyphosate , the active ingredient in Roundup herbicide, is used in large quantities on GE glyphosate-tolerant crops (i.e., Roundup Ready varieties). \nGlyphosate in animal feed has been found to sicken farm animals , with farmers noting correlations between glyphosate in animal feed and rates of miscarriage, deformities in piglets and infertility among the animals. \nMeanwhile, plants treated with the chemical show severe damage to root growth, not to mention that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen. \nDannon noted that a reduction in the usage of herbicides and pesticides is one goal they hope to achieve through their changes in sustainable agricultural practices (including the move toward non-GMO feed). 5 \nAlthough Dannon said they believe currently approved GMOs are safe, they said the growing consumer preference for non-GMO ingredients prompted their decision. \nNone of this seemed to matter to the industry groups, who called Dannon’s intention to switch to a GMO-free feed for its dairy cows, giving the American public what they want, “a tipping point.” Randy Mooney, chair of the U.S. National Milk Producers Federation, said in a conference call with reporters: 6 \n“ When something is out there that is outrageously wrong, all of us are going to have to speak up and attack it … If this isn’t addressed, we’re going to see a radical change in how food and feed is produced in this country.” \nBut isn’t that precisely the point? The industry groups continued in a letter to Dannon: 7 \n“In our view your pledge amounts to marketing flimflam, pure and simple … It appears to be an attempt to gain lost sales from your competitors by using fear-based marketing and trendy buzzwords, not through any actual improvement in your products.” \nDannon, in turn, fired back at the accusations in a news release, stating: 8 \n“We were surprised to receive a divisive and misinformed letter about our efforts to continue to grow America’s enjoyment of dairy products, including yogurt … \nWe believe there is growing consumer preference for non-GMO ingredients and food in the U.S. and we want to use the strong relationships we have with our farmer partners to provide products that address this consumer demand.” Drastic Changes in How Food Is Produced, Including Dairy, Are Desperately Needed \nPart of Dannon’s pledge included a promise to provide a fixed profit margin to its farmer partners supplying milk, which is newsworthy in itself since the price of milk is now so low that an average-sized dairy farm in Vermont (about 125 cows) is operating at a loss of $100,000 a year. \nIt’s gotten so bad that farmers in Vermont only get about $14 for 11.6 gallons of milk, which cost about $22 to produce. So they’re essentially paying about $8 to sell 11.6 gallons of milk. 9 It’s economic exploitation, VT Digger Visit Site", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:37:37.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
