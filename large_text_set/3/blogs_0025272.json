It is so worth the trip! ADVERTISEMENT \nDepending on the menu cycle, the oysters are served two ways: fresh on a half shell with four sauces (Nobu Hot Sauce, Maui Onion, Ponzu and Nobu Salsa), or New Style (freshly-shucked, lightly seared in hot sesame and olive oil) with garlic, chives and sesame seeds. \nOther offerings I can’t resist are the seabass jalapeño and the playfully prepared sushi and sashimi creations of the day, by Japanese Sushi chef Kirika Oi. \nMy son Diego feasts on the beef and chicken kushi (skewers) from the Teppan Station. I am, on the other hand, a big fan of the sinful chicken skin kushi. But not to worry, there are healthier options: Salmon Belly, Baby Octopus, Squid, Eggplant, Shiitake Mushroom and Leek, along with various sauces to excite the palate: Teriyaki, Wasabi Pepper and Anticucho. \nAnother must-savor (available a la carte) is the Nobu signature Halo-Halo, a refined and sophisticated take on the Filipino classic. \nI was told that chef Nobu Matsuhisa fell in love with Hawaiian shaved ice, so much so that he has a shaved ice dessert in every Nobu restaurant around the world, each one interpreted to suit the local palate. \nIn Manila, his rendition consists of Fiji Water Snow, Yuzu Gelée, Green Tea Crisps, Sweet Bean, Leche Flan, Freshly Made Mochi Rolled in Toasted Coconut and Sesame Seeds, Sweet Condensed Milk, Ube Ice Cream and a drizzling of Kuromitsu Syrup (dark Japanese molasses). \nThe complexity, the play of textures and the twist of flavors are due to the masterful combination, the ingenious mixing and matching of ingredients. \nNew to the carving station this month is the Roasted Aromatic Pork Belly (marinated in salt crushed pepper, onion, lemon grass and cinnamon bark) by Nobu Manila’s head chef, Filipino-American Mike de Jesus. It is paired with two dipping sauces—Asian-style dipping sauce (soy sugar, chili and calamansi) and Sinamak—and served with Beef Fried Rice. \nThough I have not sampled the belly, it is something I look forward to tasting next time. Prepared the Nobu way, I am certain there is something out of the ordinary about it. \nCall 8008080.

A delightful dish in every bite—hot, cold, crisp, sweet, sour, fruity, and perfumed with basil and cilantro. And so easy to eat that one tilapia is not enough. \nXO 46 Heritage Bistro has branches in S’Maison, Century City Mall and SM Aura. \nSummer coolers \nCoffee, cocktail and beverage consultant Mike Canlas shares some refreshing drink recipes. \nBanana-Nut Breakfast smoothie \n50 g roasted almonds or cashews \n¼ cup instant oats", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:11:43.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
