The patch is among the game’s most feature-packed, bringing a number of big improvements and changes. \nThe two biggest features are the Armory, and the crafting material storage. The Armory allows you to save up to five different builds per character. Each build will keep track of everything it includes, such as as socketed gems, skills, as well as Kanai’s Cube powers. The Armory can be found at the different town hubs. \nWhat’s more, when you equip any of your saved builds, the game will automatically swap the necessary gear and items between the character stash and the inventory. \nThe crafting mat storage is basically a one-stop storage for any of the crafting materials you obtain. This frees up space in the shared stash by automatically assigning them to a separate menu. \nThere’s also a new item type called Primal Ancients for players who finished their Season journey, and managed to find all the gear needed for their build. Blizzard says these items give high-level players something to work towards. Primal Ancients are also available for regular characters gaining Paragon levels. \nIn short, Primal Ancients are items guaranteed to come with Ancient-level stats, and the maximum number of sockets. They can only be found after reaching Greater Rift 70 solo with at least one of your characters. \nThe patch notes include changes to Adventure Mode, some quality of life fixes, and more. Hit the link for the rest. Patch 2.5.0 also brings Seasons to consoles, though the first console Season won’t start until March 31 . \nFor now, you can spend the time getting acquainted with the new features and learning all the Season tricks you can from the PC players who’ve been at it for a while.
