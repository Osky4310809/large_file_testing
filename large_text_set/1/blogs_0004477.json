Never mind that a continent away, the two nations are hardly on the best of terms. In August, Paraguay recalled its ambassador to Venezuela and proclaimed a freeze in diplomatic relations . But in an unassuming storefront in the shadow of the elevated train in Woodside, Queens, there is harmony. So Venezuelan arepas, airy corn cakes barely a finger’s width thick, may share the table with Paraguayan chipas — dense, bulging curls of cassava flour and cornmeal fattened by cheese, eggs, milk and butter and looking like lopsided bagels. Chipa tastes like a gougère after a gravitational collapse, but little pops of anise cool the mouth and lend a curious leavening effect. Zuny Llano, who grew up in Asunción, Paraguay, opened the restaurant in October with her husband, Augusto Acevedo, a native of Caracas, Venezuela. Although its menu celebrates both their heritages, its name belongs to hers: Karu means “to eat” in Guaraní, the indigenous language spoken throughout Paraguay by peasants and aristocrats alike and declared equal to Spanish by the Constitution, defying the legacy of the conquistadors. (The poet Ramón Silva noted that Guaraní is “the perfect language for verbally disemboweling an adversary.”) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Llano recruited her half brother, Abel Amarilla, to make the food of their youth: sturdy chipa, the Paraguayan daily bread, and chipa guazu, velvety with corn kernels, puréed and whole, and as ready to surrender as a soufflé. Mbeju, a flat round of cassava flour and cornmeal infiltrated by cheese, is quickly sealed together in a pan without a touch of oil, its surface a golden craquelure, crisp giving way to melt. For arepas, Mr. Acevedo turned to his sister, Lucy Acevedo. Her cakes are delicate, caught between crunch and tenderness, bearing the earthy scent of corn cooked and ground into flour. (Pre-Columbian Venezuelans would soak the kernels, or chew them, until soft enough to mash into dough.) Follow NYT Food's board Hungry City Reviews on Pinterest. Slit open, the arepas arrive with gaping mouths, stuffed with pernil, pork steeped overnight in orange juice, white wine and beer and roasted to dishevelment, or caraotas negras, black beans simmered until close to ink, under a fringe of pale Monterey Jack cheese. A filling of shredded chicken, mayonnaise and a tickle of lime is called reina pepiada (curvaceous queen), a name bestowed in 1955 in homage to the first Venezuelan Miss World. (Although if ermined in cheese, it’s called sifrina: snooty girl.) Empanadas, Mr. Amarilla’s territory, emerge with beautifully fragile crusts and leave no telltale oil stains on the fingers. For the insides, whole corn kernels, still sweet, are folded in with mozzarella and béchamel; chicken and beef are cooked unhurriedly in a cumin-laced stew, then coarsely ground, so they keep their succulence and texture. What makes the empanadas Paraguayan are littered nubs of hard-boiled egg, layered for extra richness. “My husband says, ‘You Paraguayans always add egg in every single meal,’” Ms. Llano recalled. “He’s right.” To cook here, Mr. Amarilla left behind a restaurant in Málaga, Spain, and Ms. Acevedo a restaurant in Richmond, Va. They brought their families with them: Mr. Amarilla’s wife watches over the floor, while Ms. Acevedo’s daughter waits tables and offers cheerful exegeses on the origins of the food. All but two members of the staff are family. Larger plates include a plank of filet mignon roughly the dimensions of a legal-size manila envelope, pounded flat and sheathed in breading, craggy and rumpled, like a cocoon the steak can’t wait to shed. This may be accompanied by ensalada rusa, a version of the Russian Salad Olivier mysteriously beloved throughout South America, with peas, carrots and potatoes suspended in mayonnaise. Better is pabellón criollo, Venezuela’s national dish — caraotas negras, white rice, ripe plantains shining and sweet from the pan, and carne mechada, beef braised and undone, teased out into dark tresses. For Ms. Llano, the Paraguayan mainstay is sandwich de lomito: filet mignon cut thin and grilled with nothing but salt, anchoring an architecture of ham, lettuce, tomato, mozzarella well on its way to ooze and the requisite egg, here fried gently and lazily leaking its yolk. The bread, from a neighborhood Latin bakery, is looming and nearly as buoyant as brioche, but cushions rather than overwhelms. \nAdvertisement “This is our burger,” Ms. Llano said, and I wondered: Why not everyone’s?
