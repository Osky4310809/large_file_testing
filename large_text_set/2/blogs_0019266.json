Night Shyamalan, is having a career renaissance thanks to the reception for his latest film, Split , and his television series, Wayward Pines , which nurtured the talents of Stranger Things creators, the Duffer Brothers.\nHe hopes to keep that momentum going with his latest foray in television that is near and dear to many people’s hearts – especially if you’re an ’80s baby – which comes in the form of an updated imagining of horror anthology, Tales From the Crypt , which ran on HBO from 1989-1996.\nAlthough the above trailer is light on action, a longer featurette featuring Shymalan explains the upcoming TNT series more in-depth.\nThe Cryptkeeper and a 10-episode anthology series will debut sometime later this year.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:33:02.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
