A backyard breeder has one goal in mind: profit. They do not care about the health and well-being of the animals trapped in their care. If the animal is going to make them a profit, then they are quickly sold or kept for a miserable life of forced breeding. If the animal is not considered profitable, they are immediately discarded as worthless. The latter is what happened with Boogie the Teacup Chihuahua in Palm Springs, California. \nAside from his utterly adorable face and oversized pointy ears, the first thing the shelter noticed about the tiny pup was his constant wobbling and shaking. The poor thing was unable to stand still or walk without falling and rolling over. Concerned, the kindhearted people at PAWsitive rescue took him to the veterinarian to be examined. Sadly, baby Boogie was diagnosed with a serious neurological disorder that has permanently affected his nervous system. Luckily for this brave little warrior, his foster parents fell in love with him and decided to keep him as a member of their pack. \nBoogie is just one heartbreaking example of why irresponsible breeding is wrong. With profit at the forefront for puppy mills, inbreeding and neglect of animals’ health and wellness run rampant. If you are considering adding a new pet into your life, please remember this story of Boogie and adopt, don’t shop . Want to read more posts like this?
