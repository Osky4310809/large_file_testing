PRICE: $26 million \nYOUR MAMA’S NOTES: Earlier this week the busy-beaver property gossips at the L.A. Times reported that movie industry mandarin Steven Spielberg sold his oceanfront compound along Malibu’s rapidly eroding and hence oxymoronically named Broad Beach in an off-market deal for $26 million to an unnamed buyer. The children may recall that Yours Truly let the cat out of the bag about this then still-pending deal back in early June, but at that time we quite incorrectly heard from Fanny Flapjaw that word on the PCH real estate street was that the price was expected to be “somewhere around $35 million.” Anyhoo, property records show the two-parcel spread, which comprises 1.41 acres per the L.A. County Tax Man, was acquired in two separate but contiguous transactions, one for $21 million and the other for $5 million. Both parcels were purchased by the same L.A.-based corporate concern that inexhaustible real estate yenta Yolanda Yakketyyak swears and digitally accessible resources confirm is registered to Beverly Hills-based real estate tycoon Steve Gozini. \nThe nine-bathroom compound, which Mister Spielberg put up for lease the last few summers at a rate of up to $150,000 per month, comprises a 7,237-square-foot shingled main residence described in rental listings as “Craftsman” in style. Spacious public rooms open the main floor to a wind-protected courtyard with swimming pool and/or roomy ocean side terraces. The multiwinged main residence’s seven bedrooms include a second-floor master with oceanside terrace, a massage room and private library. Naturally, the property includes a state-of-the-art movie theater as well as a detached two-bedroom guesthouse. Other Hollywood folk who own homes along Broad Beach include Pierce Brosnan, Steven Levitan, Dustin Hoffman, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, and Ray Romano. \nMister Gozini, probably not a household name unless commercial real estate is a hot dinner-table topic in your own home, has long owned a 10,000-plus-square-foot mansion in Brentwood, just a half of a dozen or so mansions down the street from the infamous and long ago razed and replaced O.J. Simpson residence. We also found plenty of evidence that another corporate entity we easily linked to Mister Gozini owns another glassy oceanfront home in Malibu on another celeb-lined street that lays claims to more than 100 feet of beach frontage. The seven-bedroom contemporary was owned by luxury handbag designer Tyler Alexandra — her daddy is the late and lauded fashion designer and brand licensing potentate Perry Ellis — until 2007, when she sold it for $16.5 million and, as it turns out, is currently for rent at $150,000 per month. \nListing photos: The Agency", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:24:22.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
