(David Criggeru/The Bristol Herald-Courier via AP) \nLEBANON, Va. (AP) â€” Now, that's a lot of change. \nA Virginia man used 300,000 pennies to pay sales tax on two cars at the Department of Motor Vehicles. \nThe Bristol Herald Courier reports that Nick Stafford delivered five wheelbarrows full of change, mostly pennies, at the DMW office in Lebanon, Virginia, on Wednesday. The coins weighed in at 1,600 pounds. \n[ NEWS OF THE DAY: Bush Twins to Obama Daughters: 'We'll Be Rooting for You' ] \nStafford said he paid in coins to \"inconvenience\" the DMV. \nStafford was upset because he was unable to find out the direct number to the Lebanon DMV until filing a Freedom of Information Act request. He later sued the state because he says he was denied direct phone numbers to other DMV offices in his area. \nStafford ended up filing three lawsuits, which were dismissed Tuesday. \n___ \nInformation from: Bristol Herald Courier, http://www.bristolnews.com \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press .
