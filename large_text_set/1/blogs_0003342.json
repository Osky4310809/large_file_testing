These renderings by RBA Design Studio depict just that, although a next-generation Ertiga isn’t expected to appear any time soon. \nWith the Swift’s face transplanted onto the Ertiga, the LED-headlamps, trapezoidal-shaped grille and U-shaped lower section are all here, with the latter hosting not just fog lamps but also LED positioning lights. \nThe “new” Ertiga continues to retain its familiar profile, although just like the hatchback, the C-pillar has been partly blacked out to create a “floating roof” look. A camera located on the underside of the wing mirrors is also seen here, along with new alloy wheels. As for the rear, the taillights have been restyled as two-piece units, and the chrome trim between them is removed. \nEngine options will likely be expanded to include a D13A 1.3 litre DDiS turbodiesel paired with a SHVS (Smart Hybrid Vehicle by Suzuki) system, which is being suggested for the current Ertiga sold in the Indonesian market. Petrol options will also be made available, with the new K10C 1.0L Boosterjet (102 PS/150 Nm) providing more power than the 1.4L K14B mill (92 PS/130 Nm). \nShould the next-gen Ertiga continue to be based on the stretched Swift platform, it should also benefit from the weight-savings enjoyed by the hatchback in its latest iteration. What are your thoughts on these renderings of the next-generation Ertiga? Do you prefer it to the current model being sold by Proton here?
