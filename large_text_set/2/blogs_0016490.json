The takeout restaurant with fresh-squeezed juice, gluten-free kale ravioli, fish tacos, and “healthy” frosting shots will debut as part of the newest, biggest Tracy Anderson Studio in conjunction with Maria Baum , at 241 East 59th Street. Though Tracy Anderson is a members-only fitness and lifestyle kind of place, the cafe is open to the public. \nFrom the release: “Following the opening of her flagship studio, Tracy Anderson will release a fully prepared meal program available for pick-up at the 3 Green Hearts cafe, and in coming months serviced with local delivery in New York City. Each meal is designed as a healthy, fresh and organic option with weight loss and weight management plans available.” By the way, studio membership is $900 a month, which includes unlimited Tracy Anderson Method classes, custom programming, discounts on retail, and the 3 Green Hearts cafe. \n— FloFab gives an update of Mads Refslund’s Fire and Ice (the restaurant), slated to open the end of 2017 on North 11th Street, across from Brooklyn Brewery in Williamsburg. “The thought is to permit more interaction between the kitchen and the customers, with diners eating in the kitchen. The concept behind the menu, he said, will be ‘fire and ice’ for raw seafood and dishes cooked in a fire pit,” she wrote. In the meantime, founder of Noma in Copenhagen and the former chef at Acme, Refslund will be guest-cheffing at Gitano Tulum in Mexico. \n— “The restaurant life gets in your blood, and you miss the action. You dream of retirement, but then what do you do?” Florence Fabricant reports on today’s opening of Greenwich Steakhouse (62 Greenwich Ave.) from Victor Chavez, who ran the kitchen at Smith & Wollensky for 30 years. He retired a year ago, returned to his native Ecuador, and is now back to open his own restaurant, with a cocktail program run by Zane Harris of Dutch Kills and Maison Premiere.\nThe three story-restaurant features exposed brick and pine beams throughout, with a working fireplace, a white marble bar, and a windowed kitchen on the ground floor. The second floor dining room is super traditional, with still-life paintings and velvet-upholstered chairs and a third floor for private events. Steak and chops range from $47 to $110. \n— Serving the Mangold and the Juicy Lucy burgers, Whitmans (500 W. 30th St.) has opened across from Hudson Yards , where we’ll be seeing more than 15 spots hand-picked by Thomas Keller in the next few years. It’s a bigger space and menu than the East Village spot. \n— Season Thirteen Top Chef finalist, Isaac Toups of Toups South and Toups Meatery in New Orleans is collaborating with Sarah Simmons of Birds & Bubbles Feb. 28 for a Louisiana crawfish boil for Fat Tuesday/Mardi Gras. It’s $45 a person.
