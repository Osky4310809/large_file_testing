Today, we got a first look at the season premier and it is action packed. \nThe clip not only shows Jack slaying a hoard of robotic beetles, but we also get to see him riding a blade motorcycle and showing off some new futuristic weapons. This first look promises a season full of action and great looking animation. Fans have been waiting patiently for the fifth and final season, and it looks like the wait was well worth it. \nThe new season is set 50 years after where we were left off, season four. Season five is set to have a \"darker, more theatrical\" feel according to the creator Genndy Tatakovsky. And in the short minute and a half preview we got a dark and mysterious armored Jack. According to the official synopsis: \n\"Itâ€™s been 50 years since we saw Samurai Jack and time has not been kind to him. Aku has destroyed every time portal and Jack has stopped aging, a side effect of time travel. It seems he is cursed to just roam the land for all eternity.\" \nThis is the first official clip from the new season following the trailer that released in late January. Adult Swim announced the release of the show on social media, when a fan asked whether the new season is still happening. Adult Swim responded simply by saying \"March 11th, 11:30 p.m. is what's going on\". This was the best possible way to announce the return of the cult hit that seemed to took over the anime world by storm. \nFans were worried that story would never be completed when it took so long to release the new season, but Tatakovsky promises it will be worth the wait. In a recent interview when asked about the new season, he responded \"It's pretty epic. Not just emotionally, but the journey that he takes. And there's this overall theme that's more complex and underneath that's contemporary that I think people can pick up on if they really analyze it. I think it's a lot deeper then anything I've ever done.\" \nThe new and final 10-episode season will premier Saturday, March 11th on Adult Swim.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:13:13.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
