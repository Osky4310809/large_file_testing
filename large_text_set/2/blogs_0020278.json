By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 25, 2017 11:44 AM Lipstick Under My Burkha ‘ban’: Shyam Benegal said that he is completely against cuts in the film. (Source: Twitter) \nVeteran filmmaker Shyan Benegal has hit back against the Pahlaj Nihalani-led Central Board of Film Certification for banning Alankrita Shrivastva’s film ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’. Benegal said that he is completely against cuts in the film and if the Board finds the content objectionable, it should rather classify the film but should not stop the release. He further said that if the people of India have the power to vote and can choose the government, they should be allowed to choose the films as well. \n“When people of our country have the power to vote, power to change govt, so why should they be told what to see and what not? I am against cuts,I ask for classification of films not censorship,” he said. \nWatch Nihalani avoiding questions: \n— muhammad waseem (@mw569256) February 24, 2017 \nYesterday film producer and director Prakash Jha also came out in support of the makers and said that the board should certify the film rather than censoring it. Stressing that the audience is matured enough to understand what is good or bad, Jha said that he will definitely appeal to the tribunal, which is the only option left before him now. He further said that it was not due to person or CBFC, but it is of the right to take decision, the mentality and the understanding, the ANI quoted him as saying. \nOn the other hand, Pahlaj Nihalini evaded media questions on why Censor Board of Certification (CBFC) refused to certify award winning ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’, film. Under Nihalini, CBFC has become a kind of “Sanskari Board” that bans films on the basis of ‘R’ rated scenes, riot-inducing scenes and this time, ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’ was termed as ‘lady oriented’. When a reporter told Nihalani that his decision maybe misogynistic, he almost lost his temper, saying, “Don’t force me.” \n“I am going to CBFC, this is my personal office. I will do it there. Don’t force me,” he can been seen as saying in an ANI video. He was being bombarded with questions on the recent decision of denying certificate to the film, which has been critically acclaimed in international festivals.
