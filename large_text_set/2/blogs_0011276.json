One of the only interesting revelations to come out of proceedings was that Matty Healy of The 1975, purveyors of unreal banger \"Somebody Else\" and also some other songs, has plans to collaborate with Skepta, who took away the award for Best British Male at the ceremony (at least someone is getting it right *cough* Grammys *cough*).Healy confirmed that he and Skepta \"know each other\" – a good start – and said that they would \"do a tune together\": \"We wanna do like a \"West End Girls\" Pet Shop Boys... maybe start a band together. Just me and Skepta do a band.\" Would listen, if only because it's so batshit. \nAnd it appears that there's plenty of Skepta to go around – he's also got love for mayor of London Sadiq Khan, who presented him with his award on stage. As NME reports , introducing Skepta, Khan said \"Can I tell you what an honour this is? This guy is cool, this guy is talented, this guy is a role model, this guy is a Londoner.\" Skeppy appeared to reciprocate the Mayor's appreciation, telling an interviewer later on that he's a fan because \"we do the same thing... we go against the grain.\" \nIt's not surprising that he's attracted Sadiq as a fan, especially considering his impact in north London. But to be honest you'll have to excuse me because I'm still kind of distracted by this prospect of Matty Healy and Skepta as the new Pet Shop Boys, so if anyone needs me I'll be waiting impatiently for their version of \"Go West,\" with an accompanying music video.
