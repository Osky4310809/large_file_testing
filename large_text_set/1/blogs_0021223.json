Initially lampooned by The Washington Post , the Jade Egg quickly elicited fervent responses from fans and critics alike. Inspired by traditional Chinese medicine, it was unlikely to ever receive a favorable response from mainstream medical “experts.” Regardless of the product’s merits, it has opened an important dialogue on vaginal health. This is a topic that rarely appears in the headlines of major national news outlets. This is unfortunate and shortchanges over half of the population. One of the primary criticisms of the Jade Egg is its potential for causing toxic shock syndrome (TSS) . This is a serious accusation. TSS is a risk usually associated with tampon use. Usually, it is blamed on improper use but a recent outbreak in Michigan may have been linked to the materials used in superabsorbent tampons. The chemicals found in most tampons are extremely dangerous and not clearly disclosed on the labels. This has led to a growing movement for transparency and disclosure in feminine hygiene products. Their concerns are justified. Recent investigations have uncovered glyphosate , dioxins, insecticides and other harmful toxins in sanitary pads and tampons. There are common sense practices that can reduce your chance of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). One of the most effective is to refrain from leaving it in overnight and to change it every four to six hours. TSS can be a life-threatening condition, so it's important to recognize the signs and symptoms. These include a sudden high fever, low blood pressure, vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, muscle aches and a rash on the soles of your feet or palms.
