While UCLA star Lonzo Ball is the most prominent of Ball's basketball-playing children at the moment, LiAngelo and LaMelo are playing at Chino Hills High School. According to head coach Stephan Gilling, there is a battle for control with LaVar Ball. Per Andrew Joseph of For The Win, Ball has gone into the team's locker room against Gilling's orders and has yelled directions to players from the sidelines that counter the coach's game plan. An especially unique situation occurred in the team's hotel after a game, as Gilling described: \nAn assistant coach comes up to me and tells me that he sees LaVar rallying the team up. I guess he got them out of their rooms on the 18th floor and tells the team that it was his system that won. That we're doing what he says. 'I run Chino Hills! I run UCLA, about to run the NBA!' He pretty much downplays me at the same time. My assistant coach sees him and says to him, 'That's not right. Is there any middle ground?' He says, 'No, there's no middle ground.' Gilling is in his first year as the coach of Chino Hills after being an assistant last season. Steve Baik was the head coach in 2015-16, helping the Lonzo Ball-led team to an undefeated record as one of the best high school teams in the country. He changed schools, however, leaving Gilling to deal with the remainders of the Ball family. As we have already learned, LaVar Ball doesn't seem to care who is the coach of these teams. The two younger family members are committed to UCLA, whether Steve Alford leaves or stays. \"We're going to stick with UCLA even if you put Bobo the Clown in as coach,\" the father said, per Ian O'Connor of ESPN.com. It's obvious Ball considers himself the main influence. With LaMelo being just a sophomore, though, it might be a good idea to repair the relationship with the current coach of Chino Hills. \"He wants to shoot people down for him to look good,\" Gilling said, per Joseph. \"That's how he is, but it doesn't affect me.\" With Lonzo likely headed to the NBA next season, there will be yet another dynamic for him to deal with going forward.
