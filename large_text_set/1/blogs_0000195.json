Lito Atienza said that the Philippines may become the world's top executioner if proposals to revive the death penalty become law. File photo \n  Reimposing the death penalty will make the Philippines the world's \"new top executioner\", Buhay party-list Rep. Lito Ateinza said Monday. \n\"We Filipinos loathe killings, whether judicial or extrajudicial, as much as we detest violent crime,\" Atienza, who represents a party-list that identifies itself as pro-life, said in a press statement. He also said that the drug-related killings, which the government blames on vigilantes and drug syndicates, have imposed a \"virtual death penalty\" over the Philippines. \nAtienza said that restoring the death penalty goes against the Filipinos' celebration of life. \n\"We celebrate life so much that despite our usual troubles, we’ve been persistently rated among the happiest people in the world,\" Atienza said. \nIn a Social Weather Stations survey released in December, President Rodrigo Duterte received a net satisfaction rating of +72 while respondents rated the government's war on drugs a high +78 in separate survey results released in November. \nDuterte, who has repeatedly asked Congress to revive the death penalty, has said that \"five or six\" convicts will be executed daily once it is reimposed.   \n\"Restore it and I will execute criminals every day – five or six. That’s for real,\" Duterte said last month during Sen. Manny Pacquiao's birthday celebration in General Santos City. Pacquiao, a Christian, has said the death penalty is allowed by the Bible and is pushing for its reimposition. \nREAD: Duterte wants 6 executions daily \nAtienza said that the problem is not the severity of the punishment imposed criminals but corruption. He said that it is the primary reason that suspects are not caught or penalized, which, in turn, \"abetted even more crime.\" \nHe earlier likened the death penalty as a Band-Aid for the Philippine criminal justice system, which he described as \"in need of surgical treatment.\" \nHe said that \"if we are to save the patient, we have to cut off the rampant tumor of corruption.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T10:07:05.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
