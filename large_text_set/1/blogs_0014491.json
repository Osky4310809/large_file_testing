Chris Bryant: the Europe minister in the last Labour government (REUTERS/Olivia Harris) \nMr Bryant told The Observer: \"Any minister who goes into the Foreign Office and has responsibility for Russia, they (Moscow) will be, in any shape or form, trying to put together information about them. \n\"I am absolutely certain that Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, Alan Duncan, who has the Russia brief, and David Davis will have been absolutely looked at. \n\"All of these people the Russians will be following very, very closely. They will have created a file and they'll be attempting to watch everything they do.\" \nHe said technological advances made it far easier for intelligence agencies to gather personal information.
