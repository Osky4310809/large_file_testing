Eden Hazard, meanwhile, has responded to Conte’s carrot rather than Jose Mourinho’s stick. \nIf he performs, Hazard can have the freedom of the park without fear of reprisal. \nIt was a telling insight last week when Conte was talking about players being uneasy watching video re-runs of matches.

Which does make you wonder if Conte will finally be THE one to grow old with the owner.
