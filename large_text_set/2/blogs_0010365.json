Lamenting his own previous “cold” relationships alongside his lavish excesses, he moans, “I just spent half a million on a chandelier / Now you’re trying to cut me off like a light switch.” Listen to the track below.\n\nThe combination, though surprising, actually has all the makings of a resounding crossover pop hit, one that we imagine will be getting a hell of a lot of airtime in the next few months. Maroon 5 used a similar formula to commercial success when they recently collaborated with Kendrick Lamar on the massively successful “Don’t Wanna Know,” featuring a Pokémon Go themed video. Watch that below.\n\nIn other music news, a candid Frank Ocean interview has just been unearthed, which you can watch here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:15:59.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
