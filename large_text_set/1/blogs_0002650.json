There are several kinds of bonuses available. A \"First Win of the Day\" IP bonus is available roughly once a day. It is available all the time by default. When you win a game, you claim the bonus and it becomes unavailable for 22 hours. After those 22 hours it becomes available until you win another game, and so on. It is not affected by boosts or penalties. In Co-op vs. AI and custom games the amount of game time that generates IP points within a day is also limited. After reaching these limits no more IPs are earned by playing each kind of game. The limits are 180 minutes for Co-op vs. AI and 120 minutes for custom games. For this purpose the beginning of each day is determined by the First Win of the Day timer, which can be checked in your summoner profile. This rule does not apply to Twisted Treeline in Co-op vs. AI . Games shorter than 7 minutes don't award IPs and don't affect the first win of the day bonus. Such short durations are very unusual in regular games, so this rule applies mainly to custom games. Co-op vs AI Gamemode Modifiers \nThe amount of IP rewarded in Co-op vs. AI is determined by a system of penalties that depend on the level of the summoner and the difficulty setting.
