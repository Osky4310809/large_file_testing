Gross Monday 20 March 2017 12:46 GMT Click to followES Going Out \nAfter a series of successful pop-up restaurants and a scramble for the perfect takeaway meal, Yolk has cracked a permanent home in the City of London. \nIts new restaurant is set to launch in late April and will serve up its signature eggy breakfasts and lunches for takeaway. \nIn the morning you can expect simple but delicious poached egg pots, with serious sandwiches served for the rest of the day. \nMenu highlights look set to be the signature Eggs Benedict pot with poached eggs, 24-hour pulled ham hock doused in Yolk's hollandaise sauce and the Steak Bernaise sandiwch, cooked medium rare with brown butter bearnaise, caramelised balsamic onions on a hot ciabatta. Steak Bearnaise sandwich on ciabatta with bavette steak, brown butter bearnaise, carmelised balsamic onions and fresh rocket. (Yolk) \nThe new spot will also be slinging coffees from a rotating selection of locally based roasters, including Workshop, Origin and Square Mile. \nYolk's new home is a unit within the Broadgate estate near Liverpool Street Station. The best brunches in London - in pictures The best brunches in London - in pictures 1/38 34, Mayfair \nFor sheer decadence, it’s hard to beat Mayfair’s 34. Brunch classics from Benedict to buttermilk pancakes are all served with flair while there’s also a hefty offering of steaks from the grill to round things off. Oh, and since you’re splashing out do make sure you sup some Champagne from the specially designed Kate Moss coupes… 2/38 Balthazar, Covent Garden \nBrunch at the original Balthazar in Manhattan is a New York institution and its Covent Garden outpost is proving pretty popular too. Take in the bustle of the grand space as you pile in pastries from the adjoining bakery, fluffy pancakes drenched in maple syrup, or eggs whatever way. Choose between fresh juices or cocktails to wash it all down. 3/38 Ben’s Canteen, various locations \nSo laid back it’s almost horizontal, few places are better suited to brunch than Ben’s Canteen. Pair a breakfast burrito, burger or buttermilk pancakes with a peanut butter and banana shake or twist on a Bloody Mary for a seriously good morning. 4/38 Berber & Q, Haggerston \nAlong with many of the main menu’s slow-cooked, seductively spiced meats, tasty dips and fluffy breads, brunch has some special dishes to offer. Red shakshuka is piquant from an abundance of roasted red peppers; Turkish eggs are lavished with paprika butter; and the Full Israeli — for two to share — is an enlivening platter of hummus, honeyed feta, boiled eggs, avocado, roasted beetroot and more. Don’t forget a harissa rose mary, a sweet and spicy riff on the classic brunch cocktail. 5/38 Big Easy, Canary Wharf \nThere’s no good reason not to start the day with barbecue food. Not one. Big Easy Canary Wharf’s Big Pig Gig offers limitless grub from a menu that includes North Carolina chopped pork, pit-smoked chicken and St Louis pork ribs. Beer, wine and prosecco is also bottomless and included in the £29.50 price tag. 6/38 Bistrotheque, Victoria Park \nYou’ll need to book for the almighty brunches at Bistrotheque. Try classics with a twist such as avocado on toast with sriracha chilli sauce or go for something less tried and tested like crab rarebit with rocket and capers. The steak tartare is also exemplary. 7/38 Caravan, various locations \nWhat you eat at Caravan will depend how virtuous or gluttinous you’re feeling. Fresh fruits and almond milk porridge rub shoulders with eggs, spreads or a particularly delicious avocado, chilli, lemon and olive oil. Then there’s flatbread topped with murguez sausage and the Caravan fry-up, or for the sweet-tooths date and hazelnut cake with halva ice cream and cardamom syrup. 8/38 Chick ‘n’ Sours, Haggerston \nThe brunch menu at Chick ‘n’ Sours plays out much like the usual one, which those who’ve tried their sexily succulent battered bird bits will know is no bad thing. But there are a couple of important extras which make it worth a weekend visit: the brunch bun features fried thigh, avocado, hot sauce, bacon, a fried egg and lashings of gochujang mayo, while on Sundays you can get a whole fried chicken — either naked or dressed with sauce — plus any sides for £25. 9/38 Chiltern Firehouse, Marylebone \nWhen Chiltern Firehouse was at the peak of its celebrity frenzy, brunch was just about the only sitting mere mortals could get a booking for. The heat is slightly less fierce now, but the brunch is still as good a call as any. Highlights include Nuno’s now legendary crab-stuffed doughnuts, a mix-your-own steak tartare and black truffle scrambled eggs. The Mary Celeste is a twist on a Bloody Mary based on orange, which comes with an oyster. And everything is served with a side of celeb spotting, obviously. 10/38 Christopher’s, Covent Garden \nThere are two brunch menus at this grand, high-ceilinged brasserie: normal and superfood. Pick depending how virtuous you are feeling, or even opt for a combination of the two. The superfood menu includes raw juices along with avocado and crab on toast, while the other offers indulgent pancakes, a lobster club sandwich and all manner of egg options. Yep, you’re probably not feeling all that virtuous… 11/38 Cookbook Café \nCookbook Café A stylish and sophisticated way to start the day. Glorious, bountiful tables laden with endless amounts of pastries, meat, sushi, salads, fruit and yoghurt are backed up by freshly cooked eggs any way, waffles and pancakes. Bellinis and prosecco are bottomless, along with tea and coffee. All in a light and airy setting within Park Lane’s Intercontinental Hotel, for £52 per person and less for under 17s. 12/38 Dean Street Townhouse, Soho \nWith its discrete booths and velvet armchairs, Dean Street Townhouse boasts one of the cosiest dining rooms in London. The extensive brunch menu doesn’t stop at eggy things. It spans home-cured salmon and steak tartare alongside fish & chips and mince & potatoes — a house classic. There are no fewer than four Bloody Marys are available should you want a change from the classic. 13/38 The Delaunay, Aldwych \nThis grand brasserie from Corbin and King serves a brunch menu that’s almost as impressive as its beautiful interiors. There’s something for everyone, from a tempting array of homemade pastries, pancakes and classic egg dishes to schnitzels and sausages — plus lots of opportunity for people-watching. You’ll want to linger. 14/38 Duck Egg Café, various locations \nIt may be run by a charming Thai family, but this rather special spot is one of the best places for a Full English anywhere in London. The main restaurant is in Dulwich, while you’ll find it residing at The Prince of Wales on Brixton Road every morning, serving up grease-free breakfast food made with top produce. 15/38 Dishoom, various locations \nThere are now four branches of Bombay Café Dishoom around town, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be prepared for a queue. The bacon naan roll is a modern classic but also try the kejriwal – two fried eggs on chilli cheese toast – and the Bombay omelette with chopped tomato, onion, coriander and green chilli. It’s technically a breakfast (but it’s so good we had to include it) so only runs until midday. Early bird catches the naan, and all that... 16/38 Duck & Waffle, City \nFor a decadent start to the day it’s hard to beat a sky-high brunch, and they don’t get any more sky-high than the one at Duck & Waffle, London’s highest restaurant. http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/restaurants/eating-at-altitude-the-highest-restaurants-in-london-a3232006.html The menu includes the eponymous duck and waffle – crispy leg confit, fried duck egg, mustard maple syrup – along with ox cheek doughnuts, shakshuka, duck egg cocotte and freshly baked pastries. 17/38 Flesh & Buns, Covent Garden \nSundays at Flesh & Buns mean unlimited everything. Well, practically. For either £39 or £46 a head (depending on which menu you go for) you’ll get a cocktail on arrival followed by chips, dips and edamame, unlimited hot and cold dishes — including the signature buns — and unlimited prosecco or wine followed by pud to share. Sorted. 18/38 Foxlow, various locations \nHawksmoor’s younger sibling knows how to whip up a mean brunch. Gutsy highlights include fried chicken and egg on a ‘croissant waffle’, steak with harissa, a sweet potato and kale hash and a Full English. 19/38 Gaucho \nAt Gaucho’s Electric Brunch, diners can order as many dishes as they like from a menu of both Argentine and brunch classics — and then keep coming back for more. That means as much steak, eggs Benedict, avo on toast and oven-baked chorizo as you can muster. Drinks are just as free-flowing, with Bloody Marys, Argentine sparkling wine and a weekly-changing ‘morning’ cocktail all bottomless. It’s all-inclusive for £49.95. 20/38 The Good Egg, Stoke Newington \nThe array of brightly flavoured dishes at this Middle Eastern-influenced restaurant includes shakshuka, sourdough with date butter, beef pastrami hash and Iraqi-style aubergine with tahini. Unsurprisingly given the name, eggs are also a major player. Spicy Bloody Marys, mimosas and cardamom-infused coffee are on hand to lubricate. 21/38 Granger & Co, various locations \nQueues out the door at all Granger & Co’s restaurants can be seen of a brunch time as Londoners flock to try Bill Granger’s bright and breezy dishes. Tuck into broken eggs with ricotta, spinach, pine nuts and grilled sourdough, or opt for a Full Aussie. 22/38 The Great Exhibition, East Dulwich \nYou choose just one main dish as part of the brunch at this East Dulwich pub, but it comes with limitless Bloody Marys, mimosas, tea, coffee, toast and jam, which means the whole thing ends up being effectively bottomless. Dishes include eggs Benedict, pancakes with maple syrup and bacon, pumpkin fritters and a Full English (or a veggie version). It costs £25 all in. 23/38 Gunpowder, Spitalfields \nBrunch at this compact Indian means spicy scrambled eggs on toast, chickpea pancakes, rich Kadhai paneer parcels and mustard seed Bloody Marys. There’s even ginger cardamon porridge for health nuts. 24/38 Hakkasan, Fitzrovia \nMichelin-starred Hakkasan doesn’t do a brunch as such, but it does do Dim Sum Sundays. The £58 menu includes four lavish courses of dim sum, half a bottle of Champagne and two cocktails. A DJ plays from 1-5pm. 25/38 Jikoni, Marylebone \nRavinder Bhogal’s cooking is clever, different and deliciously multicultural – and the brunch menu is no different. Choices include tamarind and maple-glazed bacon on fenugreek waffles with fennel slaw, and a spicy fish cake with poached egg and curry hollandaise. 26/38 KuPP, Paddington \nScandi brunch means unlimited smorgasbord top-ups as well as bottomless aquavit cocktails (risky!) or pilsner. Just choose your ‘bord to get started. Offerings include Norwegian gravlax, smoked pork meatballs and pickled veg. It’s £30 per person, but kids eat free. 27/38 Lantana Café, various locations \nThis Antipodean café group serves up indulgent yet reasonably healthy brunches, with a menu spanning corn fritters, French toast, smashed avocado and a duck and sweet potato hash. There’s the option to go bottomless for £35 (Bloody Marys, prosecco, mimosas and coffee) or opt for limitless booze-free juices and coffees for £30. 28/38 The Manor, Clapham \nAmong the main attractions at this sister to nearby The Dairy are hearty slabs of toasted sourdough topped with the likes of scrambled eggs and assorted mushrooms or a fried duck egg, crispy pig cheeks, nduja and borlotti beans. Muesli is also available for those of a healthier disposition, while a Bloody Mary station is positioned on the bar, allowing diners to add whichever herbs and spices they wish from a sizeable selection — best of all, one comes free with your brunch. 29/38 Maze, Mayfair \nGordon Ramsay’s Maze in Mayfair is dialing up the decadence with their Sunday brunch offering. Guests will be treated to unlimited fizz and Japanese dishes plus an abundance of sushi — including tuna tartare, salmon nigiri and California rolls. It’s limited to an hour-and-a-half, but that’s plenty of time to make sure you get your £40 worth. 30/38 Milk, Balham \nBright flavours abound at this local institution. Highlights include sweetcorn fritters topped with grilled halloumi and a riff on a bacon sarnie called The Convict – an English muffin with bacon, sausage, egg and a tangy ‘hangover’ sauce. 31/38 The Modern Pantry, various locations \nDiverse and international influences abound in Anna Hansen’s cooking, and the dishes at her two branches of The Modern Pantry zing all the more brightly for it. Try the marinated feta with a chilli sautéed cavolo nero and chickpea spring roll, or opt for a tamarind and miso-marinated onglet steak with cassava chips. Don’t forget the must-try house classic: sugar-cured prawn omelette with smoked chilli sambal, spring onion and coriander. Prosecco, mimosas and bellinis are also on hand. 32/38 Oblix, London Bridge \nHigh-up and high-end in equal measure, the brunch at Oblix in the Shard is hard to beat for wow-factor so long as you’re willing to splash £62 a head. That gets you three courses, a side and a glass of Champagne to toast the views with. Diners can pick dishes from the deli counter as well as ordering the likes of a smoked haddock and cod fish cake with a poached egg, or grilled rib-eye steak with a fried egg and hashbrowns. 33/38 Pix, various locations \nIt’s debatable whether you’d call Pix’s Sunday offering a brunch — not least because it doesn’t start until 1pm — but it’s definitely worth a look. The group of restaurants is inspired by the pintxos bars of barcelona, where small bites are served on cocktail sticks. Throughout Infinity Sundays diners can scoff as many of these as they want, washed down with bottomless cava. That’s all inclusive for £33. 34/38 The Providores, Marylebone \nPeter Gordon’s The Providores and Tapa Room deals in bright, exotic flavours — think grilled chorizo with sweet potato and miso hash, a soft boiled egg, garlic labneh and star anise cashew nut praline, or roast black pudding with baked apple and slow-roast tomato. Brunch drinks include a fresh passionfruit bellini. 35/38 Riding House Café, Fitzrovia \nThis is a good place to summon strength before a day's shopping around Oxford Circus. But all the more indulgent if you’re not subjecting yourself to such an ordeal afterwards. The menu spans eggs or avocado Benedict, reuben sandwiches and a particularly noteworthy chorizo and roasted red pepper hash. 36/38 Shackfuyu, Soho \nThe food here could loosely be described as Japanese junk food, but that doesn’t do its rich, varied and often umami-rich flavours full justice. Brunch allows you to choose two small dishes and one larger dish each, followed by pudding, along with bottomless pineapple sake or prosecco for £35. Highlights include a tender and sticky Korean-style short rib, a buttermilk-fried chicken roll and miso aubergine. Go in a group and share for best results. 37/38 Snaps & Rye, Ladbroke Grove \nGolborne Road Danish restaurant Snaps & Rye combines its breakfast and brunch menu. Dansih pastries and smoked salmon with scarmbled eggs sit alongside a Full Danish cosnisting of bacon, liquorice syrup, hog's pudding, spinach, tomatoes, pickled mushrooms and what they like to call Bloody Viking Ketchup. The open sandwiches are also worth a look. 38/38 Social Wine & Tapas, Marylebone \nDon’t expect eggs Benedict at this Jason Atherton joint. This isn’t standard brunch fare, but rather the same brand of modern tapas the restaurant does so well, served at brunch o’clock. It comes in the guise of a £20 Feed Me menu, which will see a surprise selection of head chef Frankie Van Loo’s favourite plates brought to the table to share. These could include tangy piquillo croquettas, rare slices of Cumbrian lamb rump with goat’s cured and spicy hummus, or a runny-yolked egg on brioche with chorizo jam and avocado. Make sure you end on the churros-esque cinnamon doughnuts, and do make the most of the extensive wine list. \nFounder Nick Philpot said: \"Having worked in central London myself, I was always frustrated at the lack of serious takeaway food. I wished there was a more exciting option - somewhere that prioritised flavour and quality of all else. That is the philosophy that guides Yolk, and we're very excited to bring our food to the people of the City\". \nYolk opens in late April at Unit 4, Finsbury Avenue Square, EC2M; yolklondon.com More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:37:32.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
