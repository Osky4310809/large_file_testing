It never set the world on fire back on PS2, Xbox and PC, but achieved a cult status. Dan Whitehead penned a Rogue Trooper retrospective for Eurogamer back in 2012, calling it \"a solid, unpretentious action game with thoughtfully executed features, all in faithful service of a beloved character\".\nThe remastered version is called Rogue Trooper Redux, which is set for release on PS4, Xbox One, PC and Nintendo Switch. It's being developed by UK studio TickTock Games, making it the first 2000 AD game developed outside of Rebellion. The teaser video is below.\n2000 AD rights holder Rebellion recently announced plans to open up its intellectual property, which includes Judge Dredd and Sláine - to other developers.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKnkYPPkdN4"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:38:13.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
