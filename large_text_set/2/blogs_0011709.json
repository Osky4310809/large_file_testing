But when it came time to accept the award for Album Of The Year, Adele broke the trophy in half so that she could share it with Beyonce.\n\"Thank you… but I can’t possibly accept this award,\" Adele said during her acceptance speech. \"My artist of my life is Beyonce, and the 'Lemonade' album was so monumental, Beyonce, and so well thought out and so beautiful and soul-bearing, and we all got to see another side to you that we don't always let us see.\"\n“All us artists here, we f**king adore you,\" Adele continued. \"You are our light, and the way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel is empowering, and you make them stand up for themselves. I love you, and I always will.”\nBeyonce was moved to tears by Adele's gesture.\n\nThe \"Hello\" singer also took home the awards for Song Of The Year and Record Of The Year, the Daily Mail reported. Beyonce lead all artists with nine nominations, and won awards for Best Music Video and Best Urban Contemporary Album.\nOther big winners of the night included Chance The Rapper and Drake.\nDuring a post award show press conference, Adele continued to praise Beyonce.\n\"Like I said in my speech, my album of the year is Lemonade,\" Adele said. \"So a piece of me did die inside, as a Beyoncé fan — not going to lie.\n\"I was completely rooting for her, I voted for her. I felt like it was her time to win. What the f*ck does she have to do to win Album of the Year?\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:46:17.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
