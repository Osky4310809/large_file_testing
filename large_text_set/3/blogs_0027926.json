The department claims that it is more effective when policing is separated from immigration enforcement, allowing it to build trust between police and residents. \nLAPD Chief Charlie Beck this week said reports of sexual assault and domestic violence by Hispanic residents have declined this year by 25 and 10 percent, respectively, possibly due to fear that police contact could lead to deportation. \nNot all law enforcement authorities in Los Angeles agree with non-cooperation policies. Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell opposes a “sanctuary state” bill in the California statehouse that attempts to prevent federal immigration agents from taking custody of people released from the state’s jails. \nIf the bill passes, McDonnell told the Los Angeles Times , immigration agents will have “no choice but to go into the communities and arrest not only the individual they are seeking but also people who are with that person, or other people in the area who are undocumented.” \n“That is something none of us want,” he added. \nSend tips to [email protected] .
