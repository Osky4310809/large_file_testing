Dele Alli celebrates with Eric Dier after scoring his and Tottenham's second goal \nHazard should have fired the Blues in front after just five minutes when he beat the offside trap and was played through one-on-one with Hugo Lloris, but he shot wide of the far post. \nWalker and Rose were menacing on either flank and Pedro was lucky to escape with just a yellow card when he came in late on the Spurs left-back, stirring back up some resentment from the 'Battle of the Bridge' last season. Dier and man of the match and Alli speak to Sky Sports after Tottenham ended Chelsea's winning run \nPedro and Costa then exchanged heated words after Costa failed to play the forward into a shooting position, as Chelsea grew frustrated at being unable to threaten the Tottenham's goal. \nAnd Spurs had a deserved breakthrough on the stroke of the interval when Walker played in Eriksen to cross for Alli to nod home for the fourth consecutive game. Alli directs his looping header into the top corner to put Spurs ahead \nChelsea came firing out of the traps in the second half and could have equalised through either Costa, who forced Lloris to tip wide from long range, or Hazard, who missed a close-range header at the far post. \nBut Alli made no mistake and doubled Spurs' lead on 54 minutes when Eriksen picked out another well-timee run into the box, and he headed beyond Thibaut Courtois into the far corner - his third brace in as many matches. \nChelsea looked forlorn and bewildered, as Pedro found space but headed an Alonso cross feebly at Lloris, and Conte threw on Willian, Cesc Fabregas and Michy Batshuayi. Alli scores his and Tottenham's second goal of the game \nBut Tottenham held on for a memorable, fifth straight win to move third in the Premier League and just two points behind second-place Liverpool. \nTottenham : Lloris (7), Dier (7), Alderweireld (7), Vertonghen (7); Walker (8), Wanyama (7), Dembele (7), Rose (8), Alli (9), Eriksen (8), Kane (7) \nSubs used : Winks (6), Sissoko (5), Son (5) \nChelsea : Courtois (6), Cahill (6), Luiz (7), Azpilicueta (6); Moses (6), Kante (7), Matic (6), Alonso (6); Pedro (7), Costa (6), Hazard (7) \nSubs used : Willian (5), Fabregas (5), Batshuayi (6) \nMan of the match: Dele Alli", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:22:04.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
