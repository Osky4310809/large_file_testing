Digital Eclipse did a great job of upholding the honor of the series, and it seems like Capcom agrees, as they aren't done with their partnership yet.\nSpeaking on a podcast, Digital Eclipse's Frak Cifaldi reminiscenced about his previous work, while commenting on the next one: \"I shipped a collection called Mega Man Legacy Collection the year before last (it's been a while), and we've got another one coming out soon that they're gonna announce any day now. I don't know when - I wish I could talk about it but it's really cool.\"\nIt could mean anything, and isn't necessarily related to Mega Man . I'd love it if it was an X  collection though with a Mega Man X amiibo, so we'd come full circle, and possibly get a Battle Network Collection  as well as one for Star Force ( Zero  got a kind of sort of recent collection on DS). While very game in the series isn't a hit, it would serve as a historical preservation of sorts, and possibly pave the way for another developer to handle a Mega Man 11 , and that coveted link from the Classic to the X series we've been waiting for.\nChannel 33 [YouTube via Rockman Corner ]\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:38:56.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
