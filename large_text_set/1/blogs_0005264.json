The game initially doubled as a showcase between Giannis and Kristaps Porzingis, who were both adding to their already-extensive highlight-reels in the first half. \nBut never one to be left out, the Greek Freak’s running mate Jabari Parker got in on the action as well. Late in the third quarter, Jason Terry took the outlook pass and darted down court before finding a streaking Parker with a beautiful lob pass that the Bucks forward threw down with malicious intentions.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Parker is leading the way for Milwaukee with 25 points on 10-of-16 shooting, to go along with five assists, and three rebounds. Now in his third season with the Bucks, Parker is starting to consistently make good on all that limitless potential that made him the second pick in the 2014 NBA Draft.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T10:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T05:24:26.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
