Fancy an early 1990s hot hatch, with a 16v engine, for banger money? Such things were all ten-a-penny just a few years ago. You couldn't move for two-grand Golf GTI 16vs and Escort RS2000s. Award for most 1990s press shot ever... But times have changed, and cars like these are starting to fetch collectors' money. A good, clean Mk2 Golf 16v with reasonable mileage is now well north of £5,000, while - somewhat unbelievably - a Mk5 Escort RS2000 in similar nick is approaching that figure, a thread we'll pick up on another day.\nBut believe it or not, there is still a hot hatch of this era, complete with a rorty naturally-aspirated 16-valve engine and a fine chassis, that can still be had for not-so-ridiculous money. Any guesses? Well, you've probably spotted the headline and the pics, so that question is rather moot. Yes, it's the Renault 19 16v. \nWhile Renault is best-known for turning out pocket rockets like the fast 5s and the Clios that succeeded it, the 19 has somewhat faded in the collective memory. And it's hard to work out why. It was repeatedly praised for its fine ride and handling balance - indeed, it won What Car?'s Hot Hatch of the Year award in 1990 - and came with the same responsive, 142hp 1.8-litre motor as the Clio 16v. That was enough to propel it to 60mph in 7.7 seconds - in other words, very competitive, as 1990s hot hatches go. It's not just Clios that were good! Yet today, its obscurity has held prices down. Well, that is to say, we think it has. Finding a 19 16v is your first challenge, so badly have they rotted away. Clean ones are almost non-existent now; strangely though, they frequently come up for sale mid-way through restoration, which leads us to wonder whether parts supply is an issue, or simply whether their value isn't such that they warrant large amounts of time and/or cash.\nSo, what are those values like then? The caveat here, of course, is that we're struggling to find a clean, solid example that's sold recently to back up the theory. However, based on the prices of the fixer-uppers, it looks like you'll struggle to pay more than £3,000 for a tidy example. That seems like a bit of a bargain, and given the 16v's rarity, it's hard to imagine those prices staying where they are for long. \nWhat's the catch? Well, as you can imagine, the 19 wasn't built to the highest possible standards of quality; interiors are chock-full of squeaky plastic that snaps, scratches and buckles like nobody's business. And while the bucket seats are exceptionally comfy, they also have a tendency to fray at the seams. Does anyone own one? Or know of one? Electrics are another common gripe - come on, it's an old Renault; what did you expect? - with niggling maladies left, right and centre. The core oily bits, though, are pretty robust, and should take a reasonable amount of punishment.\nThe only problem, then, is finding one. Easier said than done. But if you really want one of these much-underrated cars, keep your eye on owners' forums and classic car sites - consider the possibility of taking on a project as well - and it's still possible to end up with a real slice of excellent early-1990s hot hatchery for bargain basement cash.
