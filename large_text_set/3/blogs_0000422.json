It should have been resolved last year. What a cluster. Feb 28, 2017 4:21 PM \nCan you say, “Smokescreen”? \nAs much as it hurts, the Redskins need to recognize that Cousins isn’t a franchise QB. He’s OK, and if you are willing to settle for OK, then sign him up. But he is a long, long way from elite. weepingjebus says: Feb 28, 2017 4:21 PM \nThere are few teams that would have the bravery to use their own terrible trade as a positive benchmark to evaluate future trades. Congratulations? blitzinc43 says: Feb 28, 2017 4:23 PM \nAs a close friend of the organization they should rid themselves of Kirk Cousins and fulfill the “Dan Snyder Prophecy” and acquire his golden boy, the one, the only, Robert Griffin III dawoger says: Feb 28, 2017 4:24 PM \nIf you need any advice on blowing just ask the minnysoda queens. They’ve been blowing for 56 seasons and counting. Stiller43 says: Feb 28, 2017 4:26 PM \nPurely posturing. They have zero leverage here…everyone knows they wont pay Kirk, so any team will have access to him as a free agent next offseason. No reason to give up a ton now unless another Teddy Bridgewater situation happens. cadreamer1969 says: Feb 28, 2017 4:30 PM \nThe 49ers should let the situation implode and get him next year. Kyle and Lynch have 6 year contracts, they can wait. It’s bad enough they took 20 million dollar cap hit last year and scheduled to take a 24 million dollar cap hit this year. A smart team uses the number of years of the contract and upfront money to decrease the cap hit over the life of the contract instead of giving only a large salary each year. oswizard says: Feb 28, 2017 4:31 PM \nSan Frans 2017 #1 and 2018 #1.

They can refuse to pay Cousins elite money and STILL demand elite compensation. It doesn’t mean they’ll get it but they can demand it. thenewguy12 says: Feb 28, 2017 4:42 PM \n“um they can transistion tag him next year,” \nTransition tag entails zero compensation if Washington doesn’t match an offer. beavertonsteve says: Feb 28, 2017 4:43 PM \nThe Redskins are going to transition tag Cousins next year and match the 49ers offer. Washington is like Cousins’ personal Hotel California. southpaw79 says: Feb 28, 2017 4:44 PM \nThe jig was up as soon as it was reported the KC would only sign with SF. That completely obliterated the Redskins leverage at that point. The Niners can now just sit back and use their extensive draft stock and salary cap space to build up the team while they wait the year out. The Redskins are just trying to flip the script to make it look like it was their decision all along when in reality KC has been the one in control. As far as the RGIII trade being used as a gauge… well it is pretty obvious what that means. The Redskins traded up to the 2nd pick in the draft, i.e. RGIII was worth the 2nd over all pick. The Niners just happen to have the 2nd overall pick, but they have absolutely no reason to part with that pick now when they can just spend the pick now and use a slightly lesser pick next year (if transfer tagged) or get KC for free next year. madmike66 says: Feb 28, 2017 4:44 PM \nWashington has long been among the worst managed teams in football, starting all the way at the top with their owner. But right when they seem to have finally learned so many lessons from the previous decade of disasterous Snyder meddling and free agent overspending on has beens, this team just keeps shooting itself in the foot on the contract situation with Cousins. Is Cousins Tom Brady? Of course not, but for a team that has searching for “the answer” at QB for years upon years, here they finally have a very good quarterback and somehow they have bungled their way into this salary cap nightmare. Cousins is in no way worth this much money, but he is getting paid purely because of how badly the Redskins managed it. They bet against themselves and lost. It’s ridiculous, especially after going all in the way they did with RGKnee. cadreamer1969 says: Feb 28, 2017 4:44 PM \nGuess you missed this, it would mean 28 million + in 2018 but the team only gets the option to match any offer. \nKirk Cousins saga could culminate in 2018 transition tag Posted by Mike Florio on February 11, 2017, 3:26 PM EST \nfeckyerlife says: Feb 28, 2017 4:17 PM \num they can transistion tag him next year, every article on this website mentions that besides this one…. granadafan says: Feb 28, 2017 4:45 PM \nCousins and Sam Bradford somehow made deal with the devil to keep getting such lucrative contracts. chippys lost binky says: Feb 28, 2017 4:45 PM \nFair value for anything is whatever someone is willing to pay. That Kirk Cousins, with 3 career wins against winning teams, is currently driving the QB market and Washington thinks a team is going to ‘blow them away’ for the dubious pleasure of overpaying him to secure his services long term is a peculiarity of supply and demand in the current QB/tag/cap environment. That it is also fairly humorous and faintly obscene is just a bonus. viffty says: Feb 28, 2017 4:45 PM \nHe’s a mediocre QB in a great system with lots of talent and he still found a way to choke when the REDSKINS needed him the most. Fine if they keep him and fine if they let him go. The happiest people in the world are the worthless REDSKINS beat reporters who can break out the KY now that they’ve got another 4 months to beat this issue to death again and again and again. Oh Joy! pau49ers says: Feb 28, 2017 4:46 PM \n49ers are out. You don’t rebuild with no draft picks. vikesfan320 says: Feb 28, 2017 4:48 PM \nSo they want another team to blow them away by committing to a guy long term, a guy that they themselves seem unwilling to commit to long term? That makes no sense. They’ve had him on the roster for years and aren’t willing to put their franchise behind him, yet another team is supposed to go by tape and stats to jump on board? Dumb. Feb 28, 2017 4:51 PM \nRedskins will not be getting two first round picks, that is for certain. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
