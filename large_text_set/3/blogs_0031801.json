'Tipping point' \nOnly London comes close to this, with the capital's roads repaired every 23 years on average. The frequency of road surfacing in England is 55 years, while in Wales it is 63 years. \nAlan Mackenzie, chairman of the AIA, said the message from the survey was that \"highway teams simply do not have enough money to arrest the terminal decline in the condition of our local roads and the network is not resilient enough to meet the challenges ahead\". \nHe added that although the percentage of local roads in England and Wales classed as \"good\", which means they have 15 years or more remaining, rose from 48% to 53% last year, so did those in a poor condition, rising from 13% to 17%. \nMr Mackenzie said: \"This is clearly not sustainable in the long-term and many highway engineers have warned of a tipping point ahead.\" \nLast year, the government announced a £1.1bn investment in roads for 2017-18. This was increased to £1.2bn in January to include money from the National Productivity Investment Fund and the Pothole Action Fund. \nThe Department for Transport said: \"It is vital councils keep our roads in a good condition to deliver better journeys for drivers. \n\"We are providing councils more than £6bn over six years to maintain roads and repair potholes. On top of this, we announced last autumn an additional £1.1bn to upgrade and repair roads for communities across England.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:10:16.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
