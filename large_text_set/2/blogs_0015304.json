It’s going to be an interesting one, since all four of these directors are very different from each other in the kind of cinema that they do. And this difference is most obvious during one particular moment of the Koffee quiz, when Karan asks them to name three films Shah Rukh Khan has done where his character is named ‘Rahul’. There’s just silence after! (It’s particularly awkward because SRK played Rahul in two of Karan’s own films, the very popular Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham .)
