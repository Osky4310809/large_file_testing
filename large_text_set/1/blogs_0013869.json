Optimistic Baba allays injury fears https://t.co/yUqmbK0s8G pic.twitter.com/kE7Ec8LDWB — Goal.com Ghana (@goal_ghana) January 17, 2017 The Black Stars were already leading 1-0 at that stage thanks to an André Ayew penalty kick and would hold on to that lead to notch an important victory, especially with Mohamed Salah’s Egypt surprisingly dropping points in 0-0 draw against Mali, but Baba’s injury could be concerning going forward in the tournament. “I twisted my knee twice in the spate of five minutes. I have some pains but at this moment, I think the pain is going down. But we still need to do some scans and see what happens.” -Baba Rahman; source: Goal Former Chelsea boss Avram Grant, who’s been in charge of Ghana for over two years, tried to remain positive as well. “About Baba we need to wait and see, I don't know. It's 50-50, we will see in the next day what will happen.” -Avram Grant; source: Goal Baba has been ever-present for Ghana (and regularly present for Schake 04 on loan) and despite flopping rather impressively at Chelsea last season is still a high-value prospect at just 22 years age. Hopefully the injury is nothing major indeed. Fellow Chelsea loanee Christian Atsu played the full 90, unlike Victorian Angban, who remained on the bench in Cote d’Ivoire’s 0-0 draw against Togo yesterday. Here are some extended highlights of Ghana’s win, should you care. Atsu’s no.7 on the right wing. Uganda’s goalkeeper Denis Onyango was voted Africa’s best just the other week.
