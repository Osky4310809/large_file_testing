Mar 2, 2017 5:18 PM \nA 2d round is plenty significant for Cooks. ariani1985 says: Mar 2, 2017 5:19 PM \nIf he leaves will Sean place a bounty in the streets on him? Only time will tell!!! patsxsaintsfan says: Mar 2, 2017 5:21 PM \nCooks has already proven he can be successful at this level which makes him better than every prospect in the draft since from what I hear there isn’t any slam dunk WR this year. The fact his cap hit is only 2 million and you can pick up his option for next year makes him very valuable. I would be willing to use him and the saints first to move up in the draft or acquire a team picking in the back half of the drafts first in exchange for the saints 2nd and cooks. Mar 2, 2017 5:22 PM \nBrees makes him look better than he actually is. \nWouldn’t give up anything more than a 3rd.

Sometimes teams use a swap of positions as currency in trade. .

America has amazing drugs. And Cooks doesn’t play in the slot. He lines up everywhere. Mar 2, 2017 5:59 PM \numm, my point above about cruz is that they asked for too much and failed to sell high \nthey should have taken a 1st rder and with it \nthe rookie cap is a big benefit if you draft well and have solid cap space \nthey then overpaid him sending the giants into cap hell \nthe whole reason why the saints are in cap hell is because loomis is a moron and has been since 2010 \nbrees, like other 20 mil per qbs are helping to gouge their teams magikskillz says: Mar 2, 2017 5:59 PM \nI hate when people try to knock a player simply because there is other talent on the team. If a running back has a “good” line their stats are devalued. If a receiver has a “good” quarterback their stats are devalued. Every player on a team is dependent upon another. Thats how team sports like football work. It doesn’t matter how “great” your running back is if you line is no good. The offensive line and running backs compliment each other. Just like a poor guard will make a center look worse or a bad line will make a running back look worse. Yes Drew Brees is a great quarterback but that doesn’t mean he can’t also have talented skill players around him. A skill player always looks worse if his supporting cast is no good. Nobody ever devalues Antonio Brown and says he is only good because Big Ben. Take out superstar quarterbacks and the receivers will do worse. Take out the best play-makers and give them scrubs and a superstar quarterback will do worse. A player is only as good as his surrounding cast. Just because Drew Brees is a good quarterback doesn’t mean his skill players are only good because of him. And more importantly than the skill players are the Big Boys up front. Football is won in the trenches. I don’t care how good your skill players are, even if you have Tom Brady you cannot win without controlling the line of scrimmage. This is why Football is the ultimate team sport. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
