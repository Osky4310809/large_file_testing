Today the company has released all of the details, as well as a release date, making it what we consider the most significant camera launched at CES 2017. \nAt the GH5's core is a 20.3MP Live MOS sensor with no optical low-pass filter. Its new Venus Engine processor improves resolution, color, and noise reduction, and offers roughly 1.3x higher performance compared to previous models, according to Panasonic. These are encased in a rugged, weatherproof body with 5-axis image stabilization (with 'Dual IS 2' support), dual UHS-II SD card slots and a large electronic viewfinder which is arguably the best we've used. Photos can also be composed on a 3.2\" fully articulating touchscreen display. It uses the same battery as its predecessor and should last for about 410 shots per charge (CIPA estimate). \nThe GH5 uses an updated version of Panasonic's Depth from Defocus AF system with a 480 fps drive speed and 225 selectable focus points. This results in focus times of 0.05 sec according to Panasonic and 9 fps bursts with continuous AF (12 fps with focus locked). Panasonic also promises improved plane and depth tracking, along with precise control over how the camera handles these situations, with the updated DFD system. \nAs with the GH4 that came before it, pro video capture is the main selling point of the GH5. Straight out of the box the GH5 can capture UHD 4K video at 60p and 50p (8-bit 4:2:0), with a bit rate of 150Mbps and no cropping (it uses the full width of the sensor). DCI 4K (24p) and UHD/30p video also offer a 150Mbps bit rate with 10-bit 4:2:2 color. A firmware update coming this spring will add a 10-bit 4:2:2 1080/60p option. Arriving later this summer is DCI/24p, UHD/30p capture at 400Mbps, and 1080/60p capture at 200Mbps, both using All-Intra compression and 10-bit 4:2:2 color. Also coming in that firmware update are support for anamorphic 4K video capture, a 4K HDR Photo Style and USB tethering. \nThe DC-GH5 has a host of tools for video capture, including waveform and vectorsope monitoring, '709 Like' gamma and knee control, optional V-LogL support, adjustable 10-bit luminance level adjustment and much more. The GH5 can output 10-bit 4:2:2 color to an external recorder alone (via its full-size HDMI jack) or at 8-bit 4:2:2 when also recording internally (at 8-bit 4:2:0). While current Panasonic cameras have a '4K Photo' function, the GH5 has moved to 6K, allows users to extract an 18MP still. 4K Photo is still available, now at twice the frame rate (60 fps). \nAs one would expect, the GH5 is equipped with Panasonic's well-designed Wi-Fi system, but now it supports ultra-quick 802.11ac as well as Bluetooth (which allows your mobile device to 'wake up' the camera) and NFC. \nThe Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5 will go on sale at the end of March in a body-only configuration for $1999. Read our First Impressions Review \nPress Release: Panasonic LUMIX GH5 DSLM camera featuring the World’s First 4K 60p/50p [1] and 4K 30p 4:2:2 10- bit [2] Video Recording Function \nPanasonic once again pushes still and video boundaries with the LUMIX GH5 \nLas Vegas, NV (January 4, 2017) - Panasonic has today announced the LUMIX GH5, the latest flagship model of LUMIX G DSLM cameras based on the Micro Four Thirds system standard. The new camera delivers a high-end, hybrid performance to photo enthusiasts and professional videographers looking to capture moments in 4K 60p/50p video and 6K PHOTO. \nDefying all the general concepts of what a mirrorless camera can do, the LUMIX GH Series has reached a number of milestones with this introduction. Packing a host of innovative advancements in picture quality, response and performance into an unimaginably small-sized body, the new LUMIX GH5 opens the door to a new stage of photographic and cinematographic culture. \nUnprecedented Picture Quality in the History of LUMIX Cameras \nThe LUMIX GH5 is able to achieve high-quality images with real-life details through excellent resolution, image rendering and color reproduction. Its new Digital LIVE MOS Sensor increases the pixel count by 25% compared to the GH4, from 16.05 to 20.3 megapixels, while also removing the low-pass filter. \nThe camera also comes with a new image processor Venus Engine, which achieves improvement especially in natural texture expression. The engine’s Multi-pixel Luminance Generation renders clear, sharp images by referring to a 9x larger area of pixel information during the de-mosaic process for precise detail reproduction. With Intelligent Detail Processing, the characteristic of every single pixel is analyzed to detect whether the pixel is located at a flat, detail or edge part of the picture. Optimum processing according to the characteristic of each pixel is then applied. This results in high-precision yet natural images with stunning detail suppressing false colors at its edges. \nAlso, Three Dimensional Color Control detects not only hue and saturation, but also brightness, and applies optimum control according to the value of each factor. This achieves rich color reproduction from shadows to highlights of the image. The conventional Multi Process NR (Noise Reduction) is upgraded to High Precision Multi Process NR. It boasts 4x the noise identification accuracy compared to the previous engine and preserves details even after the noise reduction process. As a result, photos can be clearly shot even at high sensitivity ISO values of up to 25,600. \nThe LUMIX GH5 also incorporates the 5-axis Dual I.S. (Image Stabilizer) 2 [3] , which suppresses blurring in more powerful and advanced ways for both photo and video recording, including 4K video. Combining an O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer, 2-axis) and B.I.S. (Body Image Stabilizer, 5-axis), it compensates for larger movements which were conventionally uncontrollable. The LUMIX GH5’s high-precision gyro sensor controls both the O.I.S. and B.I.S. compensation by studying the focal length and shooting conditions, making it possible to use a max. 5-stop slower shutter speed [4] . This is highly beneficial not only for wide-angle and telephoto shots, but also in adverse situations, such as at night-time or when shooting with one hand. \nThe world’s first DSLM camera that meets professional quality standards \nThe LUMIX GH Series created an epoch-making industry sensation by achieving outstanding video recording performance with advanced features that meet the needs of professional quality levels and standards. \nWith the LUMIX GH5, the signal readout speed has been accelerated by max 1.7x in the new Digital Live MOS Sensor, and the new Venus Engine processes signals at max 1.3x higher speed. This synergy realizes 4K 60p/50p ultra high-definition, smooth, video recording for the first time in a DSLM camera. It is also capable of internal 4:2:2 / 10-bit video recording, which is the color subsampling commonly used for film production, for even more faithful color reproduction [5] . \nThe high-sensitivity MOS Sensor and Venus Engine effectively suppress rolling shutter distortion and realize high-speed readout of full digital signals. This ensures an outstandingly high image quality for every single frame. In addition, the focal length in video recording is kept the same as that in photo shooting (no cropping). \nUsers can freely choose between MOV, MP4, AVCHD Progressive and AVCHD formats at a variety of frame rates, and there is no recording time limit for both FHD and 4K video. Professional users working globally can set the system frequency to 59.94Hz, 50.00Hz or 24.00Hz. \nWhile ‘Cinelike D’ and ‘Cinelike V’, which have similar gamma setting characteristics for film production, are available in Photo Style for video recording, the LUMIX GH5 also provides ‘Like 709’ for compatibility with HDTV. A paid software upgrade to support V-LogL video recording is also available. \nIn response to requests from professional users, the LUMIX GH5 comes with a Waveform Monitor and Vector Scope. It also embeds SMPTE-compliant Time Code either in Rec Run or Free Run count-up methods, which makes it easy to synchronize multiple video footage or sound sources in the post production workflow. Luminance levels can be selected between 64-1023 / 64-940 / 0-1023 (10-bit). Synchro Scan mode suppresses flicker and Color Bars (SMPTE / EBU / ARIB Standard) are also available. \nNew AF system with advanced DFD Technology never misses a once-in-a-lifetime moment \nThe LUMIX GH5 comes with a newly improved Depth from Defocus [6] and Contrast AF technology, which not only calculates the distance to the subject by evaluating two images with different sharpness levels, but also analyzes the form, size and even motion of the subject comprehensively. Thanks to the new Venus Engine, the time for measuring the distance to the subject is 6x faster, while factoring the distance into in-plane or in-depth is 2x faster. \nThe speed of sensor drive during auto focusing in photo shooting mode has been increased to 480 fps, which is 2x faster than that of the GH4. Consequently, the LUMIX GH5 realizes ultra-high-speed AF of approximately 0.05 sec [7] and 12 (AFS) / 9 (AFC) fps high-speed burst shooting using a mechanical shutter in full resolution. By analyzing every single frame precisely, it achieves a maximum 200% higher precision frame detection with minimum motion detection error for higher tracking tolerance against moving subjects. \nFor even more precise focusing, the number of focus areas has been increased from 49 to 225. Users can create a group of focus areas depending on the composition and can control it easily with a new joystick located on the thumb position, without taking your eyes off the subject. This is possible even when using the LVF or releasing the finger off the shutter button. \nIf focus is not exactly as the user intended when the shutter is pressed, the LUMIX GH5’s Post Focus function [8] enables users to select the specific focus point even after shooting – particularly helpful in situations like macro shooting where severe focusing is required. In addition, the camera also features a Focus Stacking function. Taking a single macro photo with specific areas in focus can sometimes be difficult, Focus Stacking enables users to take multiple images of the same frame with different focus points. You can then combine them into one image with the defocus as you like. \nThe LUMIX GH5’s new 6K PHOTO [9] function makes it possible to capture unmissable moments at 30 fps by extracting the frame with the best timing out of the 6K burst file (in 3:2 or 4:3 aspect) to save as an approximately 18-megapixel equivalent high resolution photo. 4K PHOTO has also been upgraded enabling 60 fps high speed capture in approximately 8-megapixel equivalent resolution. In 6K/4K PHOTO, three exclusive modes are available to choose from depending on the situation; 6K/4K Burst, 6K/4K Burst (Start/Stop) and 6K/4K Pre-burst. \nBy compensating the signal information between the frames, the Venus Engine makes it possible to apply Post Recording Refinement over the pictures to correct distortion and reduce noise when playing back or cutting images out of the 6K/4K burst file. As a result, the picture quality of 6K/4K PHOTO shot at high shutter speed in high sensitivity or those shot in panning are dramatically improved. \nHigh mobility in rugged design for heavy field use \nTo be tough enough to withstand even heavy field use, the LUMIX GH5’s main structure is composed of a magnesium alloy, full die-cast front/rear frame. Secure construction and the sealing of every joint, dial, and button makes the camera not only splash/dust-proof, but also freeze-proof down to -10 degrees Celsius. \nThe LUMIX GH5 is equipped with a double SD Memory Card slot compatible with high-speed, high capacity UHS-II for the first time in the LUMIX digital cameras. Users can flexibly choose the recording method either in Relay Rec, Backup Rec or Allocation Rec. \nThe LUMIX GH5 has a large LVF (Live View Finder) with a stunningly high magnification ratio of approximately 1.52x / 0.76x (35mm camera equivalent). The high-precision, high-speed OLED display features 3,680K-dot high resolution and 100% field of view. Adopting a static-type touch control system, the 3.2-inch free-angle rear screen in 3:2 aspect with 1,620K-dot high resolution achieves approximately 100% field of view. \nFinally, the shutter unit is durable for approximately 200,000 releases. \nExpandability, optional accessories, other features The LUMIX GH5 integrates Bluetooth 4.2 and Wi-Fi® 5GHz (IEEE 802.11ac) connectivity to offer a more flexible shooting experience and instant image sharing with easy operation. The LUMIX GH5 is compatible with the new Battery Grip DMW-BGGH5. By using two batteries, one in the camera and the other in the grip, the DMW-BGGH5 extends the battery life for longer time shooting. The optionally available microphone adaptor DMW-XLR1 is a plug-in type adaptor for XLR microphone to record high quality stereo sound. To save power , the camera automatically enters sleep mode after detecting the eye is off the LVF sensor. Various shutter systems are available with the LUMIX GH5: A mechanical shutter with maximum 1/8000 sec, an electronic-first curtain shutter with maximum 1/2000 sec which can be used with flash while suppressing the shutter shock, and an electronic shutter without shutter shock with maximum 1/6000 sec. Firmware updates will add: Full HD 4:2:2 10bit video recording capability (scheduled for April 2017); 400Mbps 4:2:2 10bit All-Intra video recording in 4K 30p/25p/24p; Full HD, high resolution video recording in Anamorphic mode; Hybrid Log Gamma in Photo Style mode which enables popular 4K HDR video recording and USB tethering (all scheduled for second half of 2017). \nThe Lumix GH5 will be available (body only) in late March for $1999.99.
