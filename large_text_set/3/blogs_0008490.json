They were said to have operated for hours before they shot at the senator’s aide and kidnapped the other occupants of the car he was driving,” a source said. \nThe police could not be reached for comment as the Federal Capital Territory Police spokesman, Manzah Anjuguri, did not respond to phone calls. \nHe had yet to reply an SMS as of the time of filing this report. \nWhen contacted, Sani referred one of our correspondents to his Facebook post, in which he confirmed the incident. \nIn the post, the senator said, “Yesterday, by 6.30pm, a gang of armed men with sophisticated weapons stopped vehicles along Bwari-Jere-Kaduna Road and opened fire on motorists. One of the victims happened to be my Kaduna South Coordinator, Alhaji Lawal Adamu. They left many people in the pool of blood and kidnapped others, who were into the bush, including a prominent Kaduna politician in the name of Alhaji Lawal Buba. \n“The police arrived at the scene afterwards and took the victims to Bwari General Hospital. Right now, the victims are receiving medical attention at the National Hospital Abuja. Some of them sustained life threatening injuries.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:44:49.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
