I am the hunter. I am Major.” The video then points viewers to IAmMajor.me , where they can upload a photo and a caption to answer the question, “ Who are you? ” Considering the film has been under fire for casting Johansson as a white, Americanized version of the Major, you might believe what happened next.\nAs is the case whenever a company lets the public input their own captions , things predictably went pear-shaped, with VzA starting things off:\nVia Twitter \nVia Twitter \nVia Twitter \nWhoopsidoodle.\nFrom there, other folks on Twitter replied with jokes about other instances of white actors playing Asian characters, like this reference to how Iron Fist actor Finn Jones briefly quit Twitter ( they always come back ) after scathing criticisms .\n\nVia Twitter \nVia Twitter \nVia Twitter \nVia Twitter \nVia Twitter \n\nVia Twitter \nVia Twitter \nVia Twitter \nVia Twitter \nVia Twitter \n(Via Paramount Pictures , Screen Crush , ValerieComplex , helpmeskeletor , Maria_Giesela , Nice_White_Lady , DLohRidah , IWriteAllDay_ , gleebix , and ZweiXross )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T13:01:19.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
