The MP said she believes Canada isn’t as different from the U.S. as people think.\n“In the U.S., the insecurities that come with inequality have led to the rise of people like Donald Trump, but also people like Bernie Sanders. The right is mobilizing around Trump-like messages — the O’Learys, the Leitches. What kind of vision are we putting forward?” she said.\nThe self-described millennial wants to see a resurgence in the New Democratic movement, bringing in young working-class people and activists focused on women, racialized groups and indigenous peoples. Ashton said she “grew up around activism” and wants to harness that energy, describing the party’s position as being at a “crossroads.” Her campaign slogan: “Building a movement together.”\n“We’ve seen the rise of people taking political action in the last few months, particularly since Donald Trump got elected. Even here in our own country, people are getting out and participating in activities and seeing the need to fight for justice in a big way,” she said.\n“We need to be reaching out and connecting with these people. … The NDP has struggled with relevancy over the last while and that’s something that we need to tackle.”\nAshton describes the two major challenges of our time as growing inequality and climate change — the same two biggies highlighted by competitor Guy Caron, a Quebec MP and the party’s former finance critic.\nCanadians are becoming cynical about promises made by the Trudeau government, she said, and she intends to put forward a “comprehensive vision” that she hopes will attract fellow millennials. Informing that vision was a cross-country tour on precarious work for the millennial generation, which Ashton undertook while serving as the NDP’s jobs critic.\n“This phrase that the government uses about the middle class and those wanting to join it? … I didn’t meet any millennials that identified as ‘middle class.’ Many identified as having grown up in a middle-class environment,” she said. “Increasingly they’re identifying as workers, as working class. The identity of our country is shifting.”\nRelated ‘Got your back’: Charlie Angus officially launches NDP leadership bid with homage to punk roots Let the games begin: Peter Julian first to officially, definitely, join the NDP leadership race Three’s a crowd? Guy Caron joins federal NDP leadership race, citing economic prowess Some of Ashton’s policies will include reversing privatization plans, opposing trade deals “that are selling us out” (including, per the NDP’s positions, the free trade deal with Europe), improving pharmacare, fighting racial discrimination in the justice and incarceration system, and rejecting pipelines “that violate indigenous rights and threaten our environment.”\nNiki Ashton/Twitter Manitoba MP Niki Ashton joins another Bernie Sanders supporter while campaigning for the Democratic presidential hopeful during the U.S. election. “The answer is not division, is not fear, is not xenophobia or Islamophobia or racism, sexism. It’s coming together to challenge the systems that are holding us back, to call for alternatives to austerity, to privatization, to deregulation. Alternatives for political and economic policies that are aiding and abetting climate change. I do believe the NDP is well-placed to do that.”\nIt is the second time Ashton has tossed her hat in the ring for the NDP helm, having run against Tom Mulcair in 2012.\nShe will face at least three opponents — fellow MPs Caron, Peter Julian and Charlie Angus — at a first official debate this Sunday and at a youth-focused debate in Montreal March 26.\nThe NDP will choose a replacement for Mulcair this October.\nEmail: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: mariedanielles \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:07:18.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
