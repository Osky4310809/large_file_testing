They are on the well-heeled streets of London, in the back of a charming sounding ‘Farley & Bell’ van, working to deliver people’s fresh but cheap fruit and veg. \nThe advert asks, “Would you still love a bargain if we brought these problems closer to home?” \nIt’s a clever twist on an all-too familiar supply-chain tale that many of us feel we have no control over. \n“If I had known about this I wouldn’t have ordered,” says one shocked buyer as she opens her front door to two children struggling to carry her heavy box of food. \n“Sometimes you just don’t think what’s behind the cheap price. You get drawn in by a deal and pretty packaging,” says another. \nThe film includes real people’s reactions in the form of a social experiment, as well as actors. Of course, the message is that you can make a difference, by making more conscious food choices in the supermarket, such as buying Fairtrade. \n\"Whether in the UK or in Malawi, no one deserves to be short-changed for a hard day’s work,\" says Jonathan Smith, head of campaigns at the Fairtrade Foundation. \n\"Farmers get a better deal when they sell their crops on Fairtrade terms. Through Fairtrade, farmers can invest in better farming practice, earn more money for their crops, and make sure their children are fed and can go to school. Communities can also invest in clean water and clinics, improving everyone’s health.\" \nFairtrade fortnight : February 27 – March 12 More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:08:21.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
