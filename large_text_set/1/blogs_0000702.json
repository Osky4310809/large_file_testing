He is about 5 years old. He was able to overcome his parent's divorce by sleeping in a drawer at night. He is also considered smarter than Kearney, since when he was sitting on Gil 's lap when he was dressed up as Santa Claus , he believed he is the real Santa Claus and his son knew immediately he was a fake. Kearney's son seems to be a young child but Kearney says \"speaking as a teenager and parent of a teenager\" although he probably has some other child that he was talking about.
