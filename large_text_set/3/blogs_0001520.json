Ted Cruz, R-Texas, called the controversy regarding Attorney General Sessions having contacts with the Russian ambassador a “nothing burger.” \n“I think what we’re seeing is a lot of political theater,” Cruz said Thursday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe . \n“So the notion that there was something somehow wrong with a senior senator on the Armed Services Committee meeting with foreign ambassador, I think that’s a nothing burger,” he added. “That’s part of the job.” Advertisement - story continues below \nSessions had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors last year including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian and German ambassadors, in addition to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, his spokeswoman stated. \nCruz noted he has met with six different ambassadors himself in the last two months. Advertisement - story continues below \nThe Texas senator’s comments came in response to a Washington Post story published Wednesday night reporting that the then senator had at least two contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential campaign. \nDuring his confirmation hearings, Sessions was asked by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government. \n“I’m not aware of any of those activities,” he responded . “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.” \nThe attorney general issued a statement on Thursday clarifying that he had no communications with the Russian government regarding the Trump campaign.

Franken asked me at the hearing.” \nSessions announced, based on his support of President Trump during last year’s election, that he has recused himself from “ any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.” What do you think?
