That’s what brought three of your favorites together this past weekend. Issa Rae of  Insecure , Michaela Coel of the UK hit comedy  Chewing Gum and Cynthia Erivo of the Broadway production of The Color Purple all hung out like old friends on Saturday.\n\nThey linked up to check out the Soulquarius festival on the Observatory grounds in Santa Ana, California. The event was pretty much a pure ’90s fest, with performances from the likes of Brandy, Monica, Mya, Erykah Badu and R. Kelly — to name just a few of the many acts.\nThey hit the road together, exuding all the Black Girl Magic you would expect while riding in the same truck, singing SWV and taking selfie videos together:\n\n\nWhat made this brief girls’ trip so cool is the fact that  Insecure  and  Chewing Gum  are often talked about in the same vein . They are the two major series out there that tell a different story about Black women, flawed but fabulous, and in a hilarious way. So to see these two together, add in the fabulous Erivo, it’s just too much greatness at once!\nWhile the Soulquarius event as a whole got mixed reviews due to a great deal of planning complaints (with people claiming they waited hours just to get in to see performances), we’re glad it brought our best friends (in our heads of course) together for one pretty epic day.\nThe post This Is What Happens When Issa Rae, Michaela Coel And Cynthia Erivo Take A Girls’ Trip appeared first on MadameNoire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:12:19.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
