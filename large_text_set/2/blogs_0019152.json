Anna Kendrick has voiced her love for the two friends, and we totally get it. Given that the pair have practically grown up together, there are so many cute pictures of them as kids , and they’re even cute when they face swap . Literally, they give us so many #friendshipgoals . Heck, they even have their own ship name, Mophie, and we’re pretty sure that they got matching tattoos, too .\nHold tight my London Kre \nA post shared by Maisie Williams (@maisie_williams) on Jan 22, 2016 at 3:42pm PST \nWE. JUST. LOVE. THEM.\nIt seems only fitting, then, that Maisie Williams would have the most adorable happy birthday message for her on-screen sister. Yesterday (February 21st) was Sophie Turner’s 21st birthday (HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIRL), and to celebrate her BFF’s birthday, Maisie decided to share an adorable #throwback picture of the pair with a hilarious caption.\n“Happy 21st Birthday @SophieT,” she wrote. “Forever looking up to you, in more ways than one ❤️” The picture is, of course, one of Maisie literally looking up to Sophie, and it’s too cute.\nHappy 21st Birthday @SophieT \nForever looking up to you, in more ways than one ❤️ pic.twitter.com/43cCih2KeJ \n— Maisie Williams (@Maisie_Williams) February 21, 2017 A !\nEarlier this year, Sophie opened up about her friendship with Maisie to NYLON magazine, and what she said is too adorbs.\n“I’ve always seen Maisie as this rebellious, cool kid, while I’m more passive-aggressive, or else just passive,” she said. “I hate that about myself, and I love that Maisie is just who she is. We spent the past five years basically sharing a hotel room (even though we each had our own), having endless sleepovers, lots of line rehearsals, and lots of food and messing about, too.” \nJealous, tbh.\nMeanwhile, it’s been confirmed that both Williams and Turner will attend a Game of Thrones panel at this year’s South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, March 12th. The show is expected to air it’s seventh season later this year on HBO.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:52:15.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
