The whooping cough vaccine was reformulated in the 1990s because of side effects that included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. But there's some evidence the newer vaccines doesn't protect as well and that recent outbreaks of whooping cough may be the result of reformulating the vaccines. \nAnother question is whether some kids are super-sensitive to vaccines. \nDr. Anjali Jain of The Lewin Group, a health consulting group in Falls Church, Virginia, compared kids who hadn't been vaccinated because of a family history of autism to kids who had gotten their shots. \nThey found the risk of autism was less than one percent in vaccinated kids, whether they had an older sibling with autism or not. \nOther researchers have answered questions about whether kids get too many vaccines at once— they don't. \nLawmakers have begun cracking down on parents who want to choose, saying these choices endanger not only the children not being vaccinated properly, but others in the community. \nThe CDC has been studying how common autism is for years now. It's found it is a distressingly common diagnosis with somewhere between 1 in 45 and 1 in 68 kids having the condition.
