During the campaign, Mr. Trump’s chief foreign policy pledges were to be tougher on China and the Islamic State than President Barack Obama had been. But so far, there are few indications that Mr. Trump intends to do so as president. Mr. Tillerson’s trip last week to China was , and the Trump administration’s effort against the Islamic State has so far been with a heavy reliance on supporting indigenous armies to fight their own wars instead of deploying large numbers of American forces to far-flung hot spots. \n  Indeed, Mr. Tillerson has already explained that one reason his department should see its budget slashed is that he expects the United States to be engaged in fewer foreign conflicts, not more. After an Oval Office meeting on Monday with Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq told an audience at the United States Institute of Peace that he had been “given assurances that the support will not only continue but will accelerate” in Baghdad’s battle against the Islamic State. \n  The word “accelerate” is likely to be bandied about quite a bit in the next few days at Foggy Bottom, and it is one that Mark Toner, the State Department’s veteran spokesman, used repeatedly on Monday to describe the Trump administration’s plans. \nAdvertisement Promising that “there’s going to be some new ideas put on the table,” Mr. Toner said Wednesday’s meeting was intended “to accelerate and focus more on how we can accelerate our efforts.” Some counterterrorism experts said they hoped that a promised acceleration was genuine. “I was not a particular fan of what the last administration did, which I would describe as relying on passivity, proxies and special forces,” said Michael E. Leiter, who stepped down in 2011 as head of the National Counterterrorism Center. “What I hope we see in this administration is selective, deeper engagements that give greater confidence to our allies so our partnerships are more meaningful.” \n  The Trump administration faces some difficult decisions in the coming months. These include how to safeguard the civilian population in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, now under attack, from further devastation; whether to include Kurdish forces in Syria in the coming attack on Raqqa, despite bitter opposition from Turkey’s government; and how to bolster Libya’s fragile government to resist a growing threat from the Islamic State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:43:12.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
