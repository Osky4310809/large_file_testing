Let's not bring this situation back again. \n\"I do not want to judge what the judge says. I got a sentence and I decided not to appeal just to get this behind me. There is no need for me to come back on that.'' \nDanny Welbeck's first goals in eight months spearheaded Arsenal's cakewalk past Southampton, with Theo Walcott also grabbing a hat trick. Arsene Wenger was given a four-match touchline ban earlier in the week. \nWenger hailed Welbeck as effectively a new signing, with the 26-year-old finally ready to end 20 months of knee injury problems. \n\"Yes it feels like I have many new strikers because I think [Lucas] Perez played very well as well and I left [Olivier] Giroud at home,'' said Wenger. \n\"The problem will now be to find the right combination which will use them well in games. The result is strong with the balance of the team. \n\"When you look around you on the bench and you have this sort of player [Welbeck] coming on or when he starts it is somebody else. He gives us more quality going forward. \n\"We look tonight and Perez and Walcott and Danny Welbeck and I have [Alexis] Sanchez on the bench, it is an exceptional quality. For a long time we did not have the offensive quality available.'' \nWenger hopes Welbeck's return will boost his options, even admitting Arsenal boast a deeper squad than Chelsea -- but he also insisted the Blues do not need as many options to maintain their Premier League advantage. \n\"I would say we have a larger squad but Chelsea don't need too much because they don't play in Europe,'' said Wenger, with Arsenal trailing leaders Chelsea by eight points in the league. \n\"They are not in the Europa League or the Champions League. They will be in the Champions League next season and we have a larger squad.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:09:04.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
