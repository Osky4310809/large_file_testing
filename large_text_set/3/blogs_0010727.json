Here are 13 examples of times the show took a meaningful diversion from the story that “Walking Dead” creator Robert Kirkman laid out on paper. \nIt’s a formula that’s worked well for the show, which ash become the highest rated cable show in history and regularly posts viewership numbers in the tens of millions. A worthy expense, it turned out, for AMC. \n“The Walking Dead” has kept viewers guessing by killing characters before they died in the comics. It’s kept some characters around beyond their expected expiration date. It’s given one character’s death to a completely different one. And it’s offed one who still to date has not died in the comics. \nIt’s even introduced characters that didn’t feature in the comics at all, like the brother Daryl Dixon and Merle Dixon, and thus viewers have no way of knowing what will be done with them. Daryl has grown to become a fan favorite character, so whenever he ends up biting the dust it’ll be devastating. Especially if he ends up being the one Negan killed in the season 6 finale. \nWhen it comes to “The Walking Dead” you truly never know what’s going to happen! \nRead original story ‘The Walking Dead’ Shockers: 14 Times TV Show Has Strayed From the Comics (Photos) At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.
