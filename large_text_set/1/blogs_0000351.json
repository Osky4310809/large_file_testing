Maldini never won it. Even for midfield players it is not easy, because everybody goes for the goalscorer,” said Mourinho. \n“Michael Owen was the golden ball winner because of his goals. Cristiano and Lionel Messi score goals. They are phenomenal players, but they score a lot of goals. I think until you change the concept and the vision it is very difficult. \n“But if Paul keeps improving in this way, if Manchester United keep improving and doing well in European football then I think he can be a phenomenal player.” \nMourinho has adapted his formation to accomodate Pogba, switching to a 4-3-3 formation with the Frenchman sitting on the left of the three, and has seen the former Juventus man flourish. \nVIDEO: Giroud scores sensational scorpion kick for Arsenal \n“He plays with freedom. He gets into dangerous positions. He has a good shot so he can score goals from outside (the box) and is good in the air. So he can score goals like against Middlesbrough or even from set pieces,” added Mourinho. \n“On Saturday he almost killed someone that was behind the goal, but he is a good free kick taker so he can also score goals like that. He's a good penalty taker, but no problem because we don't get penalties!\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T02:55:50.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
