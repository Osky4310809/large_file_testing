They are stylish, look admirable together and of course, are too much in love! They have done a few movies together and evidently share a comfortable chemistry â€“ as we all saw in Guru , Raavan and Kuch Naa Kaho etc. (My personal favourite is the item song Kajra Re , in case you are wondering!) \nIf you are an # AbhiAsh fan like us, you will be pleased to know that the two are likely to team up for Gulab Jamun , which is being produced by Anurag Kashyap . Although their is no official statement about the project, we hear that it is being directed by a newcomer. \nSuper excited to see these two reunite after 7 long years!
