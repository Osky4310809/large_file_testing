Walter Mazzarri has decided to make four changes to the Watford side that started the draw against Crystal Palace, with Craig Cathcart, Juan Zuniga, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Troy Deeney coming into the starting line-up to replace Miguel Britos, Daryl Janmaat, Valon Behrami and Odion Ighalo, respectively. Tottenham Hotspur substitutes: Vorm, Carter-Vickers, Davies, Winks, Dembele, Sissoko, Janssen. Tottenham Hotspur XI (4-2-3-1): Lloris; Trippier, Alderweireld, Wimmer, Rose; Dier, Wanyama; Son, Alli, Eriksen; Kane. Watford substitutes: Pantilimon, Rowan, Mason, Kabasele, Stewart, Sinclair, Ighalo. Watford XI (3-4-3): Gomes; Kaboul, Prodl, Cathcart; Zuniga, Guedioura, Doucoure, Holebas; Amrabat, Deeney, Capoue. There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon… Mauricio Pochettino may have been given a headache by injuries and suspensions, but he will no doubt be pleased with his side’s recent performances. Tottenham have won all of their last three Premier League games, with Southampton the most recent to fall, and another victory here today will move them above Manchester City and, temporarily, fierce rivals Arsenal. Despite their struggles, Watford are facing Tottenham at a potentially advantageous time. Their opponents today will be without Jan Vertonghen and Kyle Walker - both of whom are suspended - whilst Toby Alderweireld has only just returned from injury. As a result, this afternoon could prove to be the day that Watford score their first goal from open play since December 10th. Watford’s recent difficulties have been compounded by their struggles in front of goal, as they’ve only managed to score four times since beating Leicester City midway through November. Etienne Capoue remains his side’s top goalscorer this season with five goals, whilst main striker Troy Deeney finally ended his two-month drought with the all-important equaliser against Crystal Palace on Boxing Day. An unbeaten October helped Watford climb up to seventh place in the table, equal on points with Manchester United, but life has been slightly tough for the Hornets since then and they now find themselves in 12th, 14 points behind Jose Mourinho’s men. Just one of their last six games has ended in a victory, with four of those resulting in frustrating defeats. Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Watford and Tottenham Hotspur at Vicarage Road.
