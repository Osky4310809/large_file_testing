But Madge made it clear that a revolution of love has room for a few f-bombs. \nAt three different points during her speech, Madonna let loose some profanity to the cheers of those in attendance. After the third f-bomb was dropped, CNN and MSNBC cut away from her speech, with CNN’s Brooke Baldwin apologizing for airing the profanity uncensored. C-SPAN, meanwhile, aired her speech in its entirety. Also Read: Ashley Judd to Trump Supporters in Her Family: ‘You Voted for a “P—y Grabber’ (Video) \nMadonna opened her speech by urging Americans to reject “this new age of tyranny, where not just women are in danger but all marginalized people, where being uniquely different right now might truly be considered a crime. It took this horrific moment of darkness to wake us the f— up.” \nShe later said, “To our detractors that insist that this march will never add up to anything, f— you.” \nBut conservative commentators took exception most to Madonna ‘s remark that she had “thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, but I know this won’t change anything.” Instead, Madonna said that rather than falling into despair, she would “choose love.” Madonna ‘s guaranteed all the headlines will now be about her White House bomb threat & F-word rant. She’s wrecked the #WomensMarch . \n- Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 21, 2017 \nMadonna ?src=hash”># Madonna is a pathetic, washed-up, has-been who apparently thinks that threatening @realDonaldTrump will somehow spark her dead career. \n- David Wohl (@DavidWohl) January 21, 2017 I hope conservatives aren’t pretending to be outraged over Madonna ‘s “f*ck you”. They told us words don’t matter, then elected a vulgarian. \n- Sarah Reese Jones (@PoliticusSarah) January 21, 2017 \n“It seems as though we had all slipped into a false sense of comfort, that justice would prevail, that good would win in the end,” Madonna said. “Well, good did not win this election, but good will win in the end. So what today means is that we are far from the end. Today marks the beginning, the beginning of our story. The revolution starts here, the fight for the right to be free, to be who we are, to be equal.” \n“Let’s march together through this darkness and with each step know that we are not afraid, that we are not alone, that we will not back down, that there is power in our unity and that no opposing force stands a chance in the face of true solidarity.” \nYou can watch Madonna speech in its entirety in the clip above.
