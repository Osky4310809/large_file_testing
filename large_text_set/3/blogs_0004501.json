'Extremely unusual' \nThe man was detained in a maximum-security detention facility in Orange County, California, Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, on Sunday told AP news agency. \nThough his wife and children - aged seven years, six years and eight months- were initially taken to a similar facility in Los Angeles, they were later moved to a hotel, she said. \nThe Special Immigrant Visas, created by congress for citizens from Iraq and Afghanistan, can be granted to to those who have helped the US military as drivers, interpreters and other jobs, which often puts their lives at risk in those countries. \nOne of the lawyers defending the family said it was \"extremely unusual if not entirely unique\" for someone who holds this special visa to be detained upon arrival. \n\"The visas require extreme vetting to get,\" said Talia Inlender, a lawyer with the legal aid group Public Counsel. \nThe petition filed in US District Court in Santa Ana, California, south of Los Angeles, also said that US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has held the family in isolation without access to legal counsel. \n\"Despite repeated requests, the CBP has provided no information regarding why the family was detained, whether they have been questioned, and whether any reason at all exists to justify their continued detention,\" the petition said.
