You can even choose to stay in one of the Royal Guest Rooms , which are specially-themed and immerse you in favorite Disney fairytales such as “The Princess and the Frog,” “Aladdin,” and “Beauty and the Beast.”\n\nWhen the resort opened on February 2, 1992, it was named Disney’s Dixie Landings Resort. Although the name has changed, the resort has always be known for its charming waterfront walkways, Southern-style specialities at both Riverside Mill food court and Boatwright’s Dining Hall and extensive recreation options like horse-drawn carriage rides, pools, bike rentals and more. \n\nOne of my favorite features of this resort is being able to take a leisurely riverboat ride to and from Disney Springs , or a short walk along the Sassagoula River to visit the sister resort, Disney’s Port Orleans Resort – French Quarter . Tell us about some of your favorite memories from your stays at Disney’s Port Orleans Resort – Riverside through the years!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:04:03.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
