Desiigner is the latest artist to be interviewed by Canadian icon and Human Serviette Nardwuar. A career milestone for any musician, Desiigner took time out of his busy SXSW schedule in Austin last week for a chat with the infamous music journalist. In true Nardwuar fashion, he came bearing insanely well-researched gifts for the American rapper and alien – including a record from 1963 by Desiigner’s grandfather Guitar Crusher, who greatly impacted his love for music, a The Life of Pablo bootleg vinyl, and a Rush Hour 2 soundtrack since Nardwuar managed to dig up his obsession with Jackie Chan.\nHere's a *new* interview i did with Desiigner at @sxsw 2017 in Austin, Texas !
