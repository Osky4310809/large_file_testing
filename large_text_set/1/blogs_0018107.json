What Is Calendula Oil? \nMarigold is a genus of about 15 to 20 species of plants in the Asteraceae family. 1 This flower is native to Southwestern Asia, as well as Western Europe and the Mediterranean. \nThe common name “marigold” refers to the Virgin Mary, with whom it has been associated since the 14th century, when it was included as an ingredient in an English recipe for fighting plague. 2 \nApart from also being used to honor Mary during Catholic events, marigold was also considered by ancient Egyptians to have rejuvenating properties. 3 Hindus used the flowers to adorn statues of gods in their temples, as well as to color their food, fabrics and cosmetics. \nPot marigold or C. officinalis is the most commonly cultivated and used species, and is the source of the herbal oil. “Calendula” comes from the Latin word “calendae,” meaning “little calendar,” because the flower blooms on the calends or the first of most months. 4 \nIt should not be confused with ornamental marigolds of the Tagets genus, commonly grown in vegetable gardens. 5 \nCalendula, with fiery red and yellow petals, is full of flavonoids, which are found naturally in vegetables and fruits and are substances that give plants their lovely bright colors. 6 \nCalendula oil is distilled from the flower tops and is quite sticky and viscous. It has a very strange smell described as musky, woody and even rotten — like the marigold flowers themselves. This smell does not readily appeal to many individuals, even when used in a remedy. Uses of Calendula Oil \nHere are three classifications of calendula plant and oil uses: \n1. Health and wellness — It has tonic, sudorific, emmenagogic and antispasmodic properties, but it is mainly used for skin care and treatment. 7 \nIt has great anti-inflammatory and vulnerary action, making it helpful with stubborn wounds, acne, ulcers, bed sores, varicose veins, rashes, eczema and related conditions. 8 It helps soothe sore, inflamed and itchy skin conditions. \nCalendula massage oil also assists in soothing, and softening skin, making it a good addition to massage oils or when preparing a carrier oil blend. \n2. Cooking — Since the Middle Ages, the petals of marigold have been used as “the poor man’s saffron ” for coloring cheeses, butters and side dishes. \nDuring the Elizabethan era, both petals and leaves were used in salads, although the latter showed to be very strong. The petals flavored soups and stews. \n3. Practical uses — Marigold has been used as a dye. Dried petals can also be added in potpourris. Composition of Calendula Oil \nIn a study, 9 calendula oil was obtained in low yield (0.3 percent) by steam distillation with cohobation from flowers and whole plants. Identified by the researchers were 66 components, mainly sesquiterpene alcohols with α-cadinol as the main constituent, at about 25 percent. \nThe essential oil from the whole plant was differentiated from that of the flowers through the presence of monoterpenes hydrocarbons, aside from the alcohols. \nThe principal constitutes of calendula essential oil 10 are flavonoids, saponosene, triterpenic alcohol and a bitter principle. The useful components of calendula itself include a volatile oil, carotenoids, flavonoids, mucilage, resin, polysaccharides, aromatic plant acids, saponins, glycosides and sterols. 11 Benefits of Calendula Oil \nCalendula oil is traditionally used for abdominal cramps and constipation. 12 It’s your skin that will receive a good bulk of the benefits, though, thanks to the oil’s anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and related properties. Here are some of the promoted benefits of this oil: 13 \n1. Skin dryness or chapping — Calendula oil is a great moisturizer for dry skin and for severely chapped or split skin. It helps soothe the area and reduce the pain. \n2. Inflammation — It works well on sprained muscles or bruises; its anti-inflammatory action helps lessen swelling from injury. Calendula oil also helps treat spider veins, varicose veins, leg ulcers and chilblains. \n3. Baby care — The oil helps relieve diaper rashes, which can extremely irritate an infant. \n4. Minor cuts and wounds — The antiseptic and antimicrobial action of the oil help speed up healing of wounds and minor cuts, and also help relieve insect bites, acne and bed sores. \n5. Skin issues — Eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis and other skin problems can be soothed using calendula oil, applied topically. Calendula oil’s antifungal action is also great for helping treat athlete’s foot, ringworm and jock itch. How to Make Calendula Oil \nCalendula oil is extracted by steam distillation. 14 There is almost no way to obtain 100 percent pure calendula essential oil, so this makes calendula essential oil an infusion and not a pure extract. 15 \nIn order to get the oil from the flower, the petals are steeped in oil, preferably olive oil. The oil left over when distillation is done is calendula oil, which should be a golden orange color. \nYou can create homemade calendula oil using the following instructions from Keeper of the Home. 16 \nWhat you will need: \n• Carrier oil (olive oil, almond oil or sunflower oil are some great options) \n• A clean glass jar with a lid \n• Cold infusion method — This is the usually preferred technique because it protects the delicate calendula from heat damage. \n1. Put your desired amount of dried calendula petals in a clean, dry glass jar. \n2. Fill the jar with your carrier oil of choice to cover the Visit Site", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T08:32:11.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
