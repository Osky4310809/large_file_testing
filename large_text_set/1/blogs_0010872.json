After all, there's only ever been one president in the existence of the @POTUS account — Barack Obama — and he also has a personal account.\n@realDonaldTrump & I working hard tonight.

He'll keep that account while the @POTUS account, the @WhiteHouse account, and other president-related social media accounts will transfer to the Trump administration.\nOf course, the tenor of Obama's tweets differ greatly from Trump's account.\nThis is what happens when we focus on building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. https://t.co/op3Z74rPeI\n— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 26, 2016\nIntelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017\nCome Friday, while tweets from the Trump administration will surely populate those other accounts, we all know where to turn when someone says something bad about Trump.\nAll about those numbers Trump also touched on the topic in a wide-ranging interview with The Sunday Times (registration required), elaborating a bit more about why he'll keep using his own account rather than the official one. Spoiler alert: it's all about those follower numbers.\n“@realDonaldTrump I think, I’ll keep it . . . so I’ve got 46 million people right now — that’s a lot, that’s really a lot — but 46 million — including Facebook, Twitter and ya know, Instagram, so when you think that you’re 46 million there, I’d rather just let that build up and just keep it @realDonaldTrump, it’s working — and the tweeting, I thought I’d do less of it, but I’m covered so dishonestly by the press — so dishonestly — that I can put out Twitter — and it’s not 140, it’s now 280 — I can go bing bing bing . . . and they put it on and as soon as I tweet it out — this morning on television, Fox — ‘Donald Trump, we have breaking news’.”\nOf course, Trump is fudging numbers a bit, combining followers from multiple platforms to get that 46 million number.\nOn just Twitter, at the time this post was published, he has 20 million followers , while the @POTUS account has 13.5 million followers and President Obama's personal account (more on that shortly) has 80.5 million followers.\nIn 5 days, I expect @BarackObama will take back his Twitter account from @ofa . 80.5 million followers. 4x Trump's reach, for those counting.\n— Alex Howard (@digiphile) January 16, 2017\nObama also wins the battle of Facebook with nearly 53 million \"Likes\" to Trump's 17.5 million , and on Instagram where he has 12.2 million followers to Trump's 4.7 million followers.\n(That brings Trump's total to 42.2 million followers, compared to Obama's 145.2 million, across those three platforms.)\nSo what happens to the Obama digital legacy? On Friday, once Trump has been sworn in, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) will transfer all of Obama's tweets at @POTUS over to the account @POTUS44 . The same will go for Joe Biden's @VP tweets ( @VP44 ) and Michelle Obama's @FLOTUS tweets ( @FLOTUS44 ).\nIn fact, the NARA is busy making sure all of the digital and social media content created by the Obama White House across multiple platforms, from Medium to YouTube, will likewise be stored on new archival accounts so that they'll still live online and be viewed by the public.\nYou know, just in case the latest incendiary tweets from president number 45 become a bit too much to bear.\nBONUS: As predicted, Donald Trump wakes up and rants about Meryl Streep on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://t.co/tBcg8duiVj", "https://twitter.com/POTUS44", "https://twitter.com/POTUS", "https://twitter.com/OFA", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/819164172781060096", "https://twitter.com/BarackObama", "https://twitter.com/VP44", "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/donald-trump-interview-brexit-britain-trade-deal-europe-queen-5m0bc2tns", "https://twitter.com/KellyO/status/820779510769385473", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/1uUBuPxp.m3u8", "https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/?fref=ts", "https://twitter.com/barackobama", "https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/803397508349198337", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PEOTUS?src=hash", "http://www.newsweek.com/obama-presidential-social-media-transition-515807", "https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/", "https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump", "https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews", "https://twitter.com/MashableNews/status/797975338366038016", "https://t.co/op3Z74rPeI", "https://www.instagram.com/barackobama/", "https://twitter.com/FLOTUS44", "https://twitter.com/KellyO/status/820786293911224320", "https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/791361893986291712", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "https://twitter.com/KellyO/status/820785990746963969", "https://t.co/qjouR9btn1", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/1uUBuPxp.jpg", "https://t.co/Tv5s8vN7ch", "https://www.instagram.com/realdonaldtrump/", "https://twitter.com/digiphile/status/820803671667724288"], "published": "2017-01-16T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T04:57:16.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
