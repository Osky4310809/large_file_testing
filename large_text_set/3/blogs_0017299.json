The name translates to Black Forest (the region the dessert is from) cherry torte, and it features layers of chocolate cake, whipped cream, and cherries.\nBerliner or krapfen Quanthem / iStock Berliner (also known as krapfen) are pillowy, soft doughnuts filled with fruit jam and dusted with powdered sugar. These are a staple in bakeries across the country.\nBienenstich AndreasWeber / iStock It's no surprise that the name of this cake translates to bee sting, considering it's so sweet.

They also eat the doughy treats for dessert. Dampfnudel (or germknoedel as they're known in Austria) are dumplings stuffed with a fruit filling, and topped with poppy seeds, melted butter, sugar, and sometimes vanilla sauce.\nPlum cake vertmedia / iStock Known as zwetschgenkuchen in German, this fruit dessert is made with a thin, flat dough and topped with pitted plums.\nZimtsterne vikif / iStock Another popular German Christmas cookie, zimtsterne (cinnamon stars) taste faintly like gingerbread, and are made with almonds, cinnamon, ginger, and icing.\nBaumkuchen Oliver Hoffmann / Shutterstock Named for its rings, which resemble tree rings, baumkuchen (tree cake) is made by placing thin layers of dough on top of each other on a spit that roasts the cake over a fire. The finished cake is then covered in chocolate.\nSpaghetti ice cream Christian Cable / Flickr True to its name, spaghetti ice cream (spaghettieis) looks just like a plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce, but it's really vanilla ice cream with fruit sauce.\nRote grütze Karsten Planz / Flickr Rote grütze is a berry compote made from red currants and berries such as raspberries and strawberries.
