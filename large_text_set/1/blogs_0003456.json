But don’t be fooled—things are going to look (and feel) quite gray for a few more months. (Remember how it was 72 degrees last Christmas, then 1 degree below zero on Valentine’s Day ?) Getting to the gym on a frozen morning is hard enough, but try hitting the pavement in New York, London, Milan, and Paris for 30 days straight of fashion shows.
