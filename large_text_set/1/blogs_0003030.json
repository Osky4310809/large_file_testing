Guillermo Eleazar presents to media at Camp Karingal illegal firecrackers confiscated in different areas in the city. BOY SANTOS \nMANILA, Philippines – A woman was burned to death in Bayawan, Negros Oriental while houses were gutted in separate fire incidents during the New Year’s Eve revelry, which recorded the lowest number of injuries in 10 years – a development attributed by the Department of Health (DOH) to fears that President Duterte would harshly punish revelers who celebrate with firecrackers. \nA two-year-old boy also perished in a fire in Quezon City yesterday, but authorities could not determine yet if the incident was related to the use of firecrackers or fireworks. \nHealth Secretary Paulyn Ubial said 350 people were reported injured by firecrackers and fireworks this year compared to a 10-year average of 1,000. \nEven in Bulacan, the country’s firecrackers and fireworks capital, the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office reported a much lower number of victims compared to last year. \n“People are now afraid to light firecrackers because of the President,” Ubial said. “They have this impression that somehow they will get caught or they will be punished.” \nDuterte, 71, has drawn global criticism including from the United States and the United Nations for a war on drugs that has killed over 5,000 people.   \nDuterte won last year’s elections in a landslide on a promise to eradicate narcotics by killing tens of thousands of criminals. \nHe also vowed to roll out Davao-style law and order measures nationwide, including banning smoking in restaurants and hotels and curbing drinking in public places. \nDuterte last month said he would issue an order to ban people from using firecrackers, limiting their use to community fireworks displays like what he did in Davao City while he was still mayor. \n“The least that I can say or do is just to issue a warning that it’s very, very dangerous,” he said pending the order’s release. \nBut despite the “remarkable” decline in injuries, Ubial said there was “still a lot of misery” as she echoed the President’s concern that children were falling victim to firecracker use and indiscriminate firing of guns. \nAnd as in past years, victims ranging from one year old to the elderly suffered injuries due to firecrackers and fireworks while causing fires in other areas. \nPersonnel of the local Bureau of Fire and Protection (BFP) recovered the body of Arlene Pinanonang, 48, businesswoman, from the fire scene in Barangay Boyco, Bayawan, Negros Oriental. \nBFP investigation showed the incident occurred when firecrackers exploded and razed the victim’s store. Fifteen others were reported injured due to firecrackers in Negros Occidental. \nFires also broke out in Barangay Mansilingan, Bacolod City and Sta. Ana, Manila due to firecrackers and fireworks. \nIn general, fires during the New Year revelry went down by 17.24 percent this year, the BFP national headquarters said. \nThe BFP reported that from Dec. 31 to yesterday, there were 48 fires compared to 58 recorded in the same period last year. \nIn Bulacan, the Provincial Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) said from 100 last year, only 38 people were admitted to the different district hospitals in Bulacan and at the Bulacan Medical Center due to injuries related to firecrackers and fireworks. \nLiz Mungcal, Bulacan PDRRMO executive officer, said the victims were aged 11 to 15 and the decline in the number of victims could be attributed to “Oplan Ingat Paputok 2017” of the provincial government. Young victims \nUbial said a three-year-old child from Cabanatuan suffered a hand injury during the New Year’s Eve celebration and the worst case involved 15-year-old Emilyn Villanueva, who slipped into a coma after a stray bullet hit her head while watching a fireworks display in Malabon. \n“This is one of our saddest incidents,” Ubial said. \nHealth officials in Bicol said 16 persons were injured in various areas in the region, six of them children aged one to six. From Dec. 21 to yesterday, 56 people were reported injured by firecrackers, a 43 percent decrease from last year’s 99. \nIn Barangay Rosario, Cervantes, Ilocos Sur, 60-year-old Renato Palomo lost three fingers after a huge firecracker called “Goodbye De Lima” prematurely exploded in his hand. \nIn Tarlac province, 17 persons were injured, eight in Bulacan and two in Pampanga, according to Chief Superintendent Aaron Aquino of Police Regional Office 3. \nAt the Region 1 Medical Center in Dagupan City, 16 persons were brought for treatment of firecracker-related injuries, some of whom suffered amputations, due to the New Year merrymaking. The hospital also recorded six other victims from Dec. 24 to 31. \nTen individuals were hurt by firecrackers in Cagayan Valley; 18 in Isabela and two each in Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya. A hospital worker cleans a patient’s wound caused by a firecracker yesterday. JOVEN CAGANDE \nSuperintendent Chivalier Iringan, Police Regional Office 2 information officer, said the victims, both minors and adults, were injured by the banned pla-pla, piccolo and pyrotechnics like kwitis and luces. \nIringan also a reported a decrease in the number of firecracker victims this year. \nDavao City, where Duterte served as mayor for more than 20 years and whose daughter, Sara is current local chief executive, registered zero firecracker-related deaths or injuries along with Zamboanga City. \nIt is the 14th year for Davao City to avoid any casualties and injuries from firecrackers, fireworks and stray bullets. In 2001, the President banned the sale of firecrackers and pyrotechnics as mayor of the city. \nSara thanked the Dabawenyos for cooperating with the local government, noting that the city is proof that enjoyable and meaningful celebrations could be done without firecrackers and fireworks and only with the use of torotot (toy trumpets). \nThe countdown to 2017, attended by around 5,000 Dabawenyos at Rizal Park in Davao City, was highlighted by competitions such as the Most Creative Torotot, Best Torotot-inspired Costume, Best Torotot-inspired Cosplay, Best Torotot-Hip Hop Dance Group, and Best Torotot-inspired Zumba Dancer. \nFor her part, Zamboanga City Mayor Ma. Isabelle Climaco-Salazar said it was the city’s third year to experience zero-casualty after it imposed a total ban on the sale and use of firecrackers and any pyrotechnic devices. \nThe city initially imposed the ban on firecrackers in 2013 following the deadly siege in this city that traumatized residents. \nAfter seeing the positive effects, the city government through the city council approved an ordinance implementing a total ban. – Ramon Efren Lazaro, Celso Amo, Raymund Catindig, Gilbert Bayoran, Rey Galupo, Emmanuel Tupas, Edith Regalado, Roel Pareño, Ric Sapnu, Cesar Ramirez, Victor Martin", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T04:47:09.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
