I know, I know, some of you purists are saying, \"But Jed, RCR  had a ton of sequels and spinoff sports titles , they just didn't come to the USA other than River City: Tokyo Rumble .\"\nWhile this is true, none of those games are true sequels to the game we know and loved growing up. The English version of River City Ransom  was heavily localized to cater to a Western audience, meaning most everything dealing with Japan was removed and replaced with something a bit more American. The characters names were also changed from Kunio and Riki to Alex and Ryan. Essentially the game was whitewashed for the sake of sales.\nRiver City Ransom: Underground  is not only the sequel RCR  fans have been waiting for but one of the greatest beat 'em ups of all time.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:25:08.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
