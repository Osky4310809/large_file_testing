For that period of time, the White House will be without a first lady a lot of the time. There is now much speculation that Ivanka is eyeing the role temporarily, due to the fact that she's rumored to be distancing herself from the Trump Corporation. Ivanka currently serves as a vice president for the company.\n\"I’m going to be a daughter,\" she previously said of her role in her father's administration. \n\"But I've said throughout the campaign that I am very passionate about certain issues. And that I want to fight for them.… So, you know there are a lot of things that I feel deeply, strongly about. But not in a formal administrative capacity.\"\nDespite that statement, Ivanka has been present during Trump's meetings with everyone from Al Gore to the Prime Minister of Japan, Heat Street reported. \nThough the situation would be non-traditional, Ivanka would not be the first daughter to serve in the role of first lady. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Harry S. Truman both had daughters who took on the role in the White House.\nSeveral readers reacted to the idea of Ivanka being the first lady.\n\"Why NOT? She is erudite adhoc answering questions versus Melania non-native English speaker talks with an accent & has Speech writer still gets it wrong. Ivanka is all American girl born in the USA. If daddy Trump needs a translator, Melania can fit in,\" one reader commented on Daily Mail's Facebook page.\n\"I am starting to believe that Trump can't function without Ivanka. I mean she's everywhere he is at. Why? What's the big secret that beholds them? The weirdest daughter and father relationship,\" another added.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T10:08:48.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
