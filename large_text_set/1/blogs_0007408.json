Nelson fractured at least two ribs in a wild-card playoff win against the New York Giants on Sunday, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport . Rapoport said it will take an “incredible effort” for Nelson to play. \nThe Packers did just fine without Nelson on Sunday, but it’s a big blow to the Packers offense. Nelson had 97 catches, 1,257 yards and 14 touchdowns in the regular season. The 14 receiving touchdowns led the NFL. He’s the Packers’ best receiver, and he won’t be easy to replace. \nNelson was injured Sunday when he was extending for a catch and Giants safety Leon Hall stuck his helmet into Nelson’s side. Nelson remained down in pain, then was carted off. \nThe Packers-Cowboys matchup is probably the best one of the divisional round. The Packers’ challenge will be a lot tougher if their top receiver can’t suit up. View photo Jordy Nelson reportedly suffered two fractured ribs against the Giants.
