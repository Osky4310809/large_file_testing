Part 8/365 : An atheist reviews a Christian devotional. (If you are new to this page, here’s a little background. ) \nDear Karen,Ugh… if the underlying theme of today’s devotional is about avoiding conflict, I must say that did my best to comply until my “ friend ” messaged to inquire why I hadn’t lived up to my end of our little bargain yet today. Let’s get right to it before the scotch kicks in fully… \nVerse Of The Day: “ The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him. “ – Nahum 1:7 (NIV) \nFirst of all… Nahum? Really? I’d re-up my original wager double-or-nothing that less than 40% of average American Christians have ever even heard of the book. Which, is actually a good thing in this case, because – Jesus Christ – this might be the greatest example of opportunistic cherry-picking of scripture of all time! My wife just rushed into my office to see why I was laughing so loudly. In case you don’t remember the proper “context” of today’s supplied scripture, let’s just expand the scripture to include the bookend verses. \n“The LORD is a jealous God, filled with vengeance and rage. He takes revenge on all who oppose him and continues to rage against his enemies! The LORD is powerful and never lets the guilty go unpunished. He displays his power in the whirlwind and the storm. The billowing clouds are the dust beneath his feet. At his command the oceans dry up, and the rivers disappear… In his presence the mountains quake, and the hills melt away; the earth trembles, and its people are destroyed. Who can stand before his fierce anger? Who can survive his burning fury? His rage blazes forth like fire, and the mountains crumble to dust in his presence. The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him. But he will sweep away his enemies in an overwhelming flood. He will pursue his foes into the darkness of night. Why are you scheming against the LORD? He will destroy you with one blow; he won’t need to strike twice!” – Nahum 1:2-8 \nOh, but, “The Lord is good…” I often hear the Christians claim that atheists are guilty of “cherry picking” Bible verses to make God look bad. Well, I’m sorry, but for those who have actually read the Bible, it is clear that God doesn’t anyone’s help. But let’s put Nahum away for a moment and check in with Jesus, since this book is meant for followers of the New Testament. \n“You are my friends if you do what I command you.” Jesus, John 15:14 (NLT) via Amazon \nToday’s Theistic Themes: The content of the today’s devotional simply expanded on yesterday’s rejection of others because people will afflict you with, “bitterness, jealousy, and envy.” Oh, but Good News! “God wants you to share it with Him…. So, turn your cares over to God today. Feel today’s weight lifted from your shoulders.” Well, yes – how wonderful it must be to lay all of your burdens at the feet of an imaginary friend who will never tell you that you’re wrong. At the end of the day, what does it solve to run away from the real world in order to avoid conflict and personal responsibilities with your fellow man? \nAhh, forget it, I’ve had enough cherry-picked verses and repetitively immoral nonsense for one evening, thank you very much. But, I’ll leave you with this: Short Secular Alternative: Conditional love is not love at all. Of gods and monsters – if anyone promises to “destroy you with one blow,” if you don’t love them first – they are not worthy of your praise. No person in their right mind would ever choose to live in fear, how on earth could they be expected to love in fear? \nI’m afraid I’m out of scotch, so… see you tomorrow . – Horus Gilgamesh \nP.S. Seriously?!? Yet another shameless plug for Jesus Daily in the Daily Interaction section? We get it, branding is a form of brainwashing. No wonder there are 135 verses to every Christian hymn. If you are a fan of this little project, be sure to check out everything else I’ve got going. (Spoiler Alert: I could use your help.) \n= = = = = \nFAIR USE NOTICE: This is a book review.
