It was a brief and cordial meeting capped by a photo opportunity,” Abella said. ADVERTISEMENT \nAsked if the two discussed the pork barrel scam controversy, in which public funds for legislators’ pet projects were allegedly funneled to fake nongovernment organizations, he reiterated that the meeting was “described only as a social call, and the gifting of books to the President.” \nA brief Palace video of portions of the meeting showed Enrile handing three books to Mr. Duterte. \nEnrile also told the President that he had a letter for him about “current problems.” He did not elaborate. \nThe meeting between Mr. Duterte and Enrile also comes after the President backed the Solicitor General in seeking the reversal of the illegal detention conviction of Janet Napoles, another suspect in the pork barrel scam controversy. \nNapoles was accused of masterminding the scheme to use bogus NGOs for the lawmakers’ pork barrel funds, which then allegedly went to private pockets. \nEarly this week, Mr. Duterte was asked what he planned to do with Napoles, whether he would look for other pork barrel suspects or her co-conspirators. \nMr. Duterte replied that he would “try to assess,” because it seemed the prosecution had been “selective.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:23:51.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
