Michelle Ugenti-Rita argues her bill encourages good government. Fontes blasts it as \"political sour grapes.\" Despite the maneuvering, other county officials say a major shakeup of election operations appears unlikely. \nThe crux of the debate is the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors decision in 1955 to delegate election duties to the Recorder's Office, the same way two other Arizona counties — Coconino and Navajo — do. The board renewed that agreement four times. \nAfter Fontes won office last year, campaigning heavily on a promise to reform the county's election system, GOP insiders began to speculate supervisors could take back control by canceling the agreement. \nUgenti-Rita found the agreement didn't have an end date and the board hadn't voted on it since 1985. \n\"That's such bad government,\" the Scottsdale Republican said. \nMORE: Read the agreements from 1955 to 1985 \nA board should regularly review agreements, especially when giving authority to another official, to \"determine whether it's a good relationship or it needs to be adjusted,\" Ugenti-Rita told The Arizona Republic . \"Having a system of review empowers the elected officials, which in turn empowers the public.\" \nRep. Michelle Ugenti-Rita. (Photo: Special for The Republic) \nShe wondered how many other local governments failed to revisit agreements. Ugenti-Rita said many are approved \"in perpetuity,\" depriving future decision-makers of the opportunity to assure agreements are working well. \nShe introduced House Bill 2179, which requires counties, cities and towns to review them every eight years. \nThe bill has drawn stiff opposition from the League of Arizona Cities and Towns and elected officials, who warn of a crushing workload to review hundreds of intergovernmental agreements. They note some intergovernmental agreements, particularly for water, must last for decades. \n\"It's unnecessary busy work for no good reason,\" League Executive Director Ken Strobeck said. \nRELATED: Fontes pans state elections-reform plan \nFontes said he welcomes a review of the elections agreement. \n\"We're actually looking at all our IGAs on our own,\" Fontes said. \"If the Board of Supervisors wants to take the Elections Department and all the problems it has, they can have it. ... They can pull the agreement whenever they wish.\" \nBut he accused Ugenti-Rita of pushing a partisan agenda. \nMaricopa County Board Chairman Denny Barney agreed it makes sense to re-evaluate the Recorder's Office agreement after major changes to county leadership in recent years. The board's four Republicans and one Democrat recently met behind closed doors with County Attorney Bill Montgomery to talk about it. \nBut no matter what, Fontes will play a role in elections, Barney said. \"I don't see any outcome that doesn't have him involved.\" \nUgenti-Rita's bill passed a key committee along party lines even as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed reservations. She plans to amend the bill to address some of the opposition's concerns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:41:52.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
