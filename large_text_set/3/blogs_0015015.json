Whereas its previous collection drew inspiration from youth and nightclubs, this one is inflected with a football feel throughout. The collection will be rolled out at select European retailers in the coming months.\nIn other fashion news, Emily Ratajkowski stuns in DKNY’s SS17 Intimates campaign .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T16:01:13.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
