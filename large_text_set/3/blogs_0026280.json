The company’s CEO paid his maiden visit to the nation last year and expressed desires to bolster the company’s business in the country.\nThere is no easy way for Apple to upkeep momentum in India.\nEven though India remains one of the few places that has shown strong iPhone sales , there is no easy way for Apple to continue the momentum.\nFor one, more than 50 percent of iPhones sold in the nation last year were iPhone 5s models. The four-year-old iPhone sells for under $300 in the country.\nAnalysts say the company needs to lower the prices of the iPhone, which are higher in India due to domestic import laws. Apple's solution of sorts was to try to convince the Indian government to permit sales of refurbished iPhones — a proposal India was quick to discard .\nNow Apple’s biggest bet at making iPhones affordable (and possibly to get India to say yes to refurbished iPhones) is if it could start manufacturing locally.\nThe Indian government offers various benefits to overseas companies to setup manufacturing plants in India as such efforts help in creation of new jobs and foster the development of cities and states.\nMashable was first to report about Apple’s plans to manufacture iPhone SE in India starting as early as April. It appears Apple will have to make do with the same usual incentives that other international brands get.\nWATCH: You can now take selfies... with your feet?", "external_links": ["http://www.asianage.com/business/companies/230317/centre-says-no-to-apples-sops-demand.html", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/ouBql3iq.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/ouBql3iq.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-23T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:09:34.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
