But ABC's The Bachelor had its lowest finale Monday with 8.4 million same-day viewers (and 7.9 million for its After the Final Rose special), down from last year's 9.6 million. \nMore sendoffs. NBC's This is Us set a series-high 12.8 million same-day viewers for Tuesday's first-season wrap-up (followed by 5.9 million for the debut of comedy Trial & Error ). Also exiting: Fox's Lethal Weapon (6 million) and Star (3.9 million, both Wednesday); ABC's The Real O'Neals (2.7 million Tuesday). \nDuane Notice of the South Carolina Gamecocks shoots the ball against Luke Kennard of the Duke Blue Devils in the NCAA men's basketball tournament.
