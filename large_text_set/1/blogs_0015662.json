March 7, 2016 | 09:41AM PT \nGal Gadot ’s Wonder Woman won’t be looking to any of the male superheroes for help in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.” \nIn an interview with Glamour , the actress spoke about the comic book character’s strength and independence, and the importance of her not relying on Ben Affleck’s Batman or Henry Cavill’s Superman. \n“For ‘BvS,’ it was important for me that we show how independent she is,” Gadot said. “She is not relying on a man, and she’s not there because of a love story. She’s not there to serve someone else.” \n“She has so many strengths and powers, but at the end of the day she’s a woman with a lot of emotional intelligence,” Gadot added. “She’s loving.” \nGadot will play Wonder Woman, aka Diana Prince, in “Batman v Superman,” as well as star in a Wonder Woman standalone film in 2017 opposite Chris Pine. She will also appear in two planned Justice League movies. \nGadot said that a movie should have been made years ago based on the popular character. “It should have happened a long time ago,” she said. “Now people are looking for [a superheroine], waiting for one, and I’m so happy and grateful to be the one who is actually doing it.” \n“Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” opens in theaters on March 25.
