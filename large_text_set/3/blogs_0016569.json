Few additional details.\nâ€” Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower) March 20, 2017\nA media spokesman from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the agency had \"no comment on potential security precautions,\" but said they would provide any updates. We've reached out to Royal Jordanian and other Middle Eastern-based airlines for further details.\nMeanwhile people are responding to the Royal Jordanian post and seem super frustrated with the sudden rule change. Many commented that the airline would lose customers over this policy. One person asked if they could still wear their watch onboard.\nSince Royal Jordanian did not make clear that this appears to be a new federal rule, people are also posting their confusion about why this is happening.\n@RoyalJordanian can you provide further details?
