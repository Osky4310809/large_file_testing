Her GPS soon ran out of battery after it led her down a road that didn’t even exist. \nShortly thereafter, her car ran out of gas. \nOn March 12, she was officially stranded. Facebook \nVanHecke spent the next five days waiting for someone to find her, surviving off emergency food and water in the meantime. \nOn March 17, she abandoned her car and walked 11 miles in an attempt to find a phone signal so she could call for help. \nThe 24-year-old was eventually rescued by an air ambulance pilot while walking back to her car, where she left behind notes indicating she needed help and rocks spelling out “Help” and “SOS.” Facebook \nBefore embarking on her trip, VanHecke posted pictures on Facebook in her car, which was stacked with food, pillows and blankets. \nJust over a week later, she posted again to tell the story of how she managed to survive five days alone in the desert with dwindling supplies. Facebook \nVanHecke, who says she’s always been an avid reader, told Elite Daily her books helped her survive the traumatic experience. \nShe said, \nI frequently used books as an escape. This misadventure proved no different. \nI spent my down time reading so I would not catch myself over thinking myself in to a state of panic. \nThe Texas native burned through the last of her car’s gas trying to find her way back after the GPS led her down a nonexistent road. Arizona Department of Public Safety \nJonah Nieves, a member of the Air Rescue team with the Arizona Department of Public Safety, eventually rescued the 24-year-old. \nHe said, \nShe ran out of gas, but she was a survivor. \nShe did a lot of things that helped her survive. \nDuring the time she was stranded, VanHecke rationed her remaining food wisely and flashed her headlamp into the sky at night. Arizona Department of Public Safety \nHowever, it was the notes VanHecke left behind on her car that led to her rescue. \nNieves spotted her empty vehicle glinting in the sunlight after 40 minutes in the air. \nHe said, \nIf she didn’t leave notes, then you’re like, ‘Is this the person we’re looking for?’ \nThere are a lot more questions up in the air. He then found VanHecke by the side of the road, where she was waving to his helicopter and crying with joy. She was given the all-clear after being taken to the hospital. Facebook Following the terrifying ordeal, VanHecke told Elite Daily she feels anxious more often now. She explained, It’s hard to fall asleep and stay asleep because I don’t want to wake up in the desert alone again. Still, the young adventurer remains positive. She said, I will still travel because one bad experience won’t stop me from nourishing my soul with worldly experiences. She advised travelers embarking alone on similar trips to always bring more water than you think you could possibly need, a gas can and a hard copy of a map of the area. The 24-year-old also recommended carrying a light with a strobe function so you can be seen at night, as well as something reflective for morning discovery. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
