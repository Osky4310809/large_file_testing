The space will also serve as a commissary kitchen for Al's Burger Shack , Burger Truck and AlMel's Catering company. \n“In many ways Mel’s is a tribute to Mama and all the female southern cooks whose stoves I learned from,” Melody Bowers said. “Our soups, salads and entrees will focus on traditional flavors with some cool twists. The commissary side of the business will serve an overdue need in Al and I’s catering and shack business, but Mel’s Luncheonette will be a labor of love.” \nThe lunch menu will change daily and will feature items like pork green chili, avocado salad and chicken and pastry. Fans of the catering menu's deviled eggs will be happy to know that they will likely be serving those up on a regular basis. \nCopyright 2017 by Capitol Broadcasting Company. All rights reserved.
