On the Monday, February 13, episode of Counting On , the spunky photographer's wedding date was only a few weeks away, and she was in full nesting mode. First up, Jinger packed her things to take them to Jeremy Vuolo 's apartment in Texas. As she packed, Jana reminisced about how she was going to miss shopping with Jinger, while Joy said she was going to miss getting coffee together. (ICYMI, Jinger really loves coffee.)

Though they admitted Jinger wasn't likely to be very surprised by the gift, they did say she had no idea what kind they were bringing. They ended up settling on a \"small SUV\" because they thought it would match her needs.

Jed didn't expect any trouble, though, citing the fact that Jeremy and Jinger were both trustworthy adults. Still, the trip — which should have taken 12 hours — ended up taking 17, and Jed was clearly ready to get out of the car when they finally pulled up to Jeremy's apartment.

I want to thank everyone for their love and their prayers and support for us during this labor and delivery.\" Jana, Jinger, Jessa Seewald and Joy Anna TLC \nA Bit About Jeremy \nAnother segment gave some more background information about Jinger's fiancé. The youngest of three boys, Jeremy studied finance in college before going on to play professional soccer. He played in Finland and in New York, but eventually gave that up to lead a small church in Texas. \"He has a great sense of humor, but knows when to be serious,\" Jinger cooed to the camera, clearly very in love. \n\"I did have an idea of the type of guy that Jinger would be looking for,\" Jessa mused. \"Obviously, the most important thing would be a love of God and have a heart for ministry.\" She also surmised that Jeremy and Jinger were a good match because they both loved fashion and coffee. Coffee was a big thing in this episode. You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:39:59.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
