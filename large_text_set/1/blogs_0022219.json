At the time, the move was legal by the NCAA rulebook and theoretically helped Michigan earn the ear of coveted Florida recruits while also closing the gap between its expense account and annual revenue stream; naturally, the big wigs in Ann Arbor happily signed off. \nIn response, ACC and SEC coaches and ADs lost their collective shit, spouting off about saving their players’ spring break, high school athlete and coaching access rules, and some other pointless dribble that avoided the truth, which was that they would very much like for powerhouses from other conferences to stay far away from their favorite recruiting spot. The blatant faux-complaints were made the whiners easy targets for a Twitter assassin like Harbaugh .

The 58-20 vote (11 of the 15 voting athletes dissented, voting to keep spring trips) effectively kneecapped any future recruiting-cum-budget balancing spring break trips for Michigan.

As CBS Sports reports , the school spent $348,553 on last year’s domestic trip. Compared to how much the school spends on its coaching staff—Harbaugh can potentially haul in roughly $9 million per year on his own—it’s a drop in the bucket. An international trip figures to be a significantly larger drop. \nAnd similar drops in said bucket—annual four percent raises for coaches, paying Brady Hoke’s severance, future stadium updates, and continued increases in staff size—add up, to the point where all the money is spent and there is somehow none left to pay the athletes.
