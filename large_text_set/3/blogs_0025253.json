Donald Trump In a Truck: Funny Photos of the President Published Updated 6:47 pm EDT, March 23, 2017 4 Comments By Daniel S. Levine 6.1k Share Tweet Follow Donald Trump Steps Into a Truck While House Republicans were scrambling to get support for the American Health Care Act , President Donald Trump was busy at the White House. He met CEOs and drivers from the largest trucking companies in the country and the meeting ended with an amazing photo op. Trump himself climbed into an 18-wheeler in front of the White House and pretended to drive it. According to a pool report, two 18-wheelers drove up to the White House and the president shook hands with the CEOs and drivers. He congratulated those with spotless accident records. Trump then climbed into the truck and honked the horn a couple of times. He closed the door and waved to the press. He was back inside the White House just after 3:00 p.m. ET. On Wednesday, when announcing the meeting, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that the trucking industry is the largest employer in 29 states.
