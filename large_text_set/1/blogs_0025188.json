The good thing is that fish tacos can be a lean option that comes with a few vegetables. The bad thing is that chains usually screw up fish tacos by using crummy fish and deep fryer and flavorless salsa. \nWe fixed the fish taco problem with three solutions. Advertisement \nPrivacy Policy | About Us \n1. We used mahi mahi instead of tilapia. Mahi mahi is meaty and hearty, yet still light and flaky. Tilapia is about as interesting as a margarita without tequila. \n2. We used a hot pan instead of a deep fryer. Good fish doesn’t need breading to taste great—just a little salt, pepper, and ancho chili powder. \n3. We used two homemade toppings instead of mass-market salsa. The first is a chipotle sour cream. The second is a corn and cherry tomato salsa. Both will blow you away. \nHungry, right? Here’s how to make it. \nWhat You’ll Need: Kernels sliced from 2 cobs corn 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved 2 Tbsp cilantro, freshly chopped 4 mahi mahi fillets 1/2 Tbsp ground chipotle powder Juice from 1 lime 1 cup sliced red cabbage 4 corn tortillas \nHow to Make It: \n1. In a large nonstick pan over medium-high, heat the oil. When the oil shimmers, add the corn. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly charred, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cilantro and mix well. Transfer to a bowl. Wipe out the pan. \n2. Season the mahi mahi fillets with half the chipotle powder, plus a pinch each of salt and pepper. Return the pan to medium-high heat and add the fish. Cook until opaque throughout, about 2 minutes a side. Transfer to a plate. Wipe out the pan. \n3. In a medium bowl, combine the lime juice, sour cream, and cabbage. Mix well and set aside. \n4. Return the pan to medium high. Heat the tortillas until pliable, 30 seconds a side. Top the tortillas with a fish fillet each, plus the salsa and sour cream sauce. \nFeeds 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:40:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
