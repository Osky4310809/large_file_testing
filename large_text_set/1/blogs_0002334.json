Yakubu Dogara \nDogara maintained that as fathers and custodians of the people’s cultures and traditions, traditional rulers have a major role to play in mobilising their subject to pray for and support efforts of the government to tackle the mirage of problems it inherited. \nThe Speaker expressed confidence in the ability of the Buhari administration to extend the same vigour and spirit with which it is fighting corruption and insurgency in combating the current economic challenges in the country. \nResponding, the Emir commended the House of Representatives under the leadership of Dogara for supporting the executive arm of the government through legislative interventions in the administration’s efforts to bring succour to the citizenry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T07:49:14.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
