It's integral to a safe flight. \nProbably the most crucial aspect of their job is passenger safety, and making sure they know who's who, predetermining any issues, and planning for possible situations. \nTo do this, flight attendants are trained to 'notice' things about you as soon as you board a plane. They make judgements, and consider eventualities accordingly. \nSjaak Schulteis, a flight attendant for 30 years, told The Sun that language is usually the very first thing on their agenda. They know if you've been hitting the gym (Photo: Getty) Read More \n\"We pay attention to their language and check if they hold a magazine or newspaper,\" said Sjaak. \n\"I know their language I try to welcome the guests and hope I guessed right.\" \nFlight attendant Janice Bridger added: \"If a person cannot understand English, they cannot understand shouted commands. \n\"Nor can they read the instructions on how to open the exits. That may disqualify someone from sitting in the exit row.\" \nSjaak explained that whether a passenger is intoxicated is also noted early on. \n\"If a guest coming aboard is drunk or intoxicated by any drug, they might not allowed to enter the plane,\" said Sjaak. \n\"The first impression is often the right one and we do refuse passengers who might be a danger for the safety of that flight.\" Being drunk on a plane is not viewed admirably Read More \nAside from what language you speak and whether or not you're drunk, also important is how physically fit you are. Especially if you're super hench. \nJanice explained: \"I watch for disabilities that may disqualify someone from sitting in the exit row. \n\"They need to be able to physically lift a heavy hatch (up to 60 lbs) or open a heavy door (several hundred pounds).\" \nAnd if you're really strong, Janice might have another, perhaps more worrying job for you. \n\"If I see someone who is muscular, powerful, strong and physically fit, I memorise their face and make a mental note of where they are sitting,\" she said. \n\"If a situation looks like it could develop, I’ll privately and discreetly ask one of these people if they would be willing to help us if necessary. \n\"Help might involve subduing or restraining an unruly passenger. We hope it never happens, but we will prepare just in case it does.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:53:23.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
