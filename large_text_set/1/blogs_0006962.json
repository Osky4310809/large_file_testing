warmest year on record. It was also a costly year with 15 weather-related events with a preliminary price tag of a billion dollars or more. \nThe annual report from NOAA's National Centers For Environmental Information (NCEI) released Monday says that the average temperature for the Lower 48 in 2016 was 54.9 degrees Fahrenheit, 2.9 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th-century average (1901-2000). Only 2012 was warmer with an average temperature of 55.3 degrees Fahrenheit. 13 PHOTOS Severe, hot summer weather in the US in 2016 See Gallery Severe, hot summer weather in the US in 2016 A woman rests in the shade during a hot and sunny day at Central Park in New York July 17, 2016.

The northeastern United States sweltered on Tuesday in a scorching summer heat wave, complete with stagnant, sticky air and no winds for relief, forecasters said. Even in a summer already filled with stretches of very hot weather, this week will be stubbornly brutal, with no relief in sight until the weekend brings thunderstorms to the region, they said.

All other states finished 2016 ranked among their seven warmest years on record. \nOutside the contiguous United States, Alaska observed a record warm year as well. This is the third year in a row that our nation's 49th state has set a new record warm benchmark for a calendar year. \nNOAA says that 2016 was the 20th year in a row that the annual average temperature in the Lower 48 has exceeded the long-term average. Additionally, temperatures have trended upward by 0.15 degrees Fahrenheit each decade in the U.S. since 1895 when records began.
