Not only do we learn that James Franco is the captain of the ship and feeling a bit under the weather, but the rest of the crew are a bunch of party animals. We get to see Danny McBride appeal to everybody’s bad side while getting seriously drunk, Katherine Waterston give a heck of a speech to inspire the crew, and everybody else giving the film that “fun” moment before everybody turns into xenomorph chow .
