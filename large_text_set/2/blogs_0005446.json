(Photo: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) \nLady Gaga's costumes were one of a Million Reasons to love her Super Bowl halftime performance . The singer rocked three looks by Atelier Versace that made us want to dig up our BeDazzlers. \nFirst, she opened her 13-minute show in a shiny, iridescent bodysuit and knee-high boots, which were both adorned with Swarovski crystals. Some on the Twitterverse thought this number gave off David Bowie vibes, though makeup artist Sarah Tanno said she took inspiration from all of the iconic looks throughout Gaga’s career when creating the look using Marc Jacobs Beauty products. \n\"I wanted her to be able to look at this 10 years from now and have it feel timeless,\" Tanno said in an email breaking down the beauty. \nGaga's glam was the perfect complement to her crystal eye mask. The futuristic, dazzling accessory extended from her cheeks all the way to her temples. \nWe give this ensemble 'applause, applause, applause.' (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) \nGaga modified her look with a golden jacket bearing shoulder spikes that she wore while playing a keytar. \nHow can we get our hands on this? (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) \nNext, the American Horror Story star embodied the spirit of the Super Bowl in her final ensemble, a cropped, white jacket with shoulders sculpted to resemble football shoulder pads and matching hot pants. \nTouchdown Gaga. (Photo: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports) \nGaga's stylist, designer Brandon Maxwell, was extremely pleased with the singer's looks and articulated his excitement in an Instagram post.

See more winning Super Bowl outfits below: Facebook   Beyoncé’s performance during the 2016 Super Bowl was exciting, political and, of course, fashionable. Not only did her dancers' costumes cause a controversial stir for their nod to the Black Panther movement, but her own fierce outfit made us all ready to get in 'Formation.' Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports Beyoncé was killing it a few years back too. During her 2013 performance, she slayed in another black one-piece -- this time in leather with lace details. Jordan Strauss, Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP One word to describe Michael Jackson’s halftime show costume? Iconic. So iconic that it even acted as inspiration for Queen B’s Super Bowl costume over 20 years later. H. DARR BEISER, USA TODAY Fullscreen Katy Perry makes the list with perhaps the most meme-able halftime costumes and back up dancer costumes (yes, we’re talking about you, Left Shark). Let’s not forget the flame dress she wore when she rode out on that giant lion or the sparkling gown she wore as she soared with a shooting star -- both of which were also stunning and meme-worthy. David J. Phillip, AP During Bruno Mars’s 2014 halftime performance, he proved that sometimes less is more. His look dazzled while staying clean and classy. Simple elegance at its finest. Elsa, Getty Images Fullscreen Janet Jackson’s performance may be remembered more for what parts of the costume she didn’t wear than anything else. During her career-changing wardrobe malfunction during a number with Justin Timberlake, her outfit (or lack thereof) would be remembered forever in Super Bowl history. DAVID PHILLIP, AP Fullscreen During his 2007 performance, Prince rocked elements of his signature style at the Super Bowl. We love the bright colors he brought to the stage not only with his outfit, but with his crazy, purple guitar that looked like an instrument of the future -- talk about an awesome accessory! Chris O'Meara, AP Diana Ross’s halftime costume sent us 'Shockwaves' and 'Endless Love' for her look. The colorful, floor-length gown was as bright and beautiful as her. Al Bello, Getty Images Last, but not least, Madonna. Swapping her iconic cone bra for an elaborate crown, the artist was channeling an Egyptian queen who was ready to 'Vogue' in 2012.
