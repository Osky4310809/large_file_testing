So, when something or someone breaks free from this paradigm of self-destruction and shines a light into the darkness, that light should be shared. \nThanks to the kind-hearted founders of the Make-a-Wish Foundation, children throughout the United States and its territories, who are facing life-threatening medical conditions, are granted a wish every 37 minutes. \nMost of the wishes of the children are for trips to Disney World, or to meet their favorite singer — and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that notion. The very idea of a dying child wishing for something outside of their own desires seemed mind-blowingly impossible — until now. \nMeet 8-year-old Amelia Meyer. When Amelia was just a little girl; she was diagnosed with brain cancer. Despite her bleak prognosis Amelia loved to go outside and play, and she did so often, as she had a fondness for nature. \n“She’s always been that kid I cannot get inside,” her mother Jill Meyer said. \nEarlier this year, Amelia was granted a wish by the Make-a-Wish Foundation and last Saturday, that wish came true. But Amelia didn’t wish to meet Mickey Mouse or Taylor Swift — she wished to pick up trash. \n“I know some kids might want to go to Disneyworld and stuff, or meet famous people, but I really feel like Amelia picked the right wish,” Amelia’s best friend Samantha Asquith said to WDAF. \nShe could have had anything she wanted and this selfless, beautiful, marvelous little girl chose to clean up other people’s messes. \n“It doesn’t look nice and another reason is because it can stay dirty and it can get animals sick,” Amelia said. \nAccording to WDAF, \nThanks to the help of Helzberg Diamonds, The Kansas City Missouri Parks and Recreation Department, the Kansas City Fire Department, the Kansas City Police Department, and hundreds of volunteers, Amelia pulled up to Swope Park, to a scene fit for a queen. She said, “I thought there was just going to be some people, not this much.” \nShe seemed most comfortable in her own element, walking and running hand in hand with her best friends. Samantha said, “I’ve known her since preschool and she’s just been my very best friend. She’s been really nice to me and really supportive of me when I have rough times.” \nHundreds helped Amelia pick up trash at Swope Park and other parks around the city. Mayor Sly James read a proclamation, naming February 27, 2016 “Amelia Meyer’s Take Care Of The World Day.” People in cities across the country and the world picked up trash in their hometowns in honor of Amelia. Followers on social media also joined in with by tagging posts and photos with #AmeliasWish \nThe selflessness and caring exhibited by Amelia are awe-inspiring. When all the negativity in the world seems overwhelming, these small, yet infinitely profound moments have a way of restoring our faith in our fellow human. Her actions should serve as an example to all. Please share her story with your friends and family so that they may be inspired by this little girl’s astounding kindness. \nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.
