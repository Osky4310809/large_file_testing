(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) Randy Lewis \nChance the Rapper , whose debut album, “Coloring Book,” prompted the Recording Academy to change its eligibility rules on how music is released, was crowned best new artist in the first award handed out Sunday at the 59th Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. \nBecause “Coloring Book” was available only as free stream, the academy altered the long-standing requirement that music considered for awards be available in physical form, an acknowledgement of the shifting tide of consumers’ preferred way to listen. \nBefore the telecast, the Chicago rapper born Chancellor Johnathan Bennett raced to the stage to collect his first Grammy, in the rap performance category, for the track “No Problem” featuring Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz . \n“This [stuff] is crazy!” he told onlookers at the Microsoft Theater across the street from Staples Center area, where the remainder of the winners and nearly two dozen live performances got under way at 5 p.m. \nBefore that ceremony began, Beyoncé versus Adele has been the main story line of the 2017 Grammys. \nHeading into the evening’s national telecast, the pendulum had already swung toward Adele. The English singer-songwriter scored two wins for pop solo performance on her hit single “Hello” from the album “25,” which also won pop vocal album in the pre-show portion of the ceremony. \nAnother win potentially working in Adele’s favor: Greg Kurstin, who produced the tracks “Hello” and “Water Under the Bridge” from “25,” was named nonclassical producer of the year. \nBeyoncé, who leads nominations with nine, meanwhile, took a single award in the early going, winning the music video Grammy for “Formation.” \nBut she finished in runner-up position in three other categories in which she had been nominated, including pop solo performance for her track “Hold Up” from her “Lemonade” album. \nSee the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour » \nLikewise, in the rock performance category, where she was in the running with her track “Don’t Hurt Yourself” with rocker Jack White, the Grammy went posthumously to David Bowie for the title track from his final album, “Blackstar,” which generated four Grammys ahead of the telecast: rock performance, alternative music album, recording package and nonclassical engineered album. A fifth Grammy could come Bowie’s way tonight if the album’s title track wins for rock song. \nBeyoncé also came in behind the Beatles for the music film Grammy, which went to the Ron Howard -directed documentary, “The Beatles: Eight Days a Week: The Touring Years.” \n“I’m very happy for all involved,” said Abramorama Entertainment chief Richard Ambramowitz told The Times about “Eight Days a Week,” which his firm distributed. \nClose behind Beyoncé’s nine nods are Rihanna, Drake and Kanye West with eight apiece. \nSeveral early Grammy winners used their time on stage to voice criticism of President Trump, his proposed travel ban on immigrants and plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. \nAmong them: comedy album winner Patton Oswalt, nominee and award presenter Margaret Cho and sibling pop due Jesse & Joy, who won the Latin pop album Grammy for “Un Besito Mas.” \n“We are so proud to be Mexican American,” said Joy Huerta, accompanied by her brother, Jesse. “For every Mexican out there, we are with you.” \nPre-telecast awards also recognized two of the most influential acts in pop music history, with the music film Grammy for the Beatles documentary and the historical album award to “The Cutting Edge: 1965-1966: The Bootleg Series, vol. 12 (Collector’s Edition),” which compiled all the recordings Bob Dylan made during an exceptionally fertile 14-month period. \nSeveral pre-telecast awards resulted in emotional acceptance speeches for recordings that recognized musicians who died. \nCountry singer-songwriter Vince Gill, a winner for his song “Kid Sister” in the Americana roots song category, pointed out that the song was written in memory of Dawn Sears, a veteran country singer who had been a part of his moonlighting Western swing band, the Time Jumpers. \n“I wish you all would have had the chance once in your life to hear the voice of the woman I wrote this song about: Dawn Sears,” he said. “She had one of the best voices you’ll ever hear in your life.” \nLikewise, singer and songwriter Rory Feek, part of the duo Joey + Rory before his wife, Joey Feek, died of cancer in March, saluted her while collecting the roots gospel album for their final recording together, “Hymns.” \n“My wife’s dream was to make a hymns album pretty much her whole life,” he said. “She didn’t get a chance to do it until she was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. She recorded in hotel rooms and in hospital beds, and it came out almost exactly a year ago. \n“When we watched this ceremony last year, she said, ‘If we get nominated promise me you will come,’ ” he said. “Then she got a big smile on her face and said, ‘Remember if we win, I’ll know before you will.’ ” \nMusician Donny McCaslin, a collaborator with Bowie on his final album, “Blackstar,” which generated four Grammys in the early going, described him as “a genius and a funny-as-hell guy. At one point, he sent me an e-mail that said, ‘I’m so happy I just vomited up a 1967 Mercedes.” \nAnd veteran folk singer Judy Collins delivered a musical tribute to Leonard Cohen, who died in November, with a performance of his song “Suzanne.” \n“Here’s how I met Leonard 50 years ago,” Collins explained from her seat at a concert grand piano. “He came into my living room and said, ‘I can’t play the guitar, and I can’t sing, and I’m not sure if this is a song,’ and then he sang me this song.” \nRoots country artist Sturgill Simpson, the long-shot overall album-of-the-year nominee for his sophomore effort, “A Sailor’s Guide to Earth,” won early in the country album category over works by veterans Loretta Lynn and Keith Urban and relative newcomers Brandy Clark and Maren Morris. \n\"Six years ago, I was in Utah working on the railroad, writing songs at night,” the Kentucky-born singer, songwriter and producer said. \"My wife made me quit that job and move to Nashville, so thanks, babe. My son was born right after my first album came out and I spent that spent first year on the road, missing them. If it wasn’t for them I wouldn’t have written this album, so I have to thank them. \n“And I guess the revolution won’t be televised. Thank you.” \nThe Grammy Awards are determined by about 14,000 voting members of the Recording Academy. The eligibility period for nominated recordings was Oct. 1, 2015, through Sept. 30, 2016.
