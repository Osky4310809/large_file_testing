There’s been lots of work done to make that happen, mostly centered on depositing conductive material, although we’ve been surprised no one has worked out how to just 3D print a plastic resist mask.\nWe recently found a GitHub group for [PCBPrints] which has small modules that would be useful in prototyping and breadboarding . They are really just carriers that create plug in modules for switches, LEDs, and the like. It looks like this is a aggregated list of other GitHub projects that realize these designs. The group is in Spanish, but Google Translate is your friend, as usual. You can see a video of one of the button modules in action, below.\n\nThere’s a generic prototype board calculator in the repository. Of course, you probably want to be careful soldering near the plastic, especially plastic with a lower melting point like PLA. Although the repositories call these PCBs, there’s no conductive part. They are really just packaging and a mechanical substrate. Still, they are pretty neat looking and we can imagine them being handy in a lot of quick projects.\nAnother way people are making PCBs with a 3D printer is to use them as plotters to draw resist on the board. Or you can go subtractive and take the resist away . We haven’t seen much in the way of using a printer to deposit resist, except using Ninjaflex .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T05:00:21.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
