He visited his godfather and his godfather was really loopy and didn’t want his godfather to be addicted to heroin,” Metz said. \n“It came up about where he might go, but by then I knew this guy didn’t even know his way around Boston, so I don’t think he’s going to get very far.” \nState Police say Doughty is armed and dangerous.
