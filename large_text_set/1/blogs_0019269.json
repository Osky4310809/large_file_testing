There’s a new Harry Potter -related Instagram account that just says “Follow the Spiders. Secrets will be revealed on 27th January, 2017” with NO OTHER INFORMATION and, unsurprisingly, the internet is losing its GD mind .\nOn Friday, the Twitter account for the official Warner Bros. Studio Tour London — which offers tours of the set where all of the Harry Potter movies were filmed — shared a link to the new @FollowTheSpiders Instagram page saying only, “Looking for something? All you need to do is #FollowTheSpiders.”\nLooking for something? All you need to do is #FollowTheSpiders : https://t.co/8fS6UYJ9P1 pic.twitter.com/48PeNP3SFk \n— WB Tour London (@wbtourlondon) January 19, 2017 Not fair, you guys. For anyone who’s not an obsessive Harry Potter fan, “follow the spiders” is a quote from Hogwarts’ groundskeeper Hagrid. He gave the instruction to Harry in J.K. Rowling’s second Harry Potter book, The Chamber of Secrets , sending Harry and Ron into the Forbidden Forest to meet the terrifying spider Aragog and receive some critical information.\nOn social media, some HP fans are wondering whether the new Instagram account could be an indication that a Forbidden Forest attraction will soon be opened at the Warner Bros. Studio, or added to one (or more!) of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attractions around the world.\nTo that we say: AHHH! YES PLEASE!\n@wbtourlondon what is this? If you're adding the forbidden forest to the tour I am there! #followthespiders \n— Rebecca Fisher (@Fishrl1) January 19, 2017 \nOthers, though, are just straight up stressed out/excited AF about whatever news is to come.\n#FollowTheSpiders ??? *grabs coat* of course I will!! pic.twitter.com/YEG3l8OkBz \n— Cosmo-Plum (@meghead55) January 23, 2017 Me waiting to find out what #FollowTheSpiders means on Friday @wbtourlondon \nSo excited pic.twitter.com/wug3c1PX7a \n— Soph✨DAN RADCLIFFE (@RadcliffesMagic) January 23, 2017 OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG THE EXCITEMENT IS KILLING ME, WHAT IS THIS ABOUT???? #followthespiders \n— Joe Crick (@joecrick_) January 19, 2017 @wbtourlondon TELL MEEE \n— Aud' ⚯͛ 오드래 (@Blondie_Black) January 20, 2017 We’re with you, fam. While we wait anxiously for Friday to arrive, we can say for sure that Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida is set to host the “ A Celebration of Harry Potter ” event from January 27th to 29th. So that could , as Seventeen reports , be when the ~big announcement~ about Follow the Spiders is made, but we won’t know more until later this week.\nIn the meantime, we’ll be re-watching all the Harry Potter movies while the weather is gloomy!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:23:40.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
