For proof of that, Literary Hub has done some (slightly morbid) calculations regarding how many books you'll be able to squeeze in during your remaining years on Earth. \nThe table below breaks down the number of books you'll have time for if you maintain your current reading habits.

Assuming they live that long, average readers in that group have 732 more books to read in their lifetimes. \"Average\" in this case means people who read 12 books per year. Lit Hub also crunched the numbers for voracious readers (50 books per year) and super readers (80 books per year).
