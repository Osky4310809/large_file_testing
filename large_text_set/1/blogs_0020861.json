Two years I spent damn near on the sideline. That's never a good feeling for any player. No player wants to go through that,\" Patterson told NFL.com reporter Conor Orr. \"I need to know if I'm going to play or not. If not, I'll take my talents elsewhere.\" \nPatterson is currently in Orlando, Florida for the 2017 NFL Pro Bowl and spoke with Orr regarding his future in the purple and gold. \n\"I really don't know. It's all up to the Vikings,\" Patterson told Orr. \"I'm a free agent starting in March and it's all what the Vikings want to do. If they want me back, they'll (make a deal) and get me back.\" \nAfter a few tumultuous and rather quiet seasons, Patterson finally found his stride again this past season, finishing the year with 52 catches, 453 yards and two touchdowns while leading the NFL in kick return average and earning his second career Pro Bowl bid. Patterson was also named first-team All Pro on special teams. \nThe fourth-year wideout credited the change in offensive coordinator for his mid-late season success, saying that he had no issue with Norv Turner, but rather that he spoke with Pat Shurmur and Shurmur told Patterson that the plan was to get him the ball more; a seemingly welcomed idea for any wide receiver in the NFL. \nNow that Patterson has been seeing the ball more, his contract is up and he's set to become a free agent in just a few short weeks, something that is admittedly rather enticing for the young receiver. \n\"It's kind of exciting,\" Patterson said. \"I've never been a free agent. It's just like coming out of college again. You never know what's going to happen. You never know where you're going to go. It's a lot of excitement to me. It'll feel good to lay around for a little bit and kick my feet up.\" \nTo read Orr's article on NFL.com, CLICK HERE ...
