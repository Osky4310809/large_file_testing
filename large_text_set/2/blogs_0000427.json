Researchers will then evaluate their responses to determine the pair’s compatibility, the Washington Post reported .\n“After seeing the photos, the monkeys have to push a button on the screen,” the park said in a statement . “In this way, we can measure their capacity for reaction.”\nDuring the four-year experiment, the zoo will show Samboja, an 11-year-old female orangutan, photos on a tablet of possible suitors from an international breeding program.\nResearchers from Leiden University said they started the matchmaking program to improve breeding success among apes.\n“Often, animals have to be taken back to the zoo they came from without mating,” zoo biologist Thomas Bionda told a local newspaper, according to the Guardian . “Things don’t always go well when a male and a female first meet.”\nBut for the lonely apes, it hasn’t been happily ever after yet. There are still some kinks to work out after, upon being given a tablet, 11-year-old Samboja destroyed it.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:02:31.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
