But when Amy Chan went through her own split , what she wanted more than anything was something that didn't quite exist yet: A safe space to heal, reflect, and take care of herself. \nThat's why she started Renew , a breakup bootcamp that includes therapy, yoga, meditation, and other healing activities on a serene farm in New York's Hudson Valley. It's a concept we're totally on board with: After all, there are spaces for work and for meeting new people, so why not a place for handling the complicated emotions that come from breakups? \nWe talked to Chan about why she started Renew, what to expect from it, and what she's learned along the way. PHOTO: William Coles \nGlamour: How did you first come up with the idea for Renew? \nAmy Chan : Five years ago, I was in a relationship with a man whom I thought I’d be spending the rest of my life with. He was my first love and without realizing it, I had put much of my sense of identity into that relationship. When one day, suddenly everything fell apart, I broke into pieces. Not only did I lose my partner, my best friend, but I lost my identity. I spiraled into a depression, broke out into panic attacks, and had thoughts of suicide. \nDuring that time, I searched everywhere for a retreat or some safe place where I could go to get the healing that I needed. Unfortunately, there was nothing targeted specifically to the type of excruciating pain that comes along with detaching. It took me almost two years to fully recover from that breakup and along the way, I’ve learned critical tools for self-soothing and getting oneself back into equilibrium. I also count my blessings that I had such a great support system that helped me through the worst of the darkness. \nThe business idea for Renew came to me about a 1.5 years ago. I realized that most of the emails I get from readers of my blog were from people going through breakups and completely distraught on how to handle the pain. It was an \"a-ha\" moment where everything came together, and I knew that I had to be the one to create a safe space for people to come and heal in a healthy way. \nG: What exactly does the retreat entail? \nAC : When you arrive, you are encouraged to check in your digital devices (we explain in one of the talks the psychology of addiction to dopamine every time we check our ex’s Instagram or obsess over his latest ‘like.’) I set the housekeeping rules, one being to surrender to the process and be open, and to refrain from giving advice. Often times, we get advice from people who are not equipped to give it, and it does more harm than good. \nThe retreat consists of group talks where we discuss topics like attachment theory and the psychology and the science behind why we feel and behave the way we do when in love and when in the cycle of grief. We also do exercises which provide tools on how one can self-soothe or snap out of reacting with the animal brain when triggered, practical tools that can be applied even when you’re at work. There’s physical exercise to boost endorphins, there’s one-one-one coaching with an on-site life coach, and writing/journaling assignments each night. An on-site chef cooks three-course meals for lunch and breakfast using all-organic and locally sourced ingredients. There’s daily yoga and meditation. During free time, guests can pet alpacas, milk the goats for fresh milk, go on hikes, relax in the sauna, or meditate in the yoga yurt. PHOTO: Amy Chan \nG: Did you participate in it yourself? \nAC : I did not participate as a guest, as I was facilitating, but I definitely partook in the guided meditations, alpaca petting, and yoga! \nG: Did it help you through your own breakup? \nAC : Starting the business made me dive deeper into the psychology behind breakups, detaching, and mourning loss. But what really has helped me through my own breakups has been learning tools to self-soothe, reframe, and forgive, and how to channel negative energy into positive. Resilience is a muscle. Learning how to cope and process painful emotions is a muscle. And I’ve been through enough ups and downs to know that you have a choice. You can use breakups, which are pivotal points in life, as a catalyst for growth, or you can choose to have it make you jaded and more fear-based. \nG: What aspects of this process can we recreate in our own lives when we're trying to get over breakups? \nAC : The \"natural\" instincts when someone is going through a breakup are counterintuitive to healing. For instance, many people stop eating or eat very unhealthy, and if your body is not fed the necessary nutrients during this trying time, it’s extremely difficult for you to heal emotionally. So, first things first, force yourself to eat, even if that entails drinking green smoothies so you’re getting nutrients in your body. \nSecond, you need support and to be around people who can provide a safe space for you to mourn, share, talk, and cry it out without feeling shame. Feeling safe is a big theme here, as when you’ve lost your routine and what you think is your rock and a part of your foundation and identity, you can feel very unsafe, which puts you in a fear/scarcity mindset. Third, you need to exercise. You need the feel-good chemicals, the endorphins to counter all the negative chemicals that are happening during this detaching phase. \nFourth, get in the habit of writing down three things you’re grateful for every day. Studies show that in a two-minute span of time, done over 21 days in a row, you can actually rewire your brain. Your brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world for the positive versus the negative. Seeing things in a frame of positivity and gratitude is a muscle. You can strengthen this muscle through practice. \nLastly, and probably most importantly, be kind and gentle on yourself. In this fast-paced world, we are so hard on ourselves and impatient with healing. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do to speed up the process. Sure, you can numb the pain or distract yourself, but if you don’t allow yourself to process the emotion in a healthy way, the pain and darkness just gets buried deep inside you, and eventually comes up in your future relationships. Stop blaming yourself and instead try to look for the lesson and the growth opportunity. PHOTO: Amy Chan \nG: What have you learned about getting over breakups since starting Renew? \nAC : I’ve learned that each time you go through a breakup, the pain isn’t any more or less intense or hard, but the way you process and get back up can be different when you learn the tools to get yourself back to equilibrium. There are so many lessons that can be learned during times of heartbreak, and there’s an opportunity to grow and become more emotionally healthy. Five years ago, my breakup completely broke me apart. \nIf I were to go through the same experience today, I know I wouldn’t go through such a downward spiral. I’ve learned through the years how to base my identity and sense of self worth on myself and not others. I’ve learned the most critical tool of all: self love. Now, if it doesn’t work out with someone, sure, I’ll be hurt. But I’ll be bruised, not broken. And I may lose my balance, but I won’t be wiped off my feet. \nWhat advice would you give others looking to get through bad breakups? \nGet support and be surrounded by people who love you. Sit with the discomfort and the emotions instead of distracting yourself and numbing the pain, or it will just haunt you in another form in the future. Don’t be afraid of the pain and darkness. There’s information there. There’s a lesson to be learned. You can use the experience as a catalyst for growth. \nHave things to look forward to: Plan a trip, treat yourself to the spa, make plans in the future so that you can focus on what you’re looking forward to versus how unbearable your present is. Understand that your brain is detaching. It’s the same part of the brain that is activated as a cocaine user feening for their next fix. You’re literally in withdrawal. Understand that it takes time for your brain and neural pathways to detach. You’re not going crazy—it’s just a process, and that process takes time. \nLastly, try to look at the bigger picture. The majority of people you date will not be your destination. They were meant to be a bridge. So find the lesson, the growth opportunity so you don’t have to keep repeating your pattern and crossing that same bridge over and over again. Once you learn what you need to learn and become more self aware and emotionally healthy, you will then cross another bridge, and one day, you’ll get to your destination.
