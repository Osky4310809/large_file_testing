It was then that he threw the hot spice in David’s face, according to The Telegraph .\nMichelle told The Telegraph that the chef became aggressive after she and David told their waiter that their meat was “tough and rubbery.”\n“To cut a long story short the chef came to our table he was extremely rude and aggressive and accused us of not wanting to pay for our food,” she said. “He started swearing at me so David said, ‘there’s no need to swear at my wife.’ The chef caused quite a scene and was shouting and swearing so David walked back to the kitchen door with him asking for an apology. The chef came to the door with a large bowl of chili powder which he threw at David’s face.”\nA diner was hospitalised after a head chef threw a bowl of hot chilli powder in his eyes pic.twitter.com/t3FgL5lopO \n— The Telegraph (@Telegraph) January 23, 2017 \nMichelle went on to explain that David had to be hospitalized to undergo several eye washes. “He instantly thought he had been blinded and didn’t know what he’d thrown at him, he was shaking in shock, hanging on to the counter being sick thinking he was going to go blind.”\nIslams said that he had acted out of self-defense. “I ran into the kitchen to get away from him but he followed me,” he said. “I was frightened and threw it at him.
