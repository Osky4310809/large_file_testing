READ MORE: Libya conflict explained \nSarraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) said in a statement that Sarraj, Swehli and Nakua had opened a new criminal investigations unit in Tripoli on Monday morning, and published pictures of the three at the event. It did not mention the shooting. \nSarraj and the GNA's other leaders arrived in Tripoli last March following a UN-backed deal signed in late 2015. \nYet, his Tripoli-based government has struggled to impose its authority, particularly in eastern Libya where a rival administration holds sway.
