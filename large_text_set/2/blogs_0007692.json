Yet those events paled in comparison to what happened the following year, when a U.S.-trained counterinsurgency force massacred more than 900 men, women and children in El Mozote and surrounding villages. In a gruesome war that claimed some 75,000 lives from 1980 until peace accords were signed in 1992, the three-day massacre at El Mozote stands out as the worst atrocity in a conflict marked by torture, executions and disappearances. Although American and Salvadoran officials at the time dismissed reports in The New York Times and The Washington Post , subsequent exhumations have provided undeniable proof of the price paid by that country’s civilians who were caught between their own military and leftist rebels.\nPhoto Juana Anteportan Sánchez (center, in hat), 82, from La Joya, watches coffins holding the human remains of 21 of the war victims killed during the massacre at La Joya on December 12, 1981, as these are returned to their families on the 35th anniversary of the events. Credit James Rodríguez/Panos Pictures Last December, on the 35th anniversary of the massacre, James Rodriguez traveled to the region in eastern El Salvador to document the proper burial of remains that had been exhumed. He went to El Mozote and the nearby village of La Joya spurred, he said, by the earlier court decision to lift the amnesty that had prevented combatants from being held accountable. To Mr. Rodriguez, a Mexican photographer who has lived in Guatemala for 12 years, it offered a window to examine the lingering aftereffects of the many human rights violations during Central America’s Cold War conflicts. In El Salvador, that means an uneasy peace, where violence exceeds wartime levels.\n“To me, the lack of transitional justice in Central America is at the root of the migratory crisis,” he said. “That absence of justice creates countries that do not function, where violence is normalized, gangs grab power and impunity spills into the business sector. These are the push factors that send people north.”\nPhoto Friends and family line up to bury coffins containing the remains of 19 of the war victims killed during the La Joya massacre.

The reburials were a big event, attracting people who had left the region during the war. The tiny coffins — which sometimes held the remains of more than one person — were distributed to relatives, who held overnight wakes. The painful memories were tempered by a sense of community.\n“It was like a fiesta,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “It was an event to share with relatives and friends that had not been seen in a while.”\nHe added that since there was no cemetery, residents acquired a small patch of land between two houses to build a memorial where they placed the remains the following morning. It stands as a reminder that justice is slow, but, hopefully, inevitable.\nPhoto Ten-year-old Anderson watches as his grandmother, Maria Elena Sanchez, hops over a ditch after delivering flowers at the home of Ernesto Ramirez, where a wake is being held for three of the massacre victims.

Their elders wanted to take advantage of this to share their memories. There were strong and sad moments. But it was also a moment where communities find some power. They are able to heal a scar. Now, combined with the lifting of the amnesty, many want justice.”", "external_links": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/13/blogs/14-lens-mozote-embed1/14-lens-mozote-embed1-blog480.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/13/blogs/14-lens-mozote-embed2/14-lens-mozote-embed2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://cja.org/where-we-work/el-salvador/", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/13/blogs/14-lens-mozote-embed3/14-lens-mozote-embed3-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/13/blogs/14-lens-mozote-embed3/14-lens-mozote-embed3-blog480.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/13/blogs/14-lens-mozote-embed1/14-lens-mozote-embed1-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/13/blogs/14-lens-mozote-embed2/14-lens-mozote-embed2-blog480.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-14T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:24:24.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
