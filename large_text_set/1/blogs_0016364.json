When the message is received, the VS16 signals the iPhone's Messages app to combine the two emoji into one, which cannot be done and can cause the app to crash and the phone to freeze.\nThe worst thing about this bug is that the recipient does not even have to interact with the message; the moment you receive it on your iPhone, it will freeze.\nThere are two caveats to this trick. First, it doesn't work on the latest version of iOS, 10.2.1 (it works on versions 10.0 through 10.1.1), meaning all you have to do is upgrade your iOS and you'll be safe. Second, it's not as simple as sending a text message from one phone to another; the process requires logging into iCloud, pasting the character string into the online version of Notes, then opening that on a phone and sharing it as a message.\nIt doesn't end here, though. EverythingApplePro shared another trick that can freeze iPhones, and this one works even on the latest version of iOS. This message involves a longer string of characters, but it can be sent directly from one iPhone to another.\nDo not try this; it's not only dangerous for others, but can also be dangerous for your own phone.\nThe process is much more convoluted, but — in most cases — it does not completely crash the recipient's iPhone, but it slows it down and is generally quite annoying.\nWe put the second method to the test, sending the killer message from an iPhone 7 to an iPhone 6S, which were both running iOS 10.2. In two trials, we didn't experience anything more than just a slight slowdown in Messages. The 6S received the text and froze momentarily both times, but after a few seconds, the system was running normally as if nothing had happened. It was annoying for a moment, sure — but it wasn't nearly as dramatic as EverythingApplePro claims in the video.\nWe do not recommend trying either method out unless you're a security researcher, especially not on someone else's phone. If for no other reason, don't do it as it requires going to a third-party web page which might contain malicious code and infect your own iPhone with malware.\nWe've recently seen several similar bugs that can render an iPhone useless, such as this video or this link , both of which cause an iPhone to crash. Apple generally fixes them fast. In this case, one of the bugs has already been fixed — hopefully Apple will soon find a cure for the other one as well.\nBONUS: Everything we think we know about the next iPhone", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/lBZ16DxG.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/lBZ16DxG.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-18T23:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T17:53:14.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
