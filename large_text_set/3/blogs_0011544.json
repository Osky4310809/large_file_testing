As a showman, he has explored the stages from Los Angeles to New York — we’re talking Broadway here, man — he’s done some weird little movies, too. And he’s lived, like so many men in prior generations have lived their lives. He is a man of his times, a man of our times, and he has become a legend.”\nHe concluded his tribute by changing the most famous line in the 1998 Coen Brothers cult classic.\n“In accordance with what we think may be your final wishes, we have committed to these sidewalks in Hollywood — in the bosom of Hollywood that you love so well — a star. A star for you, a star because we love you so well … what time is it? Afternoon? Good afternoon, sweet prince,” Bridges ended.\nAlso in attendance were Goodman’s friends and former costars Tom Hiddleston ( Kong: Skull Island ) and Emile Hirsch ( Speed Racer ).\nCongratulations to my friend John Goodman.
