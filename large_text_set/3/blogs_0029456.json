He was unable to turn things around sufficiently and they failed to make it to the tournament. Things haven’t improved since and the Dutch FA felt the need to make a change. They have placed Fred Grim in charge as interim coach for Tuesday’s friendly with Italy.\nManchester United player Daley said working with his father on the international stage was ‘a dream come true’ and that he was ‘proud’ despite things not working out.\nSamen gewerkt op het allerhoogste niveau, een droom voor ons beide als vader en zoon. Het was niet makkelijk en het heeft niet altijd mee gezeten maar ik ben trots op hoe je je altijd verantwoordelijk heb gehouden en nooit heb opgegeven! – Working together as father and son at top level was a dream that came true.
