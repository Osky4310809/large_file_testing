I’m human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker.” I have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker. \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017 \nBeck tweeted, “Wait, libertarian views? Help me out on Trumpcare, stimulus, and executive orders. Trump is anything but libertarian. # intellectualhonesty” Wait, libertarian views? Help me out on Trumpcare, stimulus, and executive orders. Trump is anything but libertarian. #intellectualhonesty https://t.co/jlt5sFvQMP \n— Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) March 20, 2017 \nA report from The Daily Caller prior to Beck’s tweet noted that Lahren’s time at TheBlaze could be running short, as her contract expires in September and inside sources suggest she likely won’t be renewed.   \nFollowing this latest tiff, the possibility that she could be out of the network before her contract is up has likely increased. \nIt is worth noting that, for someone who claimed to hold libertarian views, Lahren is seemingly unfamiliar with one of the political ideology’s key tenets regarding limited government, that being John Stuart Mill’s “harm principle,” which essentially states that governments retain the right to exercise power over an individual’s liberty for the sake of preventing harm to others. \nThus, with this principle in mind, it becomes clear that one can simultaneously be in favor of limited government and against a woman’s right to choose the murder of an unborn baby. \nTomi Lahren might be wise to reconsider her stance when it comes to abortion, as abandoning the pro-life segment of her fan base likely won’t leave her with much support at all.
