Unlike Tommy Hilfiger, who thinks  Gigi could be an ambassador   of sorts ... Noor's not willing to put that kinda pressure on the model. \nYes, Gigi is half Palestinian, and she marched against Trump's Muslim ban  and she has millions of social media followers -- but Noor says that hardly makes her a revolutionary.\nHowever, Noor -- who stars in the Newsy docu-series, \"A Woman's Job\" -- admits the supermodel could be a powerful voice ... IF she wants to be.\nYour move, Gigi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:30:23.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
