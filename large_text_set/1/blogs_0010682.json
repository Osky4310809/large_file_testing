From January 26 – 29, select players on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One will join the fray as Knights, Vikings, and Samurai, and experience the brutal melee combat of For Honor. For a chance to participate in the closed beta, you must be signed up at forhonorgame.com/war . \nDuring the Closed Beta, players can also dive into War of the Factions and get a taste of the overarching conflict between the three warring groups. War of the Factions will track every match across all platforms during the Closed Beta, and players will be rewarded for fighting for their factions (with extra spoils going to the victorious faction). Additional rewards will also be given to those that participate in the Closed Beta. Both sets of rewards will transfer over to the full game at launch. \nFor Honor is set to release on February 14 for Xbox One, PS4, and PC.
