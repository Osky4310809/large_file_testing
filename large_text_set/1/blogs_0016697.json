I interviewed many top business leaders through Negosyo founder and RFM Corp. CEO Joey Concepcion. He recently galvanized over 500 entrepreneurs, led by Manny V. Pangilinan, Lucio C. Tan, Tessie Sy Coson, Ramon Ang, Robina Gokongwei-Pe, Phil. Chamber of Commerce & Industry (PCCI) president George Barcelon, Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers (FFCCCII) president Angel Ngu, and others to offer unprecedented investments and charitable donations for President Duterte’s bold plan to economically revive war-torn and poor Sulu province as a way to promote lasting peace. Also expressing her support was House Deputy Speaker Dr. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. * * * Optimistic about the Philippines’ economic future is Alfred Dy , head of Philippine Research at CLSA Limited. Congrats to CLSA Ltd. on once more being voted the No. 1 stock brokerage in the Philippines, besting 25 out of 27 categories in the prestigious Asiamoney Brokers Poll 2016 (including the best local brokerage honor for the very first time). CLSA Philippines was cited for its “differentiated, un-conflicted research” and voted “Best Overall Country Research” for the seventh consecutive year and the “Most Independent Research Brokerage” for the third consecutive year. It was also No. 1 in the survey on research coverage in 14 of 16 sectors. * * * Also hopeful about the Philippines is one of the world’s top economists, Nobel Prize-winning Harvard professor Eric S. Maskin , whom I interviewed thanks to De La Salle University President Bro. Raymundo B. Suplido, FSC and Bridges Dialogues/International Peace Foundation leader Uwe Morawetz. Prof. Maskin said, “The Philippines has certainly come a long way, you have a lot to be proud of, but it is premature to rest on your laurels… Duterte is viewed negatively for his unfiltered statements, which could be a good or bad thing, but I applaud President Duterte for his concern for the poor. I don’t know whether he could succeed or not there. He got elected due to the inequality and if your president can lead your country towards less inequality, it would be good. To correct inequality needs intervention in policies like redistributive taxation, but this is not a permanent solution; it is better to promote more investments in human capital.” On Duterte’s independent foreign policy of the Philippines befriending Russia and China, Maskin said, “I don’t know enough about your foreign policy, but the Philippines’ having more trade with China — that is fine; more trade with Russia, fine. For a country to add new friends and gain new trade partners is constructive. I think it’s always good to expand trade; it will be good for the Philippines, it will be good for China, it will be good for the world.” Below are my interviews of top Philippine businessmen, arranged by presidential adviser on entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion: Ernesto “Ato” Tanmantiong , CEO of the Jollibee fast-food giant, told me: “We are bullish about 2017 for the Philippine economy due to government’s increased infrastructure spending, the improving peace-and-order situation and the independent foreign policy. This year, we plan to open 200 new stores all over the Philippines.” George Marsman Drysdale , chairman of the 97-year-old Marsman Drysdale Group, which is a top banana and fruit exporter, said, “We are very positive about 2017 — the Philippine economy will continue to grow fast. We are optimistic about the government’s focus on rural development specially in places like Mindanao, also government’s plan to reduce corporate taxes and their goal to streamline investment procedures. There are now more overtures from ASEAN, China, Japan, Russia, Iran and other countries, which will help to increase our Philippine exports.” John Forbes , senior adviser of the American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines (AmCham), said that “2017 will be a good year for the Philippines, unless the new US President Trump starts a trade war (with Asia), which American businesses will be worried about. Philippine economic growth should be on target, especially with more infrastructure spending and manufacturing growth staying high, above eight percent. Tourism will go up, hopefully agriculture and mining can also grow more… I hope Trump will not start a trade war because it will not be good for Asia or the US.” Ebb Hinchliffe , executive director of AmCham, said, “The Philippine economy will be better in 2017 than 2016. The fundamentals are there, infrastructure spending will go up and we still have the demographic sweet spot.” Dr. Alan Escalona , president of Philippine Franchise Association and CEO of the Fruit Magic chain, said, “Businessmen are very bullish about 2017. First, criminality has gone down nationwide due to President Duterte’s bold anti-drug war, you can feel it, criminals are more afraid. Second, more foreign investors are looking to invest here in the Philippines, especially foreign franchises. Third, we have English as our competitive edge in Asia.” Rex Daryanam , president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce (Phil.), said, “The Indian business community is very optimistic, because we see the common Filipinos are very optimistic, most of them have confidence in the government.” Minoo Jamaji , director of the same Indian Federation, said, “The Duterte government is working towards true Asian integration with China, Japan, ASEAN. We hope India, too, soon.” Balraj Singh Bhattee , director of the same Indian Federation, said, “The 2017 Philippine economy will grow at par with India and China because of strong OFW and BPO incomes, plus many other positive factors.” Tony Meloto , founder of Gawad Kalinga, said, “We are optimistic about 2017, because we have a president who is more sensitive to the needs on the ground, the government is sincere. We’re on the ground, we feel the pulse of the people and people now feel much safer.” Jose Maria C. Mendoza , president of Supervalue, Inc. and SM Supermarket, said, “2017 will be a year of opportunities and challenges. The Philippine economy is booming. People are premiumizing, leveling up their tastes, and this reflects our economic state. This year, we plan to open at least three new SM supermarkets and at least 20 Save More outlets.” Christopher T. Po , CEO of Century Pacific Group, producer of Century Tuna and other food brands, and chairman of Shakey’s fast-food chain, said, “I think the Philippine economy will continue good growth in 2017 because consumer spending is going to be strong because of demographics; also a weaker Philippine peso will give more money for OFWs’ dollars.” Bernie Liu , CEO of the Penshoppe chain, said, “Businesspeople are empowered now, because our government is simpler and more authentic.” Dr. Abraham F. Pascual , chairman of Pascual Laboratories, Inc., said, “Businesspeople are bullish about 2017, because of government’s huge infrastructure spending plans, which will of course stimulate strong economic growth. The only concern I see on the horizon is the BPO industry because it’s controlled mostly by American firms, but that is hard to just transfer out of the country because we in the Philippines still offer much cheaper costs. I believe American tourists will be replaced by more Russian and Chinese tourists. Tourism and services will grow.” Prudencio S. Garcia , president of Mekeni hotdogs, said, “The business community’s confidence is contagious. We know we have a strong leader in President Duterte, so we in the business sector are very motivated.” Toto Barcelona , president of Harbest Agribusiness Corp., said, “Many agriculture entrepreneurs are optimistic about 2017, because government’s serious anti-crime campaign has made the country more peaceful in general, so we can expect more foreign investors and tourists.” * * * Thanks for your feedback!
