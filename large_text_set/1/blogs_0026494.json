identity indicated on the application,” organization says Beatrice Verhoeven | January 30, 2017 @ 4:24 PM \nThe Boy Scouts of America will allow transgender children who identify as boys to enroll in scouting programs, the organization announced Monday. \n“Starting today, we will accept and register youth in the Cub and Boy Scout programs based on the gender identity indicated on the application,” Effie Delimarkos, director of communications for the organization, said in a statement obtained by TheWrap. “Our organization’s local councils will help find units that can provide for the best interest of the child.” \nThe organization noted that it offers “number of programs that serve all youth,” but that it’s best known for Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting that are “specifically designed to meet the needs of boys.” Also Read: GLAAD Protests Nat Geo's Collaboration With Boy Scouts \nThe organization acknowledged the break from tradition. “For more than 100 years, the Boy Scouts of America, along with schools, youth sports and other youth organizations, have ultimately deferred to the information on an individual’s birth certificate to determine eligibility for our single-gender programs,” the statement said. “However, that approach is no longer sufficient as communities and state laws are interpreting gender identity differently, and these laws vary widely from state to state.” \nIn December, an 8-year-old Jersey boy , who was born a girl but identified as a male for more than a year, was asked to leave a Cub Scouts pack. His mother had said that he was accepted as a boy at school and that complaints from parents led to his dismissal from the Cub Scouts. \nAccording to the Associated Press , the Boy Scouts had said they would admit transgender children into their coeducational programs but not to programs that were meant for boys only.

A Short Explainer \nThe Girl Scouts of America organization, which is not affiliated with the Boy Scouts, has accepted transgender members for years. \nThe Boy Scouts had endured controversy in recent years before lifting a ban on gay adults serving as Scout leaders in 2015. Also Read: Alexis Arquette, Transgender Actress and Activist, Dies at 47 \n“This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders without regard to sexual orientation, continuing Scouting’s longstanding policy of chartered organizations selecting their leaders,” the Boy Scouts said in a statement July 13, 2015. \nTwo years prior, the organization announce d they would admit openly gay youths into the program. At that time, they had maintained their stance on not allowing openly gay leaders to take part in the Boy Scouts.

What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"'Boys Don't Cry' was important to me. It was about a year after I saw that film that I started to question my own gender identity. It's a difficult movie to watch, but it was the first image of a transgender man I'd ever seen in the mainstream media. Even though the character wasn't perfect and there was a tragic ending, I could still identify with Brandon. Seeing that film helped me figure out that I was transgender.\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"I'm so tired of seeing TV shows and films where transgender people are either victimized or killers. And too often those characters that are supposed to be transgender don't look or act anything like actual transgender people. People in the entertainment industry who are writing, casting, directing, and acting transgender roles have a responsibility to do their research and make it more realistic.\" \nJennifer Finney Boylan, Author and professor at Colby College in Maine 1. What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"I wish I could say that more trans stories or characters helped me on my way when I felt most alone— but when I was coming out, quite frankly, I struggled because none of the narratives out there felt like they had anything to do with the life I wanted to live. As a woman my concerns have always been pretty close to the hearth - I have always prioritized the lives of my children and the woman that I love. Right behind that was my work as a teacher, and trying to be a positive force in the lives of my students. I didn't see that story being told when I was in my 20s and 30s; all the characters I read about seemed to suggest being trans was some wild and radical act. Now, of course, I think I have come full circle. Now I believe that there's probably no more radical thing that a trans person—or anyone—can do than raise a family, and to live your truth without shame.\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"I am tired of seeing trans people as tragic heroes. 'Heroes' are good, but do we always have to be tragic? Can we not be honored for the things we do that make us human, rather than the things that makes us extraordinary? I mean, I do believe that trans people are all heroes, and that we are extraordinary - but the media needs to show our humanity, and not to constantly exploit us. I know that there is a tremendous amount of work to be done, to help reduce unemployment and harassment of trans people - but the media can help bring this change about by altering the narrative. I want to see a trans person on a TV show whose gender identity is as unremarkable as anyone else's. I want to see a show that simply shows that being trans is just one more way of being human.\" \nIan Harvie, Comedian, writer and actor 1. What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"I am particularly proud of Laverne Cox and her role on 'Orange is the New Black' on Netflix. Laverne is a trans woman, in a trans role, bringing beautiful truth to her character, Sophia. She's tough and vulnerable at the same time, dealing with her family on the outside and her new found family on inside. No matter how you identify, if you don't fall in love with her character, you have no soul.\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"I would be all right with NEVER again seeing Trans people being depicted as mentally ill or unlovable. I would LOVE to see Trans folks represented as healthy, lovable humans, in a beautiful, loving relationships with their families friends and lovers and with people of all genders.\" \nAndrea James, Writer, director, producer and transgender advocate \n1. What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"My favorite fictional trans character is Ludo Fabre in Alain Berliner's 1997 Belgian film 'Ma Vie En Rose.' The film came out during my own transition and is one of the first films to depict trans youth, a topic now at the forefront of the trans rights movement. It's an absolute outrage that this sweet and thoughtful film is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. An honorable mention to my favorite metaphorically trans character: Rachael, the replicant who \"passes\" as human in Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi classic 'Blade Runner.'\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"If I never see another transgender \"regret narrative\" again, I'd be just fine with that. Authors and journalists who wouldn't dream of taking the 'ex-gay' movement seriously are happy to over-represent the small number of people who vacillate in how they express their gender, often presenting them as self-hating 'ex-trans' people. There's nothing wrong with moving around on the gender spectrum if someone wants, and everyone should be allowed to express their gender however they wish, whenever they wish. We must continually work to end the 'all or nothing' mentality about gender identity and expression.\" \nCarmen Carrera, Reality TV star and model \n1. What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"Laverne Cox's character on 'Orange is the New Black' is the only transgender character I think I've ever related to on television. Watching her character's transition play out on the series really hit home. I'm familiar with going through the steps, the effects on your family, facing adversity in public settings and all at the same time trying to stay focused on keeping peace of mind. I think the insight of transitioning has definitely given a little bit more of understanding to our world.\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"I hate the whole prostitute, low-life story. It's so false and degrading. Also the 'I tricked you' story is so ignorant 1990's. There are powerful, intelligent trans women out there, like myself, who know we are way more than the clichés and the stereotypes. I really would love to see a positive and accurate representation of the trans woman of today. We are truly amazing.\" \nDiego Sanchez, Director of Policy at PFLAG, formerly senior legislative adviser for Congressman Barney Frank \n1. What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"Brandon Teena, portrayed by Academy Award-winning Hillary Swank, in the film 'Boys Don't Cry.' I went to a pre-opening showing of the film, and afterwards, the packed theater moved to the lobby where we first stood together, speechless, riveted for nearly 30 minutes before going together to have ice cream. It remains powerful to me. The movie didn't stick precisely to the facts as the documentary 'The Brandon Teena Story' did, but it resonates with me still as powerful and meaningfully important.\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"I wish that I never again have to see transgender people portrayed as exaggerated caricatures of people ripe for ridicule, rather it would nice for those who portray us to recognize that we are people, just like everyone else.\" \nIsis King, Fashion model and designer, former contestant on 'America's Next Top Model' \n1. What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"I always like to see love stories about trans people finding love and functioning in society as normal people. I've seen very few stories like that, but those have been the most meaningful to me because we've already seen all the sad stories - now we want to see uplifting, motivational stories!\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"I'm tired of seeing the trans hooker that doesn't have character development outside of being a sex object. The side girl who doesn't get the respect of even being treated as a person, let alone a lady.\" \nMonica Roberts, Award-winning blogger at TransGriot \n1. What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"The best trans characters so far have been Edie Stokes in a 1977 episode of \"The Jeffersons' and the Alexis Meade character on 'Ugly Betty.'\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"Trans media representation has been a mixed bag. We still have media outlets that refuse to follow GLAAD and AP Stylebook standards. What I would like to see are trans actors and actresses actually playing trans people, trans writers writing those roles and stories.\" \nKye Allums, First transgender NCAA Division 1 college athlete, founder of Project I Am Enough \n1. What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"I was so happy to see Laverne Cox land the well deserved role in 'Orange Is The New Black.' I got a chance to hangout with her last month and I watch random people on the street shout out that they love her. It made me smile because it is too often trans women of color are treated with disrespect, especially in New York. She is living her truth as a proud black trans woman and changing hearts while doing so. I couldn't be prouder.\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"I would love to see more trans men of color being represented in the media. I would also like to hear from significant others of trans people.\" \nMia Ryan, Star of \"Houston Beauty\" on OWN \n1. What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"My favorite transgender story has been 'Major!' a documentary about long-time trans advocate Miss Major Griffin-Gracy. She was dealing with her gender transition during a very difficult time in history, and I believe that this has influenced the evolution of acceptance towards the LGBT community as a whole.\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"I think that trans representation in the media is slowly changing and I do believe that the trans community is being given a chance by audiences, but I would like to see media change their target perspective when reporting a story dealing with anyone in the trans community.\" \nJamie Clayton, Actress \n1. What transgender story or character has been particularly meaningful or impactful to you? \n\"I'm really happy with the roles I had on HBO's 'Hung' and 'Dirty Work' [dirtywork.com]. Both characters, Kyla & Michelle, were great representations of the 'every girl.' They're women juggling their jobs, dating, family and trying to fit in.\" \n2. What is a common stereotype or cliché in stories about transgender people that you never want to see again? \n\"I would love to see more trans characters that are regular, working members of society, representations that aren't criminal or sexualized where the story isn't about them being trans, they just happen to be. Those are the roles I like to watch and play.\" Previous Slide Next Slide 1 of 11 \nIn honor of Transgender Awareness Week, GLAAD and TheWrap partner to bring you these takes on representations in TV and Film \nChaz Bono, Transgender advocate, writer and musician \n1.
