Along with a new recruit (played by Zac Efron), the head-butting duo uncover a criminal plot that threatens the Bay’s future. \nFull of toned bodies and beach scenes, the trailer has obvious nods to the original TV series (they couldn’t leave out the slow motion running on the beach or red swimsuits, of course) but also includes explosions, profanity and more edgy remake material. \nThe movie also features Priyanka Chopra, Alexandra Daddario and Ilfenesh Hadera. Baywatch icons David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson are also set to make an appearance. \nBaywatch hits theaters on May 26. \nWatch the full official trailer below.
