Oh my god, he got the wrong envelope,\" the LA Times reported . \nThe \"La La Land\" team was still celebrating when producer Jordan Horowitz took to the microphone to say : \"There's been a mistake. 'Moonlight,' you guys won best picture.\" He then passed his statue to the \"Moonlight\" producers, adding: \"This is not a joke.\" \nThis was met with gasps in the audience and, later, amazement backstage. \"Is that the craziest Oscar moment of all time?\" said Emma Stone, who won best actress for her performance in \"La La Land.\" \nAll the winners' envelopes are guarded by two PwC partners, Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz, who are also the only two people who know the results beforehand. #Oscars : The 2 best secret keepers in the world. @PwC_LLP 's @briancullinan_ and @MarthaLTRuiz --the only ones on earth who know the winners! pic.twitter.com/Y3YCYqk37F — Robert Kovacik (@RobertNBCLA) February 25, 2017 \nThey take pride in what they have described as a meticulously organized operation, one that supposedly prepares for every eventuality and problem. The pair are solely responsible for counting the votes of the 7,000 Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences members. \n\"It's up to Brian and I to fully count everything together once, twice and sometimes multiple times to make sure it's correct,\" Ruiz told the BBC last week. \nThis is all done manually, with Cullinan and Ruiz leading a \"crack team of accountants to count the ballots and tally the results,\" according to PwC. \nBefore Sunday's fiasco, the company said this process involves \"no scanning machines. No computers ... [and] no security breaches.\" Warren Beatty holds the envelope containing the name of what he believes is the best picture winner but instead reads \"Actress in a Leading Role.\" Kevork Djansezian / Getty Images \nThe counting isn't the end of it. \nCullinan and Ruiz then memorize every winner in case something happens to the envelopes, even quizzing each other to make sure they know every actress, actor, film, director, song and technical crew. \nThey each carry a briefcase containing a complete set of ballots, taking different routes to Hollywood's Dolby Theatre in case one of them gets held up in traffic. They even have constant security provided by the LAPD, and stand at opposite sides of the stage handing ballots of the presenters. \nRelated: 'The Susan Lucci of the Oscars' Finally Ends Losing Streak \nIt's a system that has worked without major incident for the past 83 years, the time PwC has been responsible for counting the Oscars votes. \n\"It's such a long-term relationship [between PwC and the Oscars] that we know intricately how everything works, the timing of it, the process that we use, and they have absolute trust in us and what we do,\" Cullinan told Market Watch before Sunday's ceremony. \nNeither partner had tweeted about the mix-up as of 1:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET). \nUnsurprisingly, the incident gave birth to a host of memes and jokes on social media — with #envelopegate trending early Monday. — Mike Riopell (@MikeRiopell) February 27, 2017 I'm starting to wonder if I got nominated for Into The Wild after all. #Oscars — Emile Hirsch (@EmileHirsch) February 27, 2017 Jill Stein is already raising money for an #Oscars recount. — Matt Mackowiak (@MattMackowiak) February 27, 2017 Hey \"La La Land\" remember when you gave us that fake happy ending and then took it awayHow's it feel — Daniel \"Kibblesmith\" (@kibblesmith) February 27, 2017 \nThe best picture mix-up wasn't the only error at the ceremony. \nLeading Australian producer Jan Chapman told Variety she was \"devastated\" after her picture was used in the In Memoriam segment paying tribute to people who had passed away. \nHer image was accidentally used in the tribute to her good friend and colleague, Janet Patterson, the late Australian costume designer. \n\"Janet was a great beauty and four-time Oscar nominee and it is very disappointing that the error was not picked up,\" she told Variety in an email.
