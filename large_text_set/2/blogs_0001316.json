But sadly, only between the hours of 12-3pm, which sparked lines out the door of people waiting to get a taste. Upon trying the burger, Chang himself declared “today I tasted the future and it was vegan.” Later that year, west coast foodies would be able to get a taste of this meat-free burger when it was added to the menus of Cockscomb and Jardinière in San Francisco, as well as vegan Chef Tal Ronnen’s restaurant Crossroads Kitchen. Interestingly, Crossroads Kitchen is the only all-vegan restaurant that serves the Impossible Burger, signaling that the general consensus of plant-based protein is shifting away from bland, tasteless hippie food and being embraced by all. \nWell, good news, everyone! The Impossible Burger is now available at to two more New York locations: Saxon + Parole and the two-time James Beard awarded and Michelin star-rated, Public. Both are run by Executive Chef Brad Farmerie. And, according to Observer , it will also be featured on the menu of The Daily, Public’s adjacent sister bar, where it will actually replace the beef burger that is currently on the menu. \nHopefully, this will alleviate the massive lines at Momofuku Nishi. Farmerie said at the launch event, “we’ve always been trying to push the creative edge, to find ingredients that are new and different … When I first heard about Impossible meat, I thought this is something I really want to check out.” \nSo far, every chef whose restaurant added the Impossible Burger to the menu has served it in their own way. At Momofuku Nishi, for example, the burger is dressed with special sauce, lettuce, and tomato like a classic American hamburger. However, Observer reveals that at Public, the Impossible Burger will be served “on a seeded bun topped with muhammara (hot pepper) aioli, white cheddar, watercress, frisée, and house-made relish, served with a side of crispy shoestring potatoes” while at Saxon + Parole, it will be served “topped with both mushroom and truffle sauces, sherry-braised onions, oyster mushrooms and the traditional lettuce, tomato, and onion.” \nThe burger itself is something of a marvel: it is made from textured wheat protein, potatoes, seasoning, and an ingredient called heme , which is what makes the burger so unbelievably meaty and juicy. The journey of the Impossible Burger from its development to its several debuts at restaurants that are famous for their meat-based dishes shows how the future of food is plant-based. \nLead image source: Impossible Foods /Facebook Want to read more posts like this?
