Spoiler alert: That means not debating the definition of emotional intelligence. Corrine even goes so far as to say Taylor isn’t there for the *right reasons.* Despite bursting into a screaming match, it’s Sarah and Astrid who are eliminated. \nBut to the Bayou! \nA little chemistry, down south. (Photo: Mark Coffey, ABC) \nBeignet, Done That \nFor this week’s one-on-one, Nick chooses Rachel — a refreshing choice considering she’s faded a bit since her dominate week one. It doesn’t take long before they hit it off again and even redefine Bachelor date standards — yes, y’all. They eat. Beignets, oysters, hot sauce... everything we know is thrown out the window and down their throats. \nBut the most notable thing about Rachel and Nick’s date is their palpable chemistry. As they move to the evening date, Rachel and Nick discuss family and for the first time, the long game and what it might mean for Nick to meet her father. Clearly she gets the rose. \nWhine and Spirits \nAfterwards Nick takes the other girls to a haunted mansion, save Corinne and Taylor who are busy haunting the hotel in preparation for their two-on-one date. The night revolves around a legend of a little dead girl named May who apparently is not one to be screwed around with. The girls are pretty weary except for Jasmine, who is the classic horror story fool who decides early that May is not worth her time . Oh Jasmine. \nThe girls waste a perfectly good Ouija board session asking things like, “Who will get the group date rose?” and “Will Nick get engaged soon?” while May is clearly not impressed. Instead, she makes her presence known by dropping a chandelier near Jasmine and appearing in mirrors. As the paranormal takes place, the girls complain they don’t get enough time with Nick. But the spirits were enough to force Danielle M. into Nick’s arms, which is clearly what a girl needs to do to lock in a group date rose because that’s just what she does. \nVoodoos and Don’ts of Two-On-Ones \nAnd then there were two—Corinne and Taylor, archenemies... each more emotionally mature than the other. A two-on-one felt so tense since the days of Ashley I. and Kelsey. They meet up with a voodoo priestess who reads their cards — and immediately determines that Taylor was provoked and that she’s a water sign, which is how you know she’s legit. While she talks to Taylor, Corinne throws Nick under the bus so hard that you can hear the thud echo off the stagnant water. \nAfter trading spots, Nick addresses Corinne’s accusations with Taylor, while the voodoo priestess tells Corinne that she’s kind of harsh. The two girls reunite at a table. The priestess tells Taylor not to argue with Corinne, which she agrees to, but minutes later, Taylor must have forgotten because she calls Corinne a liar. But when Nick joins them, it’s Taylor who he sends packing. Well. That settles that. Voodoo is real. #TheBachelor pic.twitter.com/I3DkToHfxa — Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) January 31, 2017 \nAnd now for the trifecta: \nThe Good \nAdorable Raven, a usual Good suspect, returns after admitting to Nick that she’s falling in love with him. Granted, her admission is on accident, but it’s an admission nonetheless. It catches Nick off guard, but she totally owns it and clearly makes herself a frontrunner if she weren’t one already. \nThe Bad \nPost-elimination, our girl Taylor goes and gets herself doused in oils and water by secondary low-key voodoo priestesses before deciding that she needs to speak her mind. So girlfriend catches a helicopter and meets Corinne and Nick mid-date to make sure the truth comes out. \nThe Viall \nIn a first, the Viall award goes to the voodoo priestess who decided it was a good idea to set Corinne up with her own voodoo doll after asking if she can have one to exact revenge on Taylor. I don’t know what the code of voodoo ethics is, but this has to break it. \nWith that, we’ll see next week if Taylor’s plan works or if Corinne kills her with magic next week on Monday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. \nCatch up on the season here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:07:22.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
