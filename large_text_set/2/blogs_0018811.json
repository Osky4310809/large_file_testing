See, after a stay on the original one was upheld by an appeals court, the White House decided to retool and reissue the ban. \nMiller said the revisions would be “minor” and “technical” and would really just address the new ruling more than they would change anything substantial from the first order, which gave MacCallum pause. Why revise an order only slightly when 48 courts rejected it the first time? She asked him as much, like this: \nHere is one of the problems: I know you think the order was fine the way it was issued initially, but courts disagree. In fact, 48 courts took issue with it, and that’s why it is halted right now, as a result of that process that happens in this country. So, now, you are about to issue another order, and one of the things that would need to be addressed, it sounds like, is proving that the seven countries that you have targeted are indeed the right ones to target, and that you have merit and reason for targeting those specific ones, rather than, say, Saudi Arabia, right? \n“That process that happens in this country” refers, of course, to the judiciary’s role in providing other branches of government with checks and balances. Trump criticized the judiciary heavily for blocking the ban, leading to his own Supreme Court nominee expressing some alarm over the president’s seeming hostility toward the checks and balances that comprise the foundation of American democracy. \nWatch the whole thing above. \n[image: screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:53:35.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
