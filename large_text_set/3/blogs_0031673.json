Now, thanks to a new post, we know that Sush is in New York. And while she is there, the former Miss Universe is dressing for it. Like a true New Yorker, she was seen in a perfectly-fitting red coat, styled with a printed rich-girl scarf and thigh-high boots. A cross-body sling finished out our homegirl's city look. \nWhile in the city, Sush also stopped by her go-to hairdresser. And, boy did she look flawless in her no make-up look. \nA post shared by Sushmita Sen (@sushmitasen47) on Mar 29, 2017 at 12:05pm PDT \nWe are hoping that there would be more such stunners from her Big Apple trip. Well, we're here for all of it, Sush.
