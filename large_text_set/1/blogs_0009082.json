He was spotted banging his head against a metal sliding door three times in frustration after a loss to the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field late last month.\nBart Hubbuch  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T04:57:11.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
