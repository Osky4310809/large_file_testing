A person exposed to this amount of radiation would likely die in about 40 minutes, the Japan Times reports.

Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) officials, however, dismissed the idea that it might be melted nuclear fuel. \nExperts have been looking for the melted fuel, which they believe has been accumulating in tainted water. \nIn March 2011, a 9.1 earthquake and the 15-meter tsunami that followed disabled the cooling system of Fukushima’s three reactors, causing the worst nuclear incident since the 1986 Chernobyl incident in Ukraine. \nTEPCO, which operates the crippled power plant, has been obliged to deal with the consequences of the incident. \nIn February, a robot sent to explore Reactor 2 broke down because of the “unimaginable” levels of radiation, close to 650 sieverts per hour. This was the first time a robot entered this reactor since the plant’s meltdown in 2011. \nPreviously, the highest radiation level was recorded one year after the disaster and went up to 73 sieverts per hour. \nTEPCO has promised extract the hazardous material stuck in the plant’s second reactor, its president Naohiro Masuda said, according to the Japan Times. \nIn December, TEPCO nearly doubled the estimated cost for the Fukushima clean-up to $188 billion. \nA zone of more than 300 square miles around the plant is currently uninhabitable due to the continuing radiation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:42:07.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
