In order to preserve his proposal plans, Winston said no which…obviously didn’t go very well. Enter Jess, who makes the proposal surprisingly romantic and totally saves Valentine’s Day. \nAlthough Jess’s plan hits a bit of a road block and she needed a surprise Gordon Ramsey to save her, we’re THRILLED TO SAY THAT ALY AND WINSTON ARE OFFISH ENGAGED AFTER A TRULY RIDICULOUS PROPOSAL . #BLESSED Fox At first we were like “oh noooo” because it looked like the episode was going down in flames when Winston so eloquently said “ na ” when the girl he loves asked him to marry her. Definitely not what he had in mind whilst planning koala-ty time with Aly.\nFox But then it all went uphill from there. And, most importantly, obvi, Winston wore a full on Bobcat costume to do the deed (because it relates back to an earlier precious moment between he and Aly…if you have to ask then you don’t understand) which is just…too perfect for words, really. Who hasn’t dreamed of their guy proposing to them looking like a wild animal?\nFox In case you missed one of the bigger moments of our lives, check out the proposal below and get ready for your heart to explode.\nLOVE, TRUE LOVE. We couldn’t have asked for a better Valentine’s Day, tbh.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:53:56.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
