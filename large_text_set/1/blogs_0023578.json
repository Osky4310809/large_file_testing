That’s why everyone will have a Liverpool shirt come Tuesday night, because Tottenham, Man United , Arsenal and Man City will all be looking for that small glimmer of hope. The whole league needs a win for Liverpool.” \nThe BT Sport pundit added: “I know how big the game is for the club because the gap is already 10 points and they must give themselves a bit of hope by taking all the points. Klopp's men cannot afford to lose on Tuesday night, reckons Gerrard (Photo: Reuters / Dylan Martinez) The former Liverpool skipper fears Chelsea could be even better as the season goes on (Photo: BT Sport) \n“Anything else and it’s advantage Chelsea – and it would be a massive advantage. They have only dropped 11 points since the start of the season – and I also think they could improve in the second half of the season.” \nThe newly-appointed Liverpool coach tipped Chelsea as potential champions when he saw them play Liverpool in California last summer. \nGerrard added: “Liverpool hunted in packs and put pressure on Chelsea, while Conte set up to be compact. You could see how much he had done in such a short space of time.” He was also impressed with how Conte dealt with £30million striker Diego Costa when China came calling.
