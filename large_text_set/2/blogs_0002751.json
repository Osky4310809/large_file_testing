Brought forth by his father of all people. \nTMZ has learned that Calvin Cooksey didn’t take too kindly of his inclusion in the open letter his son wrote calling for acceptance in the midst of last year’s massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando . \nIn one particular passage, the Grammy Award-winning R&B star wrote : \n“I heard on the news that the aftermath of a hate crime left piles of bodies on a dance floor this month. I heard the gunman feigned dead among all the people he killed. I heard the news say he was one of us. I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a faggot as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.” \nIf Ocean’s recollections are correct, that would put 23 years in between actually seeing his father, and Cooksey seemingly has no problem cashing in on the strain of their relationship. \nHe’s asking for $14.5 million in damages to his reputation, claiming that the alleged transgender libel ruined his financial opportunities in film and music. Right. \nCooksey is no stranger to headline-grabbing lawsuits, either. In 2014, he sued Russell Simmons after GlobalGrind ran a story calling him “a deadbeat dad.” At press time, he was demanding $145 million from Simmons but no new developments have been reported on the case.
