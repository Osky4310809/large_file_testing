You should come with me. We'll do something else on our own.' \n\"So I get that. I wasn't bashing him like people do online, but I get that mindset, so I try not to get too mad. But when they attack you, it gets really discouraging, and it's hard not to get bitter and mad at 'em. But I just try to encourage people to just zip it, man, 'cause if you're not loving, then you're missing it all.\" \nHe continued: \"You know, 'love is patient, love is kind,' Paul says in First Corinthians Thirteen, and not rude. And they're all rude on there doing it. And so I call 'em keyboard gangsters, 'cause they're behind the keyboard computer and they would never talk like that to people's face. But online, they're [vicious]. And so it's just really discouraging.\" \nThe guitarist added: \"I would just say, you guys should just... you've gotta break through that, man. This is all about love, and it's, like, let the Lord teach 'em slowly through scripture and everything what to let go of in their lives and the timing. Maybe it'll take years for some people to let go of things, but we've gotta give 'em patience.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T06:39:39.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
