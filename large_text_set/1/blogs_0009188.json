Northern Ireland 'facing growing political crisis'- Martin McGuinness \nOn Monday, Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness resigned, effectively ending power-sharing at Stormont. He cited concerns over the DUP’s “arrogance” in how it has handled allegations of a major financial scandal, known as the “cash for ash” affair. \nHis DUP counterpart Arlene Foster is accused of mishandling a Government project on renewable energy, which has cost the taxpayer more than £400 million. \nSpeaking to The Independent, Ms Long said: “There is a growing perception in Northern Ireland that the potential usefulness of DUP votes in Westminster to advance Brexit may be compromising the UK Government’s willingness to challenge the DUP and ability to act as honest broker and impartial guardians of the Good Friday Agreement.” \nShe warned failure to do so could result in “the permanent collapse of the political institutions”. \nMs Long, who represents the East Belfast constituency, revealed she had written to Ms May’s Government on two occasions last month, warning of Stormont’s imminent collapse and urging action. \nShe says the Government failed to act, which fuelled turmoil in Northern Ireland and led to Mr McGuinness’ resignation. \nThe letters, seen by The Independent , urge the Government to launch an inquiry into the “cash for ash” financial scandal, warning “failure of the executive to properly address this issue could have very significant consequences [which could] present a serious threat to the stability of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland [and] could trigger the collapse of the executive”. \nMs Long said the Government failed to take her warnings seriously and did not act. She told The Independent : “It has been clear that the current government, led by Theresa May, is completely tone death to the issues in Northern Ireland with neither the experience nor frankly the interest to recognise the political sensitivities.” \nThe “cash for ash” scandal allegations relate to the Renewable Heat Initiative which was designed in 2012 to encourage local businesses to use renewable energy sources. However, the scheme appears to have had serious flaws, resulting in a loophole which meant businesses were given a financial incentive to burn fuel pointlessly. \nMs Foster, who became First Minister last year, was the minister in charge of the scheme at the time and has subsequently come under considerable criticism. The allegations emerged via a whistle-blower in November and intensified in December when one of Ms Foster’s party colleagues Jonathan Bell alleged she had asked civil servants to alter documents to reduce the appearance of her role in the affair. \nShe denies any wrongdoing and says she has been unfairly represented in the media. She resisted calls to resign and survived an attempted vote of no confidence at Stormont. \nUnder power-sharing rules, Mr McGuinness' resignation means Ms Foster also loses her position as both must participate equally in government. \nSecretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire now has a week to announce Northern Ireland will face new elections. \nThe Independent has approached 10 Downing Street and the Northern Ireland Secretary's office for comment.
