Honorees will mourn the “dark times in America” in their $20,000 frocks. Or they’ll mutter “fight the fascists” as they head back to their Malibu estates.\nThey’re going gaga in La La Land. Chris Kelly, co-head writer of “SNL,” said in March that “Donald Trump is winning because everyone you’ve ever been on a bus with gets to vote too.” The tweet wasn’t shocking because of its sneering disdain for Americans. What was breathtaking was the blitheness with which it dismissed a principle as formidable and established as democracy.\nFour days after Donald Trump was elected president, “SNL” transmuted that disgust for the people into contempt for its own animating principle — that it should at least try to be funny. It opened the show with an open display of grief, Kate McKinnon’s weepy, earnest (and consequently) embarrassing performance of “Hallelujah” while dressed as Hillary Clinton. The show’s first post-9/11 segment was not nearly as sorrowful in tone.\nMcKinnon, Kelly and many other entertainers might as well have told 46 percent of their audience to take their business elsewhere. How contemptuous is that? Even Krusty the Clown, in one of his darkest hours, vowed to spit on only one of every 50 Krusty Burgers to punish America. That’s only 2 percent! When you hate 23 times as much as Krusty, seek therapy.\n\nJennifer Lawrence, who wasn’t strongly identified with liberal politics before the election, wrote an angry open letter after it , telling America, “Do not let this defeat you — let this enrage you! Let it motivate you! Let this be the fire you didn’t have before.”\nHer latest movie, “Passengers,” which will need to earn well over $300 million to be profitable, has fizzled, bringing in only $130 million in its opening weeks. Might be a coincidence. Or maybe her new Dixie Chick shtick is turning off her fans.\n“RISE UP” and “THE REVOLUTION IS COMING” tweeted Katy Perry in defiance of Trump’s election. “This is an embarrassing night for America. We’ve let a hatemonger lead our great nation,” agreed Captain America, Chris Evans, whose tweet virtually tagged 46 percent of American voters as supporters of the hate that Trump supposedly mongered. Chrissy Teigen, also on Twitter, called Trump a “POS” (meaning “piece of s–t”) for saying Mike Pence should not have been hectored from the stage by a star of “Hamilton.”\nTHE REVOLUTION IS COMING.\n— KATY PERRY (@katyperry) November 9, 2016 \n\nMichael Shannon — General Zod in “Man of Steel” — joined fellow actors Debra Messing and Rosie O’Donnell in signing an open letter published in The New York Times exhorting, “Fill the streets of DC with millions, millions more demonstrate in every major city and small town all over US and the world, demanding that Trump-Pence be prevented from taking office before January 20.” It was an open call for mob rule to overturn the results of an election. And somehow Trump is the fascist?\nCelebrities have every right to say what they think, including the remarkably dumb things they think, and if they want to turn their backs on half of America, their diminished relevance and pay is of little concern to the rest of us.\nPossibly the craving of performers to be taken seriously is understandable when you consider how intellectually insecure they can be. Lawrence has been acting since she was 14 and didn’t attend college. Shannon is a high-school dropout. Perry left high school at age 15. Evans did not attend college. Teigen attended community college “for a couple of days.” They look around and see a Nobel Prize winning columnist like Paul Krugman of The New York Times inveighing against Trump, and they long to be valued as much for their thoughts as their looks. They hunger to be known as “activists” in addition to mere actors or singers.\nBut they’re supposed to spread joy, not rancor. And they’re oblivious to the way they motivate Trump supporters. A central reason for his victory was the widespread conviction of his backers that progressive politics, as relentless and fanatical as the Viet Cong, was infiltrating and attacking every nook of American life, not excluding bakeries, the national anthem, restrooms and now even pronouns. (Don’t call her a her if she wants to be called zir, zid or indeed Zod.)\nDragging politics in where it doesn’t belong makes life more combative, irritating and exhausting. It means no escape, no outlet, no letup, anywhere. The Viet Progs not only never give up, they never take a week off or stop advancing into new territory. We keep saying the country is too divided and it is. But five minutes ago the national anthem was considered uncontroversial. Now it’s a fount of disputation and bitterness. Whose fault is that, progressives?\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T04:48:34.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
