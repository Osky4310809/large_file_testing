But the police defended the decision to issue it.\n\"We have five to ten cars stolen this way every winter,\" Roseville Police Chief James Berlin told WXYZ. \"It’s dangerous and of course it drives everyone's insurance rates up. It drives our crime rates up.\"\nHe added that Taylor should have known better.\n\"It’s common sense. We can’t warn everybody of the law there is. Common sense says you don’t leave your car running unattended,\" he added.\nBerlin reacted sharply to Taylor calling the officer names in his Facebook post.\n\"You see the disparaging comments he made about my officer?\" Berlin told Click On Detroit. \"Drop dead.\"\nTaylor is scheduled to appear in court over the incident later in January. But there is no sign he is ready to accept the ticket.\n\"Every person warms up their car,\" Taylor told Click On Detroit. \"We live in Michigan!\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:42:24.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
