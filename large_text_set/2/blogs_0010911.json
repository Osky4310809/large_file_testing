The adorable 1-year-old , who recently returned from a tropical vacation with her family , strutted her stuff on the runway in an Air Jordan tracksuit that matched her dad. After being carried by her mom, Chanel stood at the end of the runway and struck a fierce pose. If her second year is anything like her first , she's in for more glamour than most Hollywood stars.
