Leave it at that. Otherwise collect your $600k a year and go away.”\n“I haven’t seen any policies that hurt kids yet,” another person wrote. “So, why is that in this discussion? If you know something I don’t, please inform me. And yes, kids and family are off limits. None of our business.”\nSome were empathetic with the former first daughter — a longtime Ivanka Trump pal.\n“I remember your childhood in the White House. The media was sometimes very cruel. Children don’t have a choice as to what their parents do. I hope he’ll be allowed to just be a kid,” one person wrote.\n“He is an innocent child. Loved watching him play [peek] a boo. Be kind people,” another said, referring to Barron playing the game with his nephew while at the inaugural parade.\nClinton was a frequent target of the media during her family’s eight years in the White House, including “Saturday Night Live” mocking her appearance and her being the focus of a People magazine piece about then-President Clinton’s sex scandal.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": ["http://nyp.st/2k5JiyD", "https://www.facebook.com/chelseaclinton/posts/971766646256556"], "published": "2017-01-23T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:05:57.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
