Giphy \nWe’re going to miss the level-headed views and achievable goals the 44th president had for our country. \nOn the other side of things, there are a whole lot of Americans who feel the opposite and are quite thrilled Obama is leaving — and this 6-year-old girl is NOT one of them. Newsflare \nIn a new viral video, we’re introduced to a little girl named Amber from Miami, Florida who is not happy about President Obama’s leaving and passing the torch to Trump. \nAmber was filmed by her mom Linzy as she watched the president’s emotional farewell speech on January 10. Obama pays tribute to his family during his farewell speech To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nLet’s just say this 6-year-old girl channeled the emotion millions of Americans were feeling as they stared at Obama’s last speech as our fearless leader. \nDuring the video, Amber’s mom attempts to comfort her, saying, \nTomorrow we’ll watch the Michelle Speech that she made to everybody OK. That one’s a really good one — her final advice speech. \nWhile comforting, those words were not enough to stop little Amber from sobbing. \nAs any other parent would, Linzy asked, Why are you so sad though? In all seriousness, she’s right. Why is Amber SO sad?! She’s 6 years old, –she doesn’t need to be worried about the downfall of American politics right now. Crayons and cartoons? Yes. Politics? Maybe later. However, Amber doesn’t give a fuck about what I think. She answered her mom honestly, saying, Because he’s never going to be the president no more. \nSure, she’s only 6, but she has a strong and impressive understanding of politics. Giphy \nHer mom can pat herself on the back for that. My daughter being only six knows of the president whom she loves very much. It’s really her first view of a president but I do read to her all the books of all the United States presidents so she’s very familiar. \nShe certainly is. Now, I’m not a fan of meme-ing little kids, but if you ask me, Amber’s reaction would make a GREAT, relatable meme. \nCheck out the video about and grab a box of Kleenex before you do. \n  CITATIONS DailyMail.com DailyMail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T06:42:25.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
