It seems like every former high school classmate gets engaged sometime between Christmas and New Years. This trend isn’t just for old Facebook friends either, even celebrities get engaged en masse this time of year. The most recent follower of this trend is tennis great Serena Williams. Over the weekend, Williams rung in the new year by getting engaged to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Naturally the first reaction to any engagement is wanting to see the ring. For those flocking over to her Instagram feed, Williams had a surprise in store . \nCheck out the pic below: \nSneak peek. ❤️It was a corn tortilla of course in case you were wondering. \nA photo posted by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Jan 2, 2017 at 1:06pm PST \nThat’s right, Williams has a taco engagement ring. She captioned the photo, “ Sneak peek. ❤️It was a corn tortilla of course in case you were wondering.” \nBear necessities \nA photo posted by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Nov 28, 2016 at 6:14pm PST \nWe love Williams sense of humor and while we don’t exactly buy that the taco ring is her real engagement ring (but you never know), we love that she’s taking some time to enjoy her new engagement. The couple took to Reddit to announce their engagement in the I Said Yes thread. Williams posted an adorable romantic poem to the thread. She wrote, \n“At the same table we first met by chance/ This time he made it not by chance/ But by choice/ Down on one knee/ He said 4 words/ And I said yes.” \nThe couple has been together since the fall of 2015, after Williams had a brief romance with Drake. We’re so happy for them and can’t wait to see what the wedding will look like! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:35:14.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
