Brian was shocked the crew was from Essex. \nBecky Keith, whose blind disabled son Zac, four, relies on the ward, called the closure underhand and a nightmare. \nActivist Ellen King said: “This is a disgraceful waste of taxpayers’ money, a prime example of why the NHS is in crisis. It is outrageous ambulances are used as taxis to transfer sick children away from home and their families when we have a perfectly good children’s ward on the doorstep.” Read More Theresa May has 'lost control' of NHS crisis as A&E figures show worst performance EVER \nIdris Griffiths, Chief Officer at NHS Bassetlaw Clinical Commissioning Group said the Doncaster-based ambulance provider “ensures we have a dedicated service at peak times to transfer any child that needs admitting to hospital overnight.” \nDavid Purdue, from the Trust, said the ward had to close “due to medical and nursing staff vacancies.” THE NHS faces pressures like those in Mid Staffs, said Sir Robert Francis, who led the scandal inquiry.
