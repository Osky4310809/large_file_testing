AFP/GETTY IMAGES FILE PHOTO \nSAN FRANCISCO—Golden State Warriors guard Andre Iguodala was fined $10,000 on Monday for racially charged remarks deemed “inappropriate” by the NBA. \nIguodala incurred the wrath of the league for comments made following the Warriors’ 103-102 defeat to the Minnesota Timberwolves last Friday. \nAsked about a plan by coach Steve Kerr to rest Iguodala and other Warriors stars for Saturday’s game against San Antonio, Iguodala replied: “Nope, no clue. I do what master say.” ADVERTISEMENT \nHe later used a notorious racial slur when quizzed about the Warriors’ loss to Minnesota. \nNBA executive vice president of basketball operations Kiki VanDeWeghe said in a statement Iguodala had been fined for “making inappropriate comments during a postgame media interview.” \nWarriors coach Kerr later laughed off the remarks, telling reporters: “You guys just got Andre’d.”“Andre is one of those guys who likes to stir the pot and has a lot of cryptic messaging at times,” Kerr added. “(He) jokes around. I didn’t take anything from it. It’s just Andre being Andre.” \nIguodala scored eight points in 32 minutes after coming on off the bench against the Timberwolves. \nOn Saturday, San Antonio routed the under-strength Golden State 107-85 without two of their biggest stars in Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge. \nThe Warriors (52-14) are in a three-game losing streak and have dropped four of their last six games. \nRELATED STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:54:27.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
