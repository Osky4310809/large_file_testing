During a stop on Good Morning America on Wednesday, Dax revealed the secret to his decade-long romance with wife Kristen Bell , who also stars in the film . \"We went to therapy early on to learn what our pattern of arguing was and where we needed to stop that. It's great too, because you go to the therapist and he listens to you talk for about 30 seconds and then he's like, 'I got it.'\" He also stated that couples often seek counseling when it's too late, adding, \"Most people wait until the thing is exploding before they see a professional. I thought maybe an ounce of prevention this go-around would be advisable.\"\nDax and Kristen tied the knot at a Beverly Hills courthouse in October 2013 and are parents to daughters Lincoln, 3, and Delta, 2.
