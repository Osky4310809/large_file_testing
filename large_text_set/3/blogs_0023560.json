Instead, however, it’s been marred by “the news that he was repudiated by his own FBI director.” \n“Two months into his Presidency, Gallup has Mr. Trump’s approval rating at 39%,” the board wrote in conclusion. “No doubt Mr. Trump considers that fake news, but if he doesn’t show more respect for the truth most Americans may conclude he’s a fake President.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:07:12.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
