Today is January 6 and if we start talking about players already it is going to be a long month. \n\"The club as always is working hard behind the scenes. We have an important game on Sunday and I have to think about the players we have here.\" \nOn Gestede, he added: \"Rudy will be a really good player for us. He gives us something different and I am pleased he is here so early in the window. \n\"I will have to think but I don't think he will start from the beginning on Sunday.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:41:44.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
