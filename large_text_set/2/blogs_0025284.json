Let me repeat Tom Perez is NOT now the king of the democrats. The DNC is simply a fundraising/media outlet, a private club, it’s antiquated, their functions can be done through crowdfunding and social media.Elected Democrats don’t need them like they think they do, the right ideas and stances will win votes and small dollar contributions adding up to big money. Ask these folks if you need proof: Bernie and Jane Sanders Party takeover is the only option — on every level committee, local, state, and national and it will be done. -Ray Alt (Activist Run Tulsi Run ) Sam Ronan Thanks, Samuel Ronan for giving a voice to the thousands that support you, and thanks for endorsing Keith. A 235–200 vote in their stronghold at the DNC, is nothing to sneeze at, if the party actually follow the platform of Keith and Tom it has the possibility of being relevant in the future, but i want to say to my fellow activists don’t give up on the democrat name, a candidate doesn’t have to take money or orders from the DNC, this is 2017. Sally Boyton Brown Many rising stars were given their say at the forums,with this the DNC has taken big step foreword towards accepting the new energy, don’t let one small battle determine the war for the heart of the party. Together it can become the party of peace , by, for, and with the people DNC Convention 2016 — ALOHA! Tulsi Gabbard is one of those rising stars. Mni Wiconi — Water Is Life I feel she has the honesty and integrity that we need in a candidate for the future, will the democratic party join the grassroots or will they further distance themselves? I hope with this close vote they will consider it a mandate to work with us. Freedom of/from Religion in a Pluralistic Society Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 We can not let them fracture and disenfranchise us, we will continue to fight in what ever frameworks suits us best, and don’t worry about the DNC, we have truth and that beats spin. In 2017 and beyond we are not bound to the DNC they can with us or not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:39:54.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
