Trump has emboldened the ugliest, most hateful elements of society. Fight back, join the resistance! https://t.co/Y44T4mG4nd #disruptj20 pic.twitter.com/a5C1D26OzA — ✊ #DisruptJ20 ✊ (@DisruptJ20) December 29, 2016 \nTrump, known for his brash style, has become a figure of contempt for the US left-wing, vehemently opposed to the businessman-come-politician’s election to the White House. \n“We would like the headline the next day to be ‘Donald Trump inaugurated amid complete chaos’, not ‘Donald Trump, inaugurated amid applause’,” #DisruptJ20 organizer Legba Carrefour told WJLA . \n#DisruptJ20 plans to also hold unpermitted marches after failing to secure permits for all its planned events. \nOther inauguration events arranged include ‘Occupy Inauguration’, with the group planning to march on Trump’s inauguration and hold a rally of speakers and music across Washington DC. \n“We’re going to [be] blockading checkpoints into the security zones. We're also going to be blockading roads and other modes of transit into the city,” a female member of #DisruptJ20 was heard saying in audio acquired by Fox . \nTrump supporters, including ‘Bikers for Trump’, plan to show their presence in the capitol in solidarity with the president-elect. \n“I think it's important to show that he has not been fairly portrayed in the media and there are people that support him,” Charles Hale told WJLA. The Bikers For Trump have a permit for the National Mall and will be very sad to find out that they won't be able to bring their bikes. \nHale is one of a group of bikers expected to rev their engines for Trump on the day of inauguration, driving from Baltimore to witness the event.
