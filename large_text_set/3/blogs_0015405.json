It warns (yet again) these apps will not be compatible with future versions of iOS. \nBut the new “app compatibility” menu takes the warning a step further. It shows if a newer version of the app is available and urges users that “if no update is available, contact the app developer for more information.” \nThe warnings stem from Apple’s apparent plan to force developers into updating legacy apps that were created before the 64-bit processors introduced with the iPhone 5S in 2013. Though the company has attempted to shame developers with outdated apps in the past with warnings that the apps may “slow down” users’ phones, Apple appears to be making a more aggressive push to get developers to update their apps. \nThough the company has required new apps and updates to support 64-bit processors since 2015, there are still at least 187,000 apps that don’t support the modern chipset, according to an analysis from app analytics firm Sensor Tower published earlier this week. That’s in addition to the 47,000 apps Apple removed last fall. \nApple has yet to comment publicly on the matter, other than what’s been seen in the betas, but it seems more likely than ever that iOS 11 will effectively brick a whole lot of apps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:32:08.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
