(Photo by Isaac Brekken/Getty Images for New Era Cap Co.) \nWASHINGTON — The Nationals have settled with Bryce Harper, right-handed pitcher Tanner Roark and catcher Derek Norris ahead of arbitration hearings, according to Jon Heyman. \nRoark, amazingly entering only his first year of arbitration at age 30, has agreed to a $4.315 million deal for 2017, Heyman reports, a substantial pay raise from the $543,400 he made in 2016. MLB Trade Rumors had projected Roark to earn $6.1 million. tanner roark, nats settle at $4.315M \n— Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) January 13, 2017 \nNorris, who was re-acquired by the Nationals this offseason, is entering his second year of arbitration and has agreed to a $4.2 million deal for next season, per Heyman. MLB Trade Rumors projected Norris to earn $4 million. Norris made $2.925 million last season. derek norris, nats settle at $4.2M \n— Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) January 13, 2017 \nTwo other Nationals players — Bryce Harper and Anthony Rendon — are also arbitration eligible. Harper earned $5 million in 2016 and is projected to earn $9.3 million this season. Heyman reports the Nats do have an agreement with Harper, although he did not note the terms. 106.7 The Fan’s Grant Paulsen has confirmed Washington has an arbitration agreement with Harper, not a long-term deal.

All arb-eligibles are under contract now. \n— Chelsea Janes (@chelsea_janes) January 13, 2017 \nRendon, who made $2.8 million last year, was projected to earn $6.4 million. \nThe Nationals reached a $1.575 million deal with arbitration-eligible catcher Jose Lobaton earlier this offseason. They also non-tendered center fielder Ben Revere and traded shortstop Danny Espinosa, both arbitration eligible players. \nFollow @ChrisLingebach and @1067TheFan on Twitter.
