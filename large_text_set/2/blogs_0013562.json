Unbelievable quality for the price! \nI purchased these as a Christmas gift for my niece as her old boots were very worn. I was afraid she would be disappointed that I hadn’t bought her a toy, but she was absolutely thrilled with the boots & loved the camo/pink accent! \nThis is our 2nd pair of these boots, since our 3 year old grew out of his 1st pair. They’re fantastic. Super durable. He did everything in these boots, and they held up great! \nI buy my boys a pair of these boots every year! Kids grow so quickly and these boots last for the time they can wear them and they don’t empty the wallet! LOVE THEM! And the boys love them! \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:02:22.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
