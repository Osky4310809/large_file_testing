The on again, off again couple called it quits for good (perhaps?) in 2015, but he hasn't quite moved on. In a coy way, Mayer admits that \"Still Feel Like Your Man\" off his latest EP is about Perry.\nSEE ALSO: Katy Perry's 'Chained to the Rhythm' is cotton candy political pop\n“Who else would I be thinking about? And by the way, it’s a testament to the fact that I have not dated a lot of people in the last five, six years,\" he tells the Times . \"That was my only relationship. So it’s like, give me this, people.”\nSince the breakup, Perry was in a relationship with Orlando Bloom, but no amount of nude paddle boarding or matching hairstyles could keep their love alive and they recently ended things.\nMayer, meanwhile, hasn't been having much luck with Raya, the dating app for celebrities and influencers. “It’s just lot of chatter,” he says. “We all talk to the same people. There are very few people actually meeting up.” He's looking for something serious right now, though.\nMayer even traded drinking for weed and has been living in hotels to avoid inhabiting a bachelor pad as an unorthodox method of preparing himself to be a husband and father, which further confirms that stars are definitely not just like us.\nWho knows! Maybe these two lovebirds really are chained to the rhythm of each other's heartbeats and will be together yet again.\nWATCH: Watch these privileged babies indulge in their very own day spa", "external_links": ["http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959433/john-mayers-sexually-racially-charged-playboy-interview-sparks-outrage", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/NpNdo7E9.m3u8", "http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a18449/john-mayer-tinder-story/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/arts/music/john-mayer-search-for-everything-interview.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&mtrref=t.co&_r=0", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/NpNdo7E9.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-23T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:41:16.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
