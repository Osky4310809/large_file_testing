He is now six and non verbal, but uses sign for communication.\n‘We are fostering a beautiful deaf boxer girl and she is amazing with my son. She is the most gentle, loving girl ever.\nPeople who go to A&E with toothaches are ‘costing NHS up to £18m a year’ ‘The most beautiful part of this adoption is my son and his dog can actually talk to each other!\n‘ There is something so special about this dog. Something different… I’m so drawn to her.’ \n‘I highly encourage adoption of deaf dogs… She is such a perfect addition to our family. We have been blessed with Ellie.’\nThe family now plan on adopting Ellie so she can become a permanent member of their family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:37:29.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
