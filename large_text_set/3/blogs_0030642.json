But instead, I’ll ask a semi-serious, rhetorical question: Is there anyone left who doesn’t think the league is trying to screw them every chance they get? \nAnother offseason, another owners meeting, and another Rules Committee session where they look at what New England did to give themselves a competitive advantage and eliminate it. And an NFL owner telling a USA Today writer that they refuse to sign off on a rules change if it’s coming from the Patriots. And no one says a thing about it. If this were any other team in any other sport, it would be a scandal. If an NBA owner admitted they’ll listen to every team except San Antonio, there’d be an army of lawyers coming at Adam Silver like ninjas. Or if Joe Maddon started using some radical shift that wins the Cubs the next three World Series and MLB responded by banning the shift, there’d be outrage from coast to coast. But when it’s this one team, it doesn’t even register a collective palms up “meh.” \nI get it. The Patriots aren’t the most sympathetic figures. As NBA legend/vagina expert Wilt Chamberlain put it, “Nobody roots for Goliath.” But even if my team was say, the Chiefs, the fact that the league treats one team by an entirely different set of rules than the other 31 just for the crime of being really good would be horrifying to me. The Pats are the NFL’s Harry Potter, getting persecuted by the Ministry of Magic, treated like garbage by Snape and getting his name put into the Goblet of Fire for no reason other than he’s the Boy Who Lived and the best wizard in school. And if you’re OK with that, if you liked the “leaper” block attempt when Seattle was doing it but now want it outlawed because the Patriots do it or like the fact the league won’t even consider rule changes coming from New England, you’re a loser who doesn’t ever deserve a championship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T18:48:28.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
