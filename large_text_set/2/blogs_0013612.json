Seats behind the opposing bench will run $325 per game. The least expensive seats will cost $70 per game, a $25 increase from what the franchise charged San Diego fans in 2016. \nIt’s also more than what the Rams wanted for season tickets last year, their first season back in Los Angeles since 1994. In 2016, the Rams charged $225 per game for their most expensive season tickets while the cheapest seats were $40, according to the Los Angeles Times . The Rams play in the Coliseum, which can hold more than three times as many people as the StubHub Center. \nThe Chargers are banking on their new stadium’s “intimate setting” to lure fans to the venue in Carson. \n“Playing at StubHub Center is going to offer fans a rare opportunity to see NFL action in a uniquely intimate setting,” A.G. Spanos, the team’s president of business operations, said in a statement . “Every seat at StubHub Center will feel close to the action and fans will be right there with us on every play. Not many venues can make this claim and we expect to sell out quickly. \n“Our game-day experience is going to be awesome,” Spanos said. “We have one of the most exciting offenses in the NFL and a new head coach who is already injecting new energy into our entire organization.” \nThe Chargers will play in StubHub Center until the Inglewood stadium they will share with the Rams is completed, which is expected to be in time for the 2019 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:29:48.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
