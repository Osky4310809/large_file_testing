( YG trolling with an offer to do “FDT” doesn’t count.) The request comes from who else but Azealia Banks . \nThe Harlem rapper posted on Facebook earlier today (January 18) that she “would love to perform at the inauguration” and says the rest of the lineup is not up to par for the historic event. \nBanks has had an up-and-down relationship with the President-elect, who will be officially inaugurated into office on Friday (January 20), with the celebration concert to be held the night before. She bashed him at the end of 2015 when he appeared on the cover of TIME, but slowly voiced her support for the real estate mogul and congratulated him upon winning the election in November. \nTrump has had a hard time securing acts for his inauguration, with Flo Rida assuring fans he’s not participating in the ceremonies and 2 Chainz turning down an offer to perform as well. But he does have a commitment from Chrisette Michele… for now .
