He's blowing smoke up everybody's [expletive]. [UFC president] Dana White, the UFC -- let's make it happen. Bring him over to the boxing world, and I'll show him what it's like.\" \nMayweather said he’s offering McGregor $15 million to fight him. \n\"We tried to make the Conor McGregor fight,\" Mayweather added. \"They know what my number is. My number is a guaranteed $100 million. That was my number.   \n\"We are willing to give him $15 million and then we can talk about splitting the percentage – the back end – on the pay-per-view. But of course, we're the 'A side.' How can a guy talk about making 20 or 30 million if he has never made 8 or 9 million in a fight,\" he continued. \nIn issuing those statements, Mayweather may have ended hopes of a second clash with Pacquiao, who has expressed his desire to get another crack at the undefeated American. \nSpeculations about a rematch between the two boxing superstars intensified when Mayweather showed up ringside at Pacquiao’s fight with Jessie Vargas last year in Las Vegas. \nNow, he’s made it clear that he wants nothing to do with Pacquiao, who is set to face Australian Jeff Horn on Aril 23. \n\"Only thing I'm probably interested in is the Conor McGregor fight,\" Mayweather said. \"I'm a businessman, and it makes business sense.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T06:09:24.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
