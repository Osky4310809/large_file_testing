For one thing, it's patently stupid. For two things, it would cost a heck of a lot of money for something so patently stupid. For thirdsies, the government would have to seize the land of a heck of a lot of fine Texas Republicans to do this fantastically expensive, patently stupid thing . Many of the Texas challenges are unique. Unlike in other states, most of the land along the border is privately held. To build there, the government probably would have to sue landowners to seize the land through eminent domain. [...] \nIn addition, a wall along the Texas border would slice through at least two golf courses, the rugged mountains of Big Bend National Park and historic towns and ranch lands founded before an independent U.S. or Mexico even existed. \nCutting up two golf courses? Well that's it, you might as well scrap the whole idea right there. Donald Trump considers golf courses to be his sacred homeland. \nAnyhoo, you can't build a wall along many sections of the Rio Grande to begin with. It floods. There are treaties. It cuts through nearly inaccessible terrain. Rich Texas Republicans with views of the river don't want that view blocked with a new Berlin Wall-style behemoth. And that is why people like Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and a bucketload of other big-name Republicans are, yup—against it. \nThis is why previous calls to wall off those sections have always been failed—because sooner or later, everyone involved realizes just how expensive and stupid and anti-landowner the whole thing would be, for sections of the border that are very difficult for anyone to cross to begin with, and everyone just sort of drifts off and pretends the whole idea never happened. \nAnd this is why Donald Trump, too, probably is not actually going to build a wall in those places. He may or may not know that, and he may or may not admit it, but his own appointees aren't going to do it because even they aren't that stupid. They may install more cameras. They may fly over it a bit more often with drones. But a physical wall? It’s not going to happen. A memo issued this week by the Homeland Security Department specifies that the wall should be planned for “the most appropriate locations,” and that officials should use “appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve operational control of the border.” \nTrump not keeping this particularly stupid promise would be good news, of course. Now the government will have more money to send him out golfing every weekend. The only true question in any of this might be what happens when Trump supporters find out he's been bullshitting them not just about Mexico \"paying for\" the wall, but on building the full promised wall to begin with. \nOur guess? Not a thing. They knew he was a liar when they voted for him. They're in this for the racism; the rest is details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:15:44.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
