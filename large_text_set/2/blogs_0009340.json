I know that Gucci is gonna guide me in the right direction with the music, and so getting his guidance was important in making this decision over other offers I had on the table.” A photo posted by #RALOLAFLARE (@ralofamgoon) on Feb 12, 2017 at 1:48pm PST \nFor Gucci Mane, who is preparing the release of his Droptop Wizop album, 1017 Eskimo Records comes after he established his 1017 Brick Squad Records in 2007.
