The filing notes that the federal government consents to the move to end the stay.\nThe lawyers for Hawaii plan to bring the new challenge, an amended complaint, on Wednesday, according to the joint filing by the state and Justice Department lawyers. The Justice Department’s response would be due on March 13, with Hawaii’s reply filed the next day.\nAlthough the challenge, if filed on Wednesday, likely will be the first challenge to the new ban, it is not the first announcement that there will be a challenge. That was made by the Arab American Civil Rights League and others in an ongoing lawsuit pending in Michigan. That filing , however, only stated that a new challenge would be coming on the March 16 effective date of the new order.\nView this embed › \nID: 10659443", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:53:40.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
