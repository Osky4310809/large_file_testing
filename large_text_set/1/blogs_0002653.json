There were some Paradise viewers — as well as a few Paradise costars — who were extremely suspicious about the longterm success of this particular pairing ( current Bachelor Nick Viall lead the pack, in fact).\nIf you’ll remember, Josh Murray had been accused of having anger issues in a book written by his ex , Andi Dorfman, so friends and viewers were pretty concerned to see him end up with super sweet mother-of-two Amanda.\nDavid Livingston/Getty Images Amanda opened up about the split to ET at last night’s Bachelor premiere, saying,\n“I actually haven’t talked about it yet, because it’s been a little hard. I haven’t really, you know, thought about what to say, but yeah, we did break up. It’s sad.” She went on to say, “I just think there are some things in a relationship you can work on, you know, nobody is perfect. But then there’s also things that you just can’t work on and things that you just know aren’t going to work out in the long run…It’s hard, you know, he moved across the country to live with us and I think, at the end of the day, we’re just very different people and things just didn’t work out. Just normal relationship things.”\nShe also mentioned that he moved out right before the holidays, and her entire family came to stay the next day, which she thinks has helped her two children with the difficult transition.\nRick Rowell/ABC/Getty Images If there’s one thing we know for sure, it’s that breakups suck. So we’re honestly just sending our best wishes to both of these two right now. It sounds like they’re trying to handle the situation as maturely as possible (i.e.: keep things drama-free, especially in the press), and we just hope they’re doing okay during what must be a supremely sucky time.\nHang in there, guys!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T18:19:18.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
