And so, in honor of all the poor celebs who've had their life story \"immortalized\" on this, the smallest of screens, here are eight of the most ridiculous Lifetime celebrity biopics. 1. Britney Ever After \nBritney Ever After just debuted this week, and the actress playing Britney looks NOTHING like Britney. Like… come on. We all know what Britney looks like. You cannot fool us, Lifetime. Also, the entire script appeared to have been written in about 20 minutes. At least two minutes of the movie are dedicated to “Britney” dancing around her room in her underwear, waiting for Justin to call. I wanted to watch it twice in a row but my girlfriend said no because she thought the entire movie was unfair to Britney, and would probably make Britney sad. And you know what, she’s right. It was pretty hilarious, though. 2. Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B \nLike the Britney biopic, Lifetime couldn’t afford or get permission to use Aaliyah’s music. A biopic about a musician without any of their music is like baking a cake with no sugar. And the depictions of Missy Elliott and Timbaland are completely unrecognizable through either their looks or personality. Lifetime, let's talk. These people are famous. You’re supposed to be able to tell who they are. At least the lead actress looks somewhat like Aaliyah, so that’s something. 3. The Brittany Murphy Story \nMade on a budget of $15 and (back at it again, Lifetime!) starring someone who looks absolutely nothing like Brittany Murphy, Lifetime filmed The Brittany Murphy Story in 16 days (if you don’t know anything about movies, that is extremely fast). The script hardly seems to be about Murphy herself – her interesting personality is completely missing from the film. 4. Anna Nicole \nApparently the only thing the filmmakers knew about Anna Nicole as a person is that she had big boobs. This may come as a surprise, but Anna Nicole actually had a personality! And that personality is nowhere to be seen in this trash film. There is, however, a weird conspiracy theory and a creepy recurring theme of younger Anna seeing visions of the adult version of herself — it’s weird. 5. Liz & Dick \nWhat a surprise, the movie where Lindsay Lohan played Elizabeth Taylor ended up being terrible! This movie is not about Elizabeth Taylor, but about Lindsay Lohan ACTING. It's very bad, but it's also very worth watching. 6. Ring of Fire \nDid you watch the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line and wish you could see it again, but from June’s perspective and with a much a lower budget? No? But Jewel's in it! And let me just say, her accent is delicious . But most of the movie is just Johnny being drunk and June getting mad. 7. The Unauthorized Saved by the Bell Story \nThis biopic about the Saved by the Bell cast was authorized only by Dustin Diamond, who played Screech – so Screech becomes the only sympathetic character. Apparently, Diamond waited two decades to throw his cast mates under the bus. He says they all made him feel left out because they were older than he was, which I guess is just a dig at them for being old now? And we’re supposed to believe that Screech punched someone? Haha. I don’t buy it. 8. Whitney \nThis is one of the only Lifetime films that actually managed to cast someone who looks like the actual person, so points there. But Whitney takes a beloved celebrity lost too soon and turns her life into a trashy tabloid. Not very respectful. That said, if respect for the deceased celebrity is not high on your list or priorities, this biopic may be for you! \nHave you seen any of these biopics? Did I miss any good ones?
