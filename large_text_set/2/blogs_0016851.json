House of Lords 'will not bow to threats' on Brexit, peers say \n“We may ask our partners for things that they may feel unable to give and they may ask of us things that we are unwilling to give – like continuing large subventions to the EU budget,” he told the House of Lords. \n“Is the outcome of last June’s referendum to be interpreted as meaning that a majority of the United Kingdom want to leave the EU whatever the terms? The Government clearly thinks so. On a matter of this importance has not the Government a duty to be sure before our departure becomes final? \n“My Lords, one has to ask why those who base their arguments for Brexit on the will of the people are now opposed to consulting the people on the outcome of the negotiations. One has to suspect that they fear they will get a different answer. But if so, we ought to know.” Read more EU migrant parents of British children demand clarity on right to stay \nHe made the comments on the second day of the House of Lords debate about the Government’s bill to trigger Article 50. \nYesterday other former senior mandarins in the upper house weighed in on Brexit. Lord Macpherson, former Treasury permanent secretary, and Gus O’Donnell, former head of the civil service suggested they could vote for dissenting amendments to the Article 50 Bill. \nLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Lord Paddick agreed with Lord Butler, arguing that \"the British people did not know the full consequences of leaving the EU at the time of the referendum and they did not therefore make an informed choice”. \nThe Lib Dem added: “They are entitled to a vote on the final deal.\" What experts have said about Brexit What experts have said about Brexit 1/11 Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond \nThe Chancellor claims London can still be a world financial hub despite Brexit “One of Britain’s great strengths is the ability to offer and aggregate all of the services the global financial services industry needs” “This has not changed as a result of the EU referendum and I will do everything I can to ensure the City of London retains its position as the world’s leading international financial centre.” Reuters 2/11 Yanis Varoufakis \nGreece's former finance minister compared the UK relations with the EU bloc with a well-known song by the Eagles: “You can check out any time you like, as the Hotel California song says, but you can't really leave.

The adverse winds could quickly pick up – and merit a stronger policy response. But recently they have shifted to a more favourable direction” Getty \nSome peers rejected the idea of a second referendum, however. Baroness Neville-Jones, a Conservative peers, said: “Frankly I think we can rely on the normal electoral processes of this country kicking in to deliver a verdict on what happens next. I think our system will certainly cope with whatever outcome the negotiations delivers.” \nThe Government has said that it will give Parliament a vote on the final deal. Some MPs have however said that the vote is not “meaningful” because the rejection of any deal will simply leave the UK to crash out of the bloc under WTO rules under the Article 50 timetable.
