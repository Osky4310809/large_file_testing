How stupid is that kid for throwing his Trump jersey on stage by the way? Be smarter than that man. What did he think was gonna happen? Did he think Waka Flocka was gonna frame the jersey and put it in his house? Nope. He’s gonna take that jersey and wipe his entire asshole with it. That’s what’s gonna happen. Here’s a little to any Trump supporters out there: if someone asks you for your Trump apparel, they’re going to wipe their ass with it. At the very least that’s what they’re gonna do. Never not once has someone asked for a piece of Trump apparel because they thought out was fashionable and wanted to wear it themselves. That will never be their intention. Their intentions are to smear their poop all over it or light it on fire or probably both. By the way, pretty shoddy wipe from Waka. Not the caliber of wipe you wanna see from a 30-year-old man. I hope his form is better when it’s the real deal. Trent |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:05:29.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
