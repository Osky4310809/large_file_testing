It was also expected that the amount of foreign aid issued through the department every year would be significantly reduced. \nAs for the EPA, it has long been understood that Trump intended to cut that agency down in size, particularly when it comes to the many complex regulations that do little to actually protect the environment and serve only to stifle economic growth and job creation. The EPA budget is expected to be slashed “big league.” \nCBS News noted that while details remained scarce, it was thought that Trump would seek to increase defense spending by as much as $54 billion, an amount to be offset by cuts to other non-defense and domestic programs.   \nAn unnamed official at the Office of Management and Budget told reporters that “most” agencies would see cuts in their budgets, though it was made clear that any non-defense domestic programs that were related to national security would be left untouched. \nOf course most liberals are howling, and congressional Democrats, along with some establishment Republicans, will likely fight Trump tooth and nail throughout the budget process to protect their favored programs. \nWe, however, fully support the idea of taking an ax to all of the wasteful federal spending programs that aren’t specifically enumerated in the Constitution and don’t contribute directly to keeping the nation safe and secure. \nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter so everyone knows that the EPA and State Department stand to face significant budget cuts in order to offset increased defense spending.
