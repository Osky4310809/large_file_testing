DeVos reportedly objected to the order issued Wednesday, drafted at the direction of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and revoking protections for transgender students. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer flat out rejected that reporting, saying DeVos “ 100 percent ” supported rescinding the protections. Understandably, the claim that DeVos staked out a pro-transgender stance has drawn a skeptical side-eye from LGBTQ activists and commentators alike. When DeVos tweeted part of her statement expressing support for “#LGBTQ students,” one tweeter replied , \"You rolled over like a puppy.\" \nWhatever really happened behind closed doors, there's a couple things worth keeping in mind about this event: \n1) Champion or no champion, hate prevailed in Donald Trump's administration and always will, because Trump will always side with his bigoted Attorney General Jeff Sessions; \n2) Despite the new Justice Department guidelines, the Title IX law remains intact, and a growing body of case law says those protections cover transgender kids. \nThe order DeVos signed off on runs in direct contradiction to her stated goal of protecting LGBTQ students and it used a \" states' rights \" justification for doing so. Jeff Sessions may have taken to Trump’s M.O. of living in the world as he would like it to be, but states' rights have never ultimately prevailed as a legitimate reason for denying Constitutional protections to any group of individuals. As former Obama DOJ official Vanita Gupta told NPR: \n\"The law prohibiting sex discrimination in education, just like the law that prohibits race discrimination in education, isn't left to the states in our Constitution. Equal Protection is federally guaranteed in this country, in every state in every school.\" \nNothing about the new guidelines reinforce the rights of transgender kids to attend school free from discrimination. \nIf, as stated , Betsy DeVos feels a moral and legal obligation to \" protect every student in America\" and \"ensure that they have the freedom to learn and thrive \" in schools, she can start by using the word: Transgender.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:37:31.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
