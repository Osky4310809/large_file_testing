Nordstrom did not indicate that the decision to drop the brand was permanent. A spokesperson said that retail giant makes buying decisions “season by season” and that sales of the Ivanka merchandise were low enough that they felt it was not a brand they could justify carrying during the coming season, according to The Seattle Times. \n“We’ve got thousands of brands,” the spokesperson said. “Each year we cut about 10 percent and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand’s performance we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.” \nThe Times also noted that Ivanka Trump is no longer listed on Nordstrom’s website, but a few items are still listed on Nordstrom’s value-focused Rack site. The Racked fashion website reported Thursday that Ivanka products were disappearing from Nordstrom’s e-commerce selection because of falling sales. \nNordstrom got the attention of the “Grab Your Wallet” campaign as one of the first retail outlets to partner with Ivanka on her shoe line when it debuted in 2011. Once the call for Trump boycotts started, Co-President Pete Nordstrom addressed the controversy, saying, “This is a sharply divisive subject. No matter what we do, we are going to end up disappointing some of our customers. Every single brand we offer is evaluated on their results — if people don’t buy it, we won’t sell it.” \nIvanka’s fashion business has also been criticized for mixing business promotion with politics. The company sent a “style alert” to journalists in November that promoted a bracelet Ivanka wore when she was interviewed on CBS’“60 Minutes,” the Times reported. \n“GrabYourWallet” — essentially a spreadsheet of businesses the campaign boycotts — launched in October 2016 after the release of what they call the “Trump Tapes,” in which Trump made inappropriate remarks to reporter Billy Bush about grabbing women by the genitals. “A brand strategist and a grandmother simultaneously realized they could no longer in good conscience shop at retailers that do business with the Trump family,” the “Grab Your Wallet” website states, explaining how the effort started with two women who connected on Twitter to start the campaign. \nThe campaign’s website also notes Nordstrom’s decision to drop the first daughter’s merchandise and says “Once the small handful of remaining items are no longer for sale, we’ll be removing Nordstrom from the #GrabYourWallet list.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:57:05.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
