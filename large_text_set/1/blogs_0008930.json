He has a contract and we want him to stay.\" \nBarca leave La Liga in Madrid's hands \nThe midfielder has been a staple in the Barcelona line-up since moving to Camp Nou from Sevilla in 2014, scoring the first goal in the 2015 Champions League final. \nRakitic, however, has seen his role diminish this season as a result of the arrival of Denis Suarez and Andre Gomes to play alongside Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta in the Barca engine room.
