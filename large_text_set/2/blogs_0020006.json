They eventually recruited guitarist-backup singer Pete Mindnich, drummer Shohsei Oda and bassist Peter Leonard. (Lynott and Boaté live in Baltimore, while Mindnich and Oda live in Washington. Leonard is in Chevy Chase, and the group practices in the Catonsville basement of Lynott’s parents’ house.) \nIn November 2015, the band released their debut five-track EP, which Boaté describes as “a culmination of our first two years as a band.” Recorded at Dreamcatcher Studio in Baltimore with producer Donny Ingram, songs like “Intimacy” and “Glory” sound festival-ready — propulsive, danceable and catchy enough to find an audience that grew up listening to a little bit of everything. \n“Intimacy,” Lynott’s favorite song, offers a clue to Sunbathers’ path forward: a seamless mixture of memorable guitar riffs, subtle synthesizers, a nimble rhythm section and the singer’s simpatico vocals. \n“People seemed to really latch on to that one,” said Boaté, who lives in Canton. “We really like that sound, so we might as well keep going. It’s working.” \nThematically, Sunbathers’ songs “can be boiled down to love songs,” but Lynott said he tries to inject nuance with moments of desperation and the other complicated feelings that come with relationships. The former English major often finds inspiration in poetry and novels, citing Saeed Jones’ “Prelude to Bruise” and Nayyirah Waheed’s “Salt” as recent favorites. \n“I find a lot from poets — just the way they break phrases apart and the way certain words carry different meanings in different contexts,” the Mount Vernon resident said.

(Sunbathers have mostly stuck to Baltimore, D.C., and Philadelphia so far.) \nThe Metro Gallery show will be their last in the area for a few months. They plan to take the time to finish writing and recording new material, which will either end up on a second EP or a full-length album. \nThe band has achieved a fair amount in just over three years, and Lynott says the plan to “see how far we can take it.” \n“We’ve been fortunate enough to have very positive experiences as a band,” Lynott said. “I don’t see any reason to stop.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:55:46.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
