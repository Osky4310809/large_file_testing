Trump prior to being offered the role Wednesday 22 March 2017 08:47 GMT Click to followThe Independent US ExxonMobil covered-up climate change information in the 1980s Getty \nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has claimed he didn’t want his new job, and that he only took it after some persuading from his wife. \nMr Tillerson, a former oil executive with no previous diplomatic experience, said his wife convinced him by saying God wanted him to be Secretary of State. \nHe admitted his surprise at being offered the job by President Donald Trump, who he had never met. \nSecretary of State is one of the most senior roles in the US government, and the task involves overseeing foreign relations and diplomacy. Rex Tillerson says 'these things happen' when asked about Russian civilians dying \nIn a rare interview with the conservative Independent Journal Review – the only outlet allowed to go with Mr Tillerson on his recent tour of Asia – the notoriously media shy Secretary made the frank admission. \n“I didn’t want this job,” he told the Review . “I didn’t seek this job.” \nMr Tillerson, who turns 65 this week, was planning on retiring and “going to the ranch” with his grandchildren.

After his victory, Mr Trump called him to New York to talk “about the world”, drawing on the oil man’s experience as head of Exxon Mobil. \n“When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be Secretary of State, I was stunned,” Mr Tillerson said. \nYesterday, it was reported Mr Tillerson planned on missing a meeting with Nato ministers in April in favour of meeting Chinese President Xi Jingping, alongside Mr Trump, at the Mar-a-Lago estate. He will visit Russia soon after. \nThe announcement was met with concern in the alliance, amid doubts over US commitment since Mr Trump was elected.
