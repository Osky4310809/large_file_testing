His Bajrangi Bhaijaan co-star Nawazuddin Siddiqui took to Facebook to point out how the Indian award functions are too shameful to pay homage to the late actor. Om Puri \nThe 5,710 shares of his Facebook post indicates the fact that the issue he has raised resonates with thousands of people across the globe. While the passing tribute by the Academy is noteworthy, Puri's role in Hollywood was largely reduced to stereotypical cameos and shoddily written characters in films like Mike Nichols' 1994 romantic thriller Wolf , Stephen Hopkins' 1996 historical adventure The Ghost and the Darkness and Nichols' 2007 comedy Charlie Wilson's War . \nIt is only in the Indian film industry that Puri got his rightful due. While he is certainly a part of the RIP montage that Indian award shows present every year, he certainly deserves more. This is probably what Siddiqui is seeking through his public outrage towards the Indian award functions that, as popularly perceived, have been reduced to mindless patrons of sponsors. \nPuri's good friend, National School of Drama (NSD) classmate and fellow veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah got himself into trouble when he referred to Rajesh Khanna as a 'limited actor'. Later, in his defense, he clarified that the industry did not have respect for Khanna in his final days so it was rather inappropriate to see them get offended after his death. \nThis thought can also be applied on Siddiqui's stance on Puri not getting his due in the Indian award functions. The seasoned actor was widely acknowledged and appreciated in India. He continued to do strong meaningful roles till his last breath, as seen last in The Ghazi Attack . To sideline him to racially painted cameos throughout his life and then give a short stride to his departed soul at their award function is rather a disservice to his legacy. \nRead the full text of Nawaz's Facebook post here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:15:24.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
