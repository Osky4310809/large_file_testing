It’s claimed that the first shipment figure is up almost 40 percent compared to the Galaxy S7. If this is true, it shows that Samsung is going to make a big push with the Galaxy S8 which happens to be its first flagship smartphone following the Galaxy Note 7 debacle last year. \nPrevious reports have suggested that Samsung has set a sales target of 60 million units for the Galaxy S8 which is considerably higher than the 48 million and 45 million units that it sold of the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S6 respectively. The conglomerate’s display affiliate Samsung Display is reportedly going to supply 10 million OLED panels for the Galaxy S8 and 6 million panels for the Galaxy S8 Plus initially. \nSamsung is expected to launch two models of its next flagship – the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus – both are said to feature a dual-edge curved display and similar specifications. Samsung has only confirmed that the new handset won’t be unveiled at Mobile World Congress 2017 later this month. Rumor has it that the company will conduct an event on March 29 to formally unveil the Galaxy S8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:48:30.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
