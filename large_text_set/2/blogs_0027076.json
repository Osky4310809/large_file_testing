Jamie Vardy and Leicester celebrated their first Premier League win of 2017 on Monday. Michael Regan/Getty Images \nLeicester were celebrating again six minutes before the break -- Drinkwater's sweetly hit, knuckling volley from outside of the box leaving Mignolet no chance before bursting into the net. \nAnd Vardy collected his second goal 15 minutes after half-time, sending a powerful header of a pinpoint Christian Fuchs cross out of the Belgium keeper's reach to give the home side an unassailable advantage on the night. \nPhilippe Coutinho pulled a goal back soon after, finishing off an intricate passing move with a dragged near-post finish past Kasper Schmeichel in the 68th minute. \nHowever, it was to be Leicester's night as the defending league champions went two points clear of the relegation zone with the surprising result.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:23:53.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
