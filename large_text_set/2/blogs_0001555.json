The iPhone accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s sales and Apple said sales of the new model helped lift total iPhone shipments 5% to a record 78.3m for the three months ending 31 December. \nBut the iPhone 7 still failed to attract the long lines and double-digit increase in sales that earlier models enjoyed in their first full quarter on the market. \nSales helped boost Apple’s revenue 3% to $78.4bn, ahead of analysts’ forecasts. Profit for the quarter fell 2.6% to $17.9bn, or $3.38 a share. Apple ended the quarter with $246.1bn in cash. The company’s share price jumped close to 3% in after hours trading. \nThe latest report comes after a bad year for Apple. Last October the company reported its first decline in annual sales and profit in 15 years as iPhone sales dipped 5%.

We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch,” said Cook. \nApple’s booming services business, including Apple Pay, Apple Music and the App Store, accounted for $7.2bn in revenues, an 18% increase from a year ago. But the iPhone’s struggles are not over. Sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, once seen as Apple’s strongest growth area, slipped 12% to $16.2bn in the quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:47:55.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
