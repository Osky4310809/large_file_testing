But for marketers, it’s probably more helpful to leave them out – we know that Christmas was huge and that we need to focus on that, but what else was driving conversation amongst our target audiences? \nHere’s the Facebook chart with Christmas and New Year references removed. \nAs you can see, the death of Carrie Fisher was a big focus on Facebook, with both Fisher and ‘Princess Leia’ getting a lot of mentions. \nOther celebrity deaths were also in focus, while the release of the new Star Wars film ‘Rogue One’ gained a lot of attention among male users. \nYounger male users also discussed Ronda Rousey’s UFC defeat, while ‘slow cookers’ and ‘icing’ were of particular focus among older female users – likely tied into Christmas trends. \nOver on Instagram, the focus was very similar. \nThis has actually become more of a trend – when Facebook first started publishing Hot Topics for both Facebook and Instagram (back in February 2016 ), there were very distinct differences between what was popular on each platform. But in recent months, that divide has lessened. This likely underlines how Instagram is evolving into a more expansive social network where people conduct more of their interactions, growing from its image-focused roots. \nThere are still differences, of course – video games, for example, always feature more prominently in Instagram discussion, as do celebrities and entertainment stories (Mariah Carey, Soulja Boy), but the content focus is definitely less pronounced than it once was. Which is an interesting consideration in itself. \nAs always, Facebook has also produced regional Hot Topics reports for:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:45:19.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
