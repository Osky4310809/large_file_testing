MAN UTD INJURIES \nWayne Rooney is the only expected high-profile absentee for the visit to London having missed both games in the festive period so far with a thigh injury. \nIt's extremely unlikely he'll be risked by Mourinho, who welcomed Eric Bailly back to his starting XI in the win over Boro. \nMichael Carrick missed their last match through illness but could return to United's midfield if it's not too serious. MAN UTD SUSPENSIONS \nThere is an amnesty on yellow cards from January 1, meaning all players with four bookings   this season will have their slate 'wiped clean' for a one-match ban when they reach five. \nUnited have no suspension concerns and nor do West Ham. MAN UTD   \nUnited's successful centre-back pairing of Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones - who forged a successful partnership in defence in December - were both rested for Boro's visit to Manchester and Mourinho could choose to bring them back for a more testing trip to London. It's impossible to rule out the possibility of Chris Smalling or Eric Bailly retaining their places in the XI, however, having both been first choice at the start of the season before injuries sidelined them. \nIn midfield, Carrick could return if he recovers from the illness that ruled him out of the Middlesbrough match. If he remains out, Marouane Fellaini could get a second consecutive start alongside Ander Herrera and Paul Pogba. \nFabregas sets PL record \nConsidering the fitness problems he's had this season, Henrikh Mkhitaryan could be rested for the second game in three days by Mourinho. Options to replace him include Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata, both of whom were dropped for Saturday's win. \nThree games in eight games would be tough for most 35-year-olds, but Mourinho seems adamant on playing star striker Ibrahimovic at every opportunity. If he chooses to rest him, Marcus Rashford would no doubt jump at the opportunity having fallen off the radar somewhat lately. Martial was fantastic against Boro and it would be a surprise to see him dropped against West Ham. WEST HAM DOSSIER \nWest Ham had won three consecutive games heading into their 1-0 defeat to Leicester this weekend, but they had been against teams their fans would've expected them to defeat: Burnley, Hull and Swansea. \nPrior to December's win streak, Bilic's men had been starved of points and a relegation fight was looking a surprise possibility. As of the start of 2017, they're placed less precariously in 13th and are only five points off seventh-placed Everton. \nUnbeatable Liverpool will only get better \nUnited - sixth but 14 points clear of West Ham - have played them twice already this season at Old Trafford, winning the cup tie and drawing the league game. Dimitri Payet is unquestionably their dangerman in midfield, with their forwards widely considered to be their weak point in 2016-17.   \nWest Ham are unbeaten in their last four Premier League meetings with Manchester United (W1 D3) – they’ve never gone five games unbeaten them in their English league history. \nDimitri Payet has created a league-high 72 chances   this season – that’s 52 more than any other West Ham player (Lanzini – 20). \nPaul Pogba has been directly involved in four goals in his last four Premier League appearances (two goals, two assists). \nWest Ham have won consecutive   at the London Stadium for the first time. They last won three home matches in a row in March 2016. \nAnthony Martial has scored five goals in his last four appearances against West Ham in all competitions.   \nThe game gets under way at 17:15 UK time on Monday and will be televised in the UK on Sky Sports 1.
