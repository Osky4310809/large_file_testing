I’ve reached out to the DOJ for confirmation and more details. \nCiting someone briefed on the indictments, Bloomberg reports that one of the alleged hackers is currently in Canada, and may face instant arrest. The other three are apparently in Russia, which does complicate things. \nYahoo recently revealed in testimony to a Senate committee that it was in cooperation with state, federal, and foreign governments regarding the breaches, which seems only logical considering the volume of data compromised. Apparently the efforts have borne fruit. \n(Disclosure: Verizon, which owns Aol, which owns TechCrunch, is in the process of buying Yahoo.)
