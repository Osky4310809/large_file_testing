LaFell's agents Schwartz & Feinsod announced LaFell agreed to a deal with the Bengals. Paul Dehner Jr. of the Cincinnati Enquirer noted the Bengals really grew to appreciate what LaFell brought to the organization last season: Paul Dehner Jr. @pauldehnerjr Can't tell you how many times coaches raved about what LaFell brought to the room. And he was still productive, improved as year went on. 3/8/2017, 9:32:29 PM The 30-year-old veteran spent 2016 with the Bengals on a one-year deal. With A.J. Green missing six games due to injury, he emerged as quarterback Andy Dalton 's top target down the stretch. LaFell finished the season with 64 receptions for 862 yards and six touchdowns after failing to find the end zone as a member of the New England Patriots in 2015. The former LSU standout was a third-round pick of the Carolina Panthers in 2010, but his breakout season didn't come until he joined the Pats in 2014. As quarterback Tom Brady's best outside receiving threat, LaFell set career highs with 74 grabs for 953 yards and seven touchdowns in helping the Patriots win the Super Bowl. A down year in 2015 hurt his value, but LaFell managed to repair it in 2016 by making significant improvements, according to John Gatta of Pro Football Focus: John Gatta @PFF_JohnGatta Most improved WRs by @PFF Grade (2015-16) 1. Taylor Gabriel 2. Brandon LaFell 3. Dontrelle Inman 4. Quincy Enunwa 5. Davante Adams 2/18/2017, 5:03:16 PM He appeared to be a great fit in Cincinnati's offense, which led to LaFell expressing his desire to return in 2017. Per Jim Owczarski of the Cincinnati Enquirer , LaFell believed he could truly come into his own in a second season with the Bengals: \"I'd definitely like to be back but it's out of my hands, man. Whatever happens, happens. But hopefully I'll be able to come back because I feel like in the second year within the offense with Andy [Dalton], I think I'll be even better.\" Cincinnati figured to have some competition for LaFell's services, though, after the second-best season of his career. Andy Benoit of Sports Illustrated labeled LaFell as a potential free-agent gem in a strong year for wide receivers: Andy Benoit @Andy_Benoit 2/27/2017, 9:53:00 PM Although LaFell may not rival Alshon Jeffery, DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon in terms of name recognition or body of work, he has proven to be a productive player in the right situation. LaFell isn't a true No. 1 receiver, but he can be a quality complement, which is all he'll need to be for the Bengals provided Green remains healthy next season. If LaFell manages to turn in a performance similar to what he did in 2016, then he, Green and the emerging Tyler Boyd have a chance to form one of the best receiving corps in the entire NFL .
