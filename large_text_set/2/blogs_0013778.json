It only served as a reminder of what I already knew: white institutions are never expected to acknowledge Black excellence, and that moments meant to spotlight Black genius are too often usurped to praise whiteness.\nWhile watching the Grammys last night, I received the same reminder. After losing out on previous Album of the Year nominations for I Am Sasha Fierce and Beyoncé , I was certain that even with its r acist history of ignoring Black artists , the Grammys couldn’t deny Beyoncé her just due for Lemonade . But after delivering a breathtaking performance , which paid homage to the Yoruba deity Oshun , Beyoncé lost out to Adele’s 25 for Album of the Year.\nRelated Articles: Adele Breaks her Grammy For Album Of The Year In Half Solange Rubs On Big Sis Beyoncé’s Baby Bump Backstage At The Grammy’s In A Tender Moment From Lauryn Hill To Chance The Rapper- It’s Been 18 Years Since A Black Hip-Hop Artist Won A “Best New Artist” Grammy This article originally appeared in Essence by LaSha ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:43:22.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
