Thousands of industry professionals gathered at the Anaheim Convention Center, ranging from vendors making their debut to industry veterans like Follow Your Heart displaying their newest products and journalists looking to scope out the next big thing. Just like last year at Expo East, it seems like one of the largest overarching trends at Expo West was plant-based food. \nJust less than ten years ago, the vegan food world left much to be desired, with disappointing veggie burgers and bland, flavorless tofu acting as the major representative of a greater movement. Luckily, plant-based food is now bigger than ever and companies are coming up with new, innovative products that will make even meat-eaters drool. While there are far too many new products to highlight in just one article, here are ten new products that we are most excited to try. 1. Field Roast Chili Mac ‘n Chao \nReady-made, dairy-free mac and cheese is exactly what was missing from our life — and if you’ve ever tried Field Roast’s Chao Slices, you’ll understand exactly why we’re so excited for this to launch. Field Roast’s new Chili Mac ‘n Chao is made using their tomato cayenne Chao Slices, so we can expect spicy, creamy, savory goodness in ever bite. 2. Good Karma Foods Dairy-Free Yogurt Good Karma Foods \nGood Karma’s line of dairy-free milks made from flax seeds are a blessing for anyone with a nut or soy allergy. Now, they’re expanding that line into the realm of dairy-free yogurt. Made from flax milk, this soy-free, nut-free, and non-GMO yogurt stands out from the rest with a good dose of Omega-3s in every serving. Good Karma’s line of Dairy-Free Yogurt took home an award for Best New Special Diet Food at Expo West, the largest natural food products expo, called the NEXTY Award . 3. Tofurky DIY Burgers and Sausages Good Food Institute \nMost of us have fond memories of homemade burger night, when one of our parents would pick up a package of that squiggly red ground meat. Well, thanks to Tofurky’s new DIY Pasture-Raised Plants line of ground plant-based meat, you can relive that experience. Like ground meat, home cooks can now mix in their own herbs and spices to make veggie burgers, meatballs, and sausages. Oh, yeah. 4. Lightlife Veggie Sausage Ravioli VegNews /Facebook \nLove ravioli, but not quite into the idea of making it completely from scratch? Well, then Lightlife’s new Veggie Sausage Ravioli is exactly the product you’ve been asking for. Each ravioli is stuffed with dairy-free mozzarella, veggie sausage, kale, and roasted red pepper — plus it has 19 grams of protein per serving. Sounds like the perfect post-workout meal to us. 5. Follow Your Heart Pancake and Waffle Batter plantbasedcompanion /Instagram \nHaven’t quite honed the skill of making the perfect vegan pancake (or waffle)? Now you won’t have to. Follow Your Heart’s Rocket Cakes is a ready-made pancake batter that is gluten-free, soy-free, and nut-free, making it awesome for people with allergies, too. 6. Farmhouse Culture Kraut Krisps Farmhouse Culture Farmhouse culture is probably best known for their organic kraut and probiotic Gut Shots, but who doesn’t also want the option to get their probiotics by eating chips? Four out of the five flavors in their new Kraut Krisps line are 100 percent plant-based and all of them are gluten-free. These guys also took home the 2017 NEXTY Award for Best New Snack at Expo West, the largest natural, organic, and healthy products event in the world, so they’ve gotta be good. 7. Hail Merry 2-Count Coconut Cups Hail Merry A healthy snack that tastes like dessert? Yes, please. Hail Merry is famous for its egg-free macaroons and decadent tarts, but now you can take those tarts on-the-go with their line of 2-Count Coconut Cups , which, by the way, also won an award for best new snack. We’re pretty pumped about having more options for healthy vegan treats. 8. Tofurky Vegetarian Ham Roast Tofurky The 2017 holiday season will be better than ever before with Tofurky’s new Vegetarian Ham Roast With Extra Special Beer Glaze . That’s right, beer-glazed vegan ham — get ready for your dinner to be the envy of all your relatives. 9. Miyoko’s Creamery Smoked VeganMozz \nMiyoko’s Kitchen /Twitter Once an online exclusive, but no longer! Miyoko’s Kitchen Smoked VeganMozz will be hitting stores nationwide this year. Made from coconut oil, cashews, and tapioca starch, this dairy-free mozz melts and stretches just like the real thing. We’re ready to eat all the smoky, melty, dairy-free paninis, and quesadillas that will happen as a result of this. 10. VANA Life Foods Green Chickpea Superfood Bowls \nVANA Life Foods Ready-made foods don’t always have a reputation for being the healthiest, but these Green Chickpea Superfood Bowls by VANA Life Foods are about to change that. The winner of the 2017 NEXTY Award for Best New Packaged Food, each meal contains 11 grams of protein, 11 grams of fiber, and comes in a BPA-free pouch — and you don’t have to refrigerate it, so we can see this being a popular option for travelers, too. 11. Sweet Earth Harmless Ham Sweet Earth How many of us remember ham and cheese sandwiches at lunchtime? Now, you can recreate this lunchbox staple without meat or dairy, thanks to Sweet Earth’s Harmless Ham. These meat-free deli slices made from tofu and wheat protein were originally made famous in their Harmless Ham and Chickpea Breakfast Sandwich . Now that they’ll be available as individual slices, we know that we’ll be taking a bite of a grilled “ham and cheese” sandwich in the near future. \nSo, there you have it! The future of food is looking bright thanks to products like these. Not only are we seeing a huge variety of brand-new meat and dairy alternatives, we’re also seeing a bunch of drool-worthy, nutrient-dense health foods that just happen to contain no meat, eggs, or dairy. We know that we’ll be keeping an eye out for all of these guys in the grocery store. Which product are you looking forward to most? \nLead image source: plantbasedcompanion /Instagram Want to read more posts like this?
