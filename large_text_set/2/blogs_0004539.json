That tells you everything you need to know about Bernie. Bernie has no credibility on the subject of Wall Street. Sorry. \nNot only that, but the guy’s #1 gripe is income inequality and yet he has three houses despite never holding down a solid job in the private sector . \nBernie doesn’t have to like Trump but he has absolutely no leg to stand on when he calls him a fraud. \nBernie might be the most disingenuous politician we have ever seen which makes it pretty hilarious that his supporters have created this image of him as a stand-up guy who shoots straight. \nHe’s a total joke and the fact his supporters don’t see that speaks volumes. \nAll the information is out there. All they have to do is Google it. But, they choose not to. \nSad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:07:41.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
