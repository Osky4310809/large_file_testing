So sad.\nRelated: This Instagram Couple Have A Savage Breakup \nThe actress revealed to People on Wednesday: \n\"It hurts. After we got married I wanted to wake up and see him make breakfast for me. I loved him so much.\"\nAwww!\nLauren's mother Robin Sinkhorn explained that Spear could not handle all the publicity that came with dating a Hollywood star, saying:\n\"He did not like the publicity. It was overwhelming.\"\nHowever, Lauren is not crying in her room over the breakup. Instead, the 26-year-old has been hitting the gym to get ready for bikini season, going out on dates, and trying to get a job at Starbucks if Hollywood doesn't come calling again.\nSounds like exactly the way to handle life after a breakup. You go, Lauren!\n[ Image via WENN . ] \nTags: breakups , glee , lauren potter , love line , timothy spear", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:24:59.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
