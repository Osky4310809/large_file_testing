We came here with good intentions, but it has become a nightmare,” 33-year-old Bayern Munich winger Robben said. \n“We win together and we lose together. Now we’ll get s*** all over us. It’s sad. I’m speechless. The first half was shocking.” \nCoach Danny Blind conceded before kickoff he was taking a risk playing De Ligt who, at 17, became the youngest Netherlands debutant since Mauk Weber in 1931. media_camera Netherlands' Matthijs de Ligt (R). \nBut Blind said injuries to other centre backs forced him to select a player with only a handful of appearances for Ajax. \nDe Ligt’s first action did not bode well, as he gave away a free kick just outside the penalty area inside the first minute with a rash challenge on Ivelin Popov. \nBut worse was to come four minutes later as De Ligt let a speculative high ball fall over his shoulder and collided with goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet, allowing Spas Delev to tap in for the opening goal in just the fifth minute, his first international strike. \nOnce it had the early lead, Bulgaria could have sat back and looked to hit the Netherlands on the counterattack, but the Dutch passing was so disjointed that the hosts were able to continue pushing forward. \nDelev made it 2-0 in the 20th when he curled a shot past De Ligt’s attempted block and into the bottom corner of Zoet’s goal. media_camera Bulgaria's forward Spas Delev celebrates after scoring a goal. \nThe Netherlands, which failed to qualify for the European Championship in France last year, now looks likely to struggle to reach the World Cup in Russia, which comes four years after the Dutch team coached by Louis van Gaal reached the semifinal in Brazil. \nOnly the group winner secures an automatic World Cup spot. \nBlind ended De Ligt’s match at halftime, replacing him with another debutant, Wesley Hoedt of Lazio. \nHe also sent on veteran Wesley Sneijder in an attempt to spark more creativity in midfield. \nAfter having virtually nothing to do in the first half, Bulgaria goalkeeper Nikolay Mihaylov became busy in the second, making a good save to turn away a deflected shot by Quincy Promes in the 58th and denying Davy Klaassen four minutes later as Bulgaria sat back to defend its lead and the Dutch finally exerted some pressure. \nBut despite sending on another forward, Luuk de Jong, the Netherlands barely managed another attempt on goal. media_camera", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:58:39.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
