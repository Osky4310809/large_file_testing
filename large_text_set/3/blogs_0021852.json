expected of the German World Cup winner when he moved to Old Trafford in 2015, but the midfielder was unable to deliver and has now completed a free transfer to MLS club Chicago Fire. \nDespite featuring 31 times under Louis van Gaal, Schweinsteiger only played on four occasions for Jose Mourinho’s side after the Portuguese manager decided the 32-year-old wouldn’t fit into his plans. \nMourinho believed Schweinsteiger was no longer the player he once was in 14 years at Bayern Munich, which is what Pep Guardiola alluded to when he left the Bavarian giant. \n“He is a top, top player. Unfortunately, during the last three years he was never in good condition,” then Bayern manager Guardiola said when Schweinsteiger left. \nSoon after arriving at the Red Devils, Van Gaal was also questioning his ability. \n“During December I said that I expect more and he was very disappointed I said that, but I think I can say that because my expectation is higher,” said Van Gaal towards the end of his time at United. Bastian Schweinsteiger. Source: AFP \n“Manchester United has bought him even though he is now 31, so I had to convince the board to buy him, because he’s a very good player and he always gives a team more balance.” \nVan Gaal was eventually sacked after spending over £250 million ($400m) on 12 players in his two years, and Mourinho is still trying to reverse his actions. \n‘WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY’ and UNITED PAYING FOR TRANSFER BLUNDERS \n- Schweinsteger, bought for £14.5m - sold to MLS for nothing \n- Memphis Depay, bought for £24.6m - sold to Lyon for £16m \n- Morgan Schneiderlin, bought for £24m - sold to Southampton for £24m \n- Di Maria, bought for £59.7m - sold to PSG for £44m \n- Herrera, bought for £29m \n- Anthony Martial, bought for £36m \n- Daley Blind, bought for £14m \n- Marcos Rojo, bought for £16m \n- Matteo Darmian, undisclosed \n- Radamel Falcao, came on loan \n- Victor Valdes, free transfer and then released \n- Javier Hernandez - sold to Bayern Leverkusen for £7.3m \n- Danny Welbeck - sold to Arsenal for £16m \nHe’s finally shipped Schweinsteiger off to the MLS, in what German football expert Raphael Honigstein described as a “personal decision against Louis van Gaal.” \nHonigstein told BBC: “Mourinho saw him as one of the symbols of the Van Gaal era and he very clearly wanted to change things and signal that this is going to be a new Manchester United squad.” \"Mourinho saw Schweinsteiger as a symbol of the Louis van Gaal era\"Did the German have more to offer at #MUFC ? pic.twitter.com/IImNymcm2b — BBC 5 live Sport (@5liveSport) March 21, 2017 \nSchweinsteiger, who was bought for £14.5 million, cost United £800,000 ($1.3m) every game and left for nothing, is the fourth Van Gaal signing Mourinho’s offloaded. \nMemphis Depay has moved to Lyon (£8.6 million loss), Morgan Schneiderlin to Everton (fees broke even), and Victor Valdes was released. \nHowever, the likes of Luke Shaw, Matteo Darmian, Daley Blind and Sergio Romero have also fallen out of favour under the Portuguese. \nVan Gaal also sold players that Mourinho said he “never” would have.

Never. No chance.” \nDi Maria joined the Red Devils for a British record £59.7 million, but left for PSG a year later for about £44 million, Chicarito arrived at United for about the £7.3 million that Bayer Leverkusen paid to buy him, and Welbeck went to Arsenal for £16m.

Source: AFP \nNelson Rodriguez is counting on Schweinsteiger taking the opportunity with both hands. \n“He doesn’t have the same speed and the same physical elements to his game as he did … but the rest of his game has grown,” Rodriguez said. \n“When we looked to improve last year’s team, among the elements we looked to improve was our ability to not only hold the ball-have [better pass] completion percentage and overall possession advantage, but also the ability to split lines. Get behind lines,” Rodriguez continued. \n“And Bastian, from a wide range of positions, from a wide range of distances—short and long—can unlock defences and we believe he will be very helpful in that regard. \n“Beyond that, he’s a player that you can play the ball to under pressure with comfortable assurance that he’s going to be very difficult to dispossess, if at all.” \nBut Rodriguez added: “We understand Bastian will need some time [to acclimate and regain match fitness]. Schweinsteiger. Source: AP \nThat what prompted a warning former Germany teammate Arne Friedrich, who played for Chicago Fire from 2012 to 2013. \n“From the performance level the American league can be compared with the upper part of the Bundesliga’s second division,” said Friedrich, who won 82 caps for Germany. \n“Above all, Bastian should be in a good physical condition because all the players there are fit. \n“Fitness has traditionally been a high priority in America, but tactically and in terms of the games he has played in, Bastian has a great advantage.” \nHowever, Rodriguez believes the transfer will pay off for his club. \n“He improves our locker room and our quest to continue to not only add a leader, but a role model.” \n“I suspect Bastian is going to make me a better pro, a better general manager—going to make us all better. And in the end, I think we’ll look at this and say this was the signal moment where our ambition and our vision caught up with our hopeful execution to make us a global club.” \nHere’s how the football world reacted to Schweinsteiger’s move. Thanks to all fans, the whole staff and my teammates of @ManUtd !
