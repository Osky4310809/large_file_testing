Lately, though, some adults who maybe have too much time on their hands are getting in on the coloring craze. The rise of adult-themed coloring books, with their more detailed artwork, has now expanded into mobile apps. Disney has officially launched the new Color by Disney app for Android in the Google Play Store with the hopes of riding this trend.\nSee also: Best Android apps for artists April 21, 2015 \nThe app will allow users to color in drawings of Disney’s famous animated characters, from films like Frozen, The Lion King, and many others. The app offers a ton of different colors to use so your favorite character can have his or her own special look, and you can pick from your choice of pens, including pencil, crayon, and markers. It also allows users to put in extra gradients and filters in their colored artwork. Of course, after you are done, the app allows you to share your coloring work with other via social media.\nThe Color by Disney app, while free to download and use, will require a paid subscription to unlock new content and updates. Disney is charging $2.99 for one week of access, $7.99 for one month or $39.99 for a full year.\nGet it from Google Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:22:06.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
