Each team gets an equal opportunity to win it or blow it. factschecker says: Mar 20, 2017 3:31 PM \nGood thing NFL HQ is constantly tweaking football. The game was in shambles until they started making all these changes. Maybe someday the game will be popular enough for TV networks to bid against each other just to carry a few games per week. Maybe someday the game will be popular enough that there will be internet blogs that cover the sport even through the off season when there are no games taking place. Maybe if they keep tweaking the game enough eventually we might get to that point in time?

Better yet don’t play OT at all in the regular season, nothing wrong with two teams playing to a draw. Quite frankly I don’t understand the American obsession that a game cannot end in a tie.
