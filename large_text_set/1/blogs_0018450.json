Considering how long the injury list has looked at times throughout the year, a daily report with only two players ruled out due to injury is something of a rarity, especially this late in the season.\nSteelers practice report\nDNP: Bell (NIR), Green (illness/concussion), Harrison (shoulder)\nLtd: V. Williams (shoulder)\n— Chris Bradford (@BCTBradford) January 19, 2017 \nSteelers practice report:\nFull: Boswell, Chickillo, Davis, Finney, Heyward-Bey, Mathews, Mettenberger, Toussaint\n— Chris Bradford (@BCTBradford) January 19, 2017 \nThe encouraging sight of a return to limited action for Ladarius Green on Wednesday took a step backward on Thursday, having fallen to the stomach bug going around the team. There have been no updates from the coaching staff about Green’s physical condition and he remains in concussion protocols. Even if he was cleared to return medically, it would seem unlikely Green would feature much in the game plan after missing much of training for the past few weeks.\nRelated: Even if he's healthy, should the Steelers play Ladarius Green on Sunday? \nWhile Le’Veon Bell was excused practice for personal reasons, it was a shoulder problem that earned James Harrison a rest day. Vince Williams was the lone player limited, an improvement after he was forced to sit out on Wednesday with a shoulder issue of his own. Even though he will be less than 100 percent come game day, like Harrison, there is little doubt Williams will play.\nThere was good news with the resumption of full training for Anthony Chickillo, a player who has been sidelined for a few weeks now. Sean Davis was also back with his teammates having taken a day off to rest a shoulder concern that has been bothering him for the past couple of games.\nRounding out a good day on the availability front were the four players excused because of an illness just the day before, as all were back at full practice on Thursday. Hopefully, this is an indicator the bug is some kind of 24-hour sickness and will not be too much of an issue for those affected by it come Sunday.\nRelated: Win a free official jersey by following Steelers Wire \nHere is the full participation report from Steelers.com\nSteelers: No Participation : LB James Harrison (Shoulder), TE Ladarius Green (Concussion), RB Le’Veon Bell (Not injury related).\nLimited Participation : LB Vince Williams (Shoulder),\nFull Participation : DE Ricardo Mathews (Ankle), RB Fitzgerald Toussaint (Concussion), K Chris Boswell (Illness), OL B.J.
