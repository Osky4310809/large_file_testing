And it’s that small percentage that is a challenge for our community (that) is a challenge for me.” \nMarshall said throughout his protest that taking a knee was merely a symbol and a chance for him to bring attention to social injustice. It was a costly one for him; he lost two endorsements deals and received an onslaught of racist and threatening mail. \nBut his plan was to follow his protest with action. \n“Whenever I stand up, I’ll stand up and I think it’ll be a good thing and I think I’ll make an impact,” Marshall said in September. “I’m trying to make an impact in the community as well. When I do stand up it’ll be because kneeling really was just to bring attentions to the issues, an awareness factor, a symbol, so to speak, just like the flag is a symbol. That’s really what everything’s about. It’s not about kneeling; it’s about other things, so now I’m doing the donation thing and I’m going to do other things to back up my kneeling.” \nMarshall’s meeting with White was the first step. Continuing his community work and involvement in local schools that he started before his protest was another. Trying the simulator and joining a ride-along to experience first-hand — or as close to first-hand as possible — the dangers and difficulty of law enforcement’s daily work, was yet another. \nEarlier this week, Marshall tested the VirTra V-300 simulator used to train officers in shoot and don’t-shoot scenarios. The Denver Police Department posted a preview of Marshall’s experience and will show the full video Sunday at 1:05 p.m. on its Facebook page . \nThis week the Denver police also shared its revised use-of-force policy that directs officers to employ de-escalation techniques instead of rushing into volatile situations. The policy was at the heart of Marshall’s discussion with White in September and was a primary reason Marshall decided to stand for the national anthem mid-way through the Broncos’ season. \n“For the 1st half of the season, I’ve been taking a knee for the National Anthem to raise awareness for social injustice and to start conversation about what all of us can do to make a positive change,” Marshall wrote in an Instagram post . “I’m encouraged with the many productive discussions and progress that has taken place as the Denver Police department has decided to review its use of force policy. I’m proud to have joined so many of my peers throughout sports who’ve also made their own statements.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T07:44:58.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
