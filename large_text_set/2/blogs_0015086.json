Keith Ellison Share Share Tweet \nA week out from the vote for the new DNC Chair, and the race has begun to narrow. Ray Buckley, the New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman, has dropped out of the race and has endorsed Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN). Buckley announced this endorsement on Saturday. \n\"While it was a tremendous honor to run for DNC Chair over the past few months, I am proud to throw my support behind Keith so we can ensure that the next Chair of the DNC is dedicated to investing in and strengthening state parties and ensuring that the DNC is an accountable organization,\" Buckley said in a statement. \"As I've talked to the DNC membership, it's clear Keith has widespread support, and I know as our next DNC Chair Keith will successfully unite and grow our party.\" \nThe DNC race is now mostly a contest between Ellison and former Obama Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Ellison has been endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), whereas Perez has received support from people associated with Obama and Hillary Clinton. \nThe election will take place next weekend and is expected to go into multiple ballots.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:04:22.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
