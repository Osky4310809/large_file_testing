The longtime business correspondent said the law would overwhelmingly benefit the young, the wealthy, and insurance companies. \nBut as President Donald Trump so often reminds, every trade also has a set of losers. According to Velshi, those people were the elderly, the sick, and the poor, all of whom would all take a hit with a return to market-based insurance. \nVelshi spelled it out with this helpful graphic. \nCriticism of the replacement plan has come from other quarters as well, and not just partisan Democrats. \n“With Medicaid reductions and smaller tax credits, this bill would clearly result in fewer people insured than under the ACA,” Larry Levitt , senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation said in a widely reported statement. “The House GOP proposal seeks to reduce what the federal government spends on health care, and that inevitably means more people uninsured.” \nGOP Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) said the Republican plan would bring new choices to Americans but conceded after tough questioning on CNN that the plan would likely result in less coverage. \n[image via screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
