Yes, he really did this. Trump officially filed paperwork for a 2020 presidential campaign on January 20, and after one month in office, he held one of his classic airplane hanger rallies (he pulled up in Air Force One) while surrounded by his adoring supporters. And everyone is taking notice of the man — Gene Huber — who Trump invited onstage to speak, despite the Secret Service appearing very alarmed at the prospect.\nTrump bombastically welcomed Huber onstage while remarking that he wasn’t worried about safety: “I’m only worried he’s gonna give me a kiss!” Huber gleefully hopped towards the podium while wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the presidential seal. He thanked Trump and gushed for awhile after the president noted that he’d arrived at the venue at 4:00am for an event that was scheduled at 5:00pm. After the lovefest, Trump declared, “A star is born!” Then Huber spoke with the media, and oh man…\n\nHere’s a CNN clip of Huber admitting that he has a cardboard standee of Trump in his house, and “I salute that every single day!”\nEveryday he talks to a 6 foot cardboard President Trump. You couldn’t make this stuff up #trumprally #theresistance #genehuber pic.twitter.com/PQU5F0YYQM \n— Jonathan Beeley (@foreignpolicy77) February 19, 2017 \nHe also had a message for CNN: “Let’s just be a little, little nicer to our president. Thank you so much.”\n@FoxNews Gene Huber is legend. #TrumpRally pic.twitter.com/1z6pNjmmK2 \n— Saints Watch (@TheSaintsWatch) February 19, 2017 \nHuber kinda hit the jackpot by meeting his hero, right? So, of course someone set this video to the tune of The Price Is Right .\nAs per your your many requests I've added sound to mental Donald Trump going all 'The Price Is Right' at the #TrumpRally . Please share! pic.twitter.com/n8lAPqgQUQ \n— Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 18, 2017 \n\n\nBeau Willimon (creator of House of Cards ) dug up some of Huber’s old tweets, which … are about what one would expect.\nA few tweets from the guy Trump asked up to the stage at his rally and had speak from the podium with the Presidential Seal. pic.twitter.com/tUCsSiOp1B \n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 18, 2017 \n\nAnd here is a video of Huber standing in line, just for kicks. He’s so excited.\nGene Huber, first in line at Trump’s rally on Melbourne, Florida. 13 hours ahead of time. pic.twitter.com/bJxH6x014K \n— Michael Delauzon (@MichaelDelauzon) February 18, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:33:34.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
