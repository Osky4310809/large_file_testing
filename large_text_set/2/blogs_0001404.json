We carried out some test and realised that the dog is not infected with rabies,” the source said. \nBarrow returned to The Gambia last week to a jubilant welcome marking the beginning of the west African nation’s first democratic transfer of power. \nHe had been living in Senegal for safety reasons since mid-January. \nJammeh went into exile in Equatorial Guinea under threat of regional military intervention.
