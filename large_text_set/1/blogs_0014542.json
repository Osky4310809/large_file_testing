Be clear…. There IS an agenda behind all these meetings,” T.I. titled the first caption where he doesn’t mention any names. “I shall explain in detail. Be aware. Be alert. Or Be Bamboozled!!!” A video posted by TIP (@troubleman31) on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:39am PST \nIn part two, he explains the likely motivation behind Trump taking photos with celebrities like Yeezy and Harvey, essentially suggesting it’s all a publicity stunt to secure approval from the black segment of the population. “They seen how adamantly against him being president the Hip Hop community and young black people in America was, so what do they do? They get Kanye West. He’s their representative.” A video posted by TIP (@troubleman31) on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:56am PST \nAnd he goes on for a third video, asking “Kanye what the fuck you doing, man?” A video posted by TIP (@troubleman31) on Jan 16, 2017 at 12:11pm PST \nAfter going on about Harvey and his appeal to black women, he touches on the Congressman John Lewis controversy and the fact that Martin Luther King Jr.’s son met up with Trump on his “god damn daddy’s birthday” for the observed holiday today (January 16). While T.I. makes sure to harp on how important it is to have mutual respect for people’s differences, it’s clear his frustration level is at an all-time high. Watch the videos above.
