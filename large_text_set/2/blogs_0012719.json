But it turns out women are attracted to the bright colors themselves, say Oxford University researchers who published a study on Monday that proved women are more into Caucasian men who have yellow and red skin pigment. \nThe researchers rounded up 43 heterosexual white guys, sorting 23 into the treatment group and 20 into a control group, and put the first group on a 12-week beta-carotene supplement program. Beta-carotene turns light skin yellow-red, which researchers hypothesized to be an evolutionary sign of health. At the end of the 12-week period, 66 heterosexual women assessed the pre- and post-beta-carotene faces of the men. For the guys with lighter complexions (which allowed the beta-carotene effects to be more visible), the women gave higher post-supplement levels of attraction; the women cited no difference in attraction for the control group.
