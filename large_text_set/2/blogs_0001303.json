McAfee is a Pro Bowl punter who finished third in the NFL with a net average of 42.7 yards last season. He’s also an above-average kicker on kickoffs. Players like that aren’t easy to replace. \nColts kicker Adam Vinatieri said today on PFT Live that he’s going to miss McAfee as his holder and as a presence in the Colts’ special teams meetings. \n“I’m definitely going to miss him,” Vinatieri said. “He and I and Matt Overton our long snapper, we’re around each other all day.” \nThe Colts will miss McAfee, and new G.M. Chris Ballard just found out he has another big hole on his roster.
