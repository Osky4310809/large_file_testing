So I will vote for Emmanuel Macron,\" he said. \nMr Valls met Socialist MPs on Tuesday night to explain his position. \nMr Macron - who served in Mr Valls's Socialist government before leaving to form his own political movement - is predicted to face Ms Le Pen in the second round run-off. \nCentre-right candidate François Fillon and his British-born wife Penelope have been placed under formal investigation on suspicion of abusing funds amid \"fake jobs\" allegations.
