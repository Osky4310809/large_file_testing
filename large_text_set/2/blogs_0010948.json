The original order will be rescinded. \n“We are issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country,” Trump said at a press conference at the White House. \n“The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision” by the 9th Circuit, the president added.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2017 \nEarlier this month, Massachusetts’ based federal district judge Nathaniel Gorton (whose jurisdiction lies in the 1st Circuit) found the president used the statutory authority Congress granted him regarding non-citizen entry into the country for the stated reason of ensuring “that resources are available to review screening procedures and that adequate standards are in place to protect against terrorist attacks.” \nTherefore Gorton ruled, in “light of the ‘plenary congressional power to make polices and rules for exclusion of aliens … which pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), has been delegated to the president, the court concludes that the government’s reasons, as provided in the [executive order], are facially legitimate and bona fide.” What do you think?
