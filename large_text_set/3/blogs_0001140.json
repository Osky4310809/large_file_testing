It gives [England] something different. \n“What Andy can do; I’ve never trained against a lad or played against a lad who is as physical and as good in the air as Andy, so I think it’s a no brainer for him to be in the squad as something different to what they’re used to.” poll loading Should Andy Carroll get an England recall? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T17:50:07.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
