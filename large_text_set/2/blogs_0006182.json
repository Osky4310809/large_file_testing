Banks, advisory firms and consultancies have scrambled to secure work on the IPO since Saudi officials announced their intention a year ago. show chapters Friday, 20 Jan 2017 | 7:22 AM ET | 01:45 \nJPMorgan , which has been Saudi Aramco's commercial banker for years, and Michael Klein, a former star Citigroup banker, are working with the Saudi authorities on a broad range of matters including the IPO. Other banks have provided informal advice to the company on the prospective IPO and have made several visits to Saudi Arabia in an attempt to get a slice of the action. \nMoelis declined to comment, and Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to requests for comment \nIt would be no ordinary listing for advisory firms and banks overseeing the selling of shares in the group that supplies one in every nine barrels of oil produced in the world. The offering would be complicated largely due to how entwined Saudi Aramco, the kingdom's biggest revenue generator, is with the state. Besides managing vast oil reserves, it acts on behalf of the government constructing schools, hospitals and sports stadiums. \nIn preparation for the IPO, Saudi Aramco has sought advice on matters ranging from which exchange to list on, regulatory exposure, disclosure rules and dividend policy. \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .
