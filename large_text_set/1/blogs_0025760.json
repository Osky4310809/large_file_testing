Cory Gardner of Colorado this weekend joined a growing group of Republican lawmakers critical of a travel ban issued Friday by President Donald Trump. \nThe measure, which targets several predominantly Muslim countries, created chaos at airports nationwide — including Denver International Airport — as passengers were detained and protesters rallied to their defense. \nIn a statement, Gardner said the ban “goes too far” and called on the White House to fix “this overly broad executive order.” He also highlighted that the problems green-card holders face with the ban , noting that “lawful residents of the United States should be permitted to enter the country.” \nU.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colorado Springs, agreed with Gardner on the need to ensure green-card holders were not affected. But he said Trump’s executive order was a “prudent” move. \n“By taking steps to temporarily stop refugee admittance from nations that are hotbeds of terrorist activity, the president is taking prudent action to ensure that his national security and law enforcement teams have the strategies and systems in place that they will need to protect and defend America,” Lamborn said in a statement.

Doug Lamborn (@RepDLamborn) January 30, 2017 \nThe criticism from Gardner comes as several GOP legislators have raised similar concerns, including U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations committee. Corker said Trump “should immediately make appropriate revisions .” \nTrump defended the action in a Tweet, noting that “there is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world!” There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 \nIn Colorado, the ban drew immediate criticism from Democrats and a delayed — and in some cases, no — response from Republicans.
