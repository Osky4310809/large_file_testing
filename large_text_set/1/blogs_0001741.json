But SUSTO are far from the typical. The Charleston five-piece covers vast sonic ground on their new album & I’m Fine Today , swaying between country-tinged rock (“Cosmic Cowboy”), contemplative pop ballads (“Mountain Top”), and any number of other genres that exist somewhere within the expansive fabric of Southern music. But lead single “Hard Drugs” is perhaps most typical of their nakedly honest, narrative approach to songwriting, covering themes of heartbreak and loneliness with an added dose of creative flair. \n“ & I’m Fine Today is our most earnest effort to create unique emotional soundscapes while speaking candidly and openly about the realities of existence,” the band tells Consequence of Sound . “We are a group of people, touring musicians, who feel privileged to do what we do and we have given all of our energy to create an album that captures both the pain and beauty of being human.” \nIt can seem like a pretty hopeless world out there sometimes, but this is the kind of music that just hits in the right way on those long, dark nights of the soul. Hell, it might even make you laugh when you’re done moppin’ up those tears. & I’m Fine Today is out January 13th via Missing Piece/Caroline; stream the full album below.
