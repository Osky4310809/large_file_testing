Be it a long day, a stressful relationship, or some asshole cut you off in traffic again , sometimes you just need starchy goodness. You’re not proud of it, but it’s your truth. Driving around, growing more desperate by the moment, you finally see it: those all-too-familiar Golden Arches . You order that large order of fries, but alas, the weird cardboard sleeve that you’ve come to associate with greasy goodness is half empty. No problem! Surely the crisp potatoes have merely fallen to the bottom of the paper bag, leaving you with a surprise post-meal snack. And yet, upon inspection, no additional fries are present. How does one recover from such a devastating loss?\nWell, if you’re like most people, you whine about it on Twitter. Apparently, this deep fried injustice is becoming increasingly widespread, with the McDonald’s Twitter account receiving a wave of angry tweets from unsatisfied customers. \nWhen your 'large fries' comes empty af @McDonalds pic.twitter.com/gUih9vXkFK \n— T (@tialee88) December 15, 2016 \nJust got home,got my @McDGreaterSA large fries and this is what I get, looks half empty,what am I paying for?

Mickey D’s, to their credit, decided to get ahead of the issue and release a statement. However, it’s sure to leave those who have felt the soul-crushing plight of too few fries still demanding justice.\n“There is no policy in place which suggests French Fries should be served in a carton that is anything less than full.\n“Customer service and experience is one of our top priorities and we are always disappointed to hear when our food falls short of customer’s expectations and our high standards.”\nCall this “problem” American entitlement or call it the uncomfortable destruction of the familiar, but something tells me that the angry tweets won’t end until more fries are dispensed. \n(Via BroBible )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:58:45.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
