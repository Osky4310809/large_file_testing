Right? \nMaybe not, especially if the party is going on outside of your house. \nWhen activists from the LGBT community launched a “queer dance party” in the neighborhood of Mike Pence’s temporary Washington D.C. residence on Wednesday to protest his stance on homosexuality, the vice-president-elect was invited to “Come dance, Daddy Pence.” Advertisement - story continues below \n— remmagolds (@rg0lds) January 19, 2017 \nMuch of the protest was captured on video and posted to Twitter.

The vice-president-elect and his wife were away from their home when the protest took place. \nProtest organizer Firas Nasr told the Washington Post said the dance party was organized to educate Pence on the LGBT community.

At least two of those residents said they were not upset by the commotion. \nMary Ann Carmody told the Washington Post, “I love this. I love the world. It’s wonderful to see people on the street like this. We’re lucky we can do this.” \nJoanna Pratt, a longtime resident of the neighborhood said, “We come in all shapes, sizes, colors, beliefs, and we need to respect our diversity.” \n“The LGBT community has had a real struggle to be respected and be accepted, and that’s a sad statement on our country and our culture that they’ve had that struggle,” she added.
