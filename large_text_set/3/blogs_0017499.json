It is usually caused by a virus and often persists even after other upper respiratory symptoms are gone. \nThis type of infection may be acute or chronic. Acute sinusitis only lasts for a short time, whereas chronic sinus infections last for more than six to eight weeks or frequently recur. \nAn untreated sinus infection can potentially damage the sinuses and lead to ear infections, vision loss or even meningitis, so it is important to treat it right away. But treating a sinus infection is often delayed because people do not recognize a sinus infection in the initial stage. \nEarly symptoms of a sinus infection and a cold are very much alike, usually including a stuffy nose, slight fever, a scratchy throat, and feeling fatigued and just sick. \nWhen it is a cold, the symptoms start improving in three to five days and you start feeling better within a week. But if symptoms persist for more than a week, you most likely have a sinus infection. \nHere are some symptoms of a sinus infection that can help you distinguish it from a cold. 1. Pain in Your Face \nOne of the best ways to distinguish between a common cold and a sinus infection is the pain and pressure you feel in your face with an infection. \nPain from a sinus infection can occur in and around your nose, in your upper jaw and teeth, and between your eyes. The accumulation of mucus in the sinuses also causes a feeling of heaviness or pressure in your face. \nThe pain may be worse when you move your head forward or touch the areas overlying your sinus cavities. Also, the maxillary sinuses located under your eyes may be painful when pressed or touched. \nAs the inflammation reduces and the infection clears, the pain will go away. 2. Yellowish or Greenish Discharge \nDiscolored nasal discharge – green, yellow or blood-tinged – is another sign of a sinus infection. This is mainly due to the virus in your system, which causes the discharge to change colors. \nThe discharge may also bypass your nose and flow down your throat, leading to tickling or itching sensations in the back of your throat. \nAlso, the discharge will be thick and hard to blow out of your nose. This is another major distinction between a sinus infection and a cold. The nasal discharge you experience with a common cold is clear and more liquid in nature. \nWhen suffering from a sinus infection , you’ll find that you need to blow your nose more frequently to get rid of the thick accumulated mucus. 3. Coughing Up Phlegm \nA cough often accompanies a sinus infection, but many people assume it is due to a cold or bronchitis. \nCoughing due to a sinus infection usually is worse at night and in the morning. This is mainly because the sinuses drain down the back of your throat when you lie down, which triggers the cough receptor in the back of the nasal pharynx. \nThis type of cough also produces phlegm. Phlegm contains the bacteria or virus as well as inflammatory cells produced in response to an infection. The body tries to expel the phlegm that travels to your lungs through coughing. \nYou can reduce the frequency and intensity of your coughing by sitting upright to sleep. It will also help you sleep better, which is important for recovery. 4. Stuffy Nose that Lasts Longer \nA stuffy nose is a classic symptom of both a sinus infection and a cold, but it usually lasts longer when it’s due to sinusitis. \nThis symptom is mainly due to inflamed blood vessels in the sinuses. Your inflamed sinuses may also make it difficult for you to breathe through your nose, giving you the feeling of a stuffy nose. Your voice may also sound “stuffy.” Prev post 1 of 2 Next", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T14:58:45.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
