unveils the all-electric FF 91supercar jan 04, 2017 CES 2017: faraday future unveils the all-electric FF 91supercar \n\nCES 2017: faraday future has unveiled their first production vehicle, the ‘FF 91’ all-electric supercar, at the CES 2017 trade show in las vegas. it defines a new era of electric mobility that fuses exceptionally high performance with precise handling, ultra-luxury, and futuristic intelligence features. leading its extreme capabilities, the supercar produces 783 kW of power, equating to 1050 HP, delivering a staggering 0-60 mph time of 2.39 seconds. \nthe long stance of the vehicle is highlighted by a singature line that runs along its bodyall images courtesy of faraday future \n\n\nbuilding upon their variable platform architecture (VPA) system, which was first shown at the CES 2016 with their ‘ FFZERO1’ concept car , faraday future’s ‘FF 91’ supercar enhances the flexible powertrain to merge the chassis and body into a single form. this monocoque structure provides improved vehicle rigidity, safety, and handling, and also supports the all-wheel drive system that offers greater traction, control, and precise power distribution. furthermore, the VPA houses the advanced battery technology, which includes a 130 kWh battery that achieves a range of 378 miles, and can recharge at an astonishingly fast speed of more than 500 miles per hour. \nthe exterior design is dedicated to improving aerodynamics \n\n\ndriven by aerodynamics, the faraday future ‘FF 91’ has a sleek, rounded front yet an edgy, angular rear that not only looks striking but improves efficiency and thus the car’s range. its signature UFO line runs around the mid-section, highlighting the wide and long wheelbase of the vehicle. focusing on communication, the exterior lighting system establishes a deeper and more engaging connection between itself and the driver. as users approach, the ‘FF 91’ recognizes and welcomes them by illuminating a panel with the owner’s confirmation sequence. \n\n\nwith a wide and long stance, the faraday future electric car offers a spacious and luxurious interior environment where users feel more rested and energized. offering grands views of your journey, the vehicle includes a panoramic roof that features smart dimming technology. furthermore, the rear and side windows are also made from this polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) glass, which with a simple tap provides instant privacy and shade from outside. \nthe rounded front end greets onlookers with a futuristic-like appearance \n\n\ncollaborating with leeco, a global internet company that seamlessly blends devices, contents, and applications into an ecosystem, the ‘FF 91’ offers leading in-car connectivity. named ‘FF ecosystem’, it enables occupants to access apps and content, whilst learning their preferences to offer a smarter, more personalised experience over time. with this knowledge, the system remembers likings, such as seating positions, favorite music and movies, ideal temperatures, and even driving style settings. showing off its intelligence even more, the car features advanced facial recognition technology named ‘arrival interface’, which enables passengers to unlock it without the key. \n\n\nin terms of safety, the faraday future ‘FF 91’ enhances 10 high definition cameras, 13 long and short range radars, and 12 ultrasonic sensors to quickly extract data and correct driving decisions. additionally, the ‘driverless valet parking’ feature enables the car to park itself after the driver has exited. similarly, the driver can use an app to summon the vehicle from its parking spot at a requested time and location. \nthe all-electric car races from 0 to 60 mph in 2.39 seconds \n\nthe vehicle’s rear is defined by edge lines \n\nits sensors and onboard computer makes driving corrections to ensure the safety of its passengers \n\nthe car recognizes and welcomes its drivers and passengers",
