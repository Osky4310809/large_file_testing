I’ve been bullied and shamed before — it’s not fun. I used to be so insecure that I would just keep quiet and not say anything. It’s time people who are being bullied and shamed stand up for themselves.”\nRELATED VIDEO: Jamie Otis and Doug Hehner are Expecting a Baby \nOtis shared a screenshot of her messages with her body shamer and explains why she decided to stand up for herself.\n“Maybe she didn’t realize that her comment was so hurtful and downright rude?” she wrote on her blog. “Maybe if I speak up, she won’t hurt another person by bullying and shaming them.”\nHowever, the woman showed no remorse in her response, saying that the “world doesn’t need to see” her breasts and that Otis should be more modest.\n“Her response to me literally left me speechless,” wrote Otis. “Instead of maybe apologizing and accepting that her words were hurtful, she went on to try to shame and bully me more. This is where I decided I should just stop. Some people live in their own little worlds and refuse to try to change for the better.”\nEven though her exchange didn’t have the intended result, she decided to share the experience in hopes that maybe it will change someone else’s mind who has shamed others or been shamed themselves.\n“My goal in sharing this experience is that any woman who stumbles across this post will just think about their comments before they post them,” she wrote. “Maybe we as women could go out of our way to build each other up instead of tear each other down. And if you’re reading this after being bullied or shamed, please know you are not alone. Don’t go hide in shame, but instead stand up to your bully.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:19:12.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
