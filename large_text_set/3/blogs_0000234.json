Who knew there were so many frustrated mamas out there on the leftynet?\nPresident Trump met with the presidents of Black colleges on Monday in the Oval Office. It was a routine \"grip and grin\" for the president - something he does half a dozen times a day. The White House photographer snapped some photos of the group for posterity.\nAll of this was completely routine and uneventful. Except that one photos showed Trump aide Kellyanne Conway on a sofa off to the side of the gathering with - and I can barely contain my outrage when reporting this - her feet curled beneath her. And...and...and...\nSHE HAD HER SHOES ON!\nPredictably, the lefysphere exploded in anguish at this \"disrespecting\" the Oval Office. Leading the chorus of outrage at this atrocity was former famous person Keith Olbermann who used some salty language to strike down Conway for her transgression:\nGet your fucking feet off the furniture, @KellyannePolls . This isn't your home. https://t.co/12DpukKDkS\n— Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) February 28, 2017\nNew Republic editor Jeet Heer suggested it was r cism:\nI don't care about the disrespect for the oval office, it's the disrespect for the guests from the HBCUs that is striking. https://t.co/Hplg4Dqeb3\n— Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) February 28, 2017\nEven WaPo's political reporter Chris Cillizzas thought the reaction from the left was over the top:\nFirst of all, every party not in the White House likes to express shock and outrage at the way the other side is treating this hallowed job and office. Republicans were incensed when Bill Clinton and Barack Obama treated the Oval Office with slightly less formality than did Ronald Reagan, who, famously, always wore a suit coat in the Oval Office.\nObama puts his feet on the desk! Obama throws a football!\nThis is all par for the Internet outrage/partisan police.\nWell, that's almost true. Last time I looked, there are several differences between Obama and Kellyanne Conway, not the least of which is that one of them lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and the other one doesn't.\nBut Cillizza uncovers why the outrage is not only fake, but misplaced.\nThen there is the specific context of the photo above. While not captured in most of the photos that initially circulated on the Web, other snaps of the moments following the initial picture show Conway just trying to get in position to take a photo of the gathering .\nShe was taking a photo. This is the dumbest outrage ever. pic.twitter.com/qtHkaGpH9N\n— Ben Dreyfuss (@bendreyfuss) February 28, 2017\nUnder normal circumstances, you would expect an apology from some liberals for jumping to conclusions. But the words \"normal\" and \"liberal\" are rarely used in the same sentence.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/28/kellyanne-conways-couch-scandal-may-be-the-dumbest-trump-controversy-yet/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.hapblog.com/2010/01/remember-when-other-presidents-had.html", "https://twitter.com/HeerJeet/status/836446149590433793", "https://t.co/qtHkaGpH9N", "https://twitter.com/bendreyfuss/status/836411599497854982", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/28/the-kellyanne-on-the-couch-controversy-is-so-incredibly-dumb/?utm_term=.65dc46470737", "https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls", "https://t.co/12DpukKDkS", "https://twitter.com/KeithOlbermann/status/836409504115920897", "https://t.co/Hplg4Dqeb3"], "published": "2017-02-28T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:44:08.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
