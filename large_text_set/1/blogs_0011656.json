He has joined the conservative cable news channel One America News Network as a political commentator, The Daily Beast reported Thursday. \nLewandowski, who was fired from the campaign in June, a few months after he grabbed then-Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields at a campaign event, reportedly began working at the network earlier this month. The channel, which is based out of San Diego, California, launched in 2013 and bills itself as “a network that cares about a strong America.” \nIt is not clear whether OANN’s deal with Lewandowski is exclusive, or whether he is being paid by the company. A spokesperson for One America News Network did not immediately respond to a request for additional information. \nAfter Lewandowski left the Trump campaign, he quickly joined CNN to serve as a paid political commentator supporting Trump’s campaign, and his policy proposals and behavior. For a brief time, while employed at CNN, Lewandowski continued to be paid by the Trump campaign. \nA few days after Trump won the election in November, Lewandowski resigned from the network. In 2016, OANN was available in 15 million homes, according to a company news release. CNN is available in more than 90 million homes. \nIn December, POLITICO reported that Lewandowski planned to open a lobbying firm in Washington, D.C. Lewandowski had been interested in a possible role in the Trump administration but said he thought he could best help Trump “outside the formal structure of the government.” Authors:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:46:54.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
