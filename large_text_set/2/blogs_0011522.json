John Schindler also says the seriousness of charges go way beyond impeachment now, and that one of his senior sources within the intelligence community sent him an email that began with “he will die in jail.” \nSchindler is lighting up Twitter making the case that it’s not impeachment Trump should be worried about, but possible charges of treason, which carry a punishment of imprisonment for life. \nSurprisingly, some US spies consider POTUS colluding with RIS + Kremlin, incl election theft, to be kinda treason-y https://t.co/fyY7SS0rPv \n— John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 \nNow we go nuclear. IC war going to new levels. Just got an EM fm senior IC friend, it began: “He will die in jail.” https://t.co/e6FxCclVqT \n— John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 \nBLUF: When the full extent of Trump’s collusion with the Kremlin comes out — incl using RIS to spy on Americans — people will go to prison \n— John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 GOP Reluctance To Investigate Flynn And Trump Not Stopping Intelligence Community \nWhile Huffington Post reports that the House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) is refusing to further investigate Flynn’s ties to Russia after his resignation due to leaked information about sanctions to Russian leaders, Trump and his administration are far from being out of hot water over the controversy. Many voters and politicians are asking why Flynn would give information to Russia about sanctions without being directed by Trump himself and without the president’s knowledge. As bad as that looks for Trump’s administration, things are rapidly going downhill from there.

Both publications say there are records of calls to Russia by Trump officials that were documented as part of what they call “routine monitoring.” \nCNN also reports that intercepted communications reveal that Russian officials boasted of having an inside relationship and special access to Trump before and after the election. Schindler claims that the US intelligence community has had enough and will go after Trump without mercy after the Flynn scandal and resignation, plus Trump’s attacks on those in the intelligence community itself, calling them “un-American” and referring to them as “Nazis.” More political articles on the Inquisitr", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T10:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:11:41.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
