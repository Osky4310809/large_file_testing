Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), told reporters that the FBI is not cooperating with his investigation into the \"unmasking\" of Gen. Flynn's name in intercepted communications. \"We donât actually know yet officially what happened to General Flynn,\" Nunes said of how communications from his confidential calls were leaked to the press. \"We just know that his name leaked out but we don't know how it was picked up yet. That was one of the things that we asked for in the March 15th letter, was for the NSA, CIA, and FBI to get us all the unmasking that was done.\" \"And I'll tell you, NSA is being cooperative,\" Nunes continued. \"But so far the FBI has not told us whether or not theyâre going to respond to our March 15th letter, which is now a couple of weeks old.\" \"If accurate, this information should have been shared with members of the committee, but it has not been,\" ranking Democrat on the committee Adam Schiff said in response. \"The Chairman also shared this information with the White House before providing it to the committee, another profound irregularity, given that the matter is currently under investigation. I have expressed my grave concerns with the Chairman that a credible investigation cannot be conducted this way.\" Schiff also noted that claims made by Nunes \"do not suggest in any way that the President was wiretapped by his predecessor.\" Related Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:37:28.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
