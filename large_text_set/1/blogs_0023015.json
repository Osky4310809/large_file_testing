Kashim Shettima of Borno. \nDogara said that the House would put mechanisms in place to ensure effective management of the commission, if the bill seeking its establishment is passed and assented by the president. Yakubu Dogara \nDogara further said that the commission, when established, would be monitored for the restoration, rehabilitation and development of the region. \nThe speaker also said that propose commission would provide a legal framework with which donor agencies and other interested parties could assist in the development process. \nHe further stated that legal action could be taken against the commission if any law or agreement was breached. \nDogara said that the commission would go a long way in improving the lives of Nigerians in the region and turns ‘’the ruins of the North- East to glory.” \nAccording to him, the commission will create jobs for the teeming unemployed youths in the region, thereby reducing the likelihood of insurgency among them. \n“We know what we felt and we know what we can do if this commission is established,” he said. \nThe speaker, who expressed confidence that the bill would get the assent of President Muhammadu Buhari urged the stakeholders to continue to advocate the establishment of the commission.
