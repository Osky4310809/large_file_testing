Men who are overweight or obese when they’re in their late teens are significantly more likely to develop severe liver disease —including liver cancer—years later, researchers from Sweden found. In fact, those with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above had nearly 4 times the risk of developing liver cancer later on. \nRun Faster Running in the heat can be grueling, but there are ways you can fight it: Cooling mid-run is more effective than “pre-cooling,” a study in the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research discovered. People who cooled off with a facial spray and menthol mouth rinse during their race improved their performance more than those who precooled with a slushie before the race. \nCheck Your Blood Pressure Improper blood pressure readings can lead to misdiagnosis—and over-treatment. Researchers from the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre discovered that over half of Canadian family doctors are still using manual devices to measure BP, which can lead to inaccurate readings if it’s not done properly. Automatic electronic measuring devices known as oscillometric devices may be the better choice, though they are more expensive. \nTest Your Blood For Cancer? A blood new test in development might help spot cancer without the need for invasive scopes or biopsies. Researchers from Purdue developed a blood test that measures markers of a series of proteins in the blood that, when elevated, could signal cancer. While the testing was done on breast cancer patients, it’s possible that the method could work for other types of cancer, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:34:04.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
