On Monday, Colorado Springs was in a wind-whipped frenzy trying to deal with 101-mph gales as feet of snow fell in the mountains, leading to road-clogging crashes . \n“We still have a few storms to go,” said Dennis Phillips, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Grand Junction. “We’re in this favored westerly flow where we have some great moisture coming right off the Pacific, right through California. It’s just continuing to flow right into the central Rockies.” \n“It has given us about everything it can throw at us,” he added. \nCrested Butte has tallied about 4 feet of snow since Saturday, while Aspen and Steamboat Springs have been socked in with roughly 2 feet. Monarch Mountain, which was shut down Tuesday for the second time in six days because of avalanche-risk mitigation on U.S. 50, has gotten 64 inches of snow in the past week. Monarch Mountain will not open today. \nCDOT closed Hwy 50 all last night for avalanche control. Stay tuned for info about tomorrow. \n— Monarch Mountain (@MonarchMountain) January 10, 2017 \n“This is a really unusual event,” said Ethan Greene, director of the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. “It has to do with the amount of snow and the water content of that snow and how it’s come in. We’re seeing areas like Wolf Creek Pass and Vail Pass that are getting 5 inches or 8 inches of water. That’s just a huge amount of weight that’s going onto our snowpack.” \nEvery high country areas except for the Sangre de Cristo zone is under an avalanche warning until Wednesday night, and the risk of slides isn’t expected to dissipate for several days. Loveland Pass between Loveland Ski Area and Keystone Resort wasn’t expected to reopen until sometime Wednesday. CDOT said it was working as fast as it could, keeping the economic impact on A-Basin in mind. \n“It’s a crazy weather cycle up here,” said Adrienne Saia Isaac, an A-Basin spokeswoman, as she prepared to leave the resort. She didn’t know of another evacuation and rapid closure at Arapahoe Basin like the one that took place Tuesday. \n“We want to keep the roadways open as much as we can,” Lewis said. “(But) we’re always going to come down on the side of public safety to not put people at risk.” \nMeanwhile, transportation companies and snowbound retailers are hoping that roads can be cleared before stocks of fuel and groceries are gone. \n“There will be a window of time when things will be fine, but at some point they will start running out,” said Patti Gillette, vice president of the Colorado Motor Carriers Association.

Busy gas stations sometimes rely on multiple gas drops each day. \nGrocery stores that rely on frequent delivery of perishables — such as milk and fresh vegetables — can also quickly face supply problems. “Nobody really holds inventory. They’re expecting a truck to deliver their next shelf full of milk,” Gillette said. \nDeliveries to King Soopers and City Markets along the I-70 corridor are being delayed by the closure, said Kelli McGannon, spokeswoman for the supermarkets. “(Drivers) are either stuck behind the closure or are taking alternate routes with thousands of our friends. We expect they will be able to make their deliveries, but they will be delayed,” she said. \nErik Brooking, a 37-year-old trucker from Florida, was headed to Telluride on Tuesday morning to pick up a load. Then he got a call saying it wouldn’t be possible. Due to avalanche concerns on Loveland Pass, we are CLOSING ALL SKIER SERVICES STARTING AT 1:00 p.m. 1/10/17. Stay tuned for updates. \n— Arapahoe Basin (@Arapahoe_Basin) January 10, 2017 \n“They can’t load me up because the facility is snowed in,” said Brooking, who was stopped at the Travel Centers of America truck stop in Commerce City. \nRandy Ulman, 56, was also at the truck stop. He was headed through the mountains Monday night when he encountered so much snow and ice that he had to turn back, he said. He took the load he was carrying back to Aurora, where it was taken off his truck. \n“I will probably go get another load and go east,” he said, “and get away from this crazy stuff.” \nCDOT says motorists need to be prepared for treacherous travel into next week. With more snow coming, avalanche slide paths will need more control, meaning further closures of I-70 and passes over state highways are likely. \n“Right now the forecast is showing that more snow is coming all the way through Friday,” CDOT’s highways operations director Kyle Lester said. “Those paths will fill up. It’s a matter of when. Future mitigation efforts will be needed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T06:02:04.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
