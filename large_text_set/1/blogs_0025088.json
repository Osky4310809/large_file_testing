Publisher Cmune has launched the free-to-play mobile first-person shooter Squad Wars: Death Division in the Google Play Store . It is available worldwide except for China.\nSee also: Best free Android games 4 weeks ago The game itself has an interesting premise. The backstory centers on a super-rich character named Barakiel, who has decided to organize a tournament that will bring the best mercenaries in the world to battle against each other, with the victors getting tons of money to “fulfill their wildest dreams”. Sounds like an interesting offer.\nSquad Wars features a single-play campaign with 44 levels so you can get used to its touch-based controls. However, the meat of the game is in its multiplayer modes, which include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Last Man Standing and more. Some modes support up to six players in one match.\nYou will be able to choose from over 250 weapons for your player character and play on 11 different maps. Cmune plans to add more new weapons, maps and other content to the game on a regular basis.\nOne interesting gameplay aspect of Squad Wars should make it easier for beginning players to get started. The game has an “Aim and Shoot” feature that lets your weapon begin firing automatically when you get an enemy inside your crosshairs. If you are a more experience shooter, there’s still the option to turn this feature off and fire the weapon when you want to.\nSquad Wars also support the ability to find online friends and invite them to join you in private matches. You can even create a special private leaderboard where you can compare your scores with just your buddies rather than the entire world.\nThe game includes a video replay feature so you can check out what you did right or wrong in previous matches, and you can also spectate and see what other players are doing online to learn from them.\nIt sound like Squad Wars: Death Division already has a ton of content to check out immediately, and the promise of regular updates should keep the game fresh into the future. Be aware that while the game is free to download and play, there are in-app purchases for buying items in the game as well.\nGet it on Google Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:37:01.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
