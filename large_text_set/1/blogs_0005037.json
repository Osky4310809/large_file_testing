Now it appears Google is “the current favorite” to take advantage of the Berlin-based company’s continuing losses, with a cut-price $500 million deal seemingly on the table.\nThe publication also claims that it has acquired SoundCloud’s latest financial report, which confirms that each of the three major record labels – Universal, Sony and Warner – all own stakes in the company.\nAccording to MBW ’s “rough approximation,” Universal owns a 4 percent stake in SoundCloud, with Sony on 3 percent and Warner around 2 percent. Together, the three labels would be set for around $45 million — peanuts, in the grand scheme of things.\nHead over to MBW to read the full report .\nAfter you’ve finished, have a nosy around SoundCloud’s stylish Berlin office .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T11:39:17.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
