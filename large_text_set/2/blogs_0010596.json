Of course, since Baldwin is a borderline cast member right now anyway, maybe this takes away from it a bit. And, more importantly, SNL has become the “Donald Trump punching bag” show and nothing else about it seems to matter that much right now. My goodness, this is going to become exhausting. \nThis aspect really isn’t SNL ’s fault. This all spurns out of the fact Trump gets angry at the show and angry when members of his administration are portrayed in ways he doesn’t like. (Trump certainly didn’t like that Melissa McCarthy portrayed Sean Spicer, which set off a week of sometimes annoying internet fan fiction casting for future episodes.) \nSo now we live in a world where political writers are criticizing SNL for being “too mean” and how a sketch might make the administration look sympathetic – as if the SNL writers care about that. (As if there’s some grand master plan as opposed to a bunch of people getting into a room and trying to make a TV show from scratch every week.) At this point it would actually be nice to have one show without any political humor – perhaps signaling a week in which nothing that interesting happened. A break from all this would be nice. \nBut that’s not going to happen. A week where nothing stupid happening looks like a pipe dream and at this point people would freak out of SNL did a show of fart sketches. (I, for one, welcomed a fart sketch last night.) But it’s weird, you can almost feel the letdown on social media when a sketch isn’t political. SNL isn’t going to change the world, but people are now treating it like it might. Comedy can certainly be important, but demanding that it be important is venturing a bit too close to the Studio 60 mindset. C’mon, just let them do some fart jokes sometimes. \nSketch of the Night \n“Cold Open: Sean Spicer Press Conference” So they went back to it the very next week, so what? It’s the gift that keeps on giving. I mean, no one complains when they watch any other weekly series and the same character pops up. “Ugh, Jon Snow again ? They are really running out of ideas, aren’t they?” Anyway, SNL could have Melissa McCarthy play Sean Spicer every single week and I’d be just fine with that. Sure, it doesn’t have the surprise factor anymore, but that doesn’t mean it’s not wildly entertaining watching McCarthy zip around on her motorized podium. Now we will probably get a week of Spicer denying that he considered bringing a leaf blower to his next press conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:18:00.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
