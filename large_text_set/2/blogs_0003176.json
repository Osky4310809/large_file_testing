The first half alone featured five goals, two red cards and one missed penalty. A few more oddities here and there and we could have had a new Christmas carol. \nThe first half ended 1-4 in favor of Napoli, the visiting team on the day. Unfortunately for Bologna, the visitors werenâ€™t very cordial guests. They poured on some more pain. 70 ðŸ˜Ÿ' And it doesn't stopâ€¦ Hamsik picks out the top corner for his second of the night. Now we're gonna have to win 6-5. #BFCNapoli 1-5 \nâ€” Bologna FC 1909 (@BolognaFC1909en) February 4, 2017 \nMarek Hamsik picked up his brace in the 70th, and with a four-goal lead surely Napoli would pump the brakes, right? Nahhh. Hamsik wanted his hat trick, and he got it just two minutes later. At that point, Bolognaâ€™s Twitter account just wanted it to stop. 72' Ok come on now, we've had enough. Hamsik with a screamer for his hat-trick. You can take him off now. #BFCNapoli 1-6 #EnoughOfThat \nâ€” Bologna FC 1909 (@BolognaFC1909en) February 4, 2017 \nWhatâ€™s the Twitter equivalent of raising the white flag? Iâ€™m guessing thatâ€™s it. Bologna begged for mercy, but Napoli didnâ€™t accept. The Partenopei hit lucky goal No. 7. Or unlucky No. 7 if youâ€™re a Bologna fan. 89' Nobody ever scores seven, it's unrealistic but sadly true. Mertens with the goal. Restart the console, TV or whatever. #BFCNapoli 1-7 \nâ€” Bologna FC 1909 (@BolognaFC1909en) February 4, 2017 \nRest easy, though. The Bologna account is optimistic about the future! FT Bologna 1-7 Napoli \nâ€” Bologna FC 1909 (@BolognaFC1909en) February 4, 2017 \nThe social media producer even had time to throw some totally unnecessary, but hilarious, shade at Wigan. Nope. A good point well made. Always could have gone worse though. We could have been @LaticsOfficial and lost 9-1. https://t.co/ZxzTk7vYSJ \nâ€” Bologna FC 1909 (@BolognaFC1909en) February 4, 2017 \nOuch. Digging up a match from 2009 to take a swipe at a team thatâ€™s not even in the same country? Thatâ€™s some quality social media-ing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:26:42.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
