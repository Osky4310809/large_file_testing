Even though the movie premiered 35 years ago today, Rocky’s iconic physique is still viewed as a force to be reckoned with. But while Stallone looked healthy on the outside, he admitted in a recent Instagram post that he put his body through a lot to get there by following a dangerously unhealthy diet . \nWhile filming the movie, his “meals” consisted of “very small portions of oatmeal cookies made with brown rice and up to 25 cups of coffee a day with honey and a couple of scoops of tuna fish,” Stallone wrote.

Stallone admits he would get so lightheaded and exhausted while filming boxing rounds that he’d go to a corner and literally do a handstand to get blood flowing back into his head. \nIn fact, the diet was so strict that Stallone’s body fat dipped to 2.9 percent—similar to a bodybuilder’s level. That can quickly become a problem: Research suggests that body fat that low can actually decrease your heart rate and testosterone levels and cause a slew of other health problems. \nWhile Stallone now admits it wasn’t the smartest move, he doesn’t necessarily regret it: “I may have looked pretty good on the outside but inside it was very dangerous thing to do,” he wrote in the caption. “But I wanted the movie to be about change. How people have to adapt to different challenges because if they don’t they will be conquered. I will always believe the adaptation is the key to survival and that’s what this story was all about.” A post shared by Sly Stallone (@officialslystallone) on Mar 11, 2017 at 11:47am PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:34:11.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
