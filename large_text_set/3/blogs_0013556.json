Iron is also charged for threatening A after hitting himself in the face and stabbing himself in the thigh with a knife, saying [to A], “I will tell police that you are the one who stabbed me.” \nThe ex-girlfriend’s legal representatives, Sehyun Law, said, “After it was revealed that Iron was booked without detention, Iron gave an interview to media that exposed the girlfriend’s identity, saying that she appeared on his album jacket. After that, her identity was spread all over social media.” They added, “Although she is a victim of assault and threats, her identity was revealed because of Iron’s interview, and she was witch-hunted after being labeled as a ‘masochist’ and ‘mentally ill.’ [A] is currently extremely fearful.” \nSehyun Law clarified, “The essence of this case is that the [A] was subject to assault after she refused a certain sexual act that Iron requested, and again after she attempted to break up with him. This has nothing to do with her identity or her sexual preferences.” \nThe legal representatives added, “[A] is the victim of a one-sided assault, having been strangled and punched. She never asked to be hit, and she never hit [Iron]. We have acquired enough evidence to prove that the truth is different from what Iron is claiming.” \nOn the other hand, Iron’s legal representatives said on March 15, “What was reported about Iron’s alleged assault and threats is quite far from the truth.” They added, “There are also baseless rumors being spread about Iron, and he has sustained significant damages because of this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:03:30.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
