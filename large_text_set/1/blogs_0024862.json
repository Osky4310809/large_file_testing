Breaking read more Multiple dead in shooting at Quebec City mosque Multiple dead in shooting at Quebec City mosque By Rachel Browne on Jan 29, 2017 \nA shooting at a mosque in Quebec City Sunday evening has left many people wounded and multiple dead, according to police. \nA police perimeter has been set up around the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec, located in the Sainte-Foy neighborhood. A few dozen people were in attendance when the shooting reportedly began around 8 o’clock. \nQuebec police told reporters that there have been “multiple victims” and “there are deaths,” although exact numbers are still yet unknown. The director of the center says that at least five people were killed, but police have yet to confirm that. Le Soleil newspaper is reporting four deaths. \nTwo suspected attackers have been arrested and police say there may be other suspects, according to CTV Montreal. Profondément attristé par pertes de vie + blessés à Ste-Foy \n— Ralph Goodale (@RalphGoodale) January 30, 2017 \nThe Islamic Cultural Center along with a number of other mosques in the province, have been subjected to numerous racist and Islamophobic attacks in recent years. Last June during Ramadan, a pig’s severed head with a note that said “Bon appétit” was found at the cultural center’s doors. In 2014, it and two other mosques were sent messages that said “Islam out of my country.” \nA spokesperson for the National Council of Canadian Muslims told VICE News that they are monitoring the situation closely. The group keeps a detailed tracker of incidents and Islamophobia and alleged hate crimes against Muslims. \n“We know that Quebec Muslims have just generally been on edge, and the climate there has been difficult,” said Amira Elghawaby. “But certainly I don’t think anyone could have anticipated something as tragic as this. And we still don’t know the motivation of the alleged shooters.” \nMore to come See what's on VICE News Tonight on .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T05:47:42.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
