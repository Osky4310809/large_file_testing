And it has to stop,” Trump told MSNBC on Tuesday morning, while visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\nAsked if he was denouncing anti-Semitism once and for all, Trump said, “Of course, and I do it — whenever I get a chance, I do it.”\nIn brief remarks to reporters, Trump then said that his tour of the recently opened museum was a “meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms.”\n“The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish communities and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” he said.\nTrump had recently resisted commenting on anti-Semitism. At a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, he responded to a question about “a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents” since his election by talking about his Electoral College victory.\nAsked about anti-Semitism again at a press conference the next day , Trump called it a “very insulting question.”\n“Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life,” he said. “Number two, racism, the least racist person.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:43:44.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
