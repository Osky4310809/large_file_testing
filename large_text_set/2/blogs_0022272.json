She said the facilities were less well run than those managed by the Bureau of Prisons, and were less necessary given declines in the overall prison population.\nBut Sessions says in his memo Thursday that Yates’ directive contradicted longstanding Justice Department policy and “impaired the Bureau’s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:20:46.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
