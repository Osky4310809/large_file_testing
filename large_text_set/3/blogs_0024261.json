Yes, it’s conventional asphalt all around but there are seams most everywhere, and those seams are extremely disruptive when a driver runs over them. And they are so ubiquitous that they are almost impossible to avoid. \nThe preponderance of seams makes the track brutally rough to drive on, especially now that the cars are so low to ground. If you watch the action in slow motion, it looks like the cars are running over railroad ties — except in real life, they’re doing it at 210+ miles per hour entering the corners. \n“You pull your seatbelts tight and just pray for the best,” was how seven-time series champion and six time ACS winner Johnson described a lap at this track. \nAnd yet, this track is a favorite of drivers. \n“It’s a super-wide race track and you can run anywhere from the bottom to the top,” said pole-winner Kyle Larson, who won Saturday’s XFINITY Series race. “Got to be conservative on your tires and be patient against the wall, but also aggressive. It’s an intense race track. The race has always felt fairly long because it’s so demanding, but yeah, I wish there were more race tracks like this.” \nSo expect to see a lot more mayhem on Sunday. \n“This race track always seems to provide good three- and sometimes four- or five-wide racing,” said Ryan Newman, last week’s winner at Phoenix. “But, I think just seeing cars sliding around will be a lot more fun this week than usual.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:43:53.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
