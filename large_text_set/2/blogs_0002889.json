Additionally, others thought that because Hadid's arm reaches past Jenner's waist and onto Graham's, Photoshop was used to cinch her midsection. \nAshley took to Instagram with a response, clarifying in the comment section on her own page, \"I chose to pose like that.. no one told me to do anything.\" Photos Inez and Vinoodh \nInside Vogue , Graham, 29, explained why acknowledging diversity in the fashion industry is so important nowadays. \n\"Sixty-seven percent of the women in America wear a size 14 or larger,\" she explained .\"Sixty-seven percent. Maybe you could ignore those consumers before, but now, thanks to social media, they're making their voices heard. Women are demanding that brands give them what they want. And what they want is to be visible.\" \nAshley went on, \"Designers aren't the only ones pushing fashion in an all-embracing direction.\" \nThe stunner continued to defend her stance by re-posting her first-ever Vogue cover to Instagram and captioning it, \"Dream. Come. True! THANK YOU @voguemagazine for having me on your cover!! @inezandvinoodh #diversity #inclusion #thenewnorm #fearlesswomen #vogue125\" \nE! News has reached out to Vogue for comment.
