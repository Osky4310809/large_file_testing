The NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 calls for a $19.5 billion annual budget for the agency – not a major change from the agency’s $19.3 billion budget in 2016 – but the document seems to leave out the agency’s earth science division entirely. Trump claims this is simply a way of reaffirming the agency’s “core mission” of human space exploration, space science, and technology, but given how aggressively the new administration has gone after any agencies involved in atmospheric research, climate change denial is likely the underlying motive for the shift.\n\n\nUnder the new act, Congressional Republicans have outlined a new roadmap for the agency’s future. The law calls on NASA to create a plan for humans to reach the surface of Mars by the 2030s, and to continue developing its Orion space capsule and its Space Launch System. The administration has also expressed a desire for NASA to return to the moon in the 2020s.\nRelated: NASA releases startling new images showing 30 years of change on Earth \nWhat’s unclear is exactly how the new law will affect NASA’s earth science research. Trump’s proposed budget , however, may offer some clues. He hopes to cut the earth science budget by $102 million, potentially terminating a number of programs, including the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE), Orbital Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3), Deep Space Climate Observatory (DISCOVR), and CLARREO Pathfinder missions. These four satellites help scientists monitor the Earth’s climate, weather, and oceans.\nWhile Trump may claim climate change is outside of the scope of NASA’s original research mission, that’s simply untrue. When NASA was formed in 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Act explicitly called on the new agency to contribute to the \"expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere.\" The loss of these resources would be devastating to the larger scientific world, which often relies on NASA data for research.\nRelated: Gov. Jerry Brown pledges to launch California’s “own damn satellite” if Trump blocks climate research \nIt’s still far too early to know what might happen: the funding requested would be for the 2018 fiscal year, so any cuts wouldn’t be felt immediately. The proposed budget also has to be reviewed and approved by Congress before anything is set in stone. Hopefully, lawmakers will see the value in maintaining some of these programs, even if Trump doesn’t.\nVia Business Insider \nImages via NASA \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T12:02:34.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
