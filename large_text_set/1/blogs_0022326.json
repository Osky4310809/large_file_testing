Credit Jamie Rose for The New York Times WASHINGTON — For weeks, the members of an exclusive, mostly Jewish country club in the Maryland suburbs of Washington have been entangled in a bitter dispute over whether to exclude former President Barack Obama , who has played golf there, because of Mr. Obama’s policies toward Israel. On Monday, the management of the club, Woodmont Country Club, sought to put an end to the rancor, sending a letter to members notifying them that it had invited Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, to join as “special members.” Under those terms, the former first couple would pay dues and other fees but would be spared the $80,000 initiation fee. “In the current deeply polarized political environment,” the club’s president, Barry Forman, wrote, “it is all the more important that Woodmont be a place where people of varying views and beliefs can enjoy fellowship and recreation in a relaxed environment.” As president, Mr. Obama played several rounds of golf at the club, which is off a dreary retail corridor in Rockville, Md., but is known for two highly rated 18-hole courses and a newly renovated clubhouse. Mr. Obama, who plans to live in Washington for a few more years, mused to friends that Woodmont might be a good club to hone his post-presidential game. But he got caught up in the inflamed politics of the Middle East and the American Jewish community. While many members were tickled by the prospect of his joining, a vocal minority protested that the club should not admit him because Mr. Obama had clashed with the Israeli government, most recently by refusing to veto a resolution at the United Nations Security Council condemning Israel for its building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. \n  Mr. Obama “has created a situation in which Israel’s very existence is weakened and possibly threatened,” said one member, Faith Goldstein, in a private email to Mr. Forman, which was published by T he Washington Post . “He is not welcome at Woodmont.” Other members defended Mr. Obama and warned that the club was ruining its reputation. Jeffrey Slavin, a member who is mayor of the nearby town of Somerset, resigned from the club in protest after sending an open letter to Mr. Forman demanding that Woodmont make Mr. Obama welcome. “The folks opposed to President Obama’s membership should be ashamed of themselves,” he wrote. “My intent was that justice be done, and that the club respond appropriately,” Mr. Slavin said in an interview.
