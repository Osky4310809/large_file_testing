Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 17, 2016\nLast week, responding to a curious Twitter user, Musk described the tunnel as \"starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX.\"\nHowever, contrary Musk's claim on Twitter that he planned \"to start digging in a month or so,\" the report indicates that he has already begun the initial phase of tunnel digging at the SpaceX facility in Hawthorne, CA.\nWhat remains unclear is whether this tunnel will be available to all SpaceX staff or just serve Musk's transportation needs. Based on the wording of his tweets, it sounds like it might be a his own, private Iron Man-meets-Batcave-style escape hatch, a detail that would only add to Musk's profile as an eccentric billionaire.\nOf course, any massive tunnel project burrowing under public highways will require permission from the local authorities, an issue Musk hasn't said much about.\nExciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2017\nNevertheless, technicalities haven't stopped Musk from blazing trails in space and the automotive industry, so we're likely to Musk's tunnel — which may be proof of a concept with wider applications in the future — made into a reality before most of the Hyperloop projects his previous brainstorms have inspired.\nSpeaking of Hyperloop, Musk has also been tweeting updates from Sunday's Hyperloop Pod Competition, an event designed to foster the development of various Hyperloop projects. The competition is being live streamed here .\nBONUS: SpaceX's most recent rocket landing looks so sci-fi in new photos", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Goh7jCMu.jpg", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/810108760010043392", "http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Goh7jCMu.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/824182024479133698"], "published": "2017-01-30T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:44:28.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
