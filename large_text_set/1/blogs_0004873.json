As a Philly transplant, I could count on Fox to televise 3 or 4 Eagles games during the season. This year, I watched Red Zone or went to a bar. No reason to watch that Rams team this season. chuckshontaspads says: Jan 6, 2017 6:09 PM \nHire a coach that is not a complete phony and an all time loser and you will get ratings. bmack1224 says: Jan 6, 2017 6:10 PM \nI Live in Los Angeles and thank God for the NFL Ticket. Poor People were forced to watch Rams Games week after Week on Fox when they Had waaay better games Avalable. Stop cramming Rams games down our throats and put on Better and more Competitive games Jan 6, 2017 6:10 PM \nAnd so, we are reminded why LA lost their team the first time… Jan 6, 2017 6:11 PM \nDoes this surprise… anyone? thirdand43 says: Jan 6, 2017 6:12 PM \nLack of interest was a big reason the Rams left LA in the first place. It’s wishful thinking for the NFL to believe that the city will be more interested now than they were then. The best thing the NFL owners could do is dump Roger Goodell. That’s probably just wishful thinking on my part. Matt from San Diego says: Jan 6, 2017 6:16 PM \nYou have to give it time to grow organically. That, and a loss in ratings in a market the size of LA is a net gain in juxtaposition to the STL market, so the Rams still win. Jan 6, 2017 6:16 PM \nSo let’s put a second team in L.A. — NOT!!! Jan 6, 2017 6:27 PM \nThat will all change when the Spanos family brings the Chargers to town. jimbo75025 says: Jan 6, 2017 6:30 PM \nThe Rams need a new owner first and foremost. \nNone of Kroenke’s pro teams have ever been worth a dried turd.
