Call me.\" Isaac Saul @ike_saul Feb 24, 2017 \nCaitlyn Jenner took to Twitter on Thursday night to send a hopeful message to trans kids and criticize the Trump administration's decision to roll back an Obama directive that allowed trans students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. \nIn the short video, Jenner tells trans kids that they are \"winning,\" and that soon their freedoms will be full and nationwide. She even addressed the president directly, who she said had broken a promise he made to protect the LGBT community. \n\"I have a message for the trans kids of America: you're winning,\" she said. \"I know it doesn't feel like it today or every day but you're winning. Very soon we will have full freedom nationwide and it's going to be with bipartisan support.\" \nJenner, who is perhaps the most well-known trans person in America, had supported President Donald Trump before the election and endorsed his promise to protect LGBT Americans. This week, though, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly disagreed with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos about a decision on how to handle the Obama-era directive that invoked Title IX rules to allow trans students to use the bathroom of their choice at school. According to the report, DeVos wanted to keep the rule in place while Sessions wanted to rescind it, and ultimately Trump sided with Sessions. \nThe directive asked that \"both federal agencies treat a student's gender identity as the student's sex for purposes of enforcing Title IX,\" which bars sexual discrimination in federally funded schools. Obama threatened to pull funding from any schools that didn't oblige. \nLGBT advocates say that Obama's decision helped keep trans kids safer from bullying and made them more comfortable in their life at school. Critics say the directive to states was a federal overreach, took authority away from parents and states, and acted as an ineffective one-size-fits-all solution to a complex problem. \n\"Now I have a message for the bullies — you're sick. And because you're weak you pick on kids, you pick on women, or anyone else you think is vulnerable,\" Jenner said. Well @realDonaldTrump , from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me. pic.twitter.com/XwYe0LNUOq — Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) February 24, 2017 \nThe announcement comes at a time when many Republicans are trying to move away from debating social issues in favor of focusing on economic discussion. Unfortunately, the issue isn't going anywhere — a high-profile Supreme Court case involving Virginia transgender student Gavin Grimm will hear oral arguments on March 28. The case, which is expected to have a ruling by June, will decide whether Gloucester County School Board in Virginia can stop Grimm, a trans student who was assigned female at birth, from using the men's bathroom. \nAfter the announcement to rescind the directive, several hundred began protesting outside the White House, chanting \"No hate, no fear, trans students are welcome here.\" The hashtag #ProtectTransKids started trending on Twitter, and Jenner ended her video with a message directly for Trump. \n\"From, well, one Republican to another, this is a disaster,\" Jenner said. \"And you can still fix it. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:15:12.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
