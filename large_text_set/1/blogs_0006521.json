Treat your wooden tools. \nThink of this as massage time for some of your most beautiful and beloved kitchen workhorses: your wooden spoons, cutting boards, and wooden-handled knives. Wash them by hand and towel dry them thoroughly; then apply mineral oil or, in dire cases, equal parts mineral oil and food-grade beeswax, melted together and allowed to cool until thickened. Rub either into the edges of your boards and tools and allow them to sit overnight. Buff any excess oil or balm away with a fresh towel the next day and your tools will be glossy, smooth, and ready for anything. Treat It Right How To Oil and Maintain Wood Cutting Boards (and Spoons!) in 5 Minutes a Month 5. Deal with your drawers & edit your tool collection. \nThe drawers closest to the kitchen counter tend to catch crumbs, and pulling everything out to clean them is a great chance to assess your kitchen tools. Before you return things to the drawer, be honest with yourself about the last time you used them. \nChances are that the pastry blender, julienne peeler, candy thermometer, and cherry pitter probably don't need to be in your most easily accessible storage space. There's nothing wrong with storing these occasionally used tools elsewhere — even out of the kitchen. Garlic press you never use? Duplicates of anything? Donate them. Your drawers will be less cluttered and your tools will be more of a pleasure to use. \nOrganization Inspiration: 20 Impressively Organized Kitchen Drawers 6. Change your water filter. \nThe first week of the year is a great one for updating things that need to be done periodically, like replacing the filter in your water pitcher, and giving the pitcher itself a thorough wash. Recycle the old filter, get a new one going, and set a reminder on your calendar to do it again in three months. 7. Clean or replace dishwashing tools. \nFreshen your scrub brush with a trip through the dishwasher, or soak the bristle end in distilled white vinegar for an hour or two and then hang to dry. While you're at it, boil your dish rags and then wash and dry them as usual. If you're still on team sponge, this is not the time to microwave . Get a fresh one and resolve to squeeze it dry after each use. No matter what kind of dishwashing tools you use, assess them honestly and replace them if it's time. Having a clean slate is a great incentive to keep things nice beyond January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T16:10:55.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
