To them, he has been the most delicious piece of fruit in the orchard for several years. \nAdd the fact that he has always looked like an exceptional talent, the further truths that he plays for a national team that is always capable of becoming world or continental champions, that Barcelona and Brazil share a lucrative kit manufacturer, that South America is an important part of Barca's marketing strategy and that Neymar's age makes him a perfect candidate to take \"control\" of the post-Lionel Messi era -- fame, awards, acknowledgments, world ranking -- and you can see he almost represents \"perfection.\" \nThrow in the fact that he not only trained with Real Madrid as a kid, but Florentino Perez genuinely thought that he later had a deal in the bag to secure the striker, and Neymar just nicely slides in that last segment of \"the perfect signing\" for the Camp Nou club. \nWhat they couldn't be sure of, and what I certainly wasn't originally clear about, was how the process of \"fitting\" him with the team (and, more particularly, with Messi) would go. \nThe Argentinian was Barcelona's \"plus ultra\" footballer. He was better than any talent they'd ever owned, a legitimate candidate to be knighted as the greatest-ever footballer, a team leader, vice captain, top salary earner since 2008 and an Argentinian who was not automatically disposed to jostling for \"numero uno\" position at the club -- particularly with a natural geographical rival like a Brazilian. So to add compatibility in friendship and football terms to all the other vital elements that originally made Neymar a \"must-have\" objective, and the 25-year-old is a \"must-keep\" player. At least you'd think so. \nManchester United's interest is not only fully understandable, it's also not unique. One of my sources tells me that before Neymar renewed his contract, Real Madrid, where Florentino Perez remains both thwarted and determined to redress the balance over \"the player who got away,\" began moves to discover whether the Brazilian might be open to crossing the Clasico divide. \nIn all honesty, that's precisely what any other big club should be doing in the months prior to a renegotiation. You judge that there's an opportunity, and you hope that the talks are stalling or causing ill-feeling; you hope you can outbid the club in charge of the superstar's contract, and you bank on the fact that history is on your side. \nBarcelona are far from the only club with this baggage, but, notwithstanding the exception of Messi, their foreign superstars have more often than not been ephemeral Camp Nou presences -- and still left through the back door. Luis Figo, Romario, Michael Laudrup, Ronaldinho, Deco, Samuel Eto'o: the list doesn't stop there. \nAll I'm pointing out is that when there's evidence of such a pattern, a rival club -- whether it's United, Madrid, Chelsea or Manchester City -- are entitled to suppose \"perhaps the Barca board are making a hash of this like they did with other great players. Let's test the water.\" \nWhat proved to be the case here is that the Camp Nou board were far from doing that. Neymar's future will never be completely certain, but right now, all parties agree Barca is the place. \nNeymar agreed a new deal that ties him to the club for another four years, with an ascending buyout clause showing precisely how much Barca want the Brazilian's golden years to be with them. \nThe Camp Nou renovation project will not be just a vastly expensive one. It's a time (in any club's existence, while building work is being conducted and finances are tight) when crowds can stay away, and unexpected setbacks (construction, financial, football) are harder to deal with. What's vital is that there is a player, or players, who make the fans \"believe.\" Someone who keeps them confident and makes them unwilling to miss a match or delighted to keep winning trophies. In FC Barcelona's view, Neymar is that lynchpin. \nA supplementary piece of information that I was given (and trust) was that even if Madrid could have persuaded Neymar to join or convinced Barcelona to sell -- or even could have afforded the €200 million buyout clause -- they were troubled by the fact that this is a footballer who (along with his father) might still be penalised for the manner in which they left Santos, joined Barcelona and treated the company, DIS, that owned some of his registration. \nSo, for those who believe that Neymar's powerful new contract and Jose Mourinho's words about the impossibility of acquiring him for Manchester United mean that this is now a dead subject for a number of seasons I'd say only this. When the judicial process about the manner of Neymar's arrival at the Camp Nou concludes, he and his father may well be exonerated. Then again, they may not. If -- and I mean this purely as a hypothetical -- there was a high seven-figure penalty imposed, then the voice of experience suggests that it might become a \"rogue element.\" \nLet's not talk about Neymar, let's just talk about \"Player A.\" \n\"Player A\" and one of his representatives act in a particular way and in the fullness of time, the justice system says, \"You were in the wrong: €30m penalty.\" I'd suggest that most of society would expect the person who's been punished to have to find those funds and pay the penalty. I'd also suggest that that's not how the modern elite football world works. \nUltra-elite footballers [and \"Player A\" just happens to be one of those in this absolutely hypothetical, invented idea] know that theirs is a \"seller's market.\" They're not only in the power seat; they own the seat-making company and the electricity company that supplies the power. \"Player A\" and his representative, just like \"Player B\" and \"Player C\" if we are honest here, will look around and say, \"One of these clubs, either the one I'm with or the ones who want me, can pay this fine.\" \nThat, I'm afraid, is the way of the world. So the realistic way to look at this is that either Barcelona have talked this through with their player and said that they'll indemnify him, or they've built a sum into the contract ahead of time just in case there's a financial penalty coming. (Perhaps there won't even be a reprimand. Who knows?) \nOr, and this is where other clubs will be watching closely, Barcelona's view is: \"We pay you fabulously, any financial punishment is not our responsibility and we'll take our chances about how you feel about that if the case arises.\" I'd guess that this hypothetical situation is what other clubs are waiting to know more about. Neymar's well placed to become Barca's next figurehead after Messi. It's unclear if he'd give it up. \nLast season, Neymar's father gave an interview in which he not only complained about the personal and commercial uncertainty caused by the series of claims against him, his son and Barcelona, but admitted that Manchester United tried to buy the player. \nHe said: \"United called Barcelona, but they were told that Neymar's under contract and wouldn't be sold. Everyone can stay calm,\" he said. \nWhat's going on is that Barcelona need Neymar more than they need €200m for him, of which less than €100m would be profit, I reckon. Right now, Neymar likes playing for Barcelona, enjoys his place in the \"MSN\" trident, is winning things, is maturing, is fabulously paid and can see a day after Messi's exit when the kingdom is his. \nBut those clubs who covet him will continue to call and make public their willingness to buy him just in case, one day, his situation becomes like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Laurent Blanc, Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Deco, Figo -- you get the idea. \nSo, for now, stand down everyone. Over to the Spanish legal authorities: your move. \nGraham Hunter covers Spain for ESPN FC and Sky Sports. Author of \"Barca: The Making of the Greatest Team in the World.\" Twitter: @BumperGraham .
