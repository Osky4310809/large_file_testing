Posted 11 hours ago 3 \nMarilyn Manson missed his originally planned Valentine's Day release date last month for his new album \"Say10\" without nary an explanation. \nJust recently (March 22nd) he shared the following cryptic video with a caption citing \"6:19\", which some have interpreted to be a reference to bible. \nAdmittedly though, the vague reference could cite a number of different passages. \nOne thing's for sure, June 19th, isn't a Friday - the traditional release day favored by the music industry - making it unlikely that is is a release date.
