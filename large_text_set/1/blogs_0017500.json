The total investment figure also includes funding from VIU and community partners of the university. \nThe joint federal-provincial investment was announced today by the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, and MLA for Parksville-Qualicum Michelle Stilwell, on behalf of Andrew Wilkinson, Minister of Advanced Education for the Province of British Columbia. \nThe Government of Canada’s Innovation Agenda aims to make Canada a global centre for innovation — one that creates jobs, drives growth across all industries and improves the lives of all Canadians. This investment is a prime example of that vision in action. \nThe 6,855 square-metre Health and Science Centre will allow VIU to co-locate the majority of its health and chemistry programs into one facility. The centre will also include new teaching labs for nursing and other health programs and the Applied Environmental Research Laboratory, which conducts applied research in the environmental sciences. \nInvestments in the $39.9-million project include: $19.4 million from the Government of Canada. $16.5 million from the Province of B.C. VIU and its community partners are providing $4 million. \nThis investment in VIU will improve student recruitment and retention for high-priority health occupations, such as nursing. \nToday’s announcement of $39.9 million for Health and Science Centre is in addition to: The Marine, Automotive and Trades Complex expansion. The total cost of the expansion is $20 million, with $9.5 million each from the Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia and $1 million from VIU. A District Geo-Exchange Energy System project. The total cost of the energy system project is $2.4 million with $1.1 million from the Government of Canada and $1.3 million from VIU. \nThe Government of Canada funding for the new Health Sciences Centre is being allocated through the Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund, which will enhance and modernize research facilities on Canadian campuses and improve the environmental sustainability of these facilities. \nThe B.C. government is making record investments in modern, safe infrastructure projects throughout the province – and in doing so, these construction projects are creating high-paying, family-supporting jobs. These investments are possible because of the fiscal plan of the B.C. government. \nQuotes: \nThe Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development – \n“This historic investment by the Government of Canada is a down payment on the government’s vision to position Canada as a global centre for innovation. That means making Canada a world leader in turning ideas into solutions, science into technologies, skills into jobs and start-up companies into global successes. Our investment in Vancouver Island University will create conditions that are conducive to innovation and long-term growth, which will in turn keep the Canadian economy globally competitive.” \nMichelle Stilwell, MLA for Parksville-Qualicum, on behalf of Advanced Education Minister Andrew Wilkinson – \n“The new Health and Science Centre will prepare VIU students for challenging and rewarding careers that will support their families, regional employers and the overall health of island residents. This collaborative investment continues to build a bright future for Vancouver Island.” \nRalph Nilson, president of Vancouver Island University – \n“On behalf of VIU, I’d like to thank both the federal and provincial governments, as well as our community partners for making such a significant investment in this institution and, in turn, the communities we serve. This funding will ensure students and faculty have access to state-of-the-art learning environments and that VIU’s high-quality, innovative programs can continue to support the educational and employment needs within our region, as well as further afield.” \nSherina Goglin, VIU bachelor of science in nursing student – \n“I’d like to recognize the federal and provincial governments for supporting projects that will not only enhance our educational experience but will also support the university moving forward in a sustainable way.” \nQuick Facts: The Government of Canada’s Innovation Agenda is designed to ensure Canada is globally competitive in promoting research, translating ideas into new products and services, accelerating business growth and propelling entrepreneurs from the start-up phase to international success. The targeted, short-term investments under the Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund will promote economic activity across Canada and help Canada’s universities and colleges develop highly skilled workers, act as engines of discovery, and collaborate on innovations that help Canadian companies compete and grow internationally. The Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund supports the Government of Canada’s climate change objectives by encouraging sustainable and green infrastructure projects. \nLearn More: \nInnovation Agenda backgrounder: http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1084739 \nPost-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund: http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/051.nsf/eng/home \nPost-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund backgrounder: http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1105379 \nB.C.
