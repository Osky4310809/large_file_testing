A federal court recently ruled the IRS is still targeting groups using the policy.

Partisan officials can use the “vague and open-ended” policy “to selectively delay and obstruct those applications receiving higher scrutiny without a way to hold the officials accountable for their decisions.” (RELATED: Justice Dept. Had ‘Powerful Case’ For IRS Targeting Charges) \n“Issues that attract ‘media or congressional attention’ are usually political in nature, and reliance on such a criterion means that the process itself cannot avoid partisan bias,” the report continued, noting low-level employees could delay tax-exempt applications after watching a single TV news story. \nCincinnati-based IRS tax specialist Jack Koester referred a Tea Party group’s tax exempt application to a supervisor one year after Tea Part rallies began. Cause of Action Institute called it the “patient zero” for forthcoming problems. \nThe application was passed up the chain of command until supervisors determined to hold it until Washington managers decided how to proceed. \n“This same procedure was followed in the numerous Tea Party applications that followed,” the report said. “In most of those matters, the higher-level decision on how to proceed would not come for several years.” \nCause of Action Institute noted that “one theme was consistent” while the original case was passed around among managers — “concern about media attention,” the report said. “Five separate levels of management cited that concern specifically, including the reference to potential embarrassment, while no mention at all was made of workload concerns, novel legal questions, or other similar rationales.” \nThe targeting became more elaborate over the following months, and the agency created “be on the lookout” lists ordering officials to hold all “Tea Party” or “patriot” applications.
