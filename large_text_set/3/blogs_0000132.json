Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com) | Updated March 1, 2017 - 12:29pm “My Dear Heart\" star Coney Reyes ABS-CBN/Released \nMANILA, Philippines — As Filipinos mark the beginning of Lent with Ash Wednesday, let the following words of wisdom from Coney Reyes and other veteran stars of the hit ABS-CBN soap opera “My Dear Heart” be a source of inspiration and reflection. \nKnown for her spirituality and transformative villain roles, Coney once again gives life to another powerful character in “My Dear Heart,” Dr. Margaret Divinagracia, considered the best heart surgeon in the country. With all the success she has gotten, Margaret holds herself in high regard. \nBut everything changes as she meets Heart, played by Kapamilya child star Heart Ramos. Heart is the source of strength and happiness of her parents Jude (Zanjoe Marudo) and Clara (Bela Padilla). Living as one happy family, Heart, Jude and Clara face each of life’s struggles together. Nevertheless, their hopes are destroyed when Heart gets diagnosed with congenital heart disease. \nDesperate to find a cure for their daughter’s illness, they turn to Dr. Divinagracia, who faces what she considers her biggest failure yet – her inability to cure Heart’s illness. Their lives get even more complicated because while Heart hovers between life and death, her soul travels out of her body, with only Margaret being able to see and speak to her. \nUnder the direction of Jerome Pobocan and Jojo Saguin, “My Dear Heart” also stars Robert Arevalo, Rio Locsin, Joey Marquez, Susan Africa, Eric Quizon and Loisa Andalio. Also joining the cast are Mark Oblea, Izzy Canillo, Jerry O’hara, Jameson Blake, Sandino Martin, Yñigo De Belen, Vic Robinson and Hyubs Azarcon. \nDuring the TV series’ recent press conference, the show’s seasoned cast gave some pieces of advice for younger actors and the audience. Coney Reyes: \n“You have to be a good steward of the talent God gave you. It’s not meant for you alone and to only make money with. You have to share it first and share what you know…The money will come. But you have to do your work first honorably.” Susan Africa and Eric Quizon ABS-CBN/Released Susan Africa: \n“Persevere! There will be good and bad times, but just always stay humble and remember all people who helped you on your way up.” Eric Quizon: \n“Do your homework…Always listen. Being a good actor is being a good listener.” Robert Arevalo: \n“Take everything on a day-to-day basis. Study your role and be on time.” Robert Arevalo ABS-CBN/Released Rio Locsin: \n“Sa edad namin, kapag may trabaho ka, magpasalamat ka. Importante na may iiwan ka kasi ‘di mo na mababalikan ang nakalipas na. Habang nandito ka, iparamdam mo ang pagmamahal mo. Magmahal ka.” Joey Marquez: \n“Have the abundance of humility and respect. Don’t be just a dreamer, be a doer. I never lifted my feet from the ground. Humility is the perfect formula to success.” \nWATCH: Erik Santos’ inspiring rendition of “Sa’yo Lamang”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T10:30:29.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
