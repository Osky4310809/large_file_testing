Its statement did not mention the group’s boycott effort.\n“Each year we cut about 10% [of brands] and refresh our assortment with about the same amount,” the statement said. “In this case, based on the brand’s performance we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.”\nThe retailer still has some Ivanka Trump items in stock, a spokesperson said, and will sell through that remaining inventory.\nOn the company’s website Thursday evening, the only Ivanka Trump branded items available were four styles of shoe, all being sold at a discount.\nShannon Coulter, who helps run Grab Your Wallet, said that number is down sharply from early December, when Nordstrom had 71 Ivanka Trump items for sale.\nIt's my honor to be doing this w/ you. Dazzled to see this many flexing their consumer power in favor of a more respectful, inclusive U.S. https://t.co/a7Z1HyTNBF \n— Shannon Coulter (@shannoncoulter) February 3, 2017 \n\nShe celebrated Nordstrom’s decision as a milestone for the campaign, which began in October after The Washington Post obtained a video from 2005 that showed Donald Trump bragging about groping women during a taping of “Access Hollywood.” In that video, Trump boasted that he could “grab them by the p—y,” using a vulgar term for a woman’s genitals.\nFour days after The Post’s story, on Oct. 11, Coulter posted a message on Twitter criticizing Nordstrom for doing business with Ivanka Trump. She said the retailer should disassociate itself from Ivanka Trump, because she had continued to campaign for her father in the aftermath of the tape’s release.\nWeeks later, Nordstrom had remained a focus of the boycott group’s effort. Earlier on Thursday, in fact, her group had asked its followers to call the retail giant’s headquarters in large numbers.\n“The cause and effect here is very clear,” Coulter wrote in an email Thursday evening, after Nordstrom announced its decision. “Over 230,000 Tweets and who knows how many millions of dollars’ worth of missed purchases later, they finally heard us.”\nThe “Grab Your Wallet” campaign has now targeted more than 60 companies – a group that includes Trump’s own golf courses and hotels, those that sell Trump-branded goods, and other businesses whose leaders endorsed Trump or donated to his campaign.\n“The people who voted against Donald Trump may have lost at the ballot box, but they can win at the cash register,” Coulter said. So far, they have removed five companies from the list, after they stopped selling Ivanka Trump’s merchandise.\nRelated Ivanka Trump’s China-sewn line turns profit despite the political cost Ivanka Trump used her father’s 60 Minutes interview to market $10,800 diamond bracelet The Ivanka boycott: Trump’s problem with women could tarnish his daughter’s million-dollar brand Nordstrom was one of the first retail partnerships for Ivanka Trump’s footwear after it was launched in 2011.\nCo-President Pete Nordstrom addressed the controversy surrounding the partnership in a November email to employees, according to Fortune. He said the company had heard from customers threatening to boycott the chain if they continued or discontinued its relationship with Trump.\n“This is a sharply divisive subject,” he said. “No matter what we do, we are going to end up disappointing some of our customers. Every single brand we offer is evaluated on their results — if people don’t buy it, we won’t sell it.”\nThe same month, the company posted a response on Twitter to a shopper’s open letter calling for Nordstrom to stop selling the brand.\n“We hope that offering a vendor’s products isn’t misunderstood as us taking a political position; we’re not,” the company said at the time. “We recognize our customers can make choices about what they purchase based on personal views and we’ll continue to give them options.”\nIvanka Trump’s business began with a jewelry collection in 2007, and has grown to include clothing, shoes, fragrances, handbags and other products. A spokesman for the business did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday evening.\nIvanka Trump herself intends to resign all management positions in her company and her father’s Trump Organization, attorneys for the Trump Organization have said. On Thursday, the attorneys told the news site ProPublica that the paperwork would be entirely completed on Friday.\nIvanka Trump has now moved from New York to Washington, where she has served as an adviser to her father.\nWith a file from Bloomberg \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:00:51.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
