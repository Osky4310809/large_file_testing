You aren't the kind of woman who needs to take a day off to make a point about how women are supposedly underpaid (data is still and will always be out on that one), you are likely protected enough in your position to be able to take a day off in the first place and congratulations, it means you live in the first world where a woman can choose to take a day off for whatever reason. Way to stick it to the man, ladies. I hope you had an awesome day at home, you deserve it. \nThe triumphant announcement of this day without women on the \"official\" Women's March page (because someone bought that dot com, ya know) reads : \nIn the same spirit of love and liberation that inspired the Women's March, we join together in making March 8th A Day Without a Woman, recognizing the enormous value that women of all backgrounds add to our socio-economic system--while receiving lower wages and experiencing greater inequities, vulnerability to discrimination, sexual harassment, and job insecurity. We recognize that trans and gender nonconforming people face heightened levels of discrimination, social oppression and political targeting. We believe in gender justice. \n\nAnyone, anywhere, can join by making March 8th A Day Without a Woman, in one or all of the following ways: \nWomen take the day off, from paid and unpaid labor Avoid shopping for one day (with exceptions for small, women- and minority-owned businesses). Wear RED in solidarity with A Day Without A Woman \nSo even on what is supposed to be our day, we're being told what to do. Take off work. Don't shop. Wear RED. BTW, the red thing has already been overdone for AIDS awareness, or are you guys not old enough to remember those AIDS iPods U2 was shilling many many years back? \nI own a media company, cobbling together an existence these days but an existence no less, and one that I take great pride in. The fact that I have the opportunity to cobble this existence together is completely first world, I wouldn't have this option if, say, I were a woman in Sudan. When stories I need to cover come in I can't be like yeah sorry, it's wear red day and I'm doing cliche lady stuff at home in the tub sipping wine. \nMeanwhile there's a little girl in Sudan getting her parts hacked up because female genital mutilation is still in a thing around the world and I'm over here in the United States thinking wearing a red shirt makes a difference? Please give me twenty breaks with that shit. \nHow funny was it they said avoid shopping, like that's what all we women do right lol. RESIST THE URGE. Don't shop! That'll show them! And then turn around the next day and buy a bunch of crap you don't need on Amazon, that'll show them. I did go get my hair cut at my women-owned salon but that is beside the God damned point. \nIf you took yesterday off, good for you. But look the fuck around you. Were you sold into child marriage at 12? Do you still have your natal genitals? Do you have to walk hours a day just for water? No? Then you're doing pretty good as far as women across the world are concerned. Do we first world women have problems of our own? Of course. But please stop getting the vapors at every opportunity to play up our oppression, it's getting exhausting. \nThe fact that y'all can go out there in vagina costumes and not get your asses beat is proof of how just good we have it here in the good ole first world. Remember that when you're putting on a red shirt the next time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:31:14.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
