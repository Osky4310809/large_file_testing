CNN is Fake News!’ by Justin Baragona | 5:23   Video \nOne of the juiciest news stories over the past few days has been CNN’s report on President-elect Donald Trump being presented with a two-page synopsis of claims that Russia had attempted to compromise him, and Trump’s reactions to the network’s reporting. \nThe day after CNN’s report hit, Trump got into a shouting match with CNN reporter Jim Acosta at a news conference, climaxing with Trump pointing at Acosta and calling him “fake news.” \nSpeaking to Mediaite’s Travis Irvine today, one-time Trump adviser Roger Stone applauded Trump’s actions. \n“Well, I’m so glad that Donald Trump finally called them out,” Stone said, “CNN is fake news!” \nWhen asked what he thought was going on at CNN offices right now, Stone claimed “they’re busted” and “the emperor has no clothes,” all while getting in a mention of a new book he’s written. \nCheck out the interview above to see this plus Stone’s opinions on Ted Cruz and John Podesta . \nThis is an ongoing series featuring Mediaite’s Travis Irvine approaching your favorite cable news personalities to ask them the questions they might not get asked on television. Check in with Mediaite regularly to see who our “gentleman’s paparazzi” will find next! \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:17:26.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
