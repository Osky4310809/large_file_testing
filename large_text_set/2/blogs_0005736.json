UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 14 hours ago 0 \nThe folks from Guitar Nerds have posted an interesting video rundown, presenting their take on Top 5 reasons why your guitar toan isn't that good. \nYou can check out the highlights below, make sure to watch the embedded clip for the whole thing. 5. You're using a cheap cable \n\"There's no toan killer like cheap guitar cable. So if you're still using the one that was supplied with your starter guitar kit, it's time to upgrade. Cables may seem like a boring thing to spend decent money on, but using subpar components is a sure way to produce some bad toanz.\" 4. You haven't changed your strings in months \n\"Your guitar's toan begins with the strings, and manky old ones covered in dead skin aren't exactly the best starting point. The older and more worn out your strings are, the less top end and definition you'll have. And if you're using a decent amount of gain, you'll really struggle to cut through the mix. Dead strings are also a key reason for guitar not staying in tune.\" 3. Your pedalboard is built solely around true-bypass pedals \n\"If you're building a pedalboard solely around true bypass effects, your toan is going to take a serious battering. The reason for what is commonly known as toan suck is that the combined length of your guitar and patch cables and the circuitry inside pedals themselves is having a negative effect on your signal. However, this can be easily rectified by having at least one buffer pedal on your board.\" 2. You have cheap pickups \n\"If strings are the starting point for your toan, then pickups are surely next in line, and a cheap set can do some real damage to your toan. Muddy and lacking definition, cheap pickups are a great way for manufacturers to make guitars more affordable, but can leave you with poor excuse for guitar toan.\" You're using too much gain \n\"Cranking the gain and scooping the mid frequencies is a surefire way of making your guitar sound fantastic in your bedroom or in a guitar store. But use those settings while playing in a full band and listen to your guitar disappear. By turning down the gain, you can actually put back in some definition to your sound, and the result is a thicker, fuller toan.\"Image by the one and only UltimateGuizar .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:11:16.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
