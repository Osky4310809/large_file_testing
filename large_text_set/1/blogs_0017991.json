Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPeter Crouch has ­threatened a repeat of his robot dance if he reaches a century of Premier League goals today. \nThe Stoke striker goes into the clash against Manchester United on a hot streak having scored in each of his past three league games. \nShould he add to that total against United there is a chance he will mark the ­milestone with a reprise of his ­infamous England goal ­celebration from 2006 – as friends and Twitter followers have been demanding. \nThe bookies are offering odds of 3-1 the dance gets another airing and Crouch joked that he may cave in to the mounting calls. \n“I’ve had so many people asking me whether it will come back out when I get my 100th goal,” he said. \n“They’re saying if you get the 100th goal, you’ve got to do it. \n“The pressure is taking its toll, so maybe it will come out, we will see.

I’m sure I’ll dust it off at some stage.” \nCrouch, who turns 36 on January 30, bagged the first of his 36 Premier League goals for Stoke against United in September 2011. \nAnd the former Liverpool forward would love to score against them again today. \n“I remember it was from a corner and I’d take that again for my 100th goal,” he said. “That would be great. \n“I’ve always said we can beat anyone at home and we’ve proved that over the years. \n“Ever since I’ve been at the club, we always seem to get scalps at home and there’s no bigger one than Manchester United.” \nCrouch, who has 42 England caps, is Stoke’s ­comeback king. His career at the Potters appeared to be petering out until Mark Hughes started him against Liverpool three weeks ago.

Hughes has ­repeatedly tried to replace him with the likes of Joselu, Mame Diouf and Wilfried Bony, but 6ft 7in Crouch keeps elbowing them aside to reclaim his starting place. \nHughes has rewarded him with a 12-month contract extension, keeping him at the bet365 Stadium until June 2018, and says it would have been “crazy” to let him go. \n“He’s a credit to himself, his family and his profession,” added Hughes. \n“People questioned whether we should be giving another contract to a player of his age, but he has shown that he’s still as adept at this level as he’s ever been. \n“I felt it would be crazy to allow him to leave, because I knew he could still affect games in the Premier League. \n“He’s in the team on merit now. He comes in, does his work and shows everybody how good a player he is.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T11:15:59.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
