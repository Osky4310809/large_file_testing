Muriel and Bernard were reclusive and would keep themselves to themselves and disappear and go for walks within the UK.”\nShe added: “The evidence doesn’t disclose to the required standard of proof whether there was an intention by them to take their own lives or was indeed simply a tragic accident.”\nThe inquest was also held into the death of Scott Enion, of Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, after his body was also recovered.\nMs. Harding recorded a verdict of suicide after hearing that CCTV footage captured a figure jumping from the cliffs.\nThe inquest heard he had served in the British Army from 1988 to 1996, and was deployed to the Gulf during the first Gulf War in January 1991.\nDS Ward said: “He had spoken in the past that he had been bullied in the Army due to his racial background and he had considered suicide.”\n  This article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:42:11.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
