The company has introduced a new model that offers the same Intel Core i7 processor you get with the most expensive model, but it ditches the dGPU to become slightly more affordable.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com The most expensive Surface Book you can buy comes in at $3,199. For that, you get a sixth-generation Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB solid-state drive, and a dedicated NVIDIA graphics chip. But if you can do without dedicated graphics, you can now get the same machine without the NVIDIA dGPU for $2,999.\nWell, technically, you can’t get it just yet, because it’s out of stock on the Microsoft Store — as is the model with NVIDIA graphics. But it will become an option just as soon as Microsoft has units that it is ready to sell. For now, the machine is only listed on the U.S. store, so potential Surface Book owners in other countries will have to wait longer.\nAside from the missing NVIDIA graphics, the new Surface Book is the same as its high-end sibling inside and out. It ships with a Surface Pen and that gorgeous 13.5-inch PixelSense touchscreen, plus a 5-megapixel front-facing camera that lets you seamlessly login using Windows Hello and facial recognition.\nMicrosoft doesn’t state when the new Surface Book will be available to purchase, but its listing suggests stock will be in soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:30:48.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
