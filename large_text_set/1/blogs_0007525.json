Image copyright Poike Image caption The NSPCC said 'open and honest discussion' about online safety needs to be encouraged \nMargaret Gallagher of the NSPCC said it is impossible to publish a definitive list of texting phrases young people use as they tend to change frequently. \nHowever, she said anything that promotes \"open and honest discussion\" about keeping safe online is to be welcomed. \n\"Teenagers will always want to create coded language that can't be understood by their parents - it's natural and not necessarily something to get overly concerned about,\" said Ms Gallagher. \n\"Communication and building trust with your child is the most important thing. \n\"At the end of the day, you want them to feel comfortable coming to you if they're worried about something that's happened online, like an unsolicited approach or someone putting them in a vulnerable position. \n\"They (children) just need reassurance that, if things do go badly wrong, they have someone they can turn to.\" 'Predators are persistent' \nMs Gallagher also pointed out that children who have no behavioural issues are equally as vulnerable to online predators as those who do. \nBut she stressed that older teenagers, in particular, are entitled to privacy. \n\"It's not always easy for parents to get the balance right - we know that - but if there's trust and openness there, the risk of things going badly wrong is definitely reduced,\" she said. \nIf you want more information on keeping children safe online, you can visit the NSPCC website or call the charity free on 0808 800 5000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T09:16:57.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
