Adds another Gomez pal: “Selena knows Bella through Taylor [Swift] and her squad , but they’ve never been close.” \nAccording to the pal, Gomez and The Weeknd “met a while ago and connected over music.” While the duo’s fans will have to stay tuned to see if there’s a musical collaboration on the way, multiple sources say their romance is just starting to heat up. \n“It’s new and nothing serious yet,” says the Gomez source.
