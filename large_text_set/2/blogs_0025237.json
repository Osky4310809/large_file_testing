Cameras caught her pretending to nap on John Legend’s shoulder as Affleck took to the stage, and the multi-hyphenate’s fans instantly began speculating as to why, exactly, Teigen chose this exact moment to start her snoozing.\nLook at Chrissy Teigen back there pretending to sleep through Casey Affleck’s acceptance speech pic.twitter.com/nM7UgQ6Rl9 \n— Brandon Wall (@Walldo) February 27, 2017 Many felt that this was Teigen’s small, very funny way of making a statement — similar to Brie Larson’s stone-faced stare when Affleck won both the Oscar and the Golden Globe. Affleck was accused of sexually assaulting two women — a producer and a cinematographer – who worked with him on the film I’m Still Here back in 2010. And though Affleck has vehemently denied the allegations, many people are understandably disturbed — and angry at the Academy for honoring a man who has reportedly abused women.\nI share the sentiments of #chrissyteigen when #CaseyAffleck won best actor. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/00OkOMoFOv \n— Ally J (@allylive105) February 27, 2017 Teigen has been an ally for pro-social causes like Black Lives Matter and is a proud feminist , though some noted that her protest-nap might have had a simpler explanation: perhaps she thought Denzel Washington was robbed?\n. @chrissyteigen is all of us when Casey Affleck beat Denzel Washington for Best Actor. pic.twitter.com/Y7734x7m4U \n— cx cope (@cxcope) February 27, 2017 Regardless of whether Teigen was protesting Affleck’s alleged history of sexual abuse or his win over Washington’s superior performance in Fences , one thing remains clear: the woman is a goddamn hero.\nChrissy Teigen being a national hero once again during casey affleck's speech pic.twitter.com/raZfHFQvwd \n— laura (@daisyrdley) February 27, 2017 If “Best Performance by a Hilarious Model in a Napping Role” ever becomes a thing, Teigen will be a shoo-in for sure.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:08:27.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
