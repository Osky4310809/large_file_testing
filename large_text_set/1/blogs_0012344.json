Now we have another look at the phone thanks to a case maker’s renders. The Ghostek shock-resistant case for the Galaxy S8 is already up for grabs on mobilefun.co.uk . The listing gives us a good glimpse at what the phone would look like inside a case. \nThe renders show the Samsung Galaxy S8 with a dual-edged display with very narrow bezels on top and bottom, in line with the previous leak. The device appears to have volume rocker keys and power button placed on its left side. There’s no physical home button below the screen, which suggests that the fingerprint scanner will be placed beneath the screen. \nThe photos reveal a fairly large gap for the rear camera module. The render only reveals a single camera sensor, but looking at the size of the camera window, it could easily fit two camera sensors. \nThird-party accessories manufacturers often get early information about dimensions of unreleased devices in order to have their cases ready, so this seems like a likely mockup of the final product. If the rumour mill is to be believed, the Galaxy S8 will be unveiled at an event on April 18th, but we could catch a glimpse of the device before that at MWC next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T16:35:20.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
