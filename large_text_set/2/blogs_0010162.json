She’s an uber-talented songwriter, dancer, singer, activist, and performer. Forbes named her one of the highest-paid celebrities in 2015, and she has been known to snag an £85,250 Alexander McQueen gown in a bid at auction. NBD.\nSo should it really shock us that Lady Gaga rocked $863 worth of makeup during the Superbowl ? Game Face: get @LadyGaga’s winning #SB51 makeup look using #MarcJacobsBeauty. ⠀ ⠀ @sarahtannomakeup used #CoconutPrimer, Genius Gel, #InstaMarc Contour Powder, #AirBlush in Lush & Libido, Twinkle Pop Eye Stick in Au Revoir, #Highliner Gel Eye Crayon in Violet Femme + Blacquer, Magic Marc’er Liquid Eyeliner in Blacquer, new Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon in Pink Of Me, #VelvetNoir Major Volume Mascara, #LeMarc Lip Crème in Dashing + Enamored with Hot Hot Hot. \nA photo posted by Marc Jacobs Beauty (@marcbeauty) on Feb 5, 2017 at 6:06pm PST \nWell, yes and no. No, because you’d think her daily moisturizer — you know, the kind one haphazardly tosses into one’s work purse — is made of diamonds and gemstones. But also yes , definitely yes , because most people rack up hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of makeup over time (lots of time, and lots of shameless binges) — not all in one go. But this is Lady Gaga, and she just killed it in front of more than 111 million human beings. So she can do what she wants.\nS U P E R B O W L LI getting ready with @ladygaga and @marcbeauty #superbowl #halftime #ladygaga #superbowl51 #marcjacobsbeauty #makeup #sarahtannomakeup @nfl #nfl #lipstick in Dashing #BeautyBreakdown to come \nA photo posted by Sarah Nicole Tanno (@sarahtannomakeup) on Feb 5, 2017 at 5:55pm PST \nSo, what sort of expensive, crazy beauty ritual went down? First off, it was pulled off by makeup artist Sarah Tanno, who used Marc Jacobs products exclusively. One of the cheapest items was MJ’s Lip Lock Moisture Balm , which sits at a cool $24, just about six times the price of a drugstore chapstick. And the priciest? The $99 About Last Night Style Eye Con No. 20 Eye Shadow Palette .\nAll in all, each of the items were fairly affordable (and by “fairly” we mean “kind of a splurge.”)\n\nThen there was also the below look, which took dozens of tiny crystals. It felt refreshingly like the weirdo, early-career Lady Gaga we fell in love with. The unapologetic, out-of-left-field, masquerading mother monster. That’s why we loved her — she wasn’t preoccupied with the standards or what was “normal” or typically sexy. She brought that same power and strength to the game field.\n#ladygaga I love you \nA photo posted by Sarah Nicole Tanno (@sarahtannomakeup) on Feb 6, 2017 at 11:10am PST \nSo, in total, Gaga rocked lots of eye makeup — liner, shadow, mascara — from 11 different MJ sources. Don’t even try to say you haven’t played with about seven different eyeshadow colors on a night out! The only difference is that we’re usually scraping out the last bit of Half Baked from the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette, rather than playing with the whole Marc Jacobs aisle…\nQuick Change makeup on the worlds biggest stage... I got you @ladygaga #SB51 #sarahtannomakeup #ladygaga @thewallgroup \nA photo posted by Sarah Nicole Tanno (@sarahtannomakeup) on Feb 7, 2017 at 1:04pm PST \nIncredible performance, as always, Lady Gaga. And gorgeous makeup, Sarah Tonno!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:43:02.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
