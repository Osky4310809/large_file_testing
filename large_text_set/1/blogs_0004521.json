King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 11 hours ago 9 Lars Ulrich recently talked about the \"M.O.\" of his drum playing, stressing the importance of putting the overall vibe ahead of demonstrating technical abilities.The drummer told Chris Jericho about being \"the Ringo Starr of metal\": \"[Playing what suits the song the best has] kind of been my M.O. for most of Metallica's career.\"Mr. Ulrich then explained how after the \" Ride the Lightning \" phase the group finally got a bit of time to rest, at which point Kirk Hammett went to take guitar lessons from Joe Satriani.Lars followed Kirk's steps in a way, opting to also take a few lessons - his first drum lessons ever - from \"one of Satriani's guys,\" starting a phase where he actually felt pressured to deliver more technically-intricate performances.He explained: \"I went through a period that probably culminated on the ' Justice ' album, where I felt sort of compelled to try to show ability. When you've got Dave Lombardo and Charlie Benante breathing down your back - I tried to step it up a bit, do my own thing, and do some crazy shit.\"I would come up with drum riffs and drum ideas, that Hetfield would write riffs to, like ' ...And Justice for All ' [song] - but I was trying really hard to push the drums into the foreground. And then after a year or two of that I was like, 'Seriously? Just do your thing. Chill out, support the riffs, just do what's best for the song.'\"So since around late '80s, the only thing that's really interested me is just doing the best thing for the song. Sitting and doing kind of the Phil Rudd four-on-the-floor, when it calls for that. That's what I really love to do, to make James' riffs swing, and make it kind of bounce. I just sort of of turned a corner, where I stopped being interested in doing 32s standing upside down, backwards, fucking Lombardo style. It's like, let Lombardo be Lombardo, and I'll just kind of do my own thing.\"Everybody goes through periods of that kind of thing, and I got mine out of my system pretty early. And for the last 25-30 years it's just been more about making it swing and that's what I'm happy to do. People can say what they want...\"Lars then touched on being replaced by Dave Lombardo and Joey Jordison for the Download Festival performance back in 2004 after suffering an anxiety seizure, admitting he felt a bit threatened.\"I have to say that lying in a hospital room in Hamburg, Germany while Dave Lombardo was up on stage - that was not one of life's most fun moments,\" he said with a laugh. \"It's like, uh, okay... I was on the phone with James, 'James, if I leave now I'll find a plane, I'll be there in a couple hours.' James was like, 'Just get some chill time, stay in bed, you need to recover and recuperate, and get whatever it is that's going on out of your body, and I'll see you in two days.'\"He jokingly added: \"'J mes man, I'm cooooming! Don't leave me!' It all just caught up to me. Just stop in your tracks and lay the fuck down, chill the fuck out, and we'll get back to you in a couple days.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T10:35:37.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
