They will face 27-1 Wauseon -- a 42-35 winner over Columbus Eastmoor Academy -- at 10:45 a.m. Saturday back at Ohio State’s Schottenstein Center. His play followed a steal by senior point guard Jon Williams that forced a jump ball with 26 seconds left. Until that point, Trotwood (26-3) tried to hold for the last shot. The Rams ran off the clock from 1:22, after Williams had hit the tying free throws, to set up the closing sequence. \nSTVM coach Dru Joyce sat at a podium afterward and paused. He fought back tears before praising his two senior guards. Graves has one more game left with Joyce until his basketball career continues at Buffalo. Williams will soon leave for Robert Morris. \n“These two guys … couldn’t ask for better leadership,” Joyce said. “They played with such heart. It’s going to be hard to see them go, but we still got work to do.” \nJoyce’s words came as the rest of his team celebrated in its locker room — the same locker room where the Irish cried following last year’s state championship loss to New Concord John Glenn. \n“They’re celebrating maybe a little too much right now,” Joyce said as screaming reverberated through the walls. \nThis one wasn’t just about returning to the state championship game. Trotwood, ranked second in The Associated Press Division II state poll , beat STVM by 39 points earlier this season. Joyce called it the worst loss of his coaching career. \nAnd he abandoned his team’s normal pressing defensive strategy for zones in the rematch. \n“I’m not a zone guy,” Joyce said. “I probably should zone a little more, but we always work on it on and off during the season.” \nThe adjustment forced Trotwood, which averaged 91 points per game, to just 36.8 percent shooting. Standout senior guard Torrey Patton finished with 34 points, a state semifinal record that eclipsed Bill Cain’s 33 for Columbus St. Charles in 1992. \nIt still couldn’t push the Rams to their first state final since 2006. \n“We knew we weren’t going to play the same team that we played a few months ago,” Trotwood coach Rocky Rockhold said. “They came off a trip to play us, they were going on another trip after us. I don’t put a lot of stock in games that happen in mid-January. We certainly didn’t come in here thinking we’d win by 40.” \nRockhold left Schottenstein Center convinced his team just did not finish. Had the game entered overtime, he was certain they would have won. \nTrotwood held multiple four-point leads in the final quarter after it trailed for much of the second and third. Graves said the difference this time was defense and rebounding. \n“We didn’t give up second chance shots. We emphasized that this week,” he said. \nGraves had 10 rebounds, the most for any STVM player. Sophomore forward Lunden McDay added 15 points, while senior Justin Sampson scored 11. Williams added seven points, seven assists and two steals. \nHis last one allowed Graves to make a play. Even if he wasn’t sure that chance would come. \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
