The country decided that we should leave the European Union . It was a very serious vote.” \nThe battle now, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, was to persuade Theresa May to go for a Brexit that would not damage the UK economy. \n“The question is how do we best fight for that? In our view we have to do as instructed and vote to leave the European Union, but actually the fight begins now,” Thornberry said. \n“Theresa May has put forward a contradictory vision. She has talked about having the fullest possible access to the single market, unimpeded by tariffs and red tape. And we agree with her – that’s the vision we have. \n“But she also has an alternative vision, where she said that if she didn’t get the deal she wanted, we would be free to set competitive tax rates and … change the basis of Britain’s economic model.” \nThe decision over how to handle the Brexit legislation is also causing angst for Jeremy Corbyn as dozens of Labour MPs prepare to rebel against a three-line whip ordering them to support the triggering of article 50. \nClive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, has said he will vote with the government on Brexit on Wednesday but will not back the two-clause bill next week if Labour fails to secure any amendments to it. \nIf Labour maintains a three-line whip in that situation he could become the second shadow cabinet member to resign, after Jo Stevens – with speculation also surrounding another frontbencher, Rachael Maskell. \nAnd in a letter, seen by the Guardian, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, admitted that people have urged him to consider resigning his frontbench post to reflect the 75% remain vote in his London constituency – Holborn and St Pancras. \nWhile Labour has tabled a series of amendments to the article 50 bill on issues including a meaningful final parliamentary vote over the Brexit deal, a lack of support from pro-remain Conservatives mean none are likely to pass. \n“Let’s see what happens,” Thornberry said when asked about the amendments. “But we will be doing everything that we can to ensure that we get these amendments. \n“The prime minister does not have a democratic mandate to do whatever she likes with our country. Yes, the public have voted to leave. They have not voted for the contradictory ideas that Theresa May has, and they certainly haven’t voted for her to break the British economic model.” \nThornberry confirmed, however, that the three-line whip would remain in place even if no amendments were passed: “We have said consistently, since the result, that we will not frustrate the will of the British people, and they want to leave.” \nSources told the Guardian that May is planning to publish the government’s Brexit white paper on Thursday. They said the prime minister may make one further concession first to avoid Tory backbenchers lining up with opposition parties to vote for amendments. They suggested May is minded to agree to report back to parliament on the progress on Brexit negotiations four times a year. \nThe Brexit bill, forced on the government by a supreme court ruling , triggered a passionate hours-long debate in parliament on Tuesday in which MPs from all parties clashed over the question of Britain’s exit from the EU. \nAmong the estimated 90 MPs voting against the bill will be Kenneth Clarke. The veteran Conservative delivered an impassioned speech to colleagues on Tuesday about his decision, accusing the Conservative party that he has represented for almost five decades of becoming anti-immigrant. \nClarke told colleagues that even his former colleague Enoch Powell, best known for his infamous “ Rivers of Blood speech”, would be surprised to see what had become of the Tories. \n“If he was here he would probably find it amazing to believe that his party had become Eurosceptic and rather mildly anti-immigrant in a strange way in 2016,” he said. “I’m afraid on that I haven’t followed them and I don’t intend to do so.” \nIn his speech, Clarke, a lifelong Europhile, dismissed the “pathetic” arguments of both the leave and remain campaigns in June’s referendum, citing the promise of £350m for the NHS each week and the threat of a post-Brexit punishment budget as among the “dafter” ideas. \nHe also mocked the optimism of Brexit supporters, saying: “Apparently you follow the rabbit down the hole and you emerge in a wonderland where suddenly countries around the world are queuing up to give us trading advantages and access to their markets that previously we had never been able to achieve as part of the European Union . \n“Nice men like President Trump and President Erdoğan are just impatient to abandon their normal protectionism and give us access.” \nThe Brexit secretary, David Davis, opened the debate by urging MPs to deliver the will of the people. He said the “point of no return” had already passed , adding that there would be “no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it by the back door and no second referendum”. \nDavis said people were watching to see if politicians would keep their word. “Now we must honour our side of the agreement to vote to deliver on the result. We are considering a very simple question: Do we trust the people or not?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:15:31.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
