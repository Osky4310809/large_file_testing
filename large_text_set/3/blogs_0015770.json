ADVERTISEMENT \n“I’m really taking care of my body now,” added the 35-year-old, whom the Painters acquired from Star in exchange for franchise player Paul Lee. “I’m not getting any younger.” \nAfter a 99-95 overtime win over Mahindra on Sunday, Yap finished the week with an average of 19 points built around a total of eight triples. He beat out Meralco’s Baser Amer and Chris Newsome for the PBA Press Corps’ Player of the Week award. \nYap has given coach Caloy Garcia a lot of options offensively, and this could help open up the middle for Taggert.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:41:19.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
