So far, only selected partners have been able to publish apps for Daydream , which really limited the amount of available content. Now, that is about to change. In a note posted in the Google Play Developer Console as well as in an email sent to Daydream Access Program partners, Google announced that it has opened up the Daydream Access Program (DAP) to all developers.\nThis is great news, as every developer can now publish an app or a game to the Daydream platform via Play. All of them will have to go through the usual approval process first, to make sure that they are compatible with Google’s requirements. The online search giant said in its Daydream guidelines that apps and games have to maintain high performance in order provide a comfortable experience as well as use the Daydream controller for user interaction.\nSee also: Samsung says more than 5 million Gear VR headsets have shipped 3 weeks ago Allowing all developers to publish apps and games to the Daydream platform will rapidly increase the amount of content that is available. This will make the Daydream platform a lot more appealing to consumers and will probably boost sales of the Daydream View headset as well.\nBut it is worth mentioning that the lack of content isn’t the only thing that’s holding Google’s Daydream back at the moment. The headset is currently only compatible with a few phones including, among a few others, Google’s own Pixel and Pixel XL , and Lenovo’s Moto Z . We expect that other manufacturers will soon announce more Daydream-ready smartphones, which is essential for the growth of the VR platform.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T16:51:59.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
