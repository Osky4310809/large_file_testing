At the end, the president-elect and Graydon Carter shook hands.” \nReportedly the editors spoke to Trump on a variety of topics including climate change, abortion, and issues regarding Russia and Vladimir Putin. \nAfter the election Trump called Vanity Fair “dead” and mentioned their “really low numbers,” while naming Carter on Twitter. \n“Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out,” Trump tweeted. \nHas anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead!
