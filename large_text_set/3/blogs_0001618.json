If he is not done, then he’s at least very firmly in a new era of his career, one where he’ll either be a close-to-average cornerback or perhaps a corner-turned-safety as he enters his mid-30s. \nIt is the way of life in the NFL, a league buoyed by the influx of cheap, young talent every year, and a league that makes it very difficult for non-quarterbacks to make a tremendous amount of money in their careers. \nOn that point, however, Revis has managed to be the exception. From the moment he entered the league, Revis has been about one thing above all else: Getting the most money he possibly could get from the New York Jets. Of course, there is a performance component to that quest, and in that endeavor, Revis excelled for quite some time. Hence, the hefty salaries. \nYet now, in the wake of the Jets unceremoniously cutting ties with Revis after just two seasons of what was supposed to be a glorious reunion, there is one funny factoid about New York’s second football team and the all-time great corner. \nThe Jets employed Revis from the time he was 22 years old until he was 27 years old. He suffered a concussion and then a torn knee after playing just two games in that age 27 season, so really they only had him from ages 22 through 26. They then traded him to Tampa Bay, where he played for a year before being picked up by the Patriots at age 29. \nIt was then that the Jets pounced on the free agent, violating tampering rules along the way in a frenzy to get their star back on the roster. \nThey succeeded, getting him for his age 30 and 31 seasons. \nThe humorous part, if you’re one who can enjoy a laugh or two at the Jets’ expense, is this: the Jets paid Revis over $96 million in his career, and that’s without having him on the roster for what is generally considered the prime of a player’s career. They had him as a rising star, and they had him as an older (occasionally washed-up-looking) veteran, and they paid a premium for it.

And the Patriots paid him just $12 million for 2014, which turned out to be Revis’ final season as a true No. 1 cornerback. \nHere’s a look at how that broke down by year in terms of cash earned (numbers from Spotrac): \nJETS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:28:51.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
