QB Jared Goff \nGoff finished his 2016 campaign with an 0-7 record. He threw for 1,089 yards and five touchdowns with seven interceptions. \nHis somewhat low passing completion percentage (54.6%) and his high number of fumbles (5) are something to improve on going into next season. \nIf the Rams want to be competitive next season, Goff needs to improve and show he has the ability to be a difference-maker.

CB Mike Jordan \nJordan got called up from the practice squad late in the season and played in the final five games. \nHe recorded 20 combined tackles, including 15 solo tackles and five assisted tackles in those games. If Jordan can improve this offseason, he looks to be a good backup, providing needed depth in the secondary. Related: Los Angeles Rams new defensive back is literally named Michael Jordan 3. WR Pharoh Cooper \nWith veteran receiver Kenny Britt likely to leave the team via free agency, providing quarterback Jared Goff with weapons on offense is an even greater priority this offseason. \nWhile the Rams will likely address the issue in either free agency or the draft, Cooper presents a good in-house backup option additionally. \nHe had his best game of the year in the season finale against the Arizona Cardinals, catching four of six targets for 36 yards with a long of 23 yards.

TE Tyler Higbee \nHigbee, drafted by the Rams in the fourth round of last yearâ€™s draft, finished the season with 11 catches for 85 yards and one touchdown. \nHe saw more targets on average in the final seven games of the season with Goff under center, which points to him being another potential weapon for Goff on offense.
