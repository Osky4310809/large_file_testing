(Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Jacksonville Jaguars have their  , and it’s not Chip Kelly. \nThe team announced Wednesday it is retaining Nathaniel Hackett, who replaced Greg Olson in the role on an interim basis midway through this past season under former coach Gus Bradley. \nThe announcement comes two days after Kelly was in the Jaguars’ building, presumably to discuss the coordinator role. ESPN has reported the Jaguars also interviewed him for their head coaching job before deciding to promote Doug Marrone from interim coach instead. \nHackett, 37, previously served as OC under Marrone at Syracuse and with the Buffalo Bills. \nDespite a 3-13 finish, the Jaguars opted to stay in-house for their head coach (Marrone),   (Hackett) and defensive coordinator (Todd Wash). They did change up the organization’s power structure, hiring Tom Coughlin to oversee football operations. \nSo, Kelly’s comeback apparently will have to happen someplace else. The San Francisco 49ers fired him as head coach Jan. 1, hours completing a 2-14 season, and a little over a year after the Philadelphia Eagles fired Kelly late in his third season there. \nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero . \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL divisional playoff weekend Facebook Posted!
