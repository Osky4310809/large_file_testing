Trump plans to run foreign policy without the professionals Right-wingers have hated the State Department since the days of Joe McCarthy, but never has it been so abandoned Topics: Communism , Donald Trump , Foreign Affairs , Foreign policy , Jared Kushner , Joe McCarthy , Joseph McCarthy , Newt Gingrich , Rex Tillerson , Right-wing media , Steve Bannon , Trump Administration , Trump Foreign Policy , U.S. State Department , News , Politics News Joseph McCarthy; Rex Tillerson (Credit: AP/William J. Smith/Patsy Lynch) \nSalon’s Matthew Rosza reported Monday on the incredible shrinking man, Rex Tillerson, the formerly larger-than-life Exxon CEO turned secretary of state who — despite a high level of interest in the Trump administration’s new foreign policy — has barely been seen since he was sworn in. Nobody knows whether Tillerson is just keeping out of the eye of the Trump tornado or whether he’s been sidelined by the White House in favor of the “shadow secretary,” President Donald Trump’s 35-year old son-in-law Jared Kushner. Whatever the case, it’s unusual. The department is said to be rudderless and demoralized, carrying on without any sense of direction or purpose. \nMonday was supposed to be the first State Department briefing since President Obama’s final day in office, but it was canceled because of the announcement of Trump’s new travel ban. One would think that would be an excellent day to begin, but apparently the administration doesn’t want the Department of State meddling in foreign affairs. The lack of these briefings is one more oddity in the new Trump regime. They’ve been held at State every day since the Eisenhower administration, and for a specific purpose. Such briefings are the main method of disseminating the government’s diplomatic agenda abroad. There may not be more than a handful of American reporters and C-SPAN junkies who watch them, but they are closely watched all over the world by foreign governments. It’s been radio silence since Jan. 19 . \nThe administration says they will begin the briefings again and has hired “Fox & Friends” Heather Nauert to lead them so perhaps all of this is nothing but more inefficiency and bad management. Reports coming out of the department are dismal. \nThe Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe wrote an in-depth piece on the current state of State and it’s rather shocking. She describes a department where people wander around without any work to do, no visitors come in to the building, key staffers are left out of the loop and no requests for analysis or information are forthcoming from the White House. People spend their days sending out résumés in anticipation of Trump’s promise to deliver a cut of more than 30 percent cut to department staff. \nIn some ways, this should not be such a huge surprise. Trump is clueless, of course. He can’t run the Oval Office much less oversee the executive branch. But modern conservatives have long been skeptical of the State Department and have sought to limit its influence for many decades. \nThe famous espionage case of Alger Hiss who had been a high-ranking official involved in the Yalta conference (another right wing bugaboo ) and the creation of the United Nations after World War II, focused anti-communist attention on the State Department in the late 1940s. That set the table for the next phase of the Red Scare in 1950, when Sen. Joseph McCarthy launched his famous crusade in Wheeling, West Virginia, by waving around a piece of paper and declaring that it was “a list of 205″ State Department employees known to the secretary of state as communists. In later public pronouncements, McCarthy’s number would vary: Was it 57 commies, 81 or maybe just 10? He never produced a name. \nMcCarthy went on to smear much of the rest of the government and even the military before he was through, helpedevery step of the way by his ally Richard Nixon and his lawyer Roy Cohn — who also happens to have been Donald Trump’s mentor. What a small world. \nThroughout the Cold War the right wing remained suspicious of the State Department with its squishy mandate for treaties and diplomacy, which they believed was a weak way to face the Evil Empire. When the Soviet Union broke up, they lost that rationale, but quickly replaced it with new ones. \nAfter the war in Iraq started to sour in the summer of 2003, disgraced former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, being the cunning propagandist he is, wrote an essay for Foreign Policy called “Rogue State Department” which placed the blame where the right always places it. The subhead was this evergreen conservative riff: “Anti-American sentiment is rising unabated around the globe because the U.S. State Department has abdicated values and principles in favor of accommodation and passivity.” The Christian Coalition’s Pat Robertson even got into a spot of trouble for musing on his show, “maybe we need a very small nuke thrown off on Foggy Bottom to shake things up like Newt Gingrich wants to do.” (Foggy Bottom is the Washington neighborhood west of the White House where State has long had its headquarters.) \nBy the 2016 campaign the conservative movement had gone back to its roots with conspiracy-theory claims that the State Department had been infiltrated by the Muslim Brotherhood, led by Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. It’s always something. \nOne might assume that this pattern informs the Trump administration. But even though the president is weirdly smearing Obama for alleged McCarthyism (while simultaneously planning to purge the government of suspected disloyal employees ), he doesn’t really operate by the normal right-wing playbook. As much as conservatives have battled with the Dtate Department for being too passive, no Republican administration ever actually shut it down. \nTrump has no idea what the State Department does, and in any case he’s too busy ranting on Twitter to bother with it. His close associates are almost all novices without a deep connection to conservative movement history or philosophy, so the abandonment of the State Department is most likely attributable to Tillerson’s lack of experience and Steve Bannon’s chilling if half-baked plan for the “ deconstruction of the administrative state .” \nIoffe quoted a mid-level State officer in her piece in her Atlantic article who said, “They really want to blow this place up. I don’t think this administration thinks the State Department needs to exist. They think Jared [Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law] can do everything. It’s reminiscent of the developing countries where I’ve served. The family rules everything, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs knows nothing.” \nBut this isn’t a developing country. This is the U.S. State Department, and these are career government employees who’ve been through many transitions and have never seen anything like this. The planet’s only superpower and guarantor of global security for more than 70 years has abruptly withdrawn from its diplomatic role in the world, without any plan to replace it.
