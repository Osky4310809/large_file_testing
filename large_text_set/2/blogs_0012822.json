However, in a contest loaded with future NBA standouts, Oden was the best player on the court. He had 25 points and 12 rebounds against the Gators in what ended up being his final collegiate game. \nOden was then the No. 1 overall pick of the 2007 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers and was billed as a can't-miss prospect. Texas product Kevin Durant was selected No. 2 by the Seattle SuperSonics. \nDue to a series of injuries, Oden's professional career quickly fizzled out. He missed his entire rookie season (2007-08) with a knee injury (microfrature surgery). \nThen he played in 61 games in 2008-09 and averaged 8.9 points, 7 rebounds and 1.1 blocks. Nothing stellar, but it looked like he was coming around. There was little doubt that if he could stay healthy, he could still be a very good NBA player. \nHowever, he couldn't stay healthy. \nOden began the 2009-10 season strong, averaging 11.1 points, 8.5 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. But 21 games into the year, he suffered another serious knee injury that ended what looked to be his breakout season. Oden said about the injury: \"It literally split my kneecap in half.\" \nOuch. \nHe didn't play in the NBA again until 2013-14, and by then he was a shell of his former self. As a backup for the Miami Heat, Oden played in 23 games, and averaged 2.9 points, 2.3 rebounds and 0.6 blocks. \nAnd that was all she wrote for Oden's NBA career. Three seasons (spread over seven years), 105 games, and averages of 8 points, 6.2 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game. \nSam Bowie, who was also drafted by the Trail Blazers (ahead of someone named Michael Jordan in 1984), you are finally off the hook. \nThat's right, today, even Oden considers himself the \"biggest bust in NBA history.\" \nOden, who has returned to Ohio State to finish his degree and be a student assistant coach for OSU's basketball team, was featured on ESPN's Outside the Lines Sunday morning and had several interesting comments. Here is a compilation, including his thoughts on his battles with alcohol abuse: \n** \"Basketball-wise, I would love to keep on playing. But I think you need to be able to run up and down the floor. And with my knees dragging my big body, it's just not going that way right now.\" \n** \"I drank because I had a bad game (during the 2008-09 season). But then, I would drink because I had a good game, to celebrate. I didn't know how to handle it. It was a situation I was put in, No. 1 draft pick, all these expectations.\" \n** \"I know I didn't limit myself when I started drinking, and that's definitely a problem. ... It is alcoholic.\" \n** \"It (being released by the Trail Blazers) brought me down to some low places. Guys played more games in one season than I played my entire career spread out over five years, with nothing but pain pills and alcohol. That's all I had. The lowest point was realizing it took two Vicodin, two Percocets and a bunch of drinks just to go to sleep every night.\" \n** \"I don't feel like I was that bad when I was on the court (in the NBA). And I feel like it could have just got better if I had more time on there.\" \n** \"I've been through a lot. I guess I can say it's a lot. I'm still only 28; I'm still young. I'm going to get my degree. And I'm going to be around and be a part of this Ohio State program.\" \nAnd here are two notable comments from Ohio State head coach Thad Matta during the Outside the Lines piece: \n\"He and LeBron (James) are probably the two, coming out of high school, that were the best I've ever seen.\" \n\"I thought (Oden) was probably going to be the best center to ever play the game of basketball.\" \nWhat's next for the Buckeyes?
