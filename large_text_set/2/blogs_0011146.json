Now a couple of official-looking press renders of the Huawei P10 have hit the interwebs courtesy of Evan Blass aka @evleaks . In addition, the device recently received its FCC certification, which has revealed its battery capacity. \nThe Huawei P10’s new leaked renders show a design similar to what we posted recently. The phone appears to flaunt a metal unibody design with a front-facing fingerprint sensor, which is expected to hide a fingerprint sensor beneath. The device will get two cameras at the back, aided by a laser autofocus system and a dual-tone LED flash. \nAs for the FCC certification, the listing on the regulator’s website suggests that the Huawei P10 will sport a 3,100mAh battery, which is slightly bigger than its predecessor. The phone will also come with dual SIM slots, which is hardly a surprise. \nAs per the earlier reports, the Huawei P10 will flaunt a 5.2-inch display, and will be powered by a Kirin 960 processor, mated to 4GB or 6GB of RAM. The phone’s bigger sibling, the Huawei P10 Plus is expected to sport a 5.5-inch display and come in an 8GB RAM variant as well. The new Huawei flagships will go official at the company’s pre-MWC event on February 26th, and we’ll be on the floor to bring you all the details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:14:28.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
