While there's already a Ferrari World in Dubai, this is the first park of its kind in Europe.\nSEE ALSO: Disney is building an 'Avatar' theme park and it looks unreal\nRides at the park will aim to live up to the car's famous name in speed and design. For one, there's the Vertical Accelerator, which is the tallest roller coaster in Europe at 368 feet high and reaches up to 112 miles per hour in just five seconds, Conde Nast Traveler reports.\nOther rides go beyond just high speeds, like the Bounce-Back Tower which, like its name suggests, creates movements that feel like jumpy engine pistons.\n¿Sabías solo quedan 73 días para la apertura de #FerrariLand ?

A faux Italian village will be featured at the park, with select Formula One cars and various models along its street. Italian recipes also make up much of the park's food , from quick snacks to the offerings at Trattoria, a recreation of the \"favorite restaurant\" of Formula 1 drivers in Maranello. And there will even be a reproduction of the Ferrari production line, creating a scene right out of its factory.\nVisitors can purchase tickets for Ferrari Land and PortAventura, its host park, for $55 (or £52) per adult with access to both parks on the same day.\nBONUS: Ikea is now selling a bicycle — and it looks just as pretty as their furniture", "external_links": ["https://t.co/PLEHNvnKDM", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fitur2017?src=hash", "https://t.co/Ym6Ppd4RdN", "https://twitter.com/Astal_Videos/status/820629101425950722", "https://ferrariland.portaventuraworld.com/en/restaurants", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FerrariLand?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Portaventura_ES/status/821691983391375360", "https://t.co/Y6iamxXiHM", "https://twitter.com/PortAventuraBE/status/823567028086775808", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/7C9HrSIx.m3u8", "https://t.co/Z9lyXOlyi3", "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/portaventura-world-production-files/wilson_cms/documents/documents/000/004/078/original/NdP_Ferrari_Land_FITUR_2017_EN.pdf?1484917392", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/7C9HrSIx.jpg", "http://www.cntraveler.com/story/spains-new-ferrari-land-is-disney-world-for-car-fanatics?mbid=social_facebook"], "published": "2017-01-27T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T02:49:43.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
