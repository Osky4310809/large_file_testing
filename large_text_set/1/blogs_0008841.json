His latest output comes courtesy of Alicia Keys, who has just shared a track titled “Sweet F’in Love” which features Kaytranada on production duties. Listen to it below.\n\nThe track is deceptively simple; built around little more than a looping keyboard line and Keys’ silky-soft voice chanting the title like her life depends on it. The production is classic Kaytranada, with warm pockets of synthesizer gushing in between the patches of more traditional instrumentation. It was uploaded last night by Swiss Beatz (Keys’ husband), because he seemingly knew that the world needed a great sex jam to kick off the new year.\nLast year saw both Kaytranada and Keys release studio albums, 99.9% and Here respectively. Revisit Keys’ video for “Blended Family” featuring A$AP Rocky below.\n\nIn other music news, Travis Scott has just shared a new track that may possibly appear on the long-awaited Astroworld . Listen to it right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T10:39:06.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
