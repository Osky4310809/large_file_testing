It’s a new year now and many of us are looking to take it easy on our bodies (at least for the first month), after what seemed like months of indulging in all kinds of food. If you already have a plan for what you’re going to eat, what else can you do to treat your body (and yourself) to something good? You can always grab a bottle of juice, but that can get expensive. Why not try making your own tonic? Tonics are drinks that have a base in alternative medicine and can include ingredients that do your body good like turmeric , ginger , kombucha , and more. If you’re also interested in how you can alkalize your body in the morning, we have tips for that, too. \nNeed to give your body a break? Tired of green smoothies? Then, these 10 tonics are the best way to start the new year right. 1. Turmeric Glow Lemonade \nThis Turmeric Glow Lemonade is a game-changer, mostly because it’s so lemony and a little bit spicy with a touch of sweetness. Refreshing and thirst-quenching like no other. You can mix this up in 30 seconds. Drink it any time of day, when your body is thirsty for a drink that’s a step up from water. 2. Tulsi Chai Concentrate \nForget the café — tea made with your very own Tulsi Chai Concentrate will be your new chilly day companion. Fresh ginger, cardamom, star anise, and other warm, spicy spices are crushed to release their oils, then boiled together to make a concentrate that will create the best chai tea you’ve ever tasted. The special ingredient here is tulsi — also known as holy basil — which has a spicy, peppery, clove-like flavor. You can use your homemade concentrate to make hot tea, cold tea, or espresso drinks like dirty chai. 3. Fizzy Coconut, Lime, and Mint Kombucha Elixir \nThis Fizzy Coconut, Lime, and Mint Kombucha Elixir tastes amazing, looks beautiful, is hydrating, nourishing, and full of healthy probiotics! Give it a try at home and impress friends with this pretty mocktail. It’s the perfect refreshing beverage to accompany weekend brunch. 4. Iced Dandelion Latte \nThis Iced Dandelion Latte is a detoxifying drink that is much healthier than iced coffee. It is made with roasted dandelion root tea which gives it a rich and full-bodied flavor and sweetened with stevia. Iced Dandelion Latte is flavored with a little bit of vanilla, a splash of organic soy milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon. 5. Soy Milk Kefir \nIt seems like everyone these days is crazy for kefir, a creamy fermented milk drink that is full of probiotics. If you love the idea of kefir, but you don’t love dairy, try making your own version at home … with soy milk! This two-ingredient Soy Milk Kefir is as simple as can be (seriously, you don’t really have to do much thanks to the magic of fermentation), and the result is slightly thick, perfectly tangy, and full of goodness for your gut. If you are soy-averse, try experimenting with other types of non-dairy milks and see which one you like the best! You can find ready-to-drink water kefir at your local health food store. 6. Healthy Alcohol-Free Champagne \nThis Healthy Alcohol-Free Champagne will be your new best friend if you like celebrating life without the alcohol intake. Not only it’s easier than making a cocktail but it will help replenish minerals and electrolytes. Your body will love you for that! Cheers! 7. Energizing Turmeric Tea \nDefeat the post-New Year slump with this Energizing Turmeric Tea , with warm spices and creamy coconut milk! Turmeric has been used in India for centuries for its anti-inflammatory properties; it’s also an antioxidant. In this simple smoothie, fresh turmeric is blended with matcha, cinnamon and warm spices, coconut cream, and water. Serve it warm to chase away the cold! 8. Ginger Elixir: An Ayurvedic Digestive Drink \nThis Ginger Elixir is an easy to make Ayurvedic beverage, best to have during fall and winter season. Ginger acts wonders to fire up our digestive system. Good digestion is the cornerstone of health and well-being according to Ayurveda. When our digestive system is working well, we absorb all the necessary nutrients from the food we eat, enjoy healthy circulation and have a good robust immunity to diseases. 9. Chaga Mushroom Tea: Chai and Vanilla \nChaga mushrooms have amazing healing properties and you can experience the benefits in tea form, like in this Chaga Mushroom Tea . This is a two-for-one kind of recipe: you can brew your chaga with whole spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, and others to make chai or you can brew it with vanilla stevia to make a simple, sweet vanilla tea. You can serve either flavor hot or iced, so you can enjoy it no matter what time of year it is. 10. The Easy Way to Make Your Own Kombucha \n\nWhat’s something else you can do? Learn The Easy Way to Make Your Own Kombucha ! Making your own delicious kombucha is super easy, nutritious, and saves you a ton of money since you won’t be buying all those bottles.
