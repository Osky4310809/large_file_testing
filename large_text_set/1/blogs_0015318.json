You can check out the Defenders photos in the gallery below. \nIn addition, Ritter spoke to EW about Jessica Jones and Daredevil’s relationship in the series, calling it a “cat-and-mouse” dynamic, and when asked who was the cat and who was the mouse, she replied: \n“It switches back and forth, to be honest. No one’s best friends in all of the Defenders. This is a reluctant team-up.” \nThe Defenders stars Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones, Mike Colter as Luke Cage and Finn Jones as Danny Rand/Iron Fist. In addition, Elden Henson will be reprising as Foggy Nelson along with Deborah Ann Woll as Karen Page, Eka Darville as Malcolm, Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth, Scott Glenn as Stick, Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing, Elodie Yung as Elektra, Rachael Taylor as Trish Walker, Simone Missick as Misty Knight, and Rosario Dawson as Claire Temple. It has been hinted that Jon Bernthal’s The Punisher will return for the series as well, but that remains unconfirmed. \nMarvel’s Daredevil co-showrunner Marco Ramirez will serve as showrunner and executive producer for the series along with Drew Goddard, Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory. Director S.J. Clarkson ( Marvel’s Jessica Jones , Dexter ) will direct the first two episodes of the culminating mini-series event. The eight-episode series will premiere in 2017 along with Marvel’s Iron Fist and Marvel’s The Punisher .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T17:34:50.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
