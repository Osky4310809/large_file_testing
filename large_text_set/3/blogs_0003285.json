Penn Badgley’s vegan wedding cake is perfect for anyone and everyone to eat…and it’s gorgeous.\nOn Monday, Badgley married his longtime girlfriend , Domino Kirke, in a very low-key ceremony. The two tied the knot in New York at the courthouse before celebrating with loved ones.\nWhile their ceremony was small in size, their wedding cake was fit for a king and queen. Seriously, the cake looked SO tasty — and it was vegan!\nBadgley and his new wife toasted to their marriage with friends and family, and well, cake, of course. The most magical part of the dessert option was that it was actually vegan.\n@laelcakes Thank you for the vegan, gluten free magic that was our wedding cake #laelcakes #rosewater #orangeblossom #lavender #chocolate \nA post shared by Domino Kirke (@dominokirke) on Feb 27, 2017 at 8:17pm PST \nOh, and it was so pretty we don’t know if we could’ve cut into it. Okay, that’s a lie, we can always cut the cake.\nKirke, who is the older sister to Girls star Jemima Kirke and Mozart in the Jungle star Lola, shared snaps from her big day that are to die for.\nWhile dining at Maison-May in Brooklyn the newlyweds enjoyed an intimate table for two. ✨Married ✨ \nA post shared by Domino Kirke (@dominokirke) on Feb 27, 2017 at 3:03pm PST \nEven though it was all about keeping it simple and sweet, the four-tier cake was a real showstopper. According to Kirk’s Instagram, the design was thanks to Emily Lael Aumiller of Lael Cakes.\n“An organic, vegan, and gluten-free orange blossom cake layered with chocolate icing and cacao nibs, covered with lavender icing only seemed fitting for a wedding cake as unique and stunning as Domino Kirke,” Aumiller told People . \nIn addition to creating a marble cake look, the confection was topped with fresh fruit. It had blackberries, kumquats and figs.\nDreamt up this naked, marbled, floral, chocolate, orange blossom sublime cake with @dominokirke for her wedding celebration. \nA post shared by Emily Lael Aumiller (@laelcakes) on Feb 28, 2017 at 9:00am PST \n“This custom creation combined Domino’s love of naked cakes with lush fruit, floral notes such as orange blossom, lavender and rosewater and the delicacy of our marbled designs,” she said. \nEven though the Gossip Girl alum hasn’t shared any photos himself, it’s clear he was loving every minute.\nJust look at how in love these two are! To my beautiful Domino... I'll bring you an explosive spring any day. Congratulations and props to getting married on a Monday. Love you to the moon and back. @dominokirke \nA post shared by Fox Fodder Farm (@foxfodderfarm) on Mar 1, 2017 at 11:26am PST \nCongrats you two…now if only we could see the cake, and eat it too.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:16:06.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
