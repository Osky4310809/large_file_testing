In the story, Michael ( Ben Whishaw ) and Jane ( Emily Mortimer ) are now grown up, with Michael, his three children and their housekeeper, Ellen ( Julie Walters ), living on Cherry Tree Lane. After Michael suffers a personal loss, the enigmatic nanny Mary Poppins ( Blunt ) re-enters the lives of the Banks family, and, along with the optimistic street lamplighter Jack ( Lin-Manuel Miranda ), uses her unique magical skills to help the family rediscover the joy and wonder missing in their lives. Mary Poppins also introduces the children to a new assortment of colorful and whimsical characters, including her eccentric cousin, Topsy ( Meryl Streep ). \nWe still have a long time to wait until the movie is released as it doesn’t hit theaters until December 25, 2018!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T02:33:44.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
