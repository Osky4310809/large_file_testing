He then wrestles himself out of the soldier’s arms and tries to run away. \nHe can’t escape, however, and the boy continues to cry and scream as the Queen speaks to the soldier. \nAs May approaches, his tantrum appears to worsen. At one point the boy appears to relax and starts smiling, but when May attempts to speak to him his fit begins again. \nREAD MORE: Tony Blair’s arrival at Iraq-Afghanistan war memorial sparks backlash \nThe memorial, dedicated to those who served in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, was unveiled on Thursday. More than 800 UK military personnel and civilians died in the three wars. \nThe sculpture, by Paul Day, is formed of two stone monoliths and a bronze medallion. Its unveiling in Victoria Embankment Gardens followed a service for 2,500 veterans in Horse Guards Parade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T16:42:23.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
