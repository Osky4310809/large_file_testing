'Trials in secret' \nIn their previous two-year term, Pakistan's military says it convicted 274 people in cases related to \"terrorism\". Of those, 161 people were sentenced to death, while 113 people were sentenced to prison terms. There have been no acquittals, Pakistan's military says. \nIn 110 cases, the military did not release any information on the trials, including the name of the convict, the crimes they were accused of or, in cases of imprisonment, how long the term of punishment was. \nIn the cases where the military did release information on the convicts, it reported that 94.5 percent of convicts were sentenced on the basis of confessions. \nLawyers and family members of the accused, in interviews and appeals lodged in civilian courts following the convictions, have alleged their relatives were coerced into confessing, were not given access to lawyers of their choice, or to the evidence being used against them. \nLawyers representing the convicts in civilian courts say they have been denied access to court documents, making it difficult to file effective appeals.

Pakistan: Victims question government on security after shrine blast \n\"In 106 out of the 113 cases where convicts were given prison sentences, even the names of convicts have not been made public.\" \nMoreover, the high incidence of confessions - in some cases by convicts who had previously plead \"not guilty\" in ongoing trials in civilian anti-terrorism courts - has also raised concerns. \n\"While in regular murder cases, convictions on the basis of judicial confessions aren't even five percent [in Pakistan], 95 percent of convicts have reportedly confessed to their crimes before military courts. In the absence of any safeguards, this raises serious concerns about torture or other ill treatment,\" said Omer. \nThe majority of those convicted by Pakistan's military were imprisoned under a 2011 Pakistani law that allows indefinite detention without charge in terrorism-related cases, and had, in some cases, been held in custody without trial for as long as six years, the data shows. \n\"Not only does this show that the secrecy of military trials was used to 'legitimise' past cases of enforced disappearances, it also worryingly highlights how there is complete impunity for perpetrators of the grave crime of forcibly disappearing in Pakistan,\" said Omer. Fundamental rights \nTuesday's amendment goes further than the previous law by providing retroactive legal cover to the arrest or detention of any suspect who is subsequently tried in a military court. \nIt also expands the scope of who can be tried in a military court to include anyone who \"commit[s] grave and violent act[s] of terrorism against the State\". Previously the scope was limited to those who \"belong to any terrorist group or organisation misusing the name of religion or a sect\". \nPakistan's Supreme Court greenlighted the previous constitutional amendment in August 2015, deeming it to be within the purview of the parliament to amend the law, as long as the military trials were subject to \"judicial review\". \nAt least 33 military court convictions were appealed in civilian courts since then, although none of the verdicts has been overturned. \nIn a landmark judgment in August 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed a set of 16 such appeals, all alleging fundamental rights abuses, adjudicating that fundamental constitutional rights did not apply to those being tried by military tribunals. \nFollow Al Jazeera's Asad Hashim on Twitter: @AsadHashim Source: Al Jazeera News Tell us what you think Content on this website is for general information purposes only.
