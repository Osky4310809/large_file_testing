The Wildecats’ senior forward began crashing the offensive glass with regularity and finishing around the rim. \nIt was a hook shot by Bullett late in the third quarter that sparked a 10-0 run between the end of the period and beginning of the fourth that helped Wilde Lake establish its largest lead of the night to that point, 50-41. \n“Over the course of the game, I know when I have to turn it up or when I have to be that factor for my team,” Bullett said. “We were down at halftime by one and they had a lot of momentum, so I knew that being on the boards and being a force inside was going to help my team.” \nAtholton did its best to hang around, getting back with six points on three different occasions down the stretch. But Wilde Lake was just too much, as Nick David scored all 10 of his points on the evening in the fourth quarter to help seal the victory. \nOther strong efforts from Gerald Van Tassell (10 points), PJ Joseph (8 points) and Ricardo Greene (7) went a long way to helping the Wildecats emerge victorious. \nWilde Lake 66, Atholton 54 \nWL (4-1, 9-6): Bullett 17, Keys 12, Van Tassell 10, David 10, Joseph 8, \nA (2-3, 5-10): Waterworth 14, Perlin 11, Dobson 10, Rankin 8, Parkins 7, Washington 4. \nHalf: 27-26 A. \nOther scores: \nReservoir 72, Oakland Mills 62 \nJudge Payne exploded for a career-high 30 points, including five 3-pointers, to help lead the Gators to the victory. Reservoir, which regrouped after trailing 15-12 at the end of the first quarter, has now won four straight games overall. \nSimi Ajimatanrareje (12 points) and Ayomi Akinbinu (8) also had strong games in the win for the Gators. \nJust past the midway point of the season, Howard County's boys basketball offensive standouts have established themselves.
