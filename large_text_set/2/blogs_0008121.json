Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General, 52-47. https://t.co/N9qPdAy0Rf #BREAKING pic.twitter.com/hSzFKgGAfa \n— CSPAN (@cspan) February 9, 2017 \n\nSessions had been expected to be confirmed this evening despite the efforts of Democrats to delay his confirmation. From the NY Times :\nDespite a series of fierce, last-minute attacks by Democrats, no Republicans showed any sign of breaking ranks in support of Mr. Sessions’s bid to become the nation’s top law enforcement official after two decades as a Republican senator.\n“Everybody in this body knows Senator Sessions well, knows that he is a man of integrity, a man of principle,” Senator Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican, said during the debate on Wednesday afternoon, echoing the sentiments of many Republicans. The “twisting” of Mr. Sessions’s record offended him, he said.\nOne of the big stories today was the decision by Mitch McConnell to silence Senator Elizabeth Warren last night. There is some debate on whether or not this was part of a grand plan by McConnell or just an expression of frustration with Democratic obstruction. In any case, it certainly seems to be giving Warren all the attention she craves.\nMeanwhile, Senator Tim Scott gave a 30-minute speech explaining his support for Jeff Sessions to be the next Attorney General and, about midway through his speech, he read a selection of tweets attacking him for his decision. Scott noted that he left out the attacks using the n-word:\n. @SenatorTimScott reads tweets criticizing his endorsement of Sen.
