Included is a three-year, unlimited-mileage warranty and three years’ free service. \nNo changes on the outside, but the interior does feature a new three-spoke steering wheel from the CX-9 SUV, along with a new Active Driving Display – the head-up display is now full-colour and has increased brightness, contrast and definition for improved legibility. An eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat has also been added, with two-position memory that also saves the positioning and brightness of the HUD. \nOtherwise, standard kit is the same and includes LED head- and tail lights, LED fog lights, 18-inch two-tone alloy wheels, keyless entry, push-button start, leather and suede upholstery, a glass sunroof, automatic air-conditioning, automatic lights and wipers, paddle shifters, cruise control, an MZD Connect infotainment system with a seven-inch touchscreen, six speakers and a reverse camera. \nSafety kit has also been carried over – six airbags, ABS with EBD and brake assist, stability control, hill-start assist and ISOFIX child seat anchors. \nUnder the skin, the biggest addition comes in the form of the new G-Vectoring Control system which modulates engine torque to optimise vertical load on each wheel, improving steering response and stability. The steering and suspension systems have also been revised for improved ride and handling in concert with the new technology. There’s thicker rear windscreen glass and increased sound insulation, too. \nThe engine remains unchanged – a 2.0 litre direct-injected SkyActiv-G four-cylinder petrol engine produces 154 hp at 6,000 rpm and 204 Nm of torque at 2,800 rpm. All that is sent to the front wheels via a six-speed SkyActiv-Drive automatic transmission. \nBrowse full specifications and equipment of the Mazda CX-3 on CarBase.my . \nGALLERY: Japanese-spec 2017 Mazda CX-3 Research Mazda Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:39:55.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
