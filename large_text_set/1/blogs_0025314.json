REX/Shutterstock \nThe actress rocked the sleeveless, belted, red gown, which the designer sketched for her himself, ensuring she looked totally unique on the red carpet. \nBrown is nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series for her work on “Stranger Thing,” where she plays Eleven, a girl with psychokinetic powers and a love of waffles. \nThe category also boasts her co-star Winona Ryder, Claire Foy (“The Crown”), Thandie Newton (“Westworld”) and Robin Wright (“House of Cards”).

Because yo’ girl just ordered three dozen different headbands off Amazon and I think this is going to be my year, guys. \nSo you can tell the truth. \nYes, or HECK YES, those headbands will look adorable on me? \nThe young actress is set to star in her first Hollywood blockbuster , the highly anticipated “Godzilla” sequel, “Godzilla: King of Monsters.” \nBrown’s character and the movie’s storyline are still a secret, so fans will have to wait until closer to the 2019 release of the movie to find out more. REX/Shutterstock \nMillie Bobby Brown and her co-stars will return to “Stranger Things” later this year. The show will pick up in 1984, right where it left off. \nYes, that probably does mean you’ll have to watch Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) throw up a slug again. \nIt is also expected that the second season holds a “bigger mythology” behind Will’s disappearance. \nThere will certainly be a lot more mystery to come. \nAlso a mystery? How did Millie Bobby Brown and the other kids of “Stranger Things” get so much swag ? \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
