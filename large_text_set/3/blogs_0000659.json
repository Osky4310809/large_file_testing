According to the Daily Mail 's Sami Mokbel , Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette, Borussia Dortmund 's Marco Reus and FC Porto's Andre Silva have all been identified as players who could fill Sanchez's boots at the Emirates Stadium. Mokbel added that Arsenal and the 28-year-old forward seem to have reached a sticking point in their ongoing contract renewal negotiations, and the Gunners will consider cashing in on him in the summer in order not to lose him for free when his current deal expires in 2018. Meanwhile, Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport reported that Juve have stepped up their interest in Chile international Sanchez, via Football Italia: footballitalia @footballitalia 3/3/2017, 7:45:00 AM Juventus would likely be an attractive destination for Sanchez as, unlike Arsenal, they are perennial title winners and have the depth of talent in their squad to compete for the UEFA Champions League—they reached the final in 2015. Per Mokbel, Arsenal are prepared to increase Sanchez's current wages from £130,000 per week to £180,000 per week, but he will accept nothing below £250,000. Given the discrepancy it seems highly unlikely a deal will be agreed before Sanchez enters the final year of his contract in the summer, and Arsenal will then be in a position of having to sell him if they are to make any money back. Mooted targets Lacazette, Reus and Silva would be suitable replacements as they are all natural goalscorers. 2016-17 League Statistics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T11:51:36.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
