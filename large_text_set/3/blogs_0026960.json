The actress bought a three-storey bungalow near her home in Khar, to convert into her own office. Kangana has always wanted to have her own office space and, according to sources, has been working hard with interior designer, Shabnam Gupta, to give the office a Pahariâ€‹ vibe, like her house in Manali. \nHer trip to Vaishno Devi before her birthday was not only to seek blessings for her newest film, Manikarnika , bit for this new business acquisition as well. Kangana is hoping to start her directorial venture sometime this year, as well as get into producing films, and her office will definitely play a role in this new professional sphere. We wish her all the best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:39:50.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
