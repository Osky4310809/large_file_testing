By Mike Whalley   \nThe midfielder pleaded guilty last month after the FA accused him of breaking their rules by making 1,260 football bets over a 10-year period. \nHe is widely expected to get a suspension, as Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend was given a four-month ban for breaking betting rules in June 2013 while with Tottenham – though he only served one month. \nBarton requested a personal hearing to put across his case, which was set to take place on March 8 but was postponed because the FA’s chief investigator in the case fell ill.
