So I think once more their interests go in front of the clubs and the English football interests. Nobody cares about it.” \nWhile Mourinho has played weaker or reserve sides in matches in the past when he felt the schedule in England had become too condensed, he insisted he could not do that this time, given the stature of Manchester United and the FA Cup. \nLast season, United's local rivals City picked an under-strength team in the fifth round of the FA Cup against Chelsea and were thrashed 5-1 just days before a key Champions League tie. \n“This is what we have. I cannot play against Chelsea with a second team. I cannot play against Chelsea with under-21s like Manchester City did last year I think. We are Manchester United, I cannot do that. I cannot do that as Manchester United manager, I cannot do that to the FA Cup because the FA Cup is not guilty of these decisions. The FA Cup is beautiful, the competition is historical. \n“I have to treat Manchester United supporters and the FA Cup in the right way. I cannot go there with the under-21s. Probably they deserve it but I don’t do that.” \nThe packed programme now leaves Mourinho fearful of injury, especially given his side lost Michael Carrick and Henrikh Mkhitaryan to injury in the second leg against Saint Etienne . \n“So what is going to happen is an accumulation of matches, people playing a lot of matches. I have to make some rotation, but some of the boys will have to play in all of these consecutive matches and if situations like the Mkhitaryan one or the Carrick one happen, they happen.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:39:17.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
