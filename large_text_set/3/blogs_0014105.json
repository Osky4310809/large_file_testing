The pileup happened around 2 p.m. on Tuesday. \nThe substance is said to be highly corrosive and dangerous if it comes in contact with skin, lungs, or eyes. \nJoe Baptista, the mayor of Leeds Township, told CTV News Channel all of the people who came in contact with the dangerous liquid have been removed from the scene for emergency decontamination treatment. \nHe said there is currently no risk to the general public, and no residential properties were impacted. \n“This could have been much worse,” he said. “Had there been a fire involved with the chemical, it would have been concerning.” \nThe transport truck carrying the dangerous chemical was said to have been loaded with as much as 14,000 litres of the liquid. \nBaptista said the truck’s contents were held in a number of small containers, which prevented a larger spill. Previous reports suggested the majority of the chemicals on board leaked onto the highway. \nSeveral people were taken to Kingston General Hospital. Spokesperson John Pereira tells CTV News the hospital was under a “code orange,” which indicates an “external disaster.” \n“We are currently expecting 19 patients to be brought here from the scene of the accident,” he said. “We have set up a decontamination bay for patients arriving from the scene.” \nPereira said “non-critical” emergency patients are being re-routed to nearby Hotel Dieu Hospital. \nOntario Provincial Police Const. Sandra Barr said three police officers and 17 civilians were taken to nearby hospitals for decontamination. She says one driver was injured, but she did not know the extent of the injuries. \nBarr could not comment on the cause of the accident. However, she confirmed “whiteout conditions” persist along the highway, while the investigation is underway. \n“There are a number of things going on. We have had to call other resources, other OPP officers from neighbouring detachments to assist,” she told CTV News Channel. “I’m told things are under control. It’s just a matter of completing the investigation.” \n“Blizzard and whiteout conditions for sure were a factor,” said Baptista. \nHighway 401 – the busiest highway artery in Canada – is closed in both directions east of Kingston. \nDetours are in place. The highway was expected to reopen within six hours. However, the OPP now says that timeline is unknown. \nLocal tow truck companies have confirmed to CTV News that they have not been allowed to access the crash scene.
