And by the way, he’s now on this anti-Hollywood kick. He loves Hollywood. First of all, he loves the press. He lives for it. He loves people in \nHollywood. He only wants hobnob with them. All of this hatred and stuff directed towards him. It’s not good for him. It’s not good. There’s a reason every president who leaves the office has grey hair.” \nTrump frequently appeared on Stern’s radio program over the past two decades, engaging in the kind of crude talk about women and celebrities typical of the shock-jock’s show. During the campaign, CNN’s KFile surfaced demeaning comments Trump made about women on the show. \nStern said he considers Trump a friend, but is opposed to his politics. \n“I like Donald very much personally. I was shocked when he decided to run for president, and even more shocked that sort of, people took it seriously,” Stern said. “I remember saying to him when he announced his presidency, I remember being quite amazed, because I remember him being for Hillary Clinton,” Stern added. \n“And I remember him being very–I mean he was pro-abortion. So the new Donald Trump kind of surprised me.” \nStern said he doesn’t believe Trump has had a change of heart on issues like abortion, but is instead playing to his base. \nThe radio host said he also believed Trump ran for president solely to get a larger contract from NBC for “The Apprentice.” \n“I think it started out as like a kinda cool, fun thing to do in order to get a couple more bucks out of NBC for The Apprentice, I actually do believe that,” Stern said. \nComcast Employees March In Protest To Trump Travel Ban \n“He just wanted a couple more bucks out of NBC, and that is why Donald is calling for voter fraud investigations. He’s pissed he won. He still wants Hillary Clinton to win. He’s so f-ing pissed, he’s hoping that he can find some voter fraud and hand it over to Hillary.” \nThe-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
