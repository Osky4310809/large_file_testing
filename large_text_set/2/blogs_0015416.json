Hot off getting into a high-profile spat with Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling—over comments Morgan made last week on Real Time With Bill Maher about the semantics of President Trump’s travel ban —Morgan invited Fifty Shades Of Grey author E.L. James into his conversational boudoir with a somewhat out-of-nowhere dig: Hi @E_L_James , any chance you could start tweeting me one of your books? I need some relief from this Harry Potter crap. — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 15, 2017 \nMorgan was referencing the many, many people who have been sending him quotes from Rowling’s books, in response to his claim never to have read the best-selling wizarding series. James—whose Fifty Shades Darker is currently in theaters—ignored the implied insult of Morgan’s tweet and responded gamely, sending him an excerpt that certainly sounds like something Christian Grey would say in one of his less erotically charged moments… @piersmorgan ‘I believed that the more exposure I got in the press, the better my career would progress. Trouble was, I became overexposed’ — E L James (@E_L_James) February 15, 2017 \n…only to pivot with the follow-up tweet: @piersmorgan Gilderoy Lockhart, from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. — E L James (@E_L_James) February 15, 2017 \nIt’s not clear whether Morgan has sought appropriate aftercare for this latest public spanking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:29:07.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
