There’s a lot that can go wrong when preparing a dish, but hopefully you don’t botch it up this badly.\nDakota Jean was excited to brag about her new chicken recipe on Facebook. But very quickly, people recognized that something was wrong…\nvia Facebook Pro tip: There is no such thing as “medium rare” chicken. You will get sick. People became worried about Jean pretty quickly.\nvia Facebook Pretty disturbingly, though, some people had no problem with the dish. Alexis shared an emoji licking their lips, while Jamie lauded Dakota as a “great cook.”\nAs it turns out, Dakota might have just been trolling everyone. According to MyKissCountry937 :\nBut…you see…it was all a joke. She was never serious. She never ate any of that. She was just riling up Facebook, which is pretty easy if you just go along with it. The “#vegan” was a nice touch.\nWell played, Dakota. Well played.\nSo maybe Dakota got the last laugh? Or maybe that went to this person who trolled Dakota on her own Facebook:\nvia Facebook To be honest, this is why I just cook microwave pizzas. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T21:20:04.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
