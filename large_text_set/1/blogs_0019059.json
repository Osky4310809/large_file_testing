Spurs entered the north London derby on the back foot, with Harry Kane not fully fit, Dele Alli injured and no wins in six games, but the tactical tweak initially troubled an Arsenal side who had not anticipated the move at all. \nIn fairness, nor had many others. Tottenham hadn't used a back three since their 2-1 win at Watford on 28 Dec. last year and while Pochettino said they had spent time on it in training, the preparation time must have been limited given they played Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday. Such factors considered, they performed admirably well, and Arsenal initially struggled to work the system out. Arsenal Lineups and Stats \nOnly midway through the first half did the hosts look like capitalising on Pochettino's somewhat risky defensive setup, in which the back three sometimes played man-to-man against the lone striker and the two wingers. Arsenal repeatedly broke forward against a back-tracking defence, but promising moves were either poorly timed, short of the final pass or badly finished. It took a Kevin Wimmer own goal to give them the lead. \nSpurs started the second half better and drew level through a Kane penalty, with Christian Eriksen later sending a free-kick on to the post. The game became stretched in the closing moments but neither side could find the winner. That left Arsenal without a win in five north London league derbies for the first time under Arsene Wenger, who lamented two dropped points. \nBack three catches Arsenal off guard \nAt least Wenger had not seen Arsenal fall behind, which could easily have happened early on. Facing a 4-2-3-1, Pochettino used wing-backs Danny Rose and Kyle Walker to press the full-backs, which left the back three of Eric Dier (right), Wimmer (central) and Jan Vertonghen (left) to pick up Alex Iwobi, Alexis Sanchez and Theo Walcott. \nIn central midfield, Victor Wanyama, Mousa Dembele and Eriksen clashed with Granit Xhaka, Mesut Ozil and Francis Coquelin, while Kane and Son Heung-Min battled Laurent Koscielny and Shkodran Mustafi. \nDid the switch surprise Arsenal? \"It did, completely,\" Walcott admitted. \nWithin five minutes, Spurs had created two chances, the first a Walker header from a Rose cross. If that underlined the advanced roles of the wing-backs, another aspect was that Arsenal's full-backs sometimes pushed up high to press them, leaving Koscielny and Mustafi vulnerable. On five minutes, with Hector Bellerin far up field, Son received a pass down the left, fooled Mustafi and bore down on goal, only to misplace a cross instead of testing Petr Cech. \nHowever, despite a Kane header later on, Spurs were gradually worked out by Arsenal, who pressed lower and stayed more compact. The visitors had plenty of possession but few ideas, and Vertonghen and Dier ended up trying several unsuccessful long passes towards Kane and Son. \nTransitions threaten Spurs \nAt that stage it was Arsenal who looked dangerous. When defending their box, Rose and Walker dropped down into a back five as the central midfield trio shuffled across to pick up the nearest full-back -- but the duo weren't always in position to recover when Arsenal broke quickly. Dier and Vertonghen would sometimes move out wide to stop Iwobi and Walcott, with the latter completing two tackles near the touchline, but neither had time to do so when the wingers were released in narrow positions on the break. \nThis happened when Iwobi sprinted forward only to cross poorly, and when Walcott hammered a shot against the post. Transitions were also involved when Sanchez set up Ozil, who dragged his effort wide, and when the Chilean later found Iwobi for a meek finish. There could have been further examples had Arsenal not mistimed so many moves; they ran into offside positions seven times and eventually needed help from Wimmer, who flicked Ozil's free-kick into his own net. \nRoaming Eriksen goes close \nAt the other end, Arsenal had trouble with Eriksen. The Dane dropped into midfield without the ball, often shuffling out right to pick up Nacho Monreal, but played closer to the strikers in possession and repeatedly ran in behind the backline. Still, he was better when getting the ball to feet, and he nearly created the opener when Kane flicked his cross inches wide. \nThe equaliser had less to do with Eriksen -- Dembele was fouled by Koscielny for Kane's penalty -- but he could have made it 2-1 when striking straight at Cech from inside the box. Towards the end, amid a frantic finale, he sent a free-kick on to the post and delivered a sublime pass to set up substitute Vincent Janssen, who was denied by Cech. \nSubs miss their chances \nThe chaotic ending was a product of both managers going for the win, with Wenger particularly ambitious in swapping Coquelin for Aaron Ramsey and later bringing on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Olivier Giroud in place of Walcott and Iwobi. Giroud played well, releasing Bellerin for a dangerous run into the box and then steering a header at Lloris. \nBut others were less efficient. One was Oxlade-Chamberlain, who held back Rose to commit the free-kick from which Eriksen nearly scored, and who sent an inexplicably high pass across the touchline to ruin one attack, then wrecked another with a cross behind goal. \nIt didn't go much better for Janssen, who often lost the ball and managed to commit four fouls, the joint-highest in the match, despite replacing Kane in the 73rd minute. The floundering summer signing could have won the game in stoppage time, but horribly mishit a Rose cross from excellent position. \nSuch chances denoted how the result could have tipped in either direction, though as both managers later reflected, a point apiece was probably fair enough. \nFourFourTwo Stats Zone provides live in-game data, scores, alerts and animated chalkboards.
