Danny just stayed on him.” \nBarber leads Mount St. Mary’s in caused turnovers with seven despite sitting out the season opener against Delaware on Feb. 11. He has recovered from offseason labrum surgery and is only four caused turnovers shy of topping his career high, set last year. Gravante agreed that Barber has emerged as the team’s top defenseman. \n“I would say that Danny is probably our best one-on-one, physical defender,” Gravante said. “[Redshirt senior] Kevin Verkler has a football mentality and lays a body on people. But Danny is our best and probably our biggest in terms of his athletic status and probably our best one-on-one cover guy.” Caption Orioles' Alvarez needs defense to go with hitting \nOrioles lose to the Red Sox during a spring training game but Pedro Alvarez had another good game at bat.
