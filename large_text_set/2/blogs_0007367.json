However, Marvel Studios decided to make Earth's Mightiest Heroes a lot less mighty by giving them some serious infighting that split the superhero team. At this moment   Universe, following the events in Captain America: Civil War , the Avengers are a name with nobody in it. \n\"   the culmination of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, as started in May of 2008 with the release of Iron Man ,\" Marvel boss Kevin Feige explains in the recently-released Infinity War featurette ( view here ). \"And it really is an unprecedented culmination of a series of films interlinked together, which at the time had never been done before. And for us, the important thing is making it all come together. We know they are going to face Thanos. We've been setting that up since Avengers.

Well, tear them apart. Which is why we did Civil War before Infinity War. \" \nCivil War and Infinity War co-director Anthony Russo shares: \"As we were conceiving it and executing Civil War , the end of that movie was very much a setup for what these movies will be. We always had a sense of that.\" \nAvengers: Infinity War was written   & Stephen McFeely, the duo behind the screenplays for Captain America: The First Avenger , Captain America: The Winter Soldier , and Captain America: Civil War . The directors of the latter two films, Joe and Anthony Russo , are directing Avengers: Infinity War , which is the first-part of the Phase 3 climax   Universe. \nAvengers: Infinity War will hit theaters on May 4, 2018. \nMORE Infinity War: First Look Set Video | Iron Man's New Suit | New Thanos Artwork | Spider-Man Confirmed --- \n  ComicBook Anticipated #10  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:16:57.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
