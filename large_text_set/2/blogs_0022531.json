But only months after their divorce, the Teen Mom 2 star announced she is pregnant with another man’s baby. Marroquin turned to Twitter to express his shock over the betrayal.\n“ The boys will be okay on our end I promise,” he tweeted. He then captioned a photo of their 3-year-old son Lincoln , “My son, follow your dreams. I’ll pick up the pieces for you. Love, your daddy.”\nAlthough Marroquin promised Lincoln and Isaac , 6, from Lowry’s previous relationship with Jo Rivera , will be okay, the same couldn’t be said for him.\n“Take a shot for me,” he asked fans.\nPHOTOS: Jeremy Madix Makes Serious Move With Girlfriend Despite Past Domestic Abuse History \nAs Radar exclusively reported, the 24-year-old is pregnant with her third child .\nOnly hours later , Lowry confirmed the pregnancy in a blog post.\n“I am pregnant,” she wrote on Thursday night. “Please know that this was a choice I made. I already know some won’t agree, but I’ve been showered with support by the ones I love since I found out.”\nShe explained that while Rivera has been aware of the pregnancy “for a while now” because they can “have adult conversations about things,” Marroquin was left in the dark.\n“Unfortunately, I never got to have a conversation with him about it,” Lowry wrote.\nWhile Lowry has received backlash for the pregnancy, Marroquin received support from fans.\nPHOTOS: 95 & Fabulous!
