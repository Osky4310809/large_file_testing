After all, it’s their creativity and passion that creates Disney magic and delivers the incredible guest service we’re known for. “Cast Members of Disneyland” is a collection of everyday cast members sharing their experiences on the job, stories of favorite memories and reasons they love working at the Disneyland Resort . Meet a few of them below!\n\n“It’s a privilege, really. I get to work for a company that I love, but to see magic happening right in front of me and to be part of making that magic…It just kind of embodies what Disney stands for and what it means to a child – not only the child who’s five but the child in the 65-year-old. The reputation really does live up, for guests and for cast members.” – Evamaria, outdoor vending, 4 years at the Disneyland Resort\n\n“I love talking to the kids…Sometimes all you have to do is ask a kid a question, and then they’re off telling you the whole story of their day. You have to find the fun elements of your job, then it’s not just a job anymore.” – Dave, Cars Land Merchandise, 29 years at the Disneyland Resort\n\n“With any family, this might be their one and only trip to the Resort, so I always try to instill that into new cast members – you just want everything to be wonderful for them and magical…you want to make all the good memories you can.” – “Mama Jan,” Trader Sam’s Enchanted Tiki Bar , 10 years at the Disneyland Resort\nWe will continue to introduce you to the #CastofDisneyland in the coming months.
