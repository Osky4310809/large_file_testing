These freezes follow similar actions against the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, and the Egyptian Center on the Rights to Education – and their leaders – in September. \nThese human rights organizations work to document violations and abuses, advance women’s rights and gender equality, and defend the freedoms enshrined in Egypt's constitution. This decision comes against a wider backdrop of restrictions on Egyptian civil society activity and will produce neither stability nor security. We urge the Government of Egypt to lift these asset freezes, take all legally available measures to end the investigations into these human rights non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and ease restrictions on association and expression so that these and other NGOs can operate freely.
