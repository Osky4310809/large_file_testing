Comment Gerard Lyons: Why a clean Brexit would be best for the new Global Britain \nA messy exit would reduce our control over the main elements of leaving — the single market and migration Monday 16 January 2017 12:44 BST Click to followThe Evening Standard Mixed messages? Philip Hammond spoke to a German newspaper; Theresa May outlines her plan this week Getty Images \nThis will be an important week for UK economic policy, providing greater clarity about the Government’s Brexit strategy. Yesterday, however, comments by the Chancellor Philip Hammond were interpreted controversially. During an interview in Germany, he implied that if the UK was given a bad deal by the rest of the EU, we would change our domestic economic model, effectively becoming a corporate tax haven, even changing our social policy. \nWhatever politicians on the Continent may say or do, I see no reason why our domestic economic strategy should change. The Treasury needs to stop thinking Brexit is about making the best of a bad job. After all, its pre-referendum forecasts were very pessimistic. That might help to explain his comments. \nThe Chancellor is right in observing that the UK’s Brexit strategy needs to complement the Government’s domestic economic and industrial thinking. The two should go hand in hand and reinforce each other. And they can, in a positive way. \nThe focus should be on investment, infrastructure spending and increased innovation. The EU is not only a slow- growth region in the world economy but its rules and regulations ensure it is a low-innovation one too. All the more reason to be set apart from it. \nWe need to compete, whatever type of deal we do with the EU. And the last thing we want is a change to our social model and a race to the bottom on workers’ rights. Outside the EU they would no longer be determined in Brussels but by MPs here, in response to what the British people want. Taxes can still head lower but that would depend upon how our economy performs. Theresa May ‘in position of strength' ahead of Brexit negotiations \nAll this must be seen in the context of our overall approach to Brexit. There is much talk of “hard Brexit” versus “soft Brexit”. These labels add little value and are misleading. The terms “clean Brexit” and “messy Brexit” are more accurate. \nA clean Brexit means a clean break, under our complete control, with the UK leaving both the single market and the customs union. It would allow the UK to return sovereignty to Parliament and to have a sensible migration policy, controlling our laws and our borders. Also, it would allow us to position ourselves to succeed in a changing and growing global economy. \nIn contrast, we should make clear that the UK does not want a tumultuous and potentially explosive, messy Brexit negotiation with the EU over freedom of movement and membership of the single market. A messy Brexit would give the Government no control over the central aspects of leaving. It would also maximise business uncertainty, seriously damage UK-EU relations and could even end in a disastrous stalemate. \nEven though we are leaving the EU we are still in Europe, sharing common agendas in areas such as defence and anti-terrorism. Theresa May denies 'muddled thinking' over Brexit \nThe Government has much to gain from opting for a clean Brexit. The leading economic commentator Liam Halligan and I have co-authored a report, released today by the Policy Exchange think-tank, called Clean Brexit. In it we outline the approach we believe the Government should take. \nWe need to rule out remaining in the EU’s single market. Its economic benefits are exaggerated and it does little to help our service sector, which accounts for four-fifths of our economy and is dominant in London. Inside this market we remain liable for multi-billion-pound annual payments to the EU and remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. We couldn’t control our laws or our borders. About eight per cent of UK firms export to the EU but because of our membership all firms — even only those many small firms that sell only here at home — have to abide by its rules and regulations. \nThere is a big difference between being a member of the single market and having access to it. The UK will still have access to the single market. We also have to remember that it is firms and people that trade, not bureaucrats and politicians, and whichever economy we export to it is necessary to abide by that country’s rules and regulations. \nOutside the single market we can set a migration policy to suit domestic needs. Of course we still need migration; it helps economically and culturally but it needs to be part of a sensible overall strategy. We need higher wages and more spending on training our domestic workers, not unlimited migration. \nThen we need to leave the customs union too. Once the UK leaves, around 85 per cent of the world economy will be outside the EU. Inside the customs union we remain unable to cut our own UK-focused trade agreements with nations across the world. Leaving it opens up future opportunities and allows the UK to think globally, with a focus on free trade. Central to that will be the ability to reduce non-tariff barriers that often hold back trade in services. \nWe will also need to focus on preparing to retake our seat at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Already we conduct around half of our trade under WTO rules with the rest of the world. Both the US and China trade heavily with the EU, under WTO rules, and we can do the same. But already, our WTO-rules trade is not only the biggest part, it is also fast-growing and registers a surplus. \nWe need to position the UK for future free-trade agreements. Even the European Commission acknowledges that 90 per cent of global growth is set to come from outside the EU. Such global deals are a great opportunity. \nIn addition, and as the Chancellor touched on yesterday, there is the scope for a bespoke or sector-specific trade agreement with the EU. This makes economic sense, for cars and the City. And in time, as part of our free-trade focus, we will have the ability to cut tariffs as part of our future trade deals. \nTomorrow, at Lancaster House, the Prime Minister will outline her thinking on Brexit and on the direction of government policy. The message should be Global Britain, and it is one that she should then take to Davos and the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum later this week. \nThere she will explain how Britain intends to seize the opportunity offered by Brexit, positioning us as both attractive as an economy to invest in and successful as a place from which to do business. This will be a positive message for London and the whole country. \nDr Gerard Lyons is chief economic strategist at Netwealth Investments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T15:15:40.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
