If your natural shot shape is a left-to-right, you're more likely to struggle because a number of holes require right-to-left tee shots. Draws feature more topspin than fades, which makes them harder to control. Jack Nicklaus obviously never had that problem, but some of golf's other legendary cutters - guys like Lee Trevino and Johnny Miller - did. \nBut there's also another advantage that is easy to pass over: The course is easier to play if you're left-handed, like Phil Mickelson. \nWhy? Because as Phil Mickelson explains in his second installment of Golf's Channel' show \"Feherty,\" which aired on Monday night, because lefties get the best of both worlds at The Masters. On holes that ordinarily require right-handed players to hit a hard-to-control draw, Mickelson, Bubba and Co. can hit a cut. The stats suggest he's right, too: six of the last 13 Masters winners have been left-handers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:25:31.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
