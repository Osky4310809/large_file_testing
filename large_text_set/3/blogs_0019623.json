The mortality rate for those infected was a fearsome 60 per cent.\nInterferon Beta-1a is used to treat chronic hepatitis B and C, and is sometimes administered to people with multiple sclerosis. Scientists led by Dr. Eleanor Fish of the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute first did lab experiments that suggested the drug was an effective weapon against Ebola. Then, in Guinea, they administered the drug to nine patients and compared the results to 21 similar, previously treated Ebola-sufferers who received the standard “supportive” care — measures like rehydration designed to address the virus’s symptoms.\nHandout Dr. Eleanor Fish, centre, with local health-care team in Guinea. After 21 days, 67 per cent of the Interferon-treated Ebola patients were still alive, compared to just 19 per cent of the others, according to a study just published in the journal PLOS One.\nThe researchers also concluded that the virus had been cleared more rapidly from the blood of patients getting Interferon, and that symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea and diarrhea cleared up sooner.\nThey caution the results are not definitive. The trial was small and had only one branch — for patients receiving Interferon — with the comparison subjects selected after the fact, rather than being randomly enrolled in the study.\nBut the findings are promising enough to warrant further investigation, the paper says, especially since nothing else exists for treating patients.\nInterferons are a family of naturally occurring proteins, produced in response to viral attack. In drug form and with certain diseases, they curb infection by preventing the virus from entering target cells and blocking different stages of viral replication. Because they are already in use, researchers know that they have a favourable safety profile.\nThough the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia was officially declared over in January 2016, isolated cases have emerged since and the threat of another epidemic looms.\nAmong the most promising developments in the war against the disease is another Canadian-flavoured innovation. An Ebola vaccine developed by the national microbiology lab in Winnipeg was shown effective in a large-scale clinical trial reported in December.\n• Email: tblackwell@nationalpost.com | Twitter: TomblackwellNP \nRelated Final test results confirm Canadian vaccine for ebola is highly effective The story of ‘the Canadian vaccine’ that beat back Ebola ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:43:16.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
