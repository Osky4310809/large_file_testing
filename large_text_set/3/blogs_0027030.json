The Football Whispers Index takes the latest transfer rumours and gives them a score out of five; the higher the score, the more realistic and reliable the whisper. \nHere are today's top five emerging whispers for the summer. And keep an eye on Transfer Talk for all the latest gossip. \nWayne Rooney to Everton \nThe Independent claim Manchester United are prepared to waive a transfer fee to allow Rooney to leave the club in the summer. Everton are favourites to sign the boyhood Toffee and are ready to offer the striker a £150,000-per-week contract. The report then goes on to suggest Goodison Park is the 31-year-old's preferred destination and that the deal is almost a formality. \nHector Bellerin to Barcelona \nBellerin is a long-term transfer target for Barcelona but looked set to stay at Arsenal after agreeing a new contract back in November, keeping him at the Emirates until 2023. However, it appears it's not as clear as some would believe. The 22-year-old told SPORT: \"It's nice there are a lot of big clubs that are interested in me, but if one of those is Barcelona that's special.\" \nJordi Alba to Manchester United \nThe Manchester Evening News are reporting that Barcelona left-back Alba is an admirer of Jose Mourinho and would be keen on joining Manchester United in the summer. Since Barcelona switched to the 3-4-3 formation, Alba has seen his playing time decrease and this has led to the former Valencia man exploring other possibilities. It is believed Barcelona value the 28-year-old around the £25million mark and expect to bank that fee with the left-back having three years remaining on his current deal. \nAlex Sandro to Real Madrid \nPortuguese publication A Bola are claiming that Juventus defender Sandro tops Real Madrid's list of summer transfer targets. The Serie A leaders are expected to demand a fee of around €45m to part ways with the former Porto left-back. \nJermain Defoe to West Ham United \nWest Ham United failed to land former Hammer Defoe in January but the club haven't given up. The Sun believe the striker could be available on a free transfer if Sunderland are relegated, and with the Black Cats rooted to the bottom of the Premier League, it's a real possibility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:26:11.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
