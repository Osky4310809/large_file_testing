Share 09:02 \nSince we’re on the subject of David Davis , Newsnight’s political editor (and my former Guardian colleague) Nicholas Watt has compiled an excellent 10-minute profile of him which was broadcast on Monday night. It is well worth watching, not least for revealing Davis’s past as a Kevin Keegan lookalike. A much younger David Davis. Photograph: Newsnight Share 08:55 \nIn normal circumstances the chancellor is the most important cabinet minister after the prime minister but, given the extent to which Brexit is consuming all the government’s time and energy, there’s a good case for saying that in this administration the real number 2 is David Davis, the Brexit secretary. And this morning he is getting a full interrogation from the Commons Brexit committee. I will be covering it in detail. \nAccording to the committee, these are the issues they will be focusing on: \nReadiness for triggering article 50 and negotiations for the UK to leave the EU \nThe priorities for the government as set out in the white paper \nThe great repeal bill and how the government is preparing to ensure a smooth and orderly exit from the EU \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n9.15am: David Davis , the Brexit secretary, and Olly Robins, the permanent secretary at the Brexit department, give evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. \n9.30am: Unemployment figures are published. \n10.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives evidence to the Lords international relations committee on the Middle East. \n12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. \n12.15pm: Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, gives a speech to the chief nursing officer summit. \n2pm: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, gives a speech to a human trafficking conference. \nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary after PMQs and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T11:22:16.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
