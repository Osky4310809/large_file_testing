The foam midsole’s, loaded with the trademark energy-returning pellets, gives the sneaker its light, smooth and dynamic ride, while the outsole sees Stretchweb technology and the Torsion System to give you pinpoint yet responsive grip.\nFor the upper, Porsche Design Sport keeps it clean, sharp and with a technical, almost structural, edge. However the overall aesthetic stays true to both brands’ design heritages – the breathable mesh keeps things lightweight while the soft pin-perforated leather add a luxe touch while still being grounded in sport and performance.\nThe 10 year anniversary also sees an accompany two piece sport-luxe tracksuit accompanying the sneaker drop. Two indulgent essentials, the sweat hoodie is crafted from lightweight performance fabric for max breathability while for bottoms, a slim-cut tapered jogger is constructed from soft, moisture-wicking stretch fabric for ultimate sports-luxe stunting.\nThe Porsche Design Sport by adidas all black Ultra Boost drops March 1 at adidas.com/porschedesignsport and porsche-design.com .\nShop Here For more sneakers from the two, check out the Porsche Design Sport by adidas SS17 Collection in full.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T11:26:01.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
