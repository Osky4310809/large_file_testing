I was applying the chemical for the first time when a woman approached me and warned that it was dangerous. \n“A few minutes after, some policemen came to arrest me. My brother (Faith) was not around when I put the Sniper in the beans.” \nAlthough the shop owner confessed that his suppliers in Maiduguri, Borno State, where he bought the goods, used some chemicals including Sniper and DD Force , to preserve beans, he said his brother carried out the act without his consent. \nFaith, who said he started the business four years ago, also denied offering the bribe to the DPO. \nHe said, “I wasn’t around when my brother was caught putting Sniper in the beans. I was called on the telephone and I quickly returned to Lagos from Ibadan (Oyo State), where I had gone for a function. Sunday came to my shop when he learnt some policemen were there and he was also arrested. \n“Chidioke just came back from our village. He had never seen me put Sniper in beans. In Maiduguri, if my suppliers wanted to preserve beans, they put DD Force or Sniper in water and spray it on the beans. It will be stored for about three or six months, depending on the quantity of chemicals applied. \n“I have never mixed beans with chemicals, but I have been buying the one with chemicals from Maiduguri. If it is stored for a long time, it is not dangerous for human consumption.” \nHowever, Sunday said he just alighted from a motorcycle when the police arrested him. \n“I don’t preserve my beans with Sniper . I normally buy the quantity I can sell before insects infest it,” he added. \nThe state Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni, said the suspects would be charged to court after investigation. \n“The excuse the owner of the shop gave was that he was mixing pesticide with beans and that he had been selling it like that. He approached the DPO, thinking he could easily settle the case and get the two other suspects released. He offered her N500,000, but she rejected it,” the CP added. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:26:03.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
