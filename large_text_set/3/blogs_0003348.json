By Colin Daileda 2017-03-04 19:43:09 UTC You’d think the strangest story of the day would be two Hollywood stars-turned-politicians, fighting over their shared reality TV gig, but…you’d be wrong. \nThe Russian government is trolling Sarah Jessica Parker. \nTo be fair, the Sex and the City actress started it, on Thursday, with a bit of her own trolling, posting a meme someone made of her, playing her Sex and the City character Carrie Bradshaw, doing a pitch-perfect impression of Carrie’s narrative voice: \nHer Instagram post followed news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had met with Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, during the presidential campaign. Sessions had been a Trump surrogate for President Donald Trump during part of the campaign, and is just one of several in Trump’s circle who appear to have had contact with Russian government officials. So Parker hopped on the ‘Gram, and gave a solid nod to her former Sex and the City character’s habit of wistfully typing away about life’s greatest mysteries. \nThe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs noticed. \nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is correct. Truly, anything seems possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T06:03:46.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
