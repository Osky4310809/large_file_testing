The kid had no show.\" SUPPLIED \nNo Pride In Prisons has campaigned vigorously on the issue of sexual assaults behind bars. \nGotty was convicted on two charges of sexual violation over an incident at Mt Eden Corrections Facility in January 2016. \nAt the time, Gotty was on remand awaiting sentencing on a previous conviction for indecent assault on a male aged over 16. Despite that, prison staff allowed a teenager to share a cell with him. \nThe teen said Gotty was physically intimidating and forced him to engage in oral sex. He later said he was afraid to push the panic button because of how long it took guards to respond, and how Gotty may have reacted in the meantime. At Gotty's trial, Judge Christopher Field raised concerns about the response time, which Davis said was a common issue in prisons. \"I have heard in the past that some people have pushed their buttons and have had to wait 15 to 20 minutes, so you can understand the kid's concern about pushing the button,\" he said. Emilie Rakete from the activist group No Pride In Prisons said the case was an illustration of how Corrections was failing to ensure the safety of prisoners. No Pride In Prisons has campaigned on the issue of sexual assaults behind bars, particularly against transgender prisoners. \nThe group was instrumental in having Corrections barred from this year's Pride parade in Auckland. Ad Feedback \n\"This is a clear example that demonstrates that double-bunking is not fine,\" Rakete said. \n\"Something needs to change in New Zealand prisons, or this kind of thing is going to keep happening.\" \nCorrections chief custodial officer Neil Beales defended the department's double-bunking policy, pointing out that only 30 per cent of the New Zealand prison population is double-bunked, compared with up to 80 per cent in South Australia. \n\"We have robust procedures in place which aim to ensure the safety of prisoners who are in shared accommodation cells,\" he said. \nDavis said Gotty's offending showed those procedures weren't good enough. \n\"These sorts of things are going to happen a lot more often if we double-bunk,\" he said. \nBeales said Corrections had a zero tolerance policy toward prisoner assaults, but was unable to comment on the specifics of Gotty's case. \n\"This matter was investigated by the prison and police at the time,\" he said. \n\"We are unable to go into further details while this individual is awaiting sentencing.\" \nA pre-sentence report assessed Gotty as having a significant likelihood of reoffending, with a \"very high\" risk of harm to others. \nCrown prosecutor Nick Williams has applied for preventive detention, which would see Gotty kept behind bars indefinitely. \nGotty will appear for sentencing on March 8 in the High Court at Auckland. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:06:43.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
