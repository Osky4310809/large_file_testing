It would appear that the Parisians have the upper hand, thanks to Bakayoko himself. “The opportunity to sign for the PSG youth academy presented itself. But my dad and my brother chose Rennes, the best youth academy at the time. Not going to PSG hurt me, I even had tears in my eyes.” “So if the opportunity presents itself, I will not refuse a move to PSG. But I am only 22, and I feel very good at Monaco.” -Tiemoue Bakayoko; source: Mirror Come and get me pleas don’t get much clearer than that! Bakayoko’s asking price is supposedly in the region of £40m or so, which PSG should have no trouble paying. (On the plus side, it might free up a move for any of Verratti, Matuidi, or Rabiot?) Monaco's Tiemoue Bakayoko has revealed to Le Parisien \"if the chance presented itself\" he would \"not refuse to sign for PSG.\" #ASM https://t.co/6AQ1zEZjl5 — Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) February 21, 2017 Bakayoko and his merry band of young talent from the Principality put on a show Tuesday at the Etihad — that Bernardo Silva sure looks like the real deal! — though both teams forgot that attacking is only half the battle in the 5-3 win for Manchester City. But while none of the defenders or goalkeepers may have emerged with any credit at all from the game, Monaco’s highly coveted stars left many a mouth drooling at the prospect of them joining their teams in the future.
