Mary Beth Haglin: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published Updated 9:03 pm EST, July 29, 2016 20 Comments By Paul Farrell 1.6k Share Tweet Follow Mary Beth Haglin pictured on her Facebook page. \nAn Iowa teacher says the local school district are responsible for her having a prolonged sexual relationship with a 17-year-old boy. The teacher, Mary Beth Haglin, 24, was arrested on July 22 and accused of abusing a student while she was subbing at Washington High School in Cedar Rapids. Authorities say the relationship lasted for the entire 2015/16 school year. \nSince she posted bail, Haglin has done a series of interviews where she had sensationally blamed the Cedar Rapids Community School District of allowing the relationship to take place. When speaking to KCRG, Haglin said that previous abusive relationships had allowed her to become vulnerable. \nHere’s what you need to know: 1. Haglin Said the School District Knew About the Relationship But Did Nothing Because They Didn’t Want the Bad Publicity (Screengrab via KWWL) \nIn an interview with KGAN-TV, Haglin said: \nThese people all knew what was going on, and yet hey turned a blind eye because they wanted to protect their school. They didn’t want it to get into the limelight. \nShe told the station that the relationship began in October 2015. Haglin continued, “They allowed this to happen. They knew in February.” KCRG reports that the disciplinary process only began in April 2016 when a video of Haglin and the student together began to circulate in the community. \nKWWL reports that the relationship occurred while Haglin had been working at George Washington High School in Cedar Rapids as a substitute teacher. The school is regularly ranked among the best in the U.S. On the school’s website, it says that the school is the number one high school in Iowa, citing the Washington Post. The campus is located along Forest Drive Southeast in Cedar Rapids.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:29:58.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
