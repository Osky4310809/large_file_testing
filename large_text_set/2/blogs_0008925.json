And even then, with all our might, we struggle to rise yet higher, climbing up towards the sun, desperate not to be torn away by the fury of its storms or consumed by its fires. \nThen there are our roots, deep under the ground, unmoving and serene. They are our ancient mothers and fathers, who lie within us at our very core. \nFor them, there is no storm, no struggle. There is only the One, the Infinite, for Whom all the cosmos with all its challenges are nothing more than a fantasy renewed every moment from the void. \nOur strength is from our bond with them. With their nurture we will conquer the storm and bring beauty to the world within which we were planted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:27:42.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
