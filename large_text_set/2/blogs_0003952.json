Are Italy treated harshly by referees? \nThe former Ireland international felt the penalty count did not reflect the game. \n\"We have a big challenge to change a lot of our mentality and to understand that things do against you. We lost our discipline in the second half,\" he said.

Davies or Biggar - the fly-half debate rumbles on \nSam Davies - who came on for the injured Dan Biggar after the interval - recovered from a shaky start, when he was twice stripped of possession, to impress with ball in hand. \nIn Wales that's the cue for an argument about who should start at 10 against England, provided Biggar is fit. \nIt's one Howley is not prepared to settle prematurely. \n\"I think he showed in the autumn that he's ready to start, he came over here with a progression plan in terms of experience,\" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device Six Nations 2017: Howley and Jones happy with winning start \n\"Sam has showed lovely touches and has a unique left foot, but we'll have to wait and see how Dan comes out with his rib actually. \n\"But overall Sam's done really well which puts pressure on coaches in terms of selection. \n\"He's come on in a difficult game and created opportunities for others, created space, showed composure.\" So for Wales, is the glass half full? \nWell, it's half full if you're Howley. \n\"It's a win, and momentum is important in the Six Nations,\" said the former Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half. \n\"We mentioned before the game that the conditions would have an influence and that certainly was the case. \n\"We know how tough it is to come to face on Italy coached by fantastic coaches and the conditions made it even harder for us. \n\"So we're happy and want to move on quickly and focus on the next game.\" The challenge of England \nThe defending champions may have had their own issues as they beat France on the opening weekend, but have beaten Wales in their two meetings under Eddie Jones. \nHaving played on Saturday, England have one more day to recover than Wales, but Howley was making positive noises before leaving for the night flight back to Cardiff. \n\"We've done a lot of our analysis on England already,\" he said. \n\"I said to the players before the game it's important we start the competition well, we haven't done so for four years really. \n\"So I'm glad from that perspective that we can go into the next game with a little more self-belief and confidence.\" \nAfter 15 consecutive wins, confidence will not be in short supply in the white shirts, either.
