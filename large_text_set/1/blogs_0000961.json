The new series is a good evolutionary update as it brings several design changes, more powerful hardware and new features. It’s also the first Galaxy A series to tout IP68 water and dust resistance. \nSamsung has confirmed that the Galaxy A (2017) series is going to be available for purchase in Europe early next month. The company has also confirmed prices of the two models that will be available in this market. The Galaxy A3 (2017) and the Galaxy A5 (2017) will be sold in Europe for 329 euro and 429 euro respectively. It appears that the Galaxy A7 (2017) will not be making its way to this part of the world. \nThe company is yet to confirm precisely when these devices will be launched in other markets across the globe. It’s likely that the new Galaxy A series will be released in some markets across Asia by the end of this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T12:16:53.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
