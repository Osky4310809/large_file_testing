It is indicated by the icon \"Legion(number)\", for example \"\", and followed by one or two card names which you search for. It is done in the following form: During your main phase, if your vanguard is not and never in Legion state, and your opponent has a grade 3 or greater vanguard, you may choose four cards from your drop zone, and return them to your deck in any order. After paying the cost, search your deck for up to one of the specified cards (its card name appears marked in red). Place that card at the left on your vanguard circle as playing it, in the same standing or resting state as your legion leader is in, then shuffle your deck. After the moment referred above, all the \"when placed on\" and \"when Legion\" abilities are activated at the same time, and the player chooses which of them will resolve first (by paying any cost required). \nBoth units are now associated with each other in a \"Legion state\" for the rest of game, and also, while the legion leader is on your vanguard circle, it cannot activate \"Seek Mate\" for the rest of game (even if you have not played any card). How the Legion State Works Edit \nAs long as both units are in Legion state, the unit with the Seek Mate icon is known as the \"Legion Leader\", and the unit that was placed by the Legion Leader is known as \"Legion Mate\". While both leader and mate are your vanguards, they are two different cards on the field, and each have their own characteristics, also they can be individually chosen/referred to by effects. If one of the associated units changes its standing or resting state, the other unit changes to the same state as well. Likewise, if one of the them is unable from changing its state, the other unit also becomes unable. If one of the associated units leaves the vanguard circle, the other unit is no longer in Legion state. When a unit in legion state will attack, you rest both the leader and mate, and they become the attacking unit. Neither of them can attack alone, nor can they be forced to attack due to any method. Also, the number of drive check to perform is equal to that of your legion leader. When a rear-guard will boost a vanguard in legion state, you must choose which of the two units will be boosted (for units like Wingal Brave that requires boosting specific names). The power of a unit in legion state while attacking, is equal to the sum of the power of the leader, mate and the boosting unit. In addition to other effects that increase its power. Also, the attacking unit only hits once, and it deals damage equal to your leader's critical. In any time other than attacking, the power of the legion mate cannot increase to the leader's power. If for any reason, the leader or mate that is attacking is unable to deal damage, then the other unit will be unable to deal damage as well. Only the legion leader can be chosen to be attacked, and only its power can be used as reference while it is being attacked. The legion mate cannot be attacked due to any method. The abilities \"activated on (VC)\" of your legion mate can be used and applied as it is on the vanguard circle. While your vanguard is in legion state, you can only normal ride a card with the same grade as or one grade greater than your legion leader's, and you can only normal call cards with grade equal to or less than your leader's. Effect Use Timing Edit \"When this unit Legion...\" refers to when that unit changes from not being in Legion state to being in Legion state. \"If this unit is Legion...\" refers to whether the unit is in Legion state at that current moment. \"During the turn that this unit Legion...\" only remains active during the same turn in which the unit changed from not being in Legion state to being in Legion state.
