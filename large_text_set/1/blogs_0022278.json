BLARING . . . SO LOUD . . . hit snooze – again. Must get dressed. Pull on socks, now the pants, and the shirt. Now take off the socks and find a pair that matches. No. forget it, there’s no time. Out the door without your jacket. COFFEE, must get coffee. Inside the coffee shop . . . so close, “Black, with an extra shot of espresso, to go please. I’m running late.” That fist sip is all it takes; the warmth courses through your fingers and down your throat into your belly and you can feel your brain start to speed back up again. Now that you’re armed with caffeine, you can take on the world! \nWe’ve all witnessed the miracle of coffee (or tea) every morning but what don’t see is the cost of our disposable coffee cups. After the lifesaving liquid has entered our system, we throw away our coffee cups along with their plastic lids and straws. While these pieces of plastic trash may be out of sight, they should never leave our mind. \nPlastics stay around long after our morning pick me up has left our system – it takes hundreds of years to break down one piece of plastic waste and we produce over 300 million tons of plastic waste each year. Worse still, only 15 percent of disposable plastics are properly disposed of – the rest make their way into our oceans and waterways. When you add your disposable morning coffee cup to everyone else’s it adds up fast; each year we throw away on million disposable cups. These get added to the 8.8 million tons of plastic waste that make its way into our oceans every year. Once in the water, this plastic waste has dire consequences for marine wildlife. Over 800 marine species are currently endangered because of plastic pollution and our appetite for plastic is still increasing. We have produced more plastic in the past 1o years than we did over the entirety of the last century. \nDon’t freak out, we are not asking anybody to forgo their morning caffeine fix. You can still have your coffee and feel good about drinking it on the go – just bring a travel mug with you when you leave the house. \n\n\nThis way when you order from the barista, they will know you’re cool (even though you don’t have a fancy mustache) because you’re saving the planet’s oceans. Here are some recommended travel mugs to help you get started: 1.
