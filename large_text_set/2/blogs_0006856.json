At the time, it was unclear when we would get any more information about this animated series. It looks like we didn’t have to wait very long for more news to come out. Netflix has just announced that it will unleash a Castlevania series in 2017.\nAccording to a recent press release from the company, Netflix will release Castlevania Season 1 Part 1 sometime this year. This is literally all we got from this press release. We can’t say for certain that this is the aforementioned project by Frederator Networks and producer Adi Shankar — but if we’re going to place bets, I’d say this would be a good one to make.\nDuring Nickelodeon’s Nick Animation Podcast , Fred Seibert of Frederator Studios said that he and his team were working on a project based on “one of the most world-famous video games of the last 30 years.” He also explained how Frederator Networks had the rights to adapt this video game for the past 12 years. Before that, producer Adi Shankar revealed that he was working on a “super violent” animated series based on Castlevania. Shankar said that he teamed up with Frederator Studios to produce the project.\nA report from The Globe and Mail says that renowned comic book writer Warren Ellis has written for the show’s first season. Warren Ellis is known for his dark writing style — something that will suit a Castlevania series nicely.\nAgain, we don’t have any more details about this Castlevania series. However, given the quality of Netflix’s animated shows, there is a good chance that this will be a quality program. There will no doubt be further updates on this story so make sure to come back here for additional details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:05:46.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
