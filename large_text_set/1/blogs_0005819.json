Southampton's asking price for Van Dijk has Man City looking elsewehere (Photo: Getty) \nThat’s why the City boss has sanctioned a six-month loan deal for Bayern Munich defender Holger Badstuber. \nThe 27-year-old is fit again after four injury-ravaged years and Guardiola, who worked with the German international at Bayern, is desperate for defensive reinforcements after seeing skipper Vincent Kompany once again struggle with injuries. Guardiola is set to borrow his former Bayern star Badstuber for the rest of the season (Photo: Bongarts/Getty) \nBadstuber is out of contract at the end of the season and Bayern want him to sign a new deal before allowing the loan to go through. \nThe Bavarians see a temporary switch to City as an ideal opportunity to get their popular centre-back playing again.
