The primary players were none other than Raphael Lunetta , the longtime Westside chef responsible for such big spots as JiRaffe , and the Divid + Conquer, Inc. team (Daniel Weinstock, Mike Garrett) from Maple Block Meat Co.\nSince then, the corner has been given a thorough makeover , and is being prepped to open as two simultaneous spots: Lunetta, and the more casual Lunetta All Day. Here’s what to expect.\nAt Lunetta All Day , look for something casual and fun for the whole family. Guests will enter through the back (there’s a big parking lot, don’t worry) and step into line during the day to order sandwiches, salads, AM pastries, coffee, you name it.\nThe corner has been given a thorough makeover The open, bright room features a ton of tempered glass up front against Pico Boulevard, with the effect of letting in light without congesting customers with the slow crawl of traffic beyond.\nIn the evening, service will transition into more of a sit down model with on-tap craft beer and wine. There’s a long marble bar for lounging, space for the kids to play, and high ceilings so you won’t feel hemmed in.\nOn the Lunetta side, chef Raphael Lunetta himself will be cooking up modern classics from an open kitchen. Gold touches, tile, and generous dark wood make for a sexy interior more suitable for a proper dinner, while a small bar and fireplace in the back keep things extra cozy. Lunetta All Day will open in just a couple of weeks, while Lunetta the dinner spot is a little ways behind that.\nLunetta/Lunetta All Day \n2424 Pico Blvd. \nSanta Monica, CA ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:17:34.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
