ADVERTISEMENT \n“It’s a calculated risk on their part,” said Marvin Espiritu, Lutz’s manager. “They (Meralco) know that he is still injured, and they are not rushing him. He could be available in the latter part of the Commissioner’s Cup.” \nLutz, a gunslinger, sat out almost the last two seasons because of what he thought was a hip injury. Espiritu confirmed that what caused the hip injury was an old ankle sprain in high school in the States that made his hip compensate to take on his body weight. \n“It was an ankle instability injury,” Espiritu said. “His left ankle, due to some wear and tear and an old high school injury, made his ligaments [in the ankle] loose and brittle that it could not carry his body and made his hips compensate for that.” \nEspiritu acknowledges that this is a new lease on Lutz’s PBA life and that he would need to prove himself again in the very limited time that he has. \nLutz had arthroscopic ankle ligament repair procedure in the US and returned to the country last week and chose from a list of teams that wanted his services once he gets well. \nAlaska, TNT KaTropa and Blackwater were the other teams that showed interest in acquiring Lutz, who, Espiritu said, wants to make a grand comeback with Gilas once he gets back to the pink of health. \nThe Bolts have practically bowed out of contention for a playoff berth in the season-opening conference with a 2-7 record tainted by losses in their last six games. \nLutz, who turns 32 next month, will make his first public appearance with his new team on Friday, when the Bolts battle Rain or Shine. \nMeralco assumed the remainder of his San Miguel contract of P350,000 a month that will last until the end of this season, meaning, he would have that much—or little—time to prove himself once again in the PBA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:46:57.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
