In addition, refugees were barred for 120 days, and all Syrian refugees were barred indefinitely. \nIn its 11-page reply to arguments filed by opponents of the executive order, the Justice Department restated the same arguments it has made at earlier stops along the courtroom journey — that the president has \"unreviewable authority\" to suspend entry of \"any class of aliens to protect the national interest\" and that states (in this case, Washington and Minnesota) can't challenge federal denial of entry by third-party aliens. \nWashington Attorney General Bob Ferguson rebutted that contention Monday, saying on NBC's \"TODAY\" that while the president does have the power to act in the interest of national security, \"we have a checks-and-balances system in our country, and the president doesn't have totally unfettered discretion.\" \nIn its new filing Monday, the federal government added a twist by suggesting a possible middle ground, giving the court a way to keep some of the executive order intact even if it sides mostly with Washington and Minnesota. \nJustice Department lawyers argued that the lower-court ruling focused on protecting lawful permanent U.S. residents and other nationals from the seven restricted countries \"who were previously admitted to the United States and are either temporarily abroad or are here now and wish to travel outside this country — not aliens who are attempting to enter the country for the first time.\" Play", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:26:33.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
