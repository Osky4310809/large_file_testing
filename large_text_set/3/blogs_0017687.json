It is only me who dares to run against Hayatou,” Ahmad told AFP in the Malagasy capital Antananarivo. \n“My program is the reform of the administration of CAF to prevent politics interfering with the organisation of the confederation,” said the 57-year-old father of two. \nThe emergence of Ahmad as the standard bearer of those seeking change took many involved in African football by surprise. \nPart of the Muslim minority in a small village in northwestern Madagascar, he has kept a low profile since taking charge of the football federation in his country. \n“He is a man who speaks little during CAF executive committee meetings,” said a source close to the Cairo-based organisation. \nAhmad officially has the support of the 14 member countries of the southern African confederation (COSAFA), of which Madagascar is part. \nCAF comprises 54 member countries and Hayatou, first elected in 1988, is seeking an eighth consecutive term. \nHe was challenged in 2000 and 2004 and inflicted humiliating defeats on Armando Machado of Angola and Ismael Bhamjee of Botswana. \n“Hayatou tires a lot of people, but overall the African federations will support him again,” said a source close to FIFA. \nAhmad brushes aside the argument that the president of CAF cannot come from a weak football nation like Madagascar, who are ranked 39th of 54 African national teams. \n“This is an argument to try and defeat me, but look at the presidents of the Asian and North-Central American confederations — they are from Bahrain and Canada.” \nThe senior vice-president of CAF, Suketu Patel, comes from the Seychelles, whose national team is ranked 51st in Africa. \nAhmad has based his campaign on “transparency in the management” of CAF and an end to “obsolete practices”. \nAhmad was named by the London-based Sunday Times regarding the award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. \nAccording to the newspaper, Ahmad would have received 30,000 (28,000 euros) to 100,000 dollars in exchange for his vote for Qatar. \n“It does not make sense,” says Ahmad “(as I) simply asked for financial aid to organise the elections of the Malagasy federation.” \nLast January, CAF withdrew the organisation of the Africa U-17 Cup of Nations from Madagascar and gave it to Gabon. \nCAF cited lack of preparation for the decision, which was announced after Ahmad said he would challenge Hayatou. \nAhmad says the move was a political manoeuvre. \n“Withdrawing the tournament from Madagascar came at the time I declared myself a candidate for the CAF presidency.” \nAhmad is pleased with the reform last year of the CAF statutes, limiting presidents to a maximum of three four-year terms. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T14:10:01.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
