Thea Queen ( Willa Holland ) had previously been away on a business conference over the course of the past three episodes. \nBut tonight, she returned to help her brother Oliver Queen ( Stephen Amell ) serve as mayor in a time of crisis. And according to the show's executive producers, viewers will see more of Thea in upcoming episodes. \n\"She’s headed in a direction that’s very similar to where her mother was before she was killed in Season 2. We’re excited about it.\" revealed Wendy Mericle . \nFor hardcore Thea fans, rest assured, this doesn't mean that her character will die. Although Holland does have a smaller contract with the show - which explains why she hasn't been in all of this season's episodes - she remains an integral connection to the show's earliest seasons, as well as Oliver's only living familial connection. \nAccording to Mericle, this connection between the siblings will play into Thea's storyline going into the rest of the season. \n\"I’m actually really excited about her storyline because we’re taking her to a place where she’s been dealing with all of these issues the same way Oliver has, with her bloodlust and with her other elements of her past. And this season’s going to find her in a similar place but for very different reasons. There’s gonna be a great scene coming up between Oliver and Thea that’s one of my favorites on the show.\" \nExecutive producer Marc Guggenheim echoed this, highlight the dynamic between the siblings while they both work in the mayor's office. \"There’s some really terrific Oliver/Thea scenes in next week’s episode and beyond. It’s been so much fun to have her in the mayor’s office and we’ve really been enjoying writing for them.\" \nFans will have to wait and see what exactly Thea's storyline entails, and how it will carry into the rest of this season of Arrow and beyond. \nWILD DOG’S HISTORY IS REVEALED — A traumatic attack on City Hall triggers painful memories for Rene (Rick Gonzalez) about his family.

Tensions run high in the Arrow bunker. \nKristin Windell directed the episode written by Marc Guggenheim.
