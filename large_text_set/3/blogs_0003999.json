The lap record was set October 2016. Lamborghini announced the record and released a video (shown below) of the lap Monday.\nThe Lamborghini Hurac?n Performante set a production cap lap record of 6:52.01 min on the track--five seconds faster than the previous production car record holder, the Porsche 918 Spyder.\nThe super sports car, equipped with a V10 engine, can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles in 2.9 seconds and reach a top speed of nearly 202 miles per hour.\nLamborghini attributes the car’s performance to the carbon fiber technology that helped the vehicle shed 88 pounds of weight and what it calls “Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva,” or ALA, a patented system of aerodynamics.\nA rear view of the Lamborghini Hurac?n Performante When ALA is on, a motor opens flaps in the front spoiler of the vehicle in less than half a second. This reduces air pressure on the spoiler and instead directs air through the underside of the car, which reduces drag and creates the perfect conditions for accelerating and reaching top speed.\nTurn ALA off and the flaps close, which creates downforce on the spoiler and turns the car into an ideal vehicle for high speed corners and full brake conditions. The upshot is a super sports car that can handle corners and those fast-and-straight moments.\nThe Hurac?n Performante will be delivered to its first customers this summer. The base price of the vehicle, excluding taxes is $274,390.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T09:50:44.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
