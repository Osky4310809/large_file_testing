Berry Had Just Been Released From Prison When He Married Themetta & Soon Took up Guitar Chuck Berry at 90 years of age has been married to Themetta Suggs since 1948 and they're still together after more than 68 years. #love pic.twitter.com/1lbdgCiscu \n— #wecandoitchallenge (@MinouChrystayl) March 17, 2017 \nUntil Berry met Themetta, his life was rocked with turmoil. \nAccording to Biography.com, “Berry served three years in the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men outside of Jefferson, Missouri, before gaining release on good behavior on October 18, 1947, which was his 21st birthday.” \nHe married Themetta the following year. It wasn’t the end of troubles. In his autobiography, Berry recounted how Themetta had come to see him graduate inside the prison later on. As Deseret News puts it , in 1959, Berry “was convicted and sentenced to prison for human trafficking after his 14-year-old, hat-check-girl companion was arrested for investigation of prostitution.” \nThemetta stuck by his side. \n“When I finishes (sic) the credits and extra courses in business management and accounting I was ready for graduation.” he wrote. “My wife, Toddy, came to hear me deliver the valedictory speech and witness me receiving my diploma and extra certificates. One of the more pleasant memories, yet a bit sad, was that she wept as I was nearing the close of the valedictory address, causing me to stumble over some lines. Later she told me her sorrow was caused by the location of the occasion within the confines of a prison.” \nHowever, he was also on track to a music career. \n“He also took up the guitar again when, in 1951, his former high school classmate Tommy Stevens invited him to join his band. They played at local black nightclubs in St. Louis, and Berry quickly developed a reputation for his lively showmanship,” Biography.com says. \nAccording to Deseret News , Berry started playing guitar in part to support his new family. He “developed into a guitarist in the early 1950s out of necessity. He was newly married and was working odd jobs,” the site reports. 5.
