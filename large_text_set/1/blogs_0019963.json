That way, you can watch the latest episode of Travelers (an awesome Netflix original series… check it out) offline without an internet connection, and thus save some of your cellular data for something else. However, that support only extended to a phone or tablet’s onboard storage. Now the latest Android update for the app allows you to also save your Netflix video clips to your microSD card as well.\nSee also: Best video streaming apps and video streaming services for Android December 4, 2016 This is pretty huge if you are a big Netflix binge watcher. If you have a phone or tablet that can support microSD cards , you should be able to download a ton of movies and TV episodes and save them without maxing out your onboard storage.\nIn order to use this new feature, all you have to do is go to the new “Download Location” setting in the Netflix app, then select if you want your offline clips to go to the microSD card or the onboard storage on your phone or tablet. Keep in mind that this download support only extends to a certain number of videos on the service, and it’s also not available for all Android devices.\nEarlier this month, the CEO of Netflix’s biggest rival Hulu, Mike Hopkins, confirmed that offline support would be coming for his service as well sometime in the next few months. Hopefully, that support will also include storing videos on microSD cards.\nThere are so many Netflix-exclusive shows now, and more are on the way. Indeed, the service’s push for more exclusive shows seems to be the reason why it added so many new subscribers in the company’s last quarter. What is your current favorite Netflix-exclusive TV show?
