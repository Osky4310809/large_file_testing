That's right, the gorgeous Neil Lane engagement ring that Viall used to propose to Vanessa Grimaldi on Monday's season finale of The Bachelor is actually the same one Hayes had picked out for JoJo Fletcher on The Bachelorette. It's easy to see why the 3.75-carat sparkler -- featuring a round-cut center diamond stone surrounded by a halo of smaller diamonds and two larger baguette-cut diamonds -- caught the eye of both men. The real question is how?

As for Hayes' reaction to the recycled ring, he says he's happy it found a home on someone's finger. \"It was interesting to find out. It didn't really matter to me -- JoJo never saw my ring! But Vanessa looks happy. I'm happy for her and I'm happy for the ring,\" he said. \"It was kind of funny for it to happen for the first time in Bachelor history with Nick of all people.\" A post shared by Robby Hayes (@roberthunter89) on Mar 16, 2017 at 4:42pm PDT RELATED: Jordan Rodgers Celebrates 1-Year Anniversary of First Kiss With JoJo Fletcher -- See the Sweet Pic! According to Hayes, however, picking the same ring isn't the only thing he and Viall have in common. \"He wore Chubbies all the time [and] did the no socks look,\" he joked of Viall jacking his style. \"Now he just has to stop wearing that turtleneck.\" The Bachelorette runner-up might find soon himself following in Viall's footsteps, however, as he revealed he's been asked to join the upcoming season of Bachelor in Paradise. \"It's a bridge I'll have to cross when I come to it,\" he shared. \"I value my family above everything and me being on The Bachelorette was really hard for them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:41:02.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
