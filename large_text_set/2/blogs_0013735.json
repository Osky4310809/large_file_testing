Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nStill think your Mac is immune from viruses? Think again. \nJust a week after a new strain of malware was found hidden inside malicious Microsoft Word macros , security researchers have discovered sophisticated new software from Russian hackers that targets your saved passwords and iPhone backups. \nThe malware was created by APT28, a group blamed for interfering with last year’s presidential election by hacking the Democratic National Committee. It was already infamous prior to this for its long list of attacks on iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux. \nNow the group is targeting Macs with a new version of “Xagent,” a modular backdoor that can be customized to do different things. Bitdefender found that this particular strain is capable of stealing saved users passwords, screenshots of the desktop, and iOS backups. \nOnce the malware makes its way onto your system, it establishes communication with a server then runs different modules that grab all kinds of information from your Mac. \n“Our past analysis of samples known to be linked to APT28 group shows a number of similarities between the Sofacy/APT28/Sednit Xagent component for Windows/Linux and the Mac OS binary that currently forms the object of our investigation,” explains Bitdefender. \n“For once, there is the presence of similar modules, such as FileSystem, KeyLogger, and RemoteShell, as well as a similar network module called HttpChanel.” \nThe good news is this is described as targeted attack malware, which means you’re unlikely to become a victim of it unless APT28 hits your system specifically; it’s unlikely you’ll find it lurking in the wild. And if you’re an average Joe, you’re probably not an APT28 target. \nHowever, Bitdefender is still analyzing Xagent, so we’ll have to wait for further information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:17:57.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
