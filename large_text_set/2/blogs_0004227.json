Aside from a lack of political experience, Bannon, former president of Breitbart News, has been tied to anti-Semitism and white nationalist views. \nRetired Navy Adm. Michael Mullen, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for George W. Bush and Barack Obama, wrote , \nPutting aside for a moment Mr. Bannon’s troubling public positions, which are worrisome enough, institutionalizing his attendance threatens to politicize national security decision making. \nSome have called this move a “ coup ” and a sign that Bannon is really the one in charge of the country. Twitter \nThat’s what makes this detail from the Times so alarming. The article says Trump was angry that he was “not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council.” \nApparently that order is annoying Trump more so than the immigration ban, despite the international chaos that it caused over the past week. \nTrump has now requested the White House set up some sort of formalized structure on the executive orders. He demanded to be “looped in” on the writing of the orders much earlier than he had been, the Times wrote. \nSo at least now, hopefully, Trump will actually know what he’s signing before he sees the effect of it. That’s confidence, fam!
