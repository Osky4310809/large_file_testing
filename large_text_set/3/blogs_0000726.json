For one, the Seaford, East Sussex couple have two children now who also accompany them in the photos. \nJust imagine how much two people can change through 16 years. (But not me, because I’m a vampire and we never age.) \nBeing able to witness the couple go from their days newly in love to still-in-love-but-now-with-two-kids is pretty incredible. Facebook \nGiles was just 23 when he and his now wife, who was 18 years old, took their first picture at a Brighton train station. They had just started dating a few weeks before. \nThey grew up in the same small town, but hadn’t seen each other since they were kids. Once he ran into her, Giles, who is a children’s author, simply thought “wow.” Facebook \nWhile they may have grayer hair now, the two are still as happy as ever. Their 2006 photo, seen in the below image in the middle, was a “momentous photo booth moment” for the couple. \nMichelle was three months pregnant. \nGiles said, \nShe had terrible morning sickness that day. I think we both knew life would never be the same again. Facebook \nTheir first child Elijah made his debut in 2008’s photo. In 2007, they took their annual photo booth shot on their first night out since she gave birth. Giles explained, \nMichelle and I had had little time together since the birth, so we literally ran into a booth that was outside a supermarket. \nIn 2009, their second son Sonny also joined in on the pictures. Facebook \nGiles said, \nThe photo booth was in a post office and I remember trying to squeeze two growing children into the booth and realizing there would be less and less space each year as they got bigger and that one day they would be grown men like me. \nEli is now 10 while Sonny is 8, and the couple looks forward to continuing their tradition. Facebook \nGiles went on to add, I think we both know we are different people, but the same somehow. My feelings for Michelle are just the same, perhaps stronger than ever. Our favorite picture is the one where the four of us are in it for the first time, our family complete.
