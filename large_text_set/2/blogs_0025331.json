Bill Cassidy's support for President Trump is unpopular with his constituents.\nThe activists can be heard on tape strategizing about how to turn an upcoming town hall in Breaux Bridge, La., into a fiasco for Cassidy and a political win for Democrats.\nVia The Daily Caller:\nThe activists split up into an “inside team” — tasked with occupying “as many seats as we can” and an “outside team,” whose job was to “give [the media] the coverage they want” before joining the others inside. Activists were instructed to dress like conservatives and leave at home “any signifier that you’re a liberal” in order to blend in with constituents.\nThe leftist activists strategized how best to “dominate” the question-and-answer section of the town hall and keep anyone “sympathetic” to Cassidy from asking a question.\nThe audio also reveals the activists laughing about “the poor people of Breaux Bridge” — local constituents — who might get stuck behind them. Local news coverage of the town hall said that “many attendees were turned away” from the town hall due to “capacity restrictions.”\n“Game plan number one is to fill as many seats as we can, right? If it’s all of us in there and the poor people of Breaux Bridge are sitting behind us, well then tough luck for them,” said one organizer, identified by KPEL as James Proctor. His “poor people” comment drew laughs from the other activists.\n“If we can arrange it so he doesn’t hear one sympathetic question–great. That only magnifies our impact,” Proctor said.\nAn unidentified activist can be heard saying, “The Indivisible Guide does say that when you start to lose the meeting, that’s when you boo and hiss.” Another one says, “Right, I was going to say that.”\nAccording to local news outlet The Advertiser, about half of the crowd of about 200 \"seemed to want to hear Cassidy or otherwise support him.\" The rest “frequently interrupted, expressing disagreement with some of Cassidy’s positions and shouting out their own questions.”\nAlthough the town hall was packed, perhaps as many people were unable to enter the crowded building. Participants began to arrive before 8 a.m.; City Hall does not open until 8:30 a.m.\nAt least a few times, Cassidy implored the crowd to listen to his responses or the responses of others without shouting over him or them.\n\"Listen to each other and we will hear each other,\" he said.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/27/leaked-audio-reveals-anti-trump-group-plotting-hostile-town-hall-in-louisiana/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://kpel965.com/recording-purports-to-confirm-organized-protesters-ahead-of-cassidy-town-hall-in-breaux-bridge/", "http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/2017/02/24/cassidy-crowd-breaux-bridge-standoff/98222902/", "http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/27/leaked-audio-reveals-anti-trump-forces-manufacturing-hostile-town-hall/#ixzz4ZvsRuTdF", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nGgG17Jlmo4"], "published": "2017-02-28T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:11:07.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
