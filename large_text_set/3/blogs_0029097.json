VP Mike Pence’s ‘conservative Christian’ faith is the explanation given for why he won’t be in a room alone with a female who’s not his wife \n— Xeni Jardin (@xeni) March 29, 2017 As @espiers noted in a thread today, this means he’d be unable to work with a female colleague as a peer in a professional setting. \n— Xeni Jardin (@xeni) March 29, 2017 Sincere question. How is this different from extreme repressive interpretations of Islam (“Sharia Law!”) mocked by people like Mike Pence \n— Xeni Jardin (@xeni) March 29, 2017 No need to point out he’s a creep. I know. Those eyes are the eyes we see right before the assault happens. \n— Xeni Jardin (@xeni) March 29, 2017 \nIt should be noted that the article Jardin was referencing said the Vice President Pence doesn’t do solo dinner dates with women that aren’t his wife. \nJardin instead that Pence is won’t “be in a room alone with a woman,” a claim to which Twitter responded by basically calling her a dumb-dumb idiot head. “Mike Pence has rapist eyes” is a new one. Twitter is full of surprises. https://t.co/omGm0NFQjV \n— T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) March 29, 2017 Regarding Pence and his wife, his critics are used to the Oral Office, not Oval office, so a stand-up husband shocks them. \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) March 29, 2017 Everybody remembers where they were when Mike Pence stoned a woman to death for talking to him pic.twitter.com/JLdBpFRhlh \n— Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 29, 2017 When Republicans behave like Bill Clinton, that’s bad because they’re hypocrites. When they don’t, that’s bad because they’re like Muslims. \n— Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 29, 2017 @xeni @espiers Except it didnt say that at all. I’d vote all day long against Pence, let alone Trump/Pence but no need to exaggerate \n— Roddy Boyd (@RodBoydILM) March 29, 2017 @xeni My true religion, your quaint folk tales. My religious practice, your superstition. My deeply held beliefs, your prejudices. \n— Philip Borenstein (@pborenstein) March 29, 2017 @tinahseattle nonsense.
