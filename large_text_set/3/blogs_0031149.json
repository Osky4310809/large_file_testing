She then hired Geek Squad to repair her machine, but they couldn't resolve the issue with \"complete success\", so she bought a replacement. \nRobert Saiger says he did accept the upgrade but claims to have lost data, as well as \"time and money, and incurred aggravation attempting to reconstruct and replace the data\". \nHoward Goldberg also approved the upgrade and claims his \"computer was damaged\" after Windows 10 didn't install properly. Goldberg paid someone to repair the computer since the hardware was out of warranty and is claiming lost data, lost time and money, and loss of the use of his computer. \nThe complaint contends that Windows 10 is a consumer product under US law, and accuses Microsoft of being aware that the upgrade could cause data to be lost and hardware to be damaged. \nThe complainants aim to prove a number of points through the case, including that the upgrade could cause loss of data and hardware damage, and that Microsoft knew about potential software incompatibility issues. They also want to show that the upgrade, allegedly without warnings, resulted in a breach of warranties. \nNot surprisingly, given the volume of complaints about the Windows 10 upgrade, Microsoft has been keeping tabs on what annoyed consumers most and has promised to offer users more choice with its upcoming Creators Update. \nIn a recent blogpost , the company said it will offer a way for users to \"specify exactly when you want an update to occur, including the ability to reschedule an update if your original choice ends up being less convenient than expected, or 'hit the snooze button'.\" \nWe have contacted Microsoft for its views on the class action but have yet to receive a response.
