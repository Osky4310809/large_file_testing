The ASCSN scribe said that office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation had issued a circular directing all MDAs to compile the total sum involved in respect of the unpaid entitlements of their employees. \nHe said that money included promotion arrears in some cases since 2007, burial expenses, repatriation allowance, training allowance among others. \nThe scribe urged the Federal Government to pay workers the money as it had shown support to the states by providing a bailout fund twice in the past one year. \nLawal further said that balance of the indebtedness should be captured in the 2017 budget estimate so that payment could be made in the course of the year without going through the virement process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:29:11.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
