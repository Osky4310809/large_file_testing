Of course, there is no guarantee that Cena will still be the WWE Champion at WrestleMania , as AJ Styles is owed an obligatory rematch — not to mention the fact that John Cena must defend the title in two weeks against five men at Elimination Chamber 2017 . On this week’s WWE SmackDown LIVE , who else will be added to February’s Elimination Chamber Match? And will any other title represented on the blue brand be defended in the steel structure?\nWho will challenge John Cena for the WWE Championship at Elimination Chamber 2017? [Image by WWE] On the Royal Rumble 2017 Kickoff , Naomi got the win for her team in the Six-Woman Tag Team Match by pinning SmackDown Women’s Champion Alexa Bliss. Will Naomi’s recent success earn her a singles match against Bliss at Elimination Chamber ? Or will the blue brand continue to break new ground with their Women’s Division by hosting the first-ever Women’s Elimination Chamber Match?\nFailing to win the Royal Rumble Match after a valiant effort, will WWE Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose be defending the company’s most prestigious mid-card title at Elimination Chamber 2017 , or will he be one of the men challenging John Cena for the WWE Championship?\nFinally, Neville continues to dominate the WWE’s Cruiserweight Division, having defeated Rich Swann for the Cruiserweight Championship at Royal Rumble 2017 .
