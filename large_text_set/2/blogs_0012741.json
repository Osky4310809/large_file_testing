Could he be a good fit for the Los Angeles Rams, who are looking to improve on a historically bad offensive season in 2016? I think the LA Rams should see how much cash it takes to draw Martellus Bennett away from Foxboro. He would be great for Goff. So versatile. \n— Peter Forsee (@Pete4C) February 15, 2017 \nHere’s what football analyst Elliot Harrison said about the Super Bowl champion ( via NFL.com ): \n“A lot of people think the Patriots are not going to bring him back … I don’t think New England wants to get in a bidding war at the tight end position, especially with Rob Gronkowski due to be back. Martellus Bennett could be a target for the Rams.” \nLance Kendricks did not have much success with Los Angeles last season. Yesterday, we wrote about why the Rams may cut their former starter. We also mentioned likely another cap casualty: Eugene Sims. \nIt’s worth noting that Bennett has had some serious beef with Sims in the past, so it would be poetic justice if that’s how the Rams made room for Bennett. Related: Will the Rams cut Lance Kendricks, Eugene Sims or Greg Robinson? \nIf both were cut, the Rams would save $6.75 million in cap space for free agency. \nHere’s what Bennett said about his upcoming free agency and his desire to get paid ( via Boston Globe ): \n“You want to make as much money as you can while you’re doing it because this game is not guaranteed, so every guy needs to get paid and every guy probably feels like they should get paid more and I would agree with them.” \nOther players that the Rams could cut to make room for Bennett include Alec Ogletree (which would save $8.37 million), Robert Quinn ($5.21M), Rodger Saffold ($4.32M), William Hayes ($2.5M) and Tim Barnes ($2.6M). \nWhile these all feel less likely than Kendricks and Sims, even one or two of these moves would free up significant cap space if the Rams do not look to bring back Kenny Britt or Trumaine Johnson. Related: Report: Rams likely to move on from WR Kenny Britt \nRecent reports indicate that Los Angeles is not looking to re-sign Britt in the offseason despite his increased productivity last season. \nBennett would offer a dynamic, impressive athletic option on offense for Goff — which is something that the Rams did not have last season. \nOther players mentioned by Harrison who could go to Los Angeles in free agency include DeSean Jackson and Alshon Jeffery.
