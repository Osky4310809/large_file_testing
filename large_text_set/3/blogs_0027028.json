Well, since you already have a palate for human waste, maybe you’ll like this beer. The folks over at Stone Brewing Co. are what you might call progressive… They’re taking human waste and recycling it into beer, aptly named “Full Circle Pale Ale.” 2 \nNot only that, but according to the brewery’s senior manager Steve Gonzalez, it’s one of his favorite beers. Think he just doesn’t know his shit? Well apparently the mayor of San Diego was the first to try it and he couldn’t get enough of the shit. 3 \nSo what does beer made from beer shits taste like? Gonzalez says, “you’ll taste caramel notes and some tropical fruit notes. It’s a very clean tasting beer.” Some have even described it as “the shit”. Yeah, you’ll have to excuse me if I don’t believe all the shit coming out of your mouth, Steve. 4 \nTo create the beer, they recycle water reclaimed through the Pure Water San Diego program which is attempting to “recycle and recirculate 1/3 of San Diego’s total potable water supply by 2035.” The new program has politely been nicknamed “toilet to tap”… not sure if this is the “tap” they had in mind though. 5 \nWith only five barrels currently, if you want to taste the shittiest beer ever, you’ll have to travel to San Diego. Pop a breath mint before you report back though, thanks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:07:10.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
