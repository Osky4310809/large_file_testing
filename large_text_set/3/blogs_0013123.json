The front office girl was so very organized, everything was in order because I was able to fill out all my patient information on line ahead of the visit, she had it all ready when I walked in, just a few initials and everything was complete very seamless, to me this is a big deal. I didnâ€™t have to wait to be seen, Monica the nurse took me right back to see Michelle. My visit with Michelle Holcomb was top notch. She is a provider that takes time with her patients and always listens to your needs. I never leave without additional tips and tools to help with my heath/wellbeing. I actually drive out of my way to be a patient of hers because of the patient care she delivers.
