John McCain raises concerns over 'unwillingness to separate truth from lies' Senator John McCain has given a speech which appears to take sharp aim at the president even though Donald Trump's name was never mentioned, reports the Washington Post .\nThe Arizona lawmaker was addressing the 2017 Munich Security Conference on Friday when he invoked the name of Ewald von Kleist who helped plot an assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler more than 70 years ago.\nMcCain said, \"What would von Kleist's generation say if they saw our world today?\"\nJohn McCain through the years \n\nHe then answered , \"They would be alarmed by an increasing turn away from universal values and toward old ties of blood, and race, and sectarianism. They would be alarmed by the hardening resentment we see toward immigrants, and refugees, and minority groups, especially Muslims.\"\nHe added, \"They would be alarmed by the growing inability, and even unwillingness, to separate truth from lies. They would be alarmed that more and more of our fellow citizens seem to be flirting with authoritarianism and romanticizing it as our moral equivalent.\"\nSEE ALSO: Meghan McCain blasts Trump for his tweets about her father \nAnd though he said that many seem to be giving up on Western nations, he ultimately concluded that he would continue to be \"a proud, unapologetic believer in the West.\"\nAs The Hill points out, these comments follow President Trump's recent attacks on the media as well as his attempt to temporarily block refugees and certain immigrants from the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:20:37.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
