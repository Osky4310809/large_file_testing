Sarah Ann Harris News Reporter, The Huffington Post UK \nPoor Nick Robinson suffered a very unfortunate slip of the tongue while discussing Philip Hammond on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. \nThe presenter meant to use the Chancellor’s nickname “Spreadsheet Phil”. \nBut poor Robinson accidentally ended up saying “Spreadshit Phil” instead. \nOuch. \nHe quickly corrected himself but it was too late - the slip-up was noted by many listeners Ah wonderful. Nick Robinson describing the chancellor 'spreadshit Phil Hammond.... sorry, spreadsheet Phil I should say'... @BBCr4today — Lachlan Goudie (@lachlangoudie) March 9, 2017 Could've sworn I just heard Nick Robinson make an unfortunate slip by calling Hammond \"Spreadshit Phil\".New hashtag is born! #SpreadshitPhil — Fraser Tyndall (@fraser_tyndall) March 9, 2017 Enjoyed Nick Robinson's Freudian slip on the Today Programme, calling Phillip Hammond 'Spreadshit Phil' rather than 'Spreadsheet Phil'! — Sam Holden (@sammyjets) March 9, 2017 Let's start a campaign to make spreadshit one of those words of the year. 2017's omnishambles. Wondering how to use it in a sentence https://t.co/DWu98QBhqM — Katie Allen (@KatieAllenGdn) March 9, 2017 At 8.58am, the presenter on @BBCRadio4 said 'spreadshit' rather than spreadsheet and it was glorious. — Annabel Giles (@Annabel_Giles) March 9, 2017 \nAll in all, the Chancellor hasn’t really had a great day of it, following his Budget speech. \nHe received a pasting on the front page of almost every publication on Thursday. \nThe Sun branded Hammond the “spite van man” for his “raid on the self-employed”, while the Daily Mail gave his joke bonanza short shrift, declaring the Budget “no laughing matter”. \nIn his first Budget since taking over as Chancellor last July, Hammond announced National Insurance contributions for the self-employed would go up by 2% by April 2019. \nThe move breaks a Tory election pledge to not raise National Insurance contributions, something they previously warned would “cost jobs and hit hardworking taxpayers”. \nIt is set to raise £2billion for the Treasury.
