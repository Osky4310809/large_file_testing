This news is all untrue. \n\"This season Shandong won't sign any new foreign players. We have already reduced the number of our foreign players by transferring or loaning them out. We have started our youth system development. \n\"How about we develop our own Fabregas?\" \nShandong's last high-profile foreign signing of note was Graziano Pelle, who joined the club from Southampton in June, and the Italy international helped the club avoid relegation at the end of a difficult campaign. \nShandong were champions in 1999, 2006, 2008 and 2010, but last year's struggles came as several clubs ramped up their spending on players from overseas. \nRecently, Fabregas said he planned to play in MLS rather than the Chinese Super League once his career in European football is over. \nMichael Church has written about Asian football for more than 20 years and mainly covers the Chinese game for ESPN FC.
