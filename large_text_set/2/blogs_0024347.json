It comes with 2GB or 1.5GB of RAM, depending on the market, and 16GB of expandable storage. The camera department includes a 13MP rear snapper and a 5MP front shooter, both accompanied by an LED flash. Connectivity-wise, the phone offers 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 and USB OTG. \nThe LG X power2 is being offered in four hues – Black Titan, Shiny Titan, Shiny Gold and Shiny Blue.
