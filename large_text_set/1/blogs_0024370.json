You can read Harbour’s full comments here: “Oh my god. Wow. This is unreal. I’m supposed to start talking, I’m sorry, I’m sick. On behalf of this fearless and talented cast, we would like to thank Netflix. Shawn, Matt, Ross, and the amazing casting director Carmen Cuba.\nI would just like to say that in light of all that’s going on in the world today, it’s difficult to celebrate the already-celebrated Stranger Things . But this award from you who take your craft seriously, and who earnestly believe, like me, that great acting can change the world, is a call to arms from our fellow craftsmen and women to go deeper — and through our art to battle against fear, self-centeredness, and exclusivity of our predominantly narcissistic culture. And through our craft to cultivate a more empathetic and understanding society by revealing intimate truths that serve as a forceful reminder to folks that when they feel broken, and afraid, and tired: They are not alone. We are united, in that we are all together on this horrible, painful, joyous, exciting, and mysterious ride that is being alive.\nNow, as we act in the continuing narrative of Stranger Things , we 1983 midwesterners, we will repel bullies! We will shelter freaks and outcasts, those who have no home. We will get past the lies. We will hunt monsters. And when we are at a loss amidst the hypocrisy and the casual violence of certain individuals and institutions, we will — as per Chief Jim Hopper — PUNCH SOME PEOPLE IN THE FACE when they seek to destroy the meek and the disenfranchised and the marginalized. And we will do it all with soul, with heart, and with joy. We thank you for this responsibility, thank you.”\nID: 10421851 ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/825900673485074432", "http://strangerthingscast.tumblr.com/post/156564202776/stranger-things-cast-vows-to-hunt-real", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/825905629587976192", "https://t.co/cTpSNsOptj"], "published": "2017-01-30T14:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T07:15:56.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
