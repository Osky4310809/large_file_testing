Responding to further assumptions about how he was raised and what being a 'real man' means in a blog post by Walsh, Manny notes that \"Being a man isn't about how 'tough' or 'masculine' you are… it's about taking care of the ones you love\". \nManny's dad also had a message for Walsh, writing, \"Let me first begin by telling you that I've always been there for my son and will ALWAYS be there for him. Not only am I proud of what he has accomplished but I'm more proud of the person he has become.\" That is, a role model taking down the pillars of toxic masculinity, and a master with a make-up wand.
