Despite the fact it was only available in flash sales on the company’s website and Flipkart, the Chinese manufacturer sold over one million units of the device in the 45 days since it launched in the country. This number will soon skyrocket, as the popular smartphone is now available in the offline market.\nThe company has announced that users are able to pre-order the device between March 14 – 17 at large format retailers and from March 16 – 21 at offline stores in Delhi, Jaipur, and Chandigarh. Sales will officially kick off a day after the pre-order period ends — March 18 for major retailers and March 22 at offline stores. The Note 4 will be available at 700 large format retail stores as well as at over 1,500 offline mom-and-pop stores.\nUnfortunately, you’ll have to pay a little more money if you decide to buy the Redmi Note 4 at an offline retail store. The most affordable model will set you back Rs. 11,499, while prices start at Rs. 9,999 when making a purchase online. Just in case you were wondering, the next flash sale for the device on Xiaomi’s website is scheduled for March 22.\nSee also: Xiaomi Mi 6 may launch with Snapdragon 821 due to 835 shortages 17 hours ago The Redmi Note 4 offers a lot for its price.
