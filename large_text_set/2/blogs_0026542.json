By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 28, 2017 4:29 PM Gajendra Chauhan wants Gurmehar kaur to apologise. \nAs the controversy deepens, people are coming up and taking their stance either with or against Gurmehar Kaur. The 20 year old has been in the news for quite some time now ever since she posted her video and also for her recent facebook post. Gajendra Chauhan who is the chairman of the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune has demanded an apology from Gurmehar for saying “Pakistan did not kill my father, the Kargil war did.” Chauhan in an interview with India Today, called Gurmehar’s Pakistan statement objectionable. He wants Kaur to prove that Pakistan did not kill her father and also that she is under politician’s influence. The Mahabharat actor also said, “Jabse hamari sarkaar aaie hai, bahot logon ke pait mein dard hai (Since the time out government ( BJP ) has come to power, someone or the other has issues with it).” \nYou may also want to watch- \nNot every one is thinking against Gurmehar Kaur, unlike celebrity figures like Virender Sehwag, Randeep Hooda, Yogeshwar Dutt eho are trolling the young girl, Bollywood ’s veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah came forward to support her. Following the controversy that has been taking place, Shah praised Gurmehar and slammed all those who are trolling her and called them ‘insensitive.’ Later actor Randeep Hooda justified his stance through a facebook post where he said, “Viru cracked a joke and I admit I laughed. Damn!! He is so witty and this is one of the other million things he’s said that has made me crack up. That was it!!” \nJust a few days after the alleged stoning at Ramjas College and the violence that followed, Gurmehar Kaur, daughter of the late Captain Mandeep Singh, martyr of 1999 Kargil War, had changed her Facebook display picture to one with her holding the placard saying, “I AM A STUDENT OF DELHI UNIVERSITY. I AM NOT AFRAID OF ABVP. I AM NOT ALONE. EVERY STUDENT OF INDIA IS WITH ME. #FIGHTBACKDU #STUDENTSAGAINSTABVP”. In 2016, she had participated in a video saying that Pakistan had not killed her dad, but the war did.
