And so my love affair with Publix began before I ever stepped through their door. \nNow Publix is my regular grocery store. I have a favorite Publix and a favorite cashier, who knows my children by name and remembers their birthdays too. Here are my top 10 reasons why shopping at Publix truly is a pleasure. So, What's the Deal with Publix? \nPublix is a Southern supermarket chain with locations in six states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Founded in Florida in the 1930s, they are the largest employee-owned grocery chain in the United States. Publix has built its good reputation on making shopping pleasurable (their slogan is literally \"Publix: Where Shopping Is a Pleasure\") and they more than deliver on this promise by making shopping easier, faster, and more pleasant. 10 Reasons Publix Is the Best Grocery Store Ever \nIf you've ever been to Publix, then you will understand all of these things on a deep, personal level. Oct 17, 2016 at 8:06am PDT 1. Every employee is incredibly nice and helpful. \nCustomer service is a key component of the Publix mission statement that actually comes through in their stores. My go-to location has managers and cashiers who know me by name. Ms. Tina, my favorite cashier, knows both my children by name, and remembers the things I buy frequently and reminds me when they are on sale. Butchers and seafood managers will cut, trim, or scale anything you need and don't roll their eyes at me when I'm looking for two steaks that are nearly identical for a photo shoot.

The aisles are also well-organized and wide enough to accommodate the boat-sized buggies my children love. (Image credit: Meghan Splawn ) 3. Their seasonal displays are fun and useful. \nSeasonal displays at Publix aren't just full of food stuff and candy — they also display cooking equipment, cards, and gifts you might need or want for holiday seasons. This is especially useful when I need a quick teacher's gift for an obscure holiday. (Image credit: Meghan Splawn ) 4. Publix brand is really great. \nThe store brand from chain to chain can be hit or miss, but having relied on the Publix store brand for everything from foil to frozen corn, I can attest to the awesomeness of their store brand products. This includes their deli and bakery items too. (Image credit: Lauren Volo ) 5. Their fried chicken is legendary. \nFried chicken is synonymous with Southern cuisine, so I was quite surprised when several Southern-born friends declared Publix fried chicken the best. I was doubtful that supermarket chicken could be better than some of the South's best restaurants, but y'all, Publix fried chicken is really good . It's got juicy meat with a crisp exterior and just the right amount of spice. \nI love Publix fried chicken so much that we even served it at our wedding. (Image credit: Meghan Splawn ) 6. Publix bakery is top-notch. \nBaked-in-house breads, cakes, cookies, and doughnuts from Publix are delicious and high-quality. Their cakes are so beloved that many Southern brides use Publix bakery to make their wedding cakes, and people get excited when they see a Publix cake at a birthday party. Nov 3, 2016 at 12:15pm PDT 7. Their subs are super too. \nPublix stores basically have a small sub shop set up right next to their deli and bakery. Using their fresh-baked bread, they will build you a monstrous sub sandwich better than any sub-sandwich chain and just the way you like it. Their subs have something of a cult following with several local and national news outlets naming Publix their best local sub shop. Aug 26, 2016 at 3:13pm PDT 8. Publix is home to the Apron Cooking School. \nEvery Publix location has an Apron Cooking School kiosk where easy-to-recreate recipes are cooked and sampled live with an instructor. Next to the cooking demo you'll find all the ingredients you need for that recipe and a recipe card. Recipe cards can be found throughout the stores for dinner ideas or even how to cook with seasonal produce. \nI can't think of another grocery store that wants to make getting dinner on the table better for the home cook. (Image credit: Apartment Therapy ) 9. Online ordering makes shopping at Publix faster. \nLong before Instacart, Publix created their own online ordering to make shopping faster. Instead of waiting at the deli for my sliced meat, I order online before I leave the house and pick my order up from a cooler case next to the meat and cheese counter. Sep 19, 2016 at 8:28am PDT 10. BOGO is a thing of beauty. \n\"Buy One, Get One Free\" is the most-used sale tactic at Publix, and it most often applies to pantry staples. This allows you to stock up on favorites while they are on sale and save on your grocery bill. They also frequently have 10 for $10 sales on seasonal produce, so making a big batch of roasted tomatoes is easy and affordable in the summer. \nDo you shop at Publix?
