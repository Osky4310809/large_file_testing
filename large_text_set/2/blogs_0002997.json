We were so proud when we saw Handler at the Women’s March, and her emotional response to the election results was way too relatable. Now, we’ve learned that Chelsea Handler gets political for all the right reasons.\nTBH, why Chelsea Handler gets political is so, so inspiring, and SO important. A video posted by Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) on Feb 1, 2017 at 6:32am PST \nAt the end of the day, Handler explained, she feels responsible to those more marginalized than she is. “I am a white woman of a lot of privilege. I make a lot of money, and I don’t have a lot of problems. And a lot of what this administration has proposed thus far, won’t even affect me personally.” In the video, she continues, explaining that she takes pride in the fact that our country is meant to be accepting and welcoming to people from all over, and she doesn’t want to let us lose that. “I know that this country is based on inclusiveness, on welcoming people, on loving people, that are not like you. On not worrying about how something impacts your life personally, but how it impacts all the people around you, and all the people that aren’t around you.” Yes, yes, and more yes! TBH, we’re so proud of Handler. It can be hard to talk politics 24/7. It’s draining, it’s not fun, and it can be straight up miserable. But it’s something we just can’t afford to ignore, especially not now! We’ve got to find the right balance between self care and fighting the good fight, and we believe it’s possible for us to get this all figured out if we just work together.\nH/T Bustle \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:40:08.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
