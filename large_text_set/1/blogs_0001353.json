Getting fitter, happier, healthier ... wanting more love in your lives? Well, that's the one thing that connects all of us ... that need to look ahead, positively. Even if you think your favourite Bollywood celebrities have lives wildly different than yours, you'll find that their wants and needs, and therefore, their resolutions will be quite similar to what you've thought out. Have a look at what some stars have resolved to do in 2017. \nSophie Choudry: My aim every year is to work harder but in 2017, it is going to be to work smarter! This year flew by so I'm going to make the most of every single day in the coming year. Travel to new places, release more songs and do something unexpected! \nRicha Chadha : In the coming year, I would just want be healthy, wealthy and more, wise. \nAishwarya Sakhuja: Every time I promise something to myself, I tend to break it. But, taking into consideration my beloved fathers advice, I will try to become a better person and evolve as a nicer human being in 2017. I have been shying away from adopting a pet for myself, because I always fear that I am never home and would not be able to take care of it. With this New Year, I really feel that I will be able to strike a balance with my work and personal life. I will be able adopt a new pet as a new family member. \nTaapsee Pannu: With the New Year, I surely plan to increase my patience level. I'll try not to lose my temper easily with people. \nShweta Tripathi: With the New Year, I plan to make the resolution to help and create awareness about issues that the world needs to address before it falls apart. \nPrince Narula: 2016 has been a good year for me and I would like to work harder in the coming year. I concentrated on my acting this year but in 2017 I will concentrate on my singing too. Soon my first single will be out, hence I'm excited for the 2017.
