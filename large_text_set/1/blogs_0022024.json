More by Nick Vadala \nZoos and aquariums throughout America engaged in a little friendly competition on Wednesday with #CuteAnimalTweetOff, a social-media-based battle to see whose animals are most adorable. \nAnd, if you ask us, the Philadelphia Zoo came out on top. \nThe competition began, Mashable reports , when the Smithsonian’s National Zoo put out a press release detailing the birth of a new gray seal: \nWe welcomed a gray seal pup Jan. 21. The pup appears to be nursing, moving & bonding well w/ mom. https://t.co/l0Bzu7g8ek \nNational Zoo (@NationalZoo) January 25, 2017 \nSarah Hill (@SarahJanetHill) January 25, 2017 \n@SarahJanetHill #challengeaccepted We see @NationalZoo 's seal pup, and raise an otter/osprey combo. pic.twitter.com/D9zDWXxuDb \n— Virginia Aquarium (@VAAquarium) January 25, 2017 \nFrom there, a furiously adorable battle erupted between the National Zoo and the Virginia Aquarium: \n. @VAAquarium This is Redd, our endangered Bornean orangutan infant. And he is the cutest. Do you fold yet? #challengeaccepted pic.twitter.com/ED6WiZun1R \n— National Zoo (@NationalZoo) January 25, 2017 \n@NationalZoo Don't worry, we're still here. pic.twitter.com/0Qm9dcvMD9 \n— Virginia Aquarium (@VAAquarium) January 25, 2017 \nAfter that point, other zoos throughout the United States joined in, including the Philadelphia Zoo. They started things off with a photo of a baby gorilla — a strong opener: \n— Philadelphia Zoo (@phillyzoo) January 25, 2017 \nThen, on to a video of an aye-aye: \n— Philadelphia Zoo (@phillyzoo) January 25, 2017 \nPlus a red panda for good measure: \nThis #cuteanimaltweetoff can't handle the red panda cuteness! pic.twitter.com/8oSG3SmaZd \n— Philadelphia Zoo (@phillyzoo) January 25, 2017 \nLogan the ring-tailed lemur was next: \n— Philadelphia Zoo (@phillyzoo) January 25, 2017 \nFollowed by a GIF of some black-and-white ruffed lemurs, which had our zoo all \"tuckered out\": \n— Philadelphia Zoo (@phillyzoo) January 25, 2017 \nA sentiment with which the Phoenix Zoo agreed: \n— Phoenix Zoo (@PhoenixZoo) January 25, 2017 \nA fierce battle, to be sure, but when the ammunition is photos and videos of adorable animals, we’re all winners.
