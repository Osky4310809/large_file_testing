A powerful Pacific storm blew into southern and central California on Friday, unleashing wind-driven heavy rains that forecasters said could become the strongest in years if not decades. Santa Barbara County Fire Department via AP Mike Eliason 1 of 2 By VERONICA ROCHA, HAILEY BRANSON-POTTS, MELISSA ETEHAD AND MICHAEL FINNEGAN Los Angeles Times LOS ANGELES \nA storm that forecasters warned could be the most powerful in years barreled into Southern California on Friday, flooding freeways, causing landslides and downing trees and power lines. \nOne man was killed in the San Fernando Valley Friday afternoon when power lines fell on him. Nearly 100,000 people across the region were without power as the winds toppled electrical lines. Scores of trees also fell. \nThe National Weather Service issued flood warning for a large swath of Los Angeles County including Long Beach, Lakewood, southeast L.A, the San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys, Pasadena and Burbank. The alert last through 8 p.m. \nMajor flooding was reported in Goleta and the area around Santa Barbara Airport. The 101 Freeway at Seacliff in Ventura County was closed because of heavy rain and runoff. \nIn West Los Angeles, the 405 Freeway and 90 Freeway were also gridlocked by floodwaters. The 5 Freeway near Sheldon Street was also flooded. The 110 Freeway was closed on both directions in South L.A. at Slauson Avenue. \nFlooded streets and freeway transition roads were also reported across the region. \nWind gusts reached up to 81 mph in Los Angeles County mountains Friday, according to the National Weather Service. \nEvacuation orders were issued for areas where brush fires hit last summer, with officials worried about the potential for mudslides. Among the areas evacuated was a section of Duarte. \nThe majority of residents - 103 people - decided to stay indoors despite the city of Duarte's evacuation order, according to deputy personnel on site, who are currently going door to door asking residents who stayed to sign a waiver. \nAs light rain fell on Alex Alarcon's baseball cap, the Duarte resident spoke about why he decided to stay in his home despite the city's evacuation order. \nHe had left work early Friday morning and planned to spend the night at a hotel with his wife, two children and dogs but decided against it when he noticed around 1 p.m. that the rain wasn't coming down as hard as he had initially thought. \nAlarcon, who has lived in the area for six years, said that his home had a brush with mudslides not too long ago. \n\"I had mud sticking to the sidewalk right near my house,\" he said, pointing to an area around his mailbox. \nBut Alarcon wasn't too worried about Friday's storm. He and his family felt content about staying home. \nIn the San Bernardino County mountains, a landslide the size of three football fields was threatening several homes, a fire station and a major road used by hundreds of residents, fire officials said. \nFour homes and a San Bernardino County fire station in the unincorporated community of Forest Falls are directly in the path of the hillside, which started moving about 10 a.m. Thursday, fire department spokesman Eric Sherwin said. \nTwo homes were vacant, and residents in the other two homes have voluntarily evacuated. Fire officials have removed equipment from the station to protect it from damage, he said. \nThe landslide is 300 yards wide and extends 1,000 feet from top to bottom in the Slide Canyon area, according to Sherwin. \nLike a glacier, pieces of the hillside have been slowly breaking off and dropping into a drainage below. \n\"It's a lot of material,\" he said, \"but it has a long time to come down.\" \nBut firefighters worry that Friday's powerful storm could hasten the process. \nIf the hillside - a mixture of snow, rock, soil and timber - travels down, it will spill onto Valley of the Falls Drive - a major road for residents living in the area. The blockage could trap a couple hundred residents for several days, Sherwin said. \nThe San Bernardino County road crews were placing concrete barriers along the drive to help divert mud and debris, he said. \nThe Los Angeles Fire Department was responding to dozens of reports Friday of downed power lines, including one instance in which a person died after suffering an electric shock. \nThe incident occurred at 12:43 p.m. in Sherman Oaks, fire department spokesman Erik Scott said. \nFew details were available, but Scott said a large tree toppled onto power lines and landed on a vehicle. \nIt is unclear whether the victim was inside the vehicle, he said. \nFirefighters turned off the power and cleared an area to rescue the victim, who was in serious condition and taken to a hospital, Scott said. \nThe Knott's Berry Farm amusement park in Buena Park closed Friday. \nPeople who bought entry tickets for Friday may contact the park regarding refunds, Knott's said in a statement. \nSouthwest Airlines canceled hundreds of flights in and out of California on Friday. \nAbout 250 of the airline's flights to or from Burbank, Los Angeles, Orange County, San Francisco and San Diego, among others, were canceled Friday, an airline spokesperson said. \nAmerican Airlines also canceled a host of flights to and from Orange County, and the aviation website flightaware.com reported 48 cancellations at Los Angeles International Airport. \nTrains were delayed at Union Station Friday evening because of storm activity. \nThe storm, part of a warm \"atmospheric river,\" was swollen with moisture and poised to pour rain onto burn-scarred areas in local mountains and foothills. \nBetween 2 and 6 inches of rain was expected to fall over the next 24 hours, depending on the area, with some seeing rainfall at a pace of an inch an hour - the kind of isolated, heavy downpour that can send mud and debris flows cascading into neighborhood streets. \nSnow levels are anticipated to be at 8,000 feet Friday night, lowering to 6,000 feet on Saturday, according to the weather service. Because of the heavy precipitation, 1 to 2 feet of snow could fall above 8,000 feet in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and 6 to 12 inches are possible above 6,000 feet. \nAfter a brief respite Sunday, another storm system is expected to move into the region early next week, bringing several more days of rain, forecasters said.
