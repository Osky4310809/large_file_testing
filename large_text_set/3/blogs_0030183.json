Unlike its fellow studios, DICE isn’t well-known for single-player prowess; the press-F style of its flagship Battlefield series isn’t exactly a bastion of narrative creativity. \nBattlefront 2 critically needs a stellar campaign. The offline options of its older brother were fair diversions from the multiplayer main course, but even the bot-filled Skirmish and challenging Survival modes were largely ornamental testing grounds for a new weapon or Star Card unlock. That doesn’t leave much room for a lackluster campaign. \nMissions need substance beyond a gilded conveyor belt, and they need flexibility for different tactics and playstyles. The constant strife between Jedi, Sith, Empire, and Republic is a sturdy enough stage to eschew an overarching plot if necessary; a mix of Battlefield 1’s episodic style and Battlefield Hardline’s talented voice acting would be grand. The lauded Galactic Conquest mode from Pandemic’s original Battlefront is a prime example of impact, where entire planets could be captured and an army’s power and supplies hinged on victories or losses. Whatever DICE decides upon doesn’t have to be a cookie-cut copy of what worked before, but it has to be long, fun, and engaging to stick. No pressure. A great war in Star Wars \nIt doesn’t take much to pick up any of Battlefront’s assorted carbines, pistols, or rifles and swing into a slaying spree. Intimate weapon familiarity wavers beside forgivably slim recoil patterns and soft health bars. Acing squads or gunning down the Emperor and his stupid lightning jazz-hands feels simple. Surprise! It’s meant to be . \nDispensing complexity for the sake of accessibility ultimately hampered Battlefront’s appeal to a larger shooter crowd. Battlefront 2 doesn’t need to blindly oblige hardcore enthusiasts in turn, but it does stand to benefit from a blend of approachability and depth. Something as singular as a variation of Battlefield’s attachment system would provide players the added flexibility of customizing their weapons. Expanding the Star Card system with side grade assortments (perhaps a short-range hover version of the Jump Pack or cookable, low-yield grenades) would help shape spontaneous role-shaping a la Team Fortress 2. \nIt’s fine if the actual feel of shooting Battlefront 2’s guns stays the same—lasers are literally straightforward compared to bullets, after all. The low-entry, high-skill formula proven in successful shooters such as Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege could be comfortably accommodated with Battlefront 2’s scale. Its players should be encouraged with a sense of self-improvement and a drive to return and hone their talents. Modular maps \nIn designing Battlefront’s maps, DICE tailored specific maps for specific modes: Hoth’s sprawling Outpost Beta for the 40-man Supremacy or Walker Assault, Tatooine’s circular Rebel Depot for the smaller Blast or Cargo Run, and so on. This whittled down the selection of maps for a chosen mode to a scant few. Out of the 13 maps included at launch, only four supported Supremacy and Walker Assault. Such a meager rotation grew stale fast and stifled players who preferred only a few match types. \nBattlefront 2 should instead adopt the interchangeable design seen in DLC maps such as Twilight on Hoth or Scarif’s beach base. Slicing large maps into smaller sections to appropriately fit each mode should greatly bolster map variety and avoid sending players to the shallow end of the pool if they only want to play one or two modes. A DLC plan embracing free map updates to keep the community together wouldn’t hurt.
