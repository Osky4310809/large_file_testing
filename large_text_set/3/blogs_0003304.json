Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLuis Enrique confirmed on Wednesday evening that he will step down as Barcelona boss at the end of the season. \nSpeculation over his future at the Nou Camp had been ramping up in recent weeks, with the 4-0 Champions League defeat to Paris-Saint Germain seeing the speculation reach fever pitch. \nAnd while the scramble is on for Barca to find a new boss, what next for Luis Enrique? \nThe Spaniard has won eight trophies (so far) in his three-year spell in charge of the Catalans and will likely be in demand when he decides to test himself in management again. \nBut where will that be? Here are five possible destinations for the soon-to-be ex-Barca boss. Arsenal Wenger's future at Arsenal remains unclear (Photo: Arsenal FC) \nIn case you haven't been paying attention for the last few years, you may have heard that some Arsenal fans want their manager out. \nAnd true to form, Gunners fans reacted to the news that Enrique was leaving Barca by flocking to social media and imploring the Frenchman to take the job at the Nou Camp. \nSo far, so predictable. \nBut should a Wenger-sized vacancy appear at the Emirates, then Enrique's name could well come up as a contender for the job. He's won domestic and European trophies, is used to dealing with big name players and understands the culture of a club, so ticks plenty of boxes.

Should the Arsenal boss call it a day at the Emirates come the end of the season, then would feasibly start a coaching carousel across Europe. \nThere are plenty of rumours linking Max Allegri with a move to Arsenal which would leave another high-profile vacancy at the Serie A champions. \nA move to Italy would also present Enrique with an opportunity to prove some of his critics wrong, following his disappointing two-year spell at Roma, which saw him leave the club after failing to qualify for Europe.
