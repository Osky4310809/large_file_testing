According to Jordan Schultz of the Huffington Post, Indiana has offered the 52-year-old a seven-year, $31 million contract. ESPN's Jeff Goodman countered the claim, however, reporting there has not yet been an offer. Alford is in his fourth season with UCLA, leading the team to a No. 3 seed in the current NCAA tournament. The Bruins will face Cincinnati in the Round of 32 Sunday night. Prior to his time at UCLA, Alford also coached Missouri State, Iowa and New Mexico. In 22 years as a head coach, he has put together a 480-250 record. One of his biggest draws, however, could be his familiarity with the Indiana program. Alford played for the Hoosiers from 1983 to 1987, was a two-time All-American and helped lead the squad to a national championship in 1987, the most recent of the school's five titles. Considering his son, Bryce, is a senior this season, it could be a perfect time for the coach to make a career change. Indiana parted ways with Tom Crean Thursday after seven years with the team.
