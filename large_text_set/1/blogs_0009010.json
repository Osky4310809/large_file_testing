AP file photo \nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will meet with President Duterte in Manila this week and visit his hometown and possibly even his own home in Davao. \nAbe will be the first head of state to visit the Philippines under the Duterte administration. \nThe President’s spokesperson Ernesto Abella said Abe would be at Malacañang on Thursday and in Davao on Friday. ADVERTISEMENT \n“Apparently, they have struck a certain resonant chord between the two of them. Apparently, Prime Minister Abe wants to visit the President’s house,” Abella said in a press briefing. \nMr. Duterte and Abe will talk about regional issues, business, and counterterrorism concerns, said Abella. \nThe Japanese prime minister will also meet with members of the business sector in Manila and in Davao, he said. \nPresidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said the Philippines is expected to reciprocate Japan’s warm welcome of Mr. Duterte during his Tokyo visit in October when Abe visits the country. Andanar said the two heads of state hit it off really well in Tokyo. \nThe banquet hosted by Abe lasted longer than usual, Andanar said, with the Japanese prime minister even posing for a picture flashing Mr. Duterte’s signature clenched fist. \n“It won’t just be a strengthening of ties, but a very, very warm visit and a very, very warm welcome,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:14:51.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
