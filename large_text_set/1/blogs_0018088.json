However, if you are a fan of Indian authors, there is quite the bonanza in store for you. With two major adaptations releasing this year (read a little more to see which!), we've put together an entire list of Indian-authored books that were made in Hollywood blockbusters. Make sure you read the books before the movie releases, and re-watch some of the other classics that have already made their mark as hit films, internationally.

It takes him twenty-five years to find his family again, with a lot of help from Google maps and vague childhood recollections of his hometown. The Hollywood adaption of the book stars Nichole Kidman, as his adoptive mother and Dev Patel, as Saroo. Victoria and Abdul (September 2017) \nVictoria and Abdul is the story of Abdul Karim who arrived in England at the age of twenty-f0ur to serve tables during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee celebrations. He soon found himself as one of the closet confidantes of the Queen and their growing closeness almost causes a revolt in the British household. A Hollywood version of the story, Victoria and Abdul , is all set to release in September and it stars Judi Dench as Queen Victoria and Ali Fazal as Abdul Karim. Midnight's Children (2012) \nSalman Rushdie's 1981-novel is about India's transition from British rule to Independence.
