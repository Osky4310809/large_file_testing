The couples jetted off to a range of locations; the only one worth mentioning is John and Debbie are going to Samoa, because the producers are hilariously evil. I’m already predicting that John will come home alone while Debbie is desperately chasing after a Samoan guy 20 years her junior, screaming, “COME BACK POLYNESIAN!” So do you guys happen to remember the other couples that got married last week ? Neither. So let’s break down the first episode of honeymoons briefly.\nID: 10479000 Nine Network\nBoy oh boy he’s talked for a long time.\nNine Network\n Andy and Vanessa: Andy started exercising his vocal chords, and apparently it took him two separate drinks to finish his story about how he finds it hard to meet girls. But hey, at least he’s talking.\nSimon and Alene: Alene is still horrified by Simon’s curly hair, but thinks he’s a real nice guy. The two went dancing and seemed to have a nice time. They’re nice. It’s all nice.\nSean and Susan: Honestly, these two are so cute they make me want to hurl.\nJonathan and Cheryl: Jonathan the entrepreneur seemed to think once Cheryl was wearing a bikini that they’d finally have a good conversation. Jonathan, a lot of the time, makes as much sense as his job. “I feel like you’re not the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen,” Cheryl kindly told Jonathan. He was real pissed off, because apparently no girl has ever told him like it is before.\nAnthony and Nadia: Poor Anthony went in for another kiss, and Nadia was still like, “wow stop moving so fast, I need to take this slow!!” Nadia! You got married! To a stranger! If you wanted to take things slow, try eHarmony next time!\nID: 10485372 View this image ›\nNine Network Michael and Scarlett: Michael waited until the two were on their honeymoon before telling Scarlett he was a stripper. Scarlett wasn’t stoked, but took the news surprisingly well. Michael reassured her that he had Tuesday afternoons free and even Sundays! So Scarlett is lucky! Things fell apart later though when the two disagreed on moving cities. This lead Michael to tell Scarlett he felt they were heading down a friend path and she was all “Well you’re the fakest person I’ve ever met”. Yep. The fakest.\nThe twins and their husbands: Sharon and Bogan Nick were disgustingly happy, and Michelle seemed to slowly be warming to Jesse. Sharon did confess to Nick that she’s cheated in the past, and that is his one greatest hate. So that drama was a clickbaited “to be continued” with dramatic af music for Wednesday’s episode.\nJohn and Debbie: John told Debbie he wanted to move into another apartment because he was getting on her nerves. “I don’t know why you have to dramatise everything,” Debbie said, forgetting she was the one that brought a whole Polynesian army to her wedding. Debbie then got upset and ran off, and had the most AMAZING spiel about getting nothing she wanted. “All they had to do was put an ad out to get them (Polynesian men), and they could have interviewed 100 and got one! I got nothing I wanted! I got an orange cake. It wasn’t even gluten-free.” Honestly, give Debbie a Logie for that performance.\nID: 10485224 Nine Network\nNine Network\n ID: 10485264 7. The Lauren and Andrew saga. Nine Network\nNine Network\n Lauren was finally tracked down. She was blindfolded, thrown into a van, and forced into a warehouse with Andrew and psychologist John Aiken. Joking, but she did come in laughing like a maniac, as though dumping your groom and never texting him again is the most hysterical thing to have ever happened. Lauren didn’t give any valid reasons as to why she ran away, and was actually willing to give it all another shot, and Andrew was like “this bitch is fucking cray”. Sadly, the curtain fell on their short-lived romance.\nID: 10485466 8. Wednesday: The first dinner party (if you’re still reading hey, thanks, I’ll try to make this as short as Jonathan). Nine Network\nNine Network\n The episode started with more honeymoon footage being shown, blah blah, everyone was in paradise, Sharon and Nick made up and won’t stop making out, etc.\nJonathan is still fucking pissed that Cheryl had the nerve to express she’s not that into him. Nadia’s really happy with her “friend” Anthony. Maybe one day soon she’ll realise she’s ~married~ to him. John’s not wearing his wedding ring and decided he’s not putting it on until things improve with Debbie, which will be never. And as the dinner party kicked off, the psychologists watched from a secret room, in some creepy A-type shit from Pretty Little Liars .\nAndrew rocked up minus Lauren, and of course everyone wanted to know what happened. He gathered the crew, and began his story, and Anthony had a LOT of opinions on it. “There’s NO excuse for that,” he said, as though he was talking about Andrew, but I nearly feel like it was directed at Nadia. “NO EXCUSE to not give it a try!!! You know what you’ve signed up for!! Nadia?? Are you listening to this rant??”\nNow strap yourselves in my friends, this just continues to get worse. Jonathan and Scarlett started to hit it off, bonding over the fact they’re republican, pro-life, AND THEY LOVE TRUMP. No you did not read that wrong. “He’s gonna be soooo good for them,” Scarlett drawled in her weird hybrid accent. I’m now terrified to read Scarlett’s future book.\nCheryl, a 25-year-old, decided she had more life experience than John and Debbie with their 53 years on Earth. “You’d be stupid not to give your marriage a go,” Cheryl said, ignoring her actual match Jonathan, while he stared lovingly at Trump photos on his phone. Debbie was outraged she was not getting the respect she deserved from her younger counterparts, then proceeded to chuck a Lauren, and vacated faster than you could say “Polynesian.”\nSean and Susan literally couldn’t keep their eyes off each other, Alene was pleasantly surprised that her and Simon weren’t the worst couple so far, and Scarlett started telling people Michael was a stripper but he didn’t want anyone to know. Cheryl and Jonathan ended the night with a fight, and Scarlett by name and nature, zeroed in on him to try and make Michael jealous. Ahhhh, blissful, blissful marriages. Who said romance was dead?\nID: 10487082 9. Next week: the couples meet up with the psychologists who ruined their lives, and one person walks out. FOR GOOD. Nine Network\nMe watching the show next week.\nNine Network\n Spoiler: It’s not actually me, but you never know.\nID: 10494001 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!\nTahlia Pritchard is a senior writer for BuzzFeed and is based in Sydney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:31:29.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
