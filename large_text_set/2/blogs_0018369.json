The city is requesting that Lamar remove this illegal sign immediately.\" \n“Lamar and Sprint have wasted taxpayer dollars by forcing us to defend the integrity of our city's scenic hillsides in court, and they have been in clear and blatant violation of our zoning and building code laws,” Mr. Peduto added. \n“It's beyond time for Lamar and Sprint to step up and do the right thing, remove this illegal sign, and come back to the table to propose a permanent reuse of the historic Mount Washington sign. They must remove what has become an embarrassing eyesore.\" \nJonathan Kamin, attorney for Lamar, said the company was reviewing the decision and evaluating its options. \"We haven't seen or heard anything from the city,\" he said, \nThe Sprint banner, affixed to one of the city's most prominent and historic advertising spaces on the face of Mount Washington, created a stir when it was first erected. \nThe law department sent cease-and-desist letters ordering the removal of the sign. The Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections also issued a notice of violation stating the sign was put up without a permit. \nAt the time, Mr. Kamin said that the use was permitted and in compliance with the applicable codes, an argument the zoning board rejected. \nAccording to the board's decision, the sign structure has been in place since at least 1933 and has been exclusively used for electronic messaging since then. Bayer ended its use of the sign in 2014. \n\"The board unequivocally rejects Lamar's unsupported and unsupportable contentions that the installation of the 7,200 square foot vinyl sign on the sign structure was no different than changing the advertising copy on any of its other 900 billboards in the city and that Lamar had 'explicit rights’ to install the vinyl sign,\" its decision stated. \nMark Belko: mbelko@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1262.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:35:24.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
