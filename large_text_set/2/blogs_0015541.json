Australian cricket captain Steve Smith was an early investor. Advertisement \nNow the company has launched in San Francisco and secured investment from powerhouse start-up accelerator Y Combinator, whose previous proteges include Airbnb, Dropbox and Reddit. \nMr Kearney said things were moving fast. \"In less than 10 months Snappr has gone from us brainstorming ideas over a coffee in a back alley in Ultimo, to launching in the US whilst being backed by the top startup accelerator in the world,\" he said. \"But if things aren't moving quickly, then it's not much of a start-up.\" \nDr Schiller said winning backing from Y Combinator is \"the ultimate for a start-up in its early days. The power and the benefit of YC is not the money they invest ... but the network they bring and their amazing partners.\" \nCompleting degrees in medicine and philosophy might be enough to keep some people busy, but Dr Schiller founded the EasyChem website for HSC students and the Australian Medical Student Journal while studying. \nIt was also at university that he and Mr Kearney showed early entrepreneurial flair, founding GownTown, now the country's largest online graduation retailer. \nThey offered photography along with academic dress, which proved popular with customers. \"That got us thinking, 'Why aren't we doing this for all photography?'\" Dr Schiller said. \nSnappr is the latest development to disrupt the industry, with critics saying it undervalues professional photography. But Mr Kearney said today's photography businesses would not exist without the digital camera, \"which had a hugely disruptive effect [on] businesses that came before them\". \n\"I see what we do as part of the constant and unavoidable evolution of photography, which has always existed as the intersection between art and technology,\" he said. \"We see ourselves as creating a better way for people everywhere to get access to the art of photography.\" \nThe market seems to like it, with Snappr almost doubling its number of bookings in Australia every month. The buzz around the company has grown since 60,000 people used its photo analyser tool on their LinkedIn profile pictures this year. \nThe team has plans to expand the business throughout the US and will soon unleash its photo analyser on users of the dating app Tinder. \nJust as Thomas Edison described genius as one per cent inspiration and 99 per cent perspiration, Dr Schiller put Snappr's flying start down to \"99 per cent hard work and execution\". \n\"The reality of all the successful start-ups I know from Sydney is that the one ingredient for success is not having a super clever idea, or getting the smartest people, it's just about ruthlessly good execution, sticking at it, and a lot of hard work,\" he said. \nDr Schiller, who spent his first years after graduation as a consultant with McKinsey, said he one day hopes to combine his \"two loves - medicine and health, and start-up life\". \n\"I've definitely caught the start-up bug,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:31:04.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
