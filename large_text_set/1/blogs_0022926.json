Along with policy advisor Stephen Miller, Bannon reportedly helped craft President Trump’s inauguration speech, wrote many of Trump’s executive orders, and urged Trump to take a combative aproach with Mexico and the media. \nThe former Breitbart executive is a strong proponent of Trump’s populist platform. He reportedly told a Daily Beast writer in 2013 that he is a “Leninist,” and wants to “bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T06:59:14.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
