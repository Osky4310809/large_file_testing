It started with BSP chief Mayawati who was astounded by the size of the mandate that BJP had won in the UP polls. Despite not providing any concrete evidence, she cast aspersions on the EVMs and challenged BJP to hold the elections again with paper ballots.\nSubsequently, Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP jumped into the fray and expressed doubts about the EVMs used in the Punjab polls – some had predicted an AAP sweep in Punjab, but the party ended up as a distant second to winner Congress. Now Kejriwal is insisting on switching to paper ballots for the upcoming municipal polls in Delhi in April.\nNeedless to say these allegations of EVM tampering are preposterous. Such allegations have been made before and hitherto none of those making the allegations have been able to prove their charge. In fact, after the 2009 general elections the Election Commission had made available 100 of its EVMs for any of the parties to prove their allegation of tampering. But they simply couldn’t make their case. The Election Commission has repeated affirmed that EVMs used in polls are not only tamper-proof but that individual machines aren’t connected to a network. The latter means that a mammoth number of EVMs has to be tampered across constituencies to make any meaningful difference to the election result – an improbable proposition.\nBesides, what’s bemusing is that those making allegations of EVM tampering have previously won elections conducted through the voting machines – both AAP in Delhi and BSP in UP have benefited from earlier EVM-compliant polls. Plus, there’s no denying the fact that EVMs have drastically reduced electoral malpractices. Gone are those paper ballot days when booth capturing, ghost voting and ballot box stuffing were frequently reported from polls across the country. Hence, EVMs have certainly strengthened the Indian electoral process.\nWhich is why casting aspersions on EVMs and by extension on the electoral process is dangerous for Indian democracy. In these social media-driven post-truth times it’s extremely easy to defame the voting exercise without any concrete proof. And if things continue in this direction and losing parties regularly question election results, we will end up like Bangladesh where the electorally defeated lot never accept the people’s mandate and refuse to occupy the opposition benches in Parliament. Hence, Indian political parties should be responsible and mature, and refrain from making loose allegations about EVM tampering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T07:52:26.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
