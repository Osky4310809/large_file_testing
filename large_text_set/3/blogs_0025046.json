All rights reserved. \nRefining those defensive skills has been a primary focus for Diaz this spring. He arrived in Jupiter three weeks before his scheduled report date to get some extra work with Wong. \n“With that guy, it’s pretty easy,” Wong said. “He’s really good, really consistent at where he throws the ball, so it’s easy for me to turn (a double play) and I know once I give it to him he’s going to turn the double play.” \nOnce camp began, Diaz spent extra time working with Cardinals infield instructor Jose Oquendo and Hall of Fame guest instructor Ozzie Smith, concentrating on the mental aspects of the position, knowing both the hitter’s and pitcher’s tendencies to better anticipate each play. \n“I think last year I had a little problem with my first step, and then I had to hurry a little bit with my throws. So this year I try to have the chance to go forward and have that extra step and throw with patience to first base,” Diaz said. \nThe work is paying off. Diaz has yet to commit an error this spring and is hitting .269 following Thursday’s double in the Cardinals’ 5-3 victory over the Marlins. \nDiaz ended last season hitting an even .300. The hand injury that robbed him of the entire month of August is completely healed. \nTo keep Diaz’s bat in the lineup, the Cardinals shifted Peralta to third base. Thus far, Diaz’s play hasn’t given the Cardinals any reason to reconsider the decision. \n“He’s got that look to him like he belongs,” Matheny said. “He still knows there’s things he wants to work on, be better at, but I think he’s also answered that question to himself that makes him feel like he belongs.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:28:30.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
