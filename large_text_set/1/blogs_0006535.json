And it seems that Lil Uzi Vert is the first person to ensure that these visual hallmarks will live on in 2017 with his new video “Ps & Qs,” a manic new music video that takes the app’s now infamous ‘googly eye’ look to horrific new heights.\nThe video depicts Uzi at a school in Japan, wherein he becomes involved in a fight with his nemesis to save his girlfriend named Brittany. This is all told using the aforementioned Snapchat filters as well as frequent forays into the world of actual anime, lending a different visual style seemingly every 30 seconds.\n“Ps & Qs” initially appeared on Uzi’s mixtape Lil Uzi Vert Vs. the World which dropped last spring, but in the time since he also managed to release the full-length The Perfect LUV Tape . Stay tuned to see where Uzi heads this year.\nStream Lil Uzi Vert’s 2016 full length Lil Uzi Vert Vs. the World below via Spotify:\n\nIn other music news, Travis Scott has announced his third official album titled Astroworld .
