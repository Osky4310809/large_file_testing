By Nadra Kareem Nittle Updated December 29, 2016 . \nInstitutional racism is defined as racism perpetrated by government entities such as schools, the courts or the military. Unlike the racism perpetrated by individuals, institutional racism has the power to negatively affect the bulk of people belonging to a racial group. \nWhile individual Americans may harbor racist feelings about certain groups, racism in the United States would not have thrived if institutions hadn’t perpetuated discrimination against people of color for centuries. The institution of slavery kept blacks in bondage for generations. Other institutions, such as the church, played roles in maintaining slavery and segregation. \nRacism in medicine has led to unethical medical experiments involving people of color and to minorities still receiving substandard treatment today. At present, a number of groups—blacks, Latinos, Arabs and South Asians—find themselves racially profiled for a variety of reasons. If institutional racism isn’t wiped out, there’s little hope that racial discrimination will ever be erased in the United States. Slave Shackles. National Museum of American History/Flickr.com • Slavery in the U.S. \nArguably no episode in U.S. history has left a greater imprint on race relations than slavery, commonly referred to as the “peculiar institution.” Slavery continues to fuel racist attitudes and racial discrimination across the globe. \nDespite its far-reaching impact, many Americans would be hard-pressed to name basic facts about slavery, such as when it began, how many slaves were shipped to the U.S. and when it ended for everyone. Slaves in Texas, for example, remained in bondage two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. The holiday Juneteenth celebrates the release of Texas slaves. \nBefore legislation was passed to end slavery, slaves across the world fought for freedom by organizing slave rebellions. What’s more, the descendants of slaves fought against attempts to perpetuate racism after slavery during the civil rights movement . More » Surgical bed.

The most shameful chapters in American history involve the U.S. government funding studies that allowed poor black men in Alabama to succumb to syphilis or Guatemalan prison inmates, mental health patients and soldiers to be afflicted with the disease and other sexually transmitted infections. \nGovernment agencies also played a role in sterilizing black women in North Carolina, Puerto Rican women and Native American women. Today, health care organizations appear to be taking steps to reach out to minority groups, such as the Kaiser Family Foundation’s landmark survey of black women in 2011.

On one hand, it gave underrepresented groups such as blacks , Asians and Native Americans the opportunity to show they had the skill and intellect necessary to excel in the military. On the other hand, Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor led the federal government to evacuate Japanese Americans from the West Coast and force them into internment camps for fear that they were still loyal to the Japanese empire. \nYears later the U.S. government issued a formal apology for its treatment of Japanese Americans. Not one Japanese American was found to have engaged in espionage during World War II. More » New York Police Department Car.

People of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent report being routinely profiled at the nation’s airports. Black and Latino men have been disproportionately targeted by the New York City Police Department’s stop and frisk program. \nMoreover, states such as Arizona have faced criticism and boycotts for attempting to pass anti-immigrant legislation that civil rights activists say has led to racial profiling of Hispanics.

A number of Christian denominations have apologized for discriminating against people of color by supporting Jim Crow and backing slavery. The United Methodist Church and the Southern Baptist Convention are some of the Christian organizations that have apologized for perpetuating racism in recent years. \nToday, many churches have not only apologized for alienating minority groups such as blacks but have also attempted to make their churches more diverse and appoint people of color in key roles. Despite these efforts, churches in the U.S. remain largely racially segregated.
