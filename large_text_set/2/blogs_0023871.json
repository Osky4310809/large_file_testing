According to some Bible scholars, prophetic Scriptures speak of two separate and distinct eventsâ€”the Rapture of the church and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. \nThe Rapture will occur when Jesus Christ returns for his church . This is when all true believers in Christ will be taken from the earth by God into heaven (1 Corinthians 15:51-52; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17). \nThe Second Coming will happen when Jesus Christ returns with the church to defeat the antichrist , overthrow evil and then establish his thousand year reign (Revelation 19:11-16). Comparing the Rapture and the Second Coming of Christ \nIn the study of Eschatology , these two events are often confused because they are similar. Both happen during end times and both describe a return of Christ. Yet there are important differences to discern. The following is a comparison of the Rapture and the Second Coming of Christ, highlighting the key distinctions noted in Scripture. 1) Meeting in the Air - Versus - Returning with Him \nIn the Rapture , believers meet the Lord in the air: \n1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 \nFor the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. (NIV) \nIn the Second Coming , believers return with the Lord: \nRevelation 19:14 \nThe armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean. (NIV) 2) Before Tribulation - Versus - After Tribulation \nThe Rapture will happen before the Tribulation :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:58:28.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
