The Barfi actor has been busy with the final work for his upcoming movie, Jagga Jasoos . And we can't contain our excitement on the news that he is finally making his TV debut with Nach Baliye 8 . The sad part is that he is only going to host the show for the first episode alongside main host, Karan Tacker. Ranbir is also speculated to perform a dance medley of his hit songs. The makers of the show released a statement that read: \"Ranbir Kapoor will be perfect for the grand opening episode of Nach Baliye 8 . We are very excited, and have our fingers crossed to see Ranbir Kapoor set the stage on fire with his dance and stage performance as host! Ranbir is a natural dancer and he will surely set a benchmark for the 10 jodis , and prep them up for the entire season. If things go as planned, we might be shooting later this week.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T09:30:14.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
