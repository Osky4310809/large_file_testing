Moss stated... 'In the 92nd minute of the game, following the award of a penalty against Arsenal, I was informed by Mr Taylor that he had been confronted by Mr Wenger in the technical area. \n\"He informed me that despite being warned to consider his conduct, Mr Wenger stated to Mr Taylor 'You are dishonest to your federation!' Mr Taylor told me that he told Mr Wenger that this was not acceptable to which Mr Wenger replied “f*** off”. \n\"After the penalty kick was scored I walked over to the technical area and asked Mr Wenger to leave the area for inappropriate conduct. \n\"I restarted play as Mr Wenger reached the tunnel mouth. Mr Taylor will be adding his report which will include further misconduct following Mr Wenger’s dismissal, which I did not witness.\" \nTaylor's account of events continues: \"Following the award of a penalty kick against his team in approx. 92nd min, Mr Wenger left his technical area to confront me in disagreement at the decision. \n\"Before he said anything I said 'think carefully before you say anything'. He responded by saying 'you are dishonest to your federation'. I considered this to be questioning both mine and the referee, Jon Moss’s integrity and impartiality. \n\"I stated to Mr. Wenger that such a comment was not acceptable and he told me to 'f*** off' on two separate occasions. Once Burnley had taken the penalty and before the game restarted I informed the referee, Jon Moss, what Mr Wenger had said and he subsequently dismissed Mr Wenger from the technical area. \nSutton reveal Arsenal's amazing gift \n\"Initially Mr Wenger wanted to return to his technical area and I had to ask him again to leave the vicinity as required. He then chose to stand at the opening of the tunnel. I again approached him and asked him to go to the dressing room area. \n\"At this point Mr Wenger pushed me twice and I had to ask the security staff present to escort Mr Wenger to the dressing room area. At the conclusion of the match Mr Wenger visited the officials changing room and apologised to myself and Mr Moss for his earlier actions.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:48:40.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
