It’s a condition that causes chronic pain, rawness or irritation that comes and goes, burning and sensitivity in the vulva — that outer part of the vagina. \nGynaecologists say many things can be responsible for vulvodynia, otherwise known as vagina depression. They are as follow… \nWashing with too much soap: Any type of soap, however gentle, can be irritating to the labia, says a Clinical Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Yale School of Medicine, Dr. Mary Jane Minkin. \n“The less (soap) you use, the better. Once a day or after a gym session, work up a small lather from a soap made with no dyes or fragrances, which can itch or burn,” says Minkin. \nGetting a tattoo on or near vagina: Tempted to get a tattoo below the belt? Consider how it might affect your vagina. Having a tattoo done anywhere on your anatomy can trigger redness and inflammation, but your vaginal area has the most sensitive skin of your entire body, says Minkin. \nSo, you’re practically asking for a rash and itchy irritation. Even the cheap dye from a temporary tattoo can have the same effect, she says. So, get body art on your ankle, arm, or back instead. \nLubricating it with baby oil: So, you’re ready for sex, and to get things going quick, you rub on some baby oil or another petroleum jelly product. Hmmm! Your vagina isn’t going to be happy. \nOil-based lubricants are thicker and don’t wash out very easily, so they can get stuck in your vaginal canal and eventually trap bacteria along with it, resulting in infection, says Minkin. Stick with silicone- or water-based lube instead. Because they wash out easily, they make your vagina smile. \nNot taking off your gym clothes after a workout: As you lounge around in your sweaty gym pants, bacteria are breeding like crazy, thanks to all that perspiration your below-the-belt region produces (your vaginal area is packed with sweat glands, you know). \nIf bacteria get into your vaginal canal, they can upset the balance of the microbes that normally live there and cause a yeast infection, says Minkin. \nChange out of your sweaty, stinky gear as soon as you can, and take a quick shower to wash away the sweat that allows infection-causing bugs to thrive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:35:40.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
