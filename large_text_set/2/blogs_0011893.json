Their plan is to live in California part of the year to be closer to their children and grandchildren. “We’re getting old,” said Elgin, 75, with a laugh. He is the author of two popular, irreverent books about the ad business and Seattle business life: “Huckster,” and “The Man Behind the Curtain: Encouraging, Cajoling, Begging and Other Time-Honored Management Techniques.” “We love our penthouse so much,” says Elgin, “and you can be sure that if it weren’t for a greater love for our kids and grandkids, we wouldn’t consider this transition.” Theirs is one of two penthouses in Seattle’s historic Seaboard Building, which started out as a banking building in the early 1900s. The building is registered as a National Historic and Seattle City Landmark. “The terrace is one of the largest, if not the largest in the city,” says the listing’s broker Scott Wasner with Realogics Sotheby’s International Realty, of the 1,684-square-foot terrace. Bonnie Elgin has created a private garden above the city on the terrace, and the two love to spend time there, alone or entertaining. “It’s the best place in the world to see the all the parades,” says Ron. “Seafair, Gay Pride, the Seahawks Parade. They all come right below us. It’s a thrill.” This unique residence, about 2,000 square feet inside, offers spectacular city views, high ceilings, skylights, custom cabinetry, gas fireplace, teak finishes, hardwood floors, and beautiful glass and millwork. And as a separate possible add-on, the Elgins leased an 11-by-14-foot chamber downstairs that was the bank’s vault in the old days of the Seaboard. “The door is made of stainless steel and glass,” Ron says. “It has a double combination lock and the door weighs 27,000 pounds. It’s got my wine in it,” he said, jokingly. That vault does not come with the penthouse, but Elgin thinks that the lease to it could be picked up. There is also other storage in the building as well. “It’s just time for us to start thinking about warmer weather in the winter and keeping a smaller place here,” he says. Elgin has lived in Seattle for 73 years, and Bonnie was born in Seattle 71 years ago. Elgin has no idea how long it will take to make the transition to a smaller place and get a “snowbirds” home in California. “It took eight years to sell our Perkins Lane home,” he said. “Just because we are putting this on the market doesn’t mean we are leaving immediately.” The Elgins have owned this penthouse for eight years and have lived in it for three. “It’s the perfect place,” he says. “I wrote two books here. We love our neighbors in the other penthouse, Matt Griffin and Evelyn Rosner. We love our terrace gardens, and we love living in the heart of downtown. Westlake Park is our front yard.” Elgin retired in 2012 after being in the advertising business almost 50 years. His powerhouse ad agency, Elgin Syferd, which he co-founded with his friend and public relations guru Dave Syferd , grew to be worth a fortune, with major clients, including McDonald’s, Nordstrom, Holland America , Microsoft and so many more, with a $250,000 in billings. Never one to really retire, Elgin is working on his third book, a humorous novel, “calling on my life experience, about a dysfunctional advertising agency.” Check out the photos to see the Elgin’s penthouse paradise.
