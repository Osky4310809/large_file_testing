She had come to promote her international show, Quantico Season 2. Well, now that PeeCee has already slayed on the show, it's time for the next superstar from Bollywood to step right up. Deepika Padukone is now going to appear on Ellen's show! Deepu (yes, we'd like to think we're homies with her) will be promoting her upcoming Hollywood venture XXX: The Return of Xander Cage . It is said that Deepika will shoot for the show in this week and the episode will air on January 18 in the U.S and January 19 in India. Way to go, Deepika!
