But the funniest nugget — per usual — comes courtesy of the internet, which resurfaced some hilarious old tweets from Johnson.\nLet's just say they don't exactly paint a picture of a seasoned basketball executive.\nSEE ALSO: Twitter can't get over this English cricketer who was sold for $2 million at the IPL auctions\nJohnson, bless his soul, is known for his comically obvious tweets, most of which are probably intended to be hot basketball analysis. It reminds many of Mr. Perd Hapley — everyone's favorite fictional newscaster from NBC's \" Parks and Recreation \" — who often delivers the most obvious statements without sacrificing his broadcasting baritone.\nThe line between Perd Hapley and Magic Johnson is nearly non existent\n— Father John Zesty (@machinesports) June 3, 2016\nI read Magic Johnson's tweets in Perd Hapley's voice.\n— Chuck McGill (@chuckmcgill) June 14, 2016\nFor context, Perd says things like this.\nImage: NBC\nAnd this.\nSo when news broke on Tuesday that Johnson would be cutting deals for the Lakers — two days before NBA's trade deadline — many poked fun at Johnson's tweet style.\nMagic Johnson is now the Lakers President of Basketball Operations, meaning he will preside over the operations of Lakers basketball.\n— Tom Fornelli (@TomFornelli) February 21, 2017\nLet's take a tour of Johnson's tweets, shall we? (For maximum enjoyment, read them in Perd Hapley's voice.)\nHere's one from 2013, where he laid out NBA star Carmelo Anthony's NBA Finals aspirations, which is essentially the goal of every professional that has ever played.\nCarmelo Anthony is on a mission to win the NBA Championship!\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) April 9, 2013\nOr this hot take from the 2016 NBA playoffs, where Johnson broke down exactly how playoff series work.\nThe Warriors defeated the Thunder in game two tonight. Whichever team can win more games will go to the NBA Finals!\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicsTweets) May 19, 2016\nOr these brilliant tweets from last year's NBA Finals.\nThere comes a point in the NBA Finals when one team knows that the other team is better than they are, the Cavs now know.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) June 6, 2016\nWith Steph Curry on the floor the Golden State Warriors are a championship team! Without him they are still a very good team!\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 1, 2016\nWhen Steph & Klay are playing great together the Warriors are a hard team to beat.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) June 11, 2016\nOr this breaking tweet from a Los Angeles Dodgers game.\nChase Utley's HR just put the Dodgers up 3-1 against his former team, the Phillies in PA and the fans gave him an amazing standing ovation!\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) August 17, 2016\nFinally, some Lakers-specific basketball analysis, where he suggested going after Kevin Durant and DeMar DeRozan, who were obviously the most desired talent on the market this offseason. LeBron James, on the other hand, will probably never leave Cleveland, but ...\nLaker Nation: The first free agent the Lakers should go after is Kevin Durant.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 2, 2016\nLaker Nation: DeMar DeRozan should be one of the free agents we go after this summer.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 2, 2016\nLaker Nation: The Lakers should call LeBron James agent. We know he's going stay in CLE but they should go after him just in case he leaves.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 2, 2016\nWhat's even funnier is that those Lakers tweets actually forced the team to strip Johnson's honorary VP title. But two weeks ago, the Lakers made Johnson an adviser to owner Jeanie Buss , and now, less than a year after they stripped his VP title, Johnson has the keys to the Lakers' kingdom.\nNot taking anything away from Johnson. He's a legendary NBA icon with a brilliant basketball mind. A heap of successful investments — including the Los Angeles Dodgers and Sparks — brand him as a savvy businessman, too.\nBut let's hope, for the Lakers' sake, he keeps those Twitter takes to a minimum.\nBONUS: A bike helmet with turn signal lights will make rides a whole lot safer", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TomFornelli/status/834104204595691521", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/726910416123645952", "https://twitter.com/chuckmcgill/status/742572561314250753", "http://deadspin.com/magic-johnson-tweets-his-way-into-a-job-hes-unqualified-1792591177", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Lt-nDWrgiM?enablejsapi=1&", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/727145117572681729", "https://twitter.com/MagicsTweets/status/733154615865171968", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/765710159330934784", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/741486400973897728", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/UWBstvwE.jpg", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/727143501054373888", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PUzrly9viB7tON4zgCqBMV1Pe3I=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390484%2F21fec7ca-a24c-4e6a-b5f4-e633655cd0e2.gif", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/739651261033635840", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/726969165165142016", "http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-remove-honorary-vice-president-title-from-magic-johnson/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcszyb5d7nA", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HUQAXSimqdCrN4FAhh1mjq7BvRk=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390484%2F21fec7ca-a24c-4e6a-b5f4-e633655cd0e2.gif", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/UWBstvwE.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/machinesports/status/738605390632357888", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/321683177661952000"], "published": "2017-02-22T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:59:02.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
