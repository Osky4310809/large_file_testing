Here to help is Bess Kalb , a writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live and an occasional New Yorker contributor . For a while now she’s been trolling Trump hilariously in the voice of a kindly mother or aunt, or even a fawning wife. Case in point: her tweets in response to the bombshell “golden showers” news that dropped yesterday.\n. @realDonaldTrump Honey, did you pee on Russian girls?\n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 10, 2017 \n. @realDonaldTrump Or did you pay the Russian girls to pee on each other, angel?\n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 10, 2017 \n. @realDonaldTrump I'm not mad, but it seems a bit degrading either way, Donald. And the nice people at the Ritz had to clean the up the pee!\n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 11, 2017 \n. @realDonaldTrump Remember: Pee on however many sex workers you please, but don't let the Russians use it to bring a nation to its knees!\n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 11, 2017 \n\n\nShe then followed that up with some responses to Trump’s predictable Twitter rant this morning .\n. @realDonaldTrump Uh oh, sweetheart, you sound VERY upset. Now is not the time to project the image you're unhinged!\n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 11, 2017 \n. @realDonaldTrump If there's nothing to worry about, there's nothing to worry about! Shouting on the Internet doesn't do anyone any good.\n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 11, 2017 \n. @realDonaldTrump (It makes it seem like maybe you peed on the Russian girls or they peed on one another for your pleasure, dear.)\n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 11, 2017 \n. @realDonaldTrump Oh, angel, sorry I was watching the President's address. When you're arguing \"FAKE NEWS\" best not to cite \"lifezette.\"\n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 11, 2017 \n. @realDonaldTrump Oh good lord, hun. If you can't handle a tabloid kerfuffle, you can't President. I know it's hard. I know. Shhhh. I know.\n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 11, 2017 \n. @realDonaldTrump And let's be extremely careful about invoking Nazi Germany in the same tirade you lament a free press.\n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 11, 2017 \n\n\nBONUS: she tweets at Melania Trump in Slovenian.\ntwitter\nShe also dismisses trolls effortlessly with wit.\nPoor guy just trying to troll in Donald Trump's mentions got murdered in front of everybody pic.twitter.com/NRWnHoRpT1 \n— Tim (@Playing_Dad) January 4, 2017 \n\nShe’s developing a rabid fanbase! Go, Bess go!\nLOVE MY FANS! pic.twitter.com/du5WT158Nu \n— Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 11, 2017 \n\nThe point of all this is to tell you that you should go back and read Bess Kalb’s entire feed if you need a good laugh and follow her on Twitter . She is truly the best thing about every Trump tweet rant. It’s going to be a long four years, after all. Buckle up. And let’s hope that this new national treasure never stops tweeting at the next President of the United States.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T19:37:04.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
