I was about to cry. I was grateful for their attendance. It was a project that I wanted to show the members, and I was grateful that they said good things [about it].” \nAhn So Hee continued, saying, “Because I usually talk to the members often, I had already known about the disbandment beforehand. I think I felt it greater when I left and stood on my own. I hope the members do really well even after the disbandment.” \nMeanwhile, Ahn So Hee’s upcoming film “Single Rider” is set to air on February 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:02:11.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
