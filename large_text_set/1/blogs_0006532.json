Having previously explored the ideas of synesthesia and living technology , the designer now looks to the power of magnetic fields for inspiration. And not just any magnetic fields, either— van Herpen's first inklings of the idea came from a visit to CERN’s Large Hadron Collider made up of a 27-kilometre ring of superconducting magnets. \nVan Herpen writes , “I find beauty in the continual shaping of chaos which clearly embodies the primordial power of nature’s performance.\" To create Magnetic Motion, van Herpen collaborated with Canadian architect Philip Beesley and Dutch artist Jolan van der Wiel , who explore nature and technology in their sculptural practices. \nThe designer deftly used futuristic techniques including injection molding, laser cutting, and 3D printing to create the romantic-futuristic collection; this is clothing that looks like wearable architecture. For Magnetic Motion, van Herpen even \"grew\" some accessories herself, by manipulating magnetic metal-laden materials. \nLose yourself in Iris van Herpen's innovative collection below: \nTo learn more about the couture designer click here . \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T10:51:48.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
