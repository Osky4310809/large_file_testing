The singer has since been on a campaign to prove his endless talents, singing duets with a Spice Girl (!) , covering the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme tune , and drunkenly attempting to go in on Nicki Minaj’s verse from “Monster” (to varying success).\nWhat’s more, Sheeran just announced a heap of tour dates , where we’re hoping that he’ll wow the crowd with some of these new party tricks.\nComing to North American this summer, check my website for details on the fan pre-sale that starts this Mon 13th March. \nA post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos) on Mar 8, 2017 at 5:19am PST \nWell, it seems that Ed Sheeran has another trick he can add to his repertoire: singing basically every song ever using just four chords. Dropping by Dutch late night show RTL Late Night, Ed postured that he could perform any song in the charts with just four chords. When pushed by the TV host, Ed took up the challenge and the results are pretty spectacular.\nBlasting through songs like Passenger’s “Let Her Go,” Craig David’s “Walking Away,” The Beatles’ “Let It Be,” Abba, the Spice Girls’ “2 Become 1,” and Bruno Mars’ “Locked Out Of Heaven,” Ed absolutely kills it.\nWatch the clip below.\nAs Unilad points out, the chords Ed was using are Em, Cadd9 ( Or C), G, and D, with some commenters noting that the experiment has been done before by Australian comedy group Axis of Awesome.\nAmazing.\nMeanwhile, Ed Sheeran has also been opening up about some of the celebrity high jinks that he’s gotten up to. Speaking to The Guardian during a recent interview, the singer revealed that he went drunk golfing with Justin Bieber and things didn’t quite go to plan. In fact, Ed ended up hitting Justin over the face with a golf club. Oh dear.\nHopefully when Ed heads out on tour he’ll stick to the musical covers and party tricks, and avoid the golf course…\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T13:14:03.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
