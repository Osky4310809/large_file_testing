They didn’t have an opponent for AJ at WrestleMania. I said that I hadn’t been asked because I hadn’t — but then I was. … I said, ‘I wish that young man was here 10 years ago, man. I honestly do. I think he’s very talented.'” \nRumors of a Michaels-Styles match surfaced prior to the Royal Rumble in January at the Alamodome in San Antonio. Many expected the Heartbreak Kid to return to the ring in his hometown for the 20th anniversary of him winning the WWF title at the Rumble, which happened in the same building. \nStyles fueled those rumors when he tweeted a mock Royal Rumble promo poster that a fan made. Interesting photo….. is it not? pic.twitter.com/MKgF4XoAF1 \nMichaels hasn’t competed since 2010, when he faced The Undertaker in WrestleMania 26 and retired after losing the match. \nThe Phenomenal One is scheduled to face Shane McMahon next weekend at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:35:41.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
