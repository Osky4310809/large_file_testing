Their current favorite style? This geometric, gold-rimmed pair from Krewe . 2 of 13 AKM-GSI (2) \nHickies 'Shoelaces' \nNeed further proof that the BFFs love to match from head to toe? They've taken their twinning right down to the shoelaces, both cinching their kicks with these Hickies self-adjusting elastics . 3 of 13 Splash News Online; Pacific Coast News Frame Denim 'Le Mechanic' Jumpsuit \nWe're not going to say that it's easy for a non-supermodel to pull off this slim-fitting denim one-piece. But we are going to say they both look darn good wearing it. 4 of 13 AKM-GSI; FameFlynet Sandro 'Amele' Boots \nGigi and Kendall both consider this classic bootie a fashion week staple (they wore the pair all over N.Y.C. and Paris) but it's clear that they're Kendall's favorite pair of kicks – at last count, she'd sported them more than 20 times. 5 of 13 Bauer-Griffin; Splash News Online \nBlack Orchid 'Noah' Jeans \nThe denim collections in both of their closets must be massive, but they both have singled out this patchwork pair (the colorway of which, fittingly, is called “Groovy Baby.”) 6 of 13 AKM-GSI; Splash News Online Beyond Yoga Leggings \nWe imagine the “Beyond” in “Beyond Yoga” has to do with the fact that the super-fit duo is so far “beyond” regular workout pants, they need a pair with sheer thigh windows . 7 of 13 Runway Manhattan/Bauer-Griffin \nMA-1 Flight Jacket \nFor some stars, being photographed in the same outfit ( like this nylon bomber ) is a nightmare. For Kendall and Gigi, it just proves that they're The World's Coolest BFFs. 8 of 13 AKM-GSI; Splash News Online Artizia Scarf \nThis one's right out of the “model-off-duty” handbook: Got a statement moto, skinny jeans and heeled booties? Top them all off with a blanket scarf, like this Wilfred Free “Diamond Mosaic” number . 9 of 13 Rex Shutterstock; FameFlynet \nFrame Denim 'Le Original' Jeans \nOn one hand, it’s possible that these slightly distressed jeans are so good, each girl needed her own pair. But we also think it's possible the BFFs were sharing suitcases during a very long Fashion Month. 10 of 13 X17 Online; Splash News Online Express 'Sherpa Wedge' Jacket KenGi shops together, travels together and parties together, so it makes sense that the BFFs own the same Express jacket too. 11 of 13 Splash News Online (2) \nStella McCartney Flatforms \nIn our minds, Gigi saw this pair on Kendall and rushed to buy her own, but the star print was all sold out, so she compromised with the classic tri-color . 12 of 13 David M. Benett/Getty; Marc Piasecki/GC. Bott Lola James 'Mini Me' Necklace \nKendall is so committed to her BFFs (Best Fashion Friends) that she gets matching necklaces made of their portmanteaus: CaKe for Cara Delevingne, KenGi for Gigi Hadid . 13 of 13 AKM-GSI; Getty Yeezy Boost 350s \nOne of the great things about having a hot sneaker designer as your brother-in-law: You can call him up to get a couple pairs for you and your squad when the rest of us are setting alerts on eBay.
