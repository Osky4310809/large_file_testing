Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the time that it was “likely” that that specific booster would be qualified for reuse. Musk also optimistically anticipated a June 2016 timeframe for a re-use mission, a date which obviously slipped, which is not unusual for Musk’s rosy predictions and aggressive timelines.
