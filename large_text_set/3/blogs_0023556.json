After decades of labeling fats as public enemy number one, studies have suggested that sugar is even worse. How did sugar manage, up to now, to avoid the spotlight as the major reason for the obesity epidemic facing our country? \nHere’s the simple answer: Sugar tastes good, advertising is everywhere, and we have been trained since childhood to love sugary things. \nBut medical science, too, bears its share of the blame. \nIn the late 1970’s, new dietary recommendations swept the country suggesting that cholesterol and fat were bad and should be eliminated from food products.

Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are actually protective of the heart. \nTo lose weight, focus on sugar, and how to remove it from your diet. \nEliminate sodas, and other sweetened beverages from your diet. A can of soda has 10 teaspoons of sugar in it. Artificial sweeteners stimulate the centers in our brain that crave sugar and make us hungry.

These include fructose, corn sweetener or syrup, dehydrated cane juice, dextrose, maple syrup, and honey. Words that end in “ose” or “ol” If you want an occasional egg instead of a carb-laden breakfast, go for it. Yolks are high in cholesterol if that’s a concern, but eggs won’ Try a sugar “purge” from your diet for a few weeks.
