I don’t get it. \nShe looks like she chewed up some food and wants to show it to you before she swallows (real mature, Mariah!). Except, there is no food in her mouth, so...that’s even weirder and less mature. Advertisement Advertisement \nShe looks like a baby bird waiting for the mother bird to throw up in her mouth. \nIt appears to have rained since she and her driving companion, YG, opened the roof of their Rolls Royce. It looks like she was thirsty and wanted a sip of nature’s tap. \nIt looks like she’s practicing saying, “Aaaah,” to a doctor. You can never be too prepared. Sponsored \nIs she tired? Is she high? Is she singing? Is she dry? WHAT IS SHE??? \nYG does not seem particularly concerned, so I guess she’s fine??? I do know her, but I don't know what she's doing", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:36:20.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
