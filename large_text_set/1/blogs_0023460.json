Among the protest sites was Dulles Airport, where Customs and Border Protection officials are reportedly violating a court order and refusing to speak to members of Congress.\nWhile we rally at @Dulles_Airport , thousands assemble in DC against the #MuslimBan .

Thanks again, internet! If you’re one of the millions of Americans who’d rather speculate about trailers than sports, then /Film has the Super Bowl preview for you .

During last night’s protests, Lyft announced a $1 million donation to the ACLU. Uber, on the other hand, got rid of surge pricing from JFK Airport while NYC taxi drivers were holding a strike in support of refugees. Many pointed out that Uber’s actions looked suspiciously like strike-breaking, and CEO Travis Kalanick’s lukewarm response to Trump’s refugee and immigrants bans didn’t help. A #DeleteUber campaign kicked up on Twitter. (Via The Hollywood Reporter ) (Image via Josh Farelie)\nWant more stories like this?
