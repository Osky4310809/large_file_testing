Gov. Dan Patrick put the Texas Rangers on the case . \nDuring an interview earlier this week, Super Bowl champion Brett Favre opened up on a similar case that’s gone cold over the last two decades. The jersey he wore in Super Bowl XXXI against the Patriots – which the Packers won, 35-21, also mysteriously disappeared. \nVia Fox Business : \n“I actually … no one really cares, but my Super Bowl jersey from my first against New England in New Orleans, the one in which we won, I have no idea where it is. But no one’s talking about it. I don’t have it, I don’t know where it is or where it went. \n… What happens is there’s a massive celebration, of course, you go into the locker room – it’s mass confusion. Unless you actually take your jersey off and your pants and stuff, and you put them in a bag that is secure, you don’t know. Because there’s people grabbing stuff, there’s laundry, guys are going in the shower, they’re hugging, there’s champagne – so, it could easily get taken.” \nWe care, Brett.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T19:31:47.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
