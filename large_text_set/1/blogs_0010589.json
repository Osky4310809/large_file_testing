DAMN. Giphy \nThe findings also concluded that striking this particular pose from 10 feet away or less puts that biometric information at severe risk. \nWhile this isn’t the only way for your personal data to be retrieved against your will, plenty of people make the peace sign in photos and perceive the gesture to be harmless. \nHowever, while the recent findings related to the peace sign may be alarming, it’s important to remember your fingerprint isn’t typically used for anything other than your iPhone these days. Giphy \nFurthermore, it would take a highly skilled criminal to access a photo of you and use your peace sign gesture to recreate your fingerprint. They would need to first obtain the required photo and then make an intricate, exact recreation of your fingerprint. \nEven then, the job isn’t done. The fingerprint thief would then need to have the recreation of your fingerprint molded perfectly before retrieving your smartphone and using the mold to access it. \nThere’s A LOT of room for error in that one equation alone. \nIn other words, yeah, it’s kind of creepy you could be putting yourself at risk with a simple peace sign, but don’t freak out if you accidentally get your Amy Poehler on during your next run-in with a camera lens. \nThe chances of your peace sign selfie leading to a security breach of your personal life are quite slim.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T06:43:45.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
