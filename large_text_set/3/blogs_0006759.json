Police teams bored a hole in the roof and blew up the back wall of the building to enter the house. \nSenior police officials were camping at the site to oversee the operation, which was also being monitored by the Union Home Ministry. \nInitially, it was suspected that there were two IS operatives inside the house but that turned out to be a false alarm as police found the body of only one. One pistol and a revolver was found in possession of Saifullah, the terror suspect who was killed. MUST READ Suspected ISIS terrorist killed in Lucknow encounter; 8 pistols, 650 rounds of ammo, explosives recovered \nSeparately, a module, radicalised by the deadly terrorist organisation Islamic State, triggered a low-intensity blast in a train in Madhya Pradesh earlier on Tuesday, injuring 10 passengers. \nThe morning blast on the Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train at Jabri railway station is possibly the first instance of a terror strike by an IS module in India. \nThe blast on the Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train spurred the Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh police to launch coordinated operations in the two states. \nSoon, eight members of the group were arrested, while UP's Anti-Terror Squad got \"concrete\" information from intelligence about the presence of gang leader Saifullah, believed to be involved in a train blast in Madhya Pradesh. \nWhen the ATS officials went to apprehend him, he suddenly opened fire on the team from the house. \nThe Times of India quoted sources in central intelligence agencies as well as MP and UP police confirming that that the module owes allegiance to IS. \nHowever, it is yet to be ascertained whether the directive to carry out the attack came from an \"online handler\" of the international terrorist network currently engaged in a grim battle of survival in Iraq and Syria. \nIS is known for its federated way of functioning where it encourages jihadis loyal to it to select their targets and hit them. \nSo far, intelligence agencies had been able to nip terror plots by IS-inspired jihadis before they could be executed. \nThe house in which Saifullah was killed belonged to Badshah Khan, resident of Malihabad, and the accused had been living there with two others for the past two months. \nThey posed as students and did not mingle with the neighbours, an ATS official said and informed that efforts were now underway to nab the two accomplices who were at large. \nIn a related development, another suspect of a sleeper module has been held from Kanpur by the ATS. \nPolice picked up two suspects from Lakhna in Etawah and three in Kanpur. \nThis is for the first time that an attack has been carried out by IS in India, using the recruits radicalised from within the country. Previously, IS had tried to carry out many attacks in Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, through various modules but all such attempts were foiled. \nIn last one year, NIA and police of various states have arrested about 60 Indian-origin IS recruits before they could carry out attacks. These men were part of at least 6-7 modules, which couldn't carry attacks. \nFollowing the Lucknow gunfight, an alert has been sounded at the Lucknow International Airport and at prominent railway stations across the state. \nPolice and intelligence officials have been directed to step up vigil and keep a close watch on busy thoroughfares, malls and markets.   09:28 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:44:28.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
