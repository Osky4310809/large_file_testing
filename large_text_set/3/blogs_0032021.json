Of course, the tradition took a break from 1972 to 2005 when Washington had no major league team. \nAccording to the Washington Post , the White House told the Nationals the president has a scheduling conflict on Opening Day, April 3, Nationals vs. Marlins.\nWhat exactly is this scheduling conflict? We don’t know yet. I have some guesses.\nIt IS the NCAA Final Four. Perhaps Trump wants to focus on one sporting event at a time.\nHe might be golfing. That’s another sport.\nHe might be conducting some sort of negotiation over golf or watching TV at Mar-a-Lago.\nPitching requires the hands. Everyone can see your hands when you pitch. Maybe Trump doesn’t want to draw attention to his hands.\nRegardless, it’s a shame he’s breaking with tradition. The good news is there will still be some presidents there on Opening Day:\nBrad Mills-USA TODAY Sports ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:52:00.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
