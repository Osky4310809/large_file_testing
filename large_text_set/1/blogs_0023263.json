But after the appearance on Today and the first pitch at Fenway Park and the tickets to the Patriots games and the seemingly endless media requests quieted down, D’Agostino, a member of the New Balance Boston team, had to face the less glamorous part: repairing the physical damage caused by the fall. \nShe had surgery to repair her knee in September and a long, tedious road of physical therapy, cross training, and trial and error to figure out if she still had a professional running career to return to—and discovering who she is, if not a runner. That has meant taking off any internal pressure she may feel to return to competition within a certain timeframe or using any metrics to measure success, other than how her body is feeling. \n“I want to go about this healing process with a sense of freedom that will benefit my relationship with running and my passion for it,” she said, “just knowing that I don’t have to prove anything.” \nNow that’s she’s running up to 25 minutes on solid ground without pain, D’Agostino has a few pieces of coping advice for other runners who may face an overwhelming setback. \nTake baby steps. Days after surgery the only activity she could do was half rotations on a spin bike and physical therapy exercises three times a day. A month later, she moved to the elliptical at the gym to get blood flowing in the injured area. By Thanksgiving she could complete full rotations on the bike, add intervals to workouts on the elliptical, or aqua jog in the pool. \nThe next step was running on an Alter-G treadmill, which allows a runner to adjust the percentage of body weight to lessen the impact. She started out at 10 minutes at 50 percent of her body weight and gradually progressed to 30 minutes at almost full weight. \nNew Year’s Day brought the most significant milestone of all: running outside on the ground. She started that day with four sets of five minutes of walking and two minutes of jogging. D’Agostino’s boyfriend, a former football player, was excited for the rare opportunity to run alongside her. \n“The point was to just enjoy it and learn to trust myself,” she said. “It was one more thing to put in my arsenal of reasons to take another step forward.” \nAccept long-term changes. Training for D’Agostino is forever altered, she said. Her coach, Mark Coogan, has always been an advocate of high mileage, but after this injury and multiple stress reactions last year, it is time for her to come to terms with her limitations, which include low bone density. Going forward, many running sessions will be replaced by cross training. She’ll run on softer surfaces, use the Alter-G, and do whatever is necessary to save her body for critical speed workouts and harder runs outside. \n“You’ve got to put your time in and get your heart rate up, but I’ve learned how to do that effectively with cross training,” she said. “The hardest part for me is putting aside my ego. If I had it my way I’d continue with [running twice a day], but I’m realizing if I can train consistently under a new model, that’s what it’s about.” \nWith a new view of training, the relationship between Coogan, who has been D’Agostino’s coach since she was an NCAA cross-country champion at Dartmouth College, has also shifted in a positive way, she said. \n“We’re reaching this level as I mature and become more of an adult where he’s been receptive for the need for change,” she said. “I know my body best and he respects that. He is an incredibly necessary source of wisdom and I trust him with my training but he and I both know that if I had to go about it on my own I could. That’s a sign of good coaching.” \nStick with your people. When her team was scheduled to spend January in Flagstaff, Arizona, to train at high altitude, D’Agostino knew she wouldn’t get performance benefits from the trip. She went anyway, because it was a chance to focus on her rehabilitation, bond with teammates, and be in a concentrated training environment. \nOne day she pulled the spin bike up to the finish line of the track so she could remain motivated by her teammates as they ran a speed workout. \n“Sometimes it’s hard to be there, because it conjures up the feelings of all that I’m missing, but it always ends up being a source of encouragement,” she said. “I think it helps to stay really intentional with your community.” \nBe positive, but cut yourself slack. D’Agostino is a big believer in finding the lessons she can learn in the bad times. She does this through her faith, but she encourages anybody going to through a setback to find a method that works. \n“It’s useful to think about your purpose and become grounded in your identity beyond being a runner,” she said. “I think having journaling time or being introspective every day with 20 minutes of quiet or yoga helps.” \nShe admits that as much as she retains a positive attitude, she allows herself to acknowledge that “sometimes cross training kind of sucks.” To find a more upbeat attitude, she’ll take time to create a new playlist or find a new podcast to listen to while she's on the bike or elliptical. Sometimes D’Agostino writes mantras on notecards and brings them to the gym to read during intervals. \n“Know that you are human and there’s going to be both dark and light in the process,” she said. “My heart is so fickle and the only times I’ve learned something in a transformative way are through these injuries. And when you think about them that way, it’s like, ‘Bring it on.’ Just trust the natural ebb and flow.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T04:40:01.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
