She plans a resolution to hold hearings. \n“All of us feel that we’re not doing our jobs when we don’t have all of our students competing.” (credit: Mike DeNardo) \nShe made her announcement at Boys’ Latin Charter High School, where founder David Hardy outlined Philadelphia’s problem. \n“Black males who make up 25 percent of the enrollment in the school district finish college at about a three percent rate.” \nHardy says he expects the hearings to find that employers have to look outside Philadelphia for qualified workers. \n“I think she’s going to find that when you have this low of a college completion rate, it leaves a hole in the economy here.” \nBlackwell says it’s an issue that traditional district and charter schools need to tackle together.
