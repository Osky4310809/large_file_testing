(CBS/AP) — A former Army reservist charged with stealing 16 guns from a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Worcester escaped from a detention center and may be in Massachusetts. \nThirty-five-year-old James Morales was discovered missing from the Wyatt Correctional Center in Central Falls, Rhode Island Saturday evening. James Morales (Image credit: Mass. State Police) \nU.S. Marshall Jamie Hainsworth said Morales scaled a building and climbed over a razor wire to escape. He added that officials believe Morales is wounded and bleeding from the razor wire. \nState Police spokesman Dave Procopio said Morales then stole a car from the parking lot of a BK Mart on Route 1 in Attleboro Saturday night. \n“Earlier this morning Massachusetts State Police K-9 unit, Trooper Tim Blackwell and K9 Klaas, picked up Morales track in Attleboro and tracked to the area under a Route 95 overpass near the Rhode Island line, where the track ended. At that location police found what appears to be discarded prison clothing. The clothing had blood on it,” Procopio said. He told WBZ-TV the clothes were found around 5 a.m. Sunday. \nMorales is six-feet tall, weighs 175-pounds, has brown eyes and was bald at the time of his escape. \nHe has a large eagle tattoo on the left side of his neck.

He is scheduled to make a court appearance in connection with the weapons theft on Friday. \nHe also faces unrelated state child rape charges. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
