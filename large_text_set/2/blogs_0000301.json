Tim Warner/Getty Images \nSurprisingly, the Bears failed to qualify for Super Bowl 51, which takes place this Sunday, Feb. 5 in Houston. But the Bears' rare lack of participation shouldn't stop Chicago from enjoying Super Bowl Sunday. Plenty of bars and restaurants are holding watch partiesâ€”but which ones are truly special? \nThe following list compiles some of the best and unique parties in the city. These spots are exciting enough to convince a non-football fan that sporting is all right. There are glorious beer and wings specials. There are taco and chili bars and other buffets to satiate the hungriest fans. \nYes, there are Patriots- and Falcons-affiliated bars in Chicago, but we don't care. However, some of these restaurants have chefs who've made special entrees celebrating both teams. \nSure, almost any bar with a television will show New England versus the Falcons, but why settle for the mundane? Check out the map below, which is ordered geographically from north to south. 1 Fat Cat Bar & Grill \nFat Cat, the beer-heavy bar in Uptown, has special selections so fans can cast their allegiances. Falcon fans can feats on a chili dog with house-made chili or a southern fried chicken biscuit sandwich. Patriot fans have the option of a New England clam chowder or \"Beantown Baked Beans\" (navy beans braised with molasses and salt pork).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:40:24.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
