Lose weight! Make meals taste better! Is there anything nuts can’t do? By Rachel Meltzer Warren February 8, 2017 Getty Images \nYou’d be crazy not to eat nuts regularly. (Unless, of course, you’re allergic. In that case: As you were.) Scientists have known for a while that almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and more, are a healthful addition to your diet. But recent research shows that eating nuts daily offers a bounty of benefits. Here’s why you should aim for a handful a day. 1/6 Getty Images Reason #1: You may live longer \nReally! People who ate at least 20 grams of nuts per day (about a handful) were 22 percent less likely to die prematurely, according to a 2016 review article published in BMC Medicine . 2/6 Getty Images Reason #2: Your may help your heart \nPeople who ate the most nuts had nearly a one-third decreased risk of having coronary heart disease and a 21 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with people who ate little to no nuts, according to the same 2016 review. Researchers say that the high levels of fiber, polyunsaturated fats, and magnesium may all contribute to lower cholesterol and improved heart health. 3/6 Getty Images Reason #3: You may cut your cancer risk \nStudy participants who popped a handful of nuts or more daily had a 15 percent lower risk of developing cancer compared with those who ate the least, according to the same study. This may be because of the high levels of cell-protecting antioxidants in nuts. 4/6 Getty Images Reason #4: You may weigh less \nNuts have calories, but they also have fiber, protein, and fat, which can help curb your appetite. When researchers put overweight adults on a diet, people whose plan included almonds lost more weight and kept it off for longer compared with those who ate more carbs, according to a study published in the International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:21:12.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
