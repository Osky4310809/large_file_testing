Most Popular Mar 3, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below For the new live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast , Disney turned to legendary choreographer Anthony Van Laast, whose resume includes everything Mamma Mia (stage and film)to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 . To get Emma Watson and Dan Stevens ready for their iconic ballroom scene as Belle and Beast, Van Laast had them learn the basics of waltz. To his surprise, Van Laast also had to choreograph the movements for \"Be Our Guest,\" even though it was mostly CGI. The process, which included inspiration from real-life dancers, a storyboard artist, and motion capture, took about six months. \"I've seen so many animated films [with people dancing] and never really thought about it, but of course they must have used a choreographer and I thought, Christ, I'm the choreographer of this iconic piece in Beauty and the Beast ,\" Van Laast said in a recent phone call from England. \"This was the one thing that caused me more sleepless nights than anything… I think when you see the film, you'll understand the complexity of the number. There are knives in the air, there's food coming and going.\" Most Popular Here, Van Laast reveals the intricacies of putting together a ballroom scene, especially when someone's toes are on the line. 1. Dan had to practice dancing in platform shoes. \"For the big ballroom scene, it was absolutely him, [but] they had to have the height difference for when they danced. She had to be a lot smaller than him. He had to wear platform shoes that were quite difficult to dance in. First he learned how to waltz, then he had to learn the routine, then he had to learn how to do the routine in platform shoes, then he had to dance with Emma in those platform shoes.\" 2. Emma rehearsed with 1 lb weights on each of her wrists to help her with her posture for the waltz. \"[This was] so she would hold her arms in a certain way. She got used through rehearsal to moving with a big skirt, and she never complained about it.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 3. Dan could have broken Emma's toes making the movie. \"It was a matter of posture and how you hold your back. The big thing for Dan was, because he had these great big clodhoppers on his feet, not to tread on Emma's feet… I know that as far as she was concerned, she was always a little fearsome of her feet trodden on, and he was a little fearsome of treading on her feet. It was a very complicated routine.\" 4. Dan had extra training because of the awkward Beast postures. Every morning at 6:30 a.m., \"someone would come and do exercises and yoga with him, just to keep his body free.\" Emma, on the other hand, was already \"really fit\" because she already does yoga. \"She's a very good mover.\" 5. Technicians and camera crew clapped and congratulated Emma and Dan when scene wrapped. \"[This also happened] at the read through, which was in front of hundreds of people. Emma just jumped up. Everyone was thrilled.\" GIF 6. The lift is all about Emma. \"It's all about how the woman holds her body that enables the man to lift her. It was about working with Emma, teaching her how to hold herself so she was 'liftable.' The hardest thing is being put down and moving in the right direction after being put down.\" 7. A Pharrell classic was the source of celebration during filming. \"When we finished shooting the last dance [scene] in the film, someone put on 'Happy' and the cast and all the crew had a party.\" That person, actor Kevin Kline revealed to Vanity Fair , was Emma. \"After a long, long day, suddenly Pharrell Williams's song 'Happy' comes on, blasting, and everyone just starts jumping around,\" Kline said. \"It became kind of a wrap party, really celebratory. And I asked, 'Who did that?' It was Emma.\" Beauty and the Beast opens March 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:21:23.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
