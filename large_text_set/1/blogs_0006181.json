Now a couple of months ahead of the supposed Galaxy S8 unveiling, SK Hynix has unveiled the world’s first 8GB LPDDR4X mobile DRAM. Speculations suggest that the Galaxy S8 will utilise the faster and more power efficient mobile RAM from SK Hynix. It’s worth mentioning that the recently unveiled ASUS ZenFone AR is the world’s first smartphone with 8GB of RAM, although it utilises an LPDDR4 mobile DRAM chipset. \nSK Hynix’s new 8GB mobile DRAM utilises dual channel 16-gigabits chips. The brand claims 8GB is the highest density in the LPDDR4X standard, which has 20 percent higher power efficiency as compared to the LPDDR4 standard. The new RA processes 34.1GB of data per second with 64-bit I/O. The company says that its new RAM takes 30 percent less space than current LPDDR4 mobile chips.

The vendor’s new 8GB module is expected to be in great demand this year, as the chip maker tips they will be used in a handful of flagship phones this year. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to be one of these flagships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T15:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T10:39:17.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
