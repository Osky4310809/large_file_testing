A few issues are presented in short here: The most confused and debatable event in The Terminator and the whole franchise concerns the birth of John Connor , the future leader of the Resistance . In the future, John Connor himself sends back Kyle Reese , who eventually meets and impregnates Sarah Connor and later gives birth to John Connor. The question is raised: How can the older John Connor send back Kyle Reese, his own father? It is also revealed that Kyle is the one who mentions the name John as Sarah's future son, which makes her name her son John Connor. The remaining parts of the T-800 created Skynet . In Terminator 2: Judgment Day it is revealed by the T-800 that the parts from Cyberdyne Systems factory were analyzed and Skynet and cyborgs were created through reverse engineering. Miles Dyson stated that the technology in the parts was so advanced that no human would be able to invent the technology. This leads to the conclusion that Skynet created itself by sending back the T-800 in this movie. It can be argued that Miles Dyson's statement may be more of a personal opinion, rather than a true fact. Humans may very well invent the technology, but with the parts, the creation of Skynet and Judgment Day would occur earlier. The actual date of Skynet's creation and Judgment Day is not revealed in The Terminator , so it's still speculation and a debatable issue. Kyle Reese gives Sarah Connor a message that he got from the future John Connor. Sarah Connor made young John memorize the message that the future can be changed , and makes sure he gives this info to Kyle in the future. The movie doesn't reveal where this message came from originally. Another example of paradox is the picture Kyle has of Sarah. This is the very same picture where Sarah is being photographed outside a gas station. The fact the Sarah Connor is chased by a T-800 and protected by Kyle Reese, brings her to this exact place, at this specific date and time, which makes it a paradox. \nFor the sake of understanding and resolving the story in The Terminator , let's assume in a previous unaltered timeline, Kyle never met Sarah and never fathered John. It may even be that the future leader of the Resistance is not named John. All this does not matter, except that Sarah is the mother of a future leader of the Resistance. That's what triggers Skynet to send back a T-800 to kill her. Beneath are listed several timelines prior to the events of The Terminator in an attempt to resolve some the paradoxes mentioned above: Alpha timeline", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T04:19:37.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
