The car/submarine remains one of the most iconic movie vehicles ever, and Lotus is honoring the 40th anniversary of the flick with a special Evora Sport 410 that nods to that Esprit. \n-The tribute Evora Sport 410 doesn’t have an official name to mark its specialness, but the in-house customizers at Lotus Exclusive made the connection apparent. Unique front and rear fascias hark back to the white-and-black S1, and a black pinstripe tracing the car’s beltline plus a scripted badge on the B-pillar are similar in style to those on the Esprit. Part of the hood also has been blacked out. The tartan-plaid inserts on the seats and door panels are pure Bond, and contrast red stitching furthers the specialized look.\n- \n-Everything else about the Evora Sport 410 remains the same. It uses a supercharged 3.5-liter six-cylinder engine that creates 410 horsepower at 7000 rpm and 310 lb-ft of torque at 3500 rpm. Its curb weight is 2921 pounds, and Lotus claims it can sprint from zero to 60 mph in less than four seconds, with a top speed of 190 mph.\n- - Double-O Slow?

(The 410 comes to North America this spring.) This one-off is an example of what customizations are possible with Lotus Exclusive, a service Lotus says 25 percent of its buyers use, and they can no doubt replicate this car if they’d like—just don’t go driving off any piers, okay?\n-\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:08:27.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
