Schaefer works for the Inquirer. More by Mari A. Schaefer Arrow icon \nA two-year-old stray dog from Thailand that lost the top part of her snout in an attack and almost ended up on a dinner plate, has been sponsored by two local animal activists who hope to get her medical care. \nAfter the attack, in which someone tried but failed to cut off her head and then eat her, Teresa ended up in a Thai animal shelter. Rescuers, who could not provide the care she needed, contacted Michelle Weirich, of Glen Mills, who had plans to adopt another dog from the shelter. \nWeirich enlisted the help of Karen Quigley, of Sewell, Gloucester County, owner of Elwood, the dog that was crowned the world’s ugliest dog in 2007 and died in 2103. The two have teamed up to transport the pup to New Jersey for care before going to Quigley's home for foster care. \nA GoFundMe page has been set up to raise $7,000 for the dog travel to United States and the surgeries she will need at NorthStar Vets in Robbinsville, N.J., which has stepped up to provide her care. Teresa is set arrive at the John F. Kennedy International Airport on Jan. 28.
