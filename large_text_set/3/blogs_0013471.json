You are gone and gone for good. See where your tactlessness and emotional poverty has landed you… before a Commissioner for Oaths; but this is only the beginning, the attributes listed above will further help to deny you the rulership of the Emirate of Kano, after which l see you returning to the Sudan to lecture on what you know best…SHARIA! abiodun johnson \nYou are one of those stupid Nigerian. Emmanuel A. Yakiilipiti \nYou are a product of prison conjugal visit abiodun johnson \n2nd stupid Nigerian. Bestman \nIts clear that you’re an enemy of the nation’s progress. May almighty God change your mind towards Nigeria dream before your death. (Amen) God bless Nigeria. Osibisa \nIs that because you are BLIND or God has CLOSED YOUR EYES TO SANUSI’S RECKLESS WASTAGE OF THE NATION’S RESOURCES? Bestman \nSo they say, see him as innocent until proving quitting ScrollCreed \nYou are one of those Reuben Abati’s loyalist put here to rove confusion and peddle lies. Rakota \nSANUSI…GOD IS WITH YOU…I LIKE YOUR COURAGE AND BOLDNESS…IT IS YOUR TYPE WE SHOULD HAVE AS PRESIDENT Osibisa \nAs long as he too COUGHS out all the BILLIONS he has RECKLESSLY SPENT! Musa Johnson \nSanusi L Sanusi will go down in history as a bold,courageous and patriotic Nigerian Hero. He came to the CBN and brought remarkable positive changes to safeguard depositors’ money which was being pilfered by executive thieves calling themselves CEOs. His removal is a credit and a testimony to his personal honour and integrity. If only he had kept quite and played along with the crooks who are now presiding over the affairs of our beloved Nigeria,would he have been sacked? No way! Soldier on,Mallam. And keep your head high. Nigerians indded proud of your sterling qualities. Olusegun Adekoya \nAs a people are we being sensible at all with this Sanusi praise singing as if he is a saint. Nigerians almost brought the roof down because the presidency budgeted =N=1 Billion for feeding but everyone is silent on CBN under Sanusi spending =N=1.257 Billion on guards and police officers lunch in 2012. \nBecause Sanusi alleged that some monies are missing doesnt mean he should not be held accountable. I read the full letter suspending him and great allegations and infractions levelled against him which warrants his suspension. \nIs the suspension as a result of his allegation of missing oil money? am not sure. However, should he be held accountable even though he whistle blew? Definitely. \nYou dont live in glass house and throw stones and then blame the birds you were trying to kill for the stone breaking down your house HAMZA \nAdekoya, =N=1 Billion for feeding(at Aso Rock for how many people or locations?) but everyone is silent on CBN under Sanusi spending =N=1.257 Billion on guards and police officers lunch in 2012(at CBN for how many people or locations?). You are not very analytic. Always use your brain wisely before you contribution to the discussion. Thanks. Olusegun Adekoya \nAnd if you used your brain you would have known that there are hundreds of staff in the presidency plus that amount includes funds for hosting visitors including dignitaries. Not to mention that in the presidency it includes breakfast, lunch and dinner. \nI am not in any way agreeing with the budgeted amount for feeding as identified in the 2012 budget which within this year budget is lower than half of the 2012 amount. But why is no one talking about CBN spending that staggering amount for police officers lunch Abbeyboy \nAnd you should know that, there are thousands of police across the entire offices of CBN In the country. What is te difference between Sanusi and Jonathan, who budgeted N500,000 to feed each of the two dogs in aso rock per month. What is the average monthly salary of doctors in Nigeria?.

Nigerians did not MANDATE you to speak for them! I know many Nigerians that are concerned about the REVELATIONS regarding his reign and tenure at the CBN! frog2222 \nHe’s wasting his time, he’s a criminal. His he doing this for the APC, or what? I will never vote for him as the President… terrible! mike \nSERAP said the suspension of Sanusi amounted to “a distraction and can only contribute to shifting the focus of the government from the real issue, which is finding the missing $20bn oil money.” THESE BAD ADVISERS @ THE VILLA HAS MADE SANUSI ANOTHER HERO!!! Osibisa \nSERAP should jump into the LAGOON! Where was SERAP when SANUSI was acting like the GOVERNOR of NIGERIA or MAYOR, by spending money that did not belong to him on SCHOOLS, ‘REHABILITATION’, ETC. Who sent him? Dr. Peter Ejirika,CPA \nSanusi would not prevail in any court action he brings against the government due to the following: his appointment is illegal because he lacks the minimum qualifications required for that job, he misappropriated public funds of about $40 million arising from his various gifts and donations to members of his family without authorization from either the legislative or the executive arm of government, and his appointment was terminated by the death of the previous president. Suffice it to say Sanusi thought Nigeria belonged to him. TOPE \nsanusi is only lucky dat obj is not the president. by now you must have been in kirikiri tasting the other side. He once said he has not tasted poverty. h . Osibisa \nSanusi should go and sit down! If he, as an administrator, does not understand the meaning of ‘SUSPENSION’, in Employment Law, then it says a lot about his ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY. \nSuspension is an administrative tool, which is used as a precursor before a person is disciplined in Employment relationship and under Employment Law. It is usually contained in the Employer’s DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE. It is used in cases of serious MISCONDUCT or GROSS MISCONDUCT. A SUSPENSION is usually with PAY. Which means that SANUSI’S SALARY is still being paid. (That is another difference between a SUSPENSION and a DISMISSAL or REMOVAL). \nIf in the end, the person is found not culpable after a DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATION, the matter is dropped, and the suspension is lifted, and the employee returns to his post. But if the allegations are proven, s/he is then dismissed. And it is after this PROCESS that the President is then required to forward the person’s name to the Senate to confirm the removal. \nMany people, including Sanusi, who lack knowledge of Employment Law, and who believe in abnormal procedures, are those that will expect the President to REMOVE Sanusi without following DUE EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURE! \nSanusi is also an EMPOYEE of the CBN. The same procedures, concerning the procedure for investigating cases of misconduct, equally apply to him. Except that in his own case, the CBN Act requires the President to do an additional thing of getting the Senate’s approval before REMOVING him! But the Senate’s approval is not required before SUSPENDING Sanusi as part of the CBN disciplinary process or procedure! ScrollCreed \nSanusi God Bless you and I will stand and match on the streets of Nigeria in show of solidarity to rescue our country from the hands of Colonial apologists, oppressors and corrupt leaders who pad their pockets and those of their cronies with our resources.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:06:56.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
