She said earlier this month that she intended to start speaking out again on public issues. On Tuesday, she urged voters to resist Trump policies that she said included suspicion of refugees and voter suppression in some areas.\n“These are bad policies that will hurt people and take our country in the wrong direction,” Clinton said, relaying what she had become one of her mantras since the November election.\n“It’s the kinds of things you think about when you take long walks in the woods,” she said. “Resist, insist, persist, enlist.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:35:58.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
