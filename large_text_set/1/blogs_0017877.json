Thomas appreciated the love, but expressed an issue he had with the game. @NBA2K appreciate the love but damn Can you make me more realistic in the game? Like be able to get a shot off in the paint lol. \n— Isaiah Thomas (@Isaiah_Thomas) January 19, 2017 \nThomas does have a legitimate gripe. Aside from being a terrific 3-point shooter, he has shown on countless occasions his ability to drive to the basket and score in the paint. \nIT probably is used to getting undervalued, though, and he continues to prove his doubters wrong. \nThumbnail photo via Bob DeChiara/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T08:32:24.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
