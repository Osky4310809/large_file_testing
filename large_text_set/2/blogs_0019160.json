His impression was often rolled out in tandem with ‘Luther The Anger Translator’ played by Keegan-Michael Key, a character that was so good President Barack Obama even used it at the White House Correspondent’s Dinner.\nLast night, Jordan Peele was a guest on Late Night with Seth Meyers and he not only revived his impression of Brack Obama but he busted out a rare ‘Drunk Obama’ impression. Imagining what life is like for Barry O. these days, Jordan Peele gave us a look through the lens of how Obama might be looking at America these days.\nIt’s been over a month since we last saw Jordan Peele’s impression of Barack, something he busted out on The Daily Show back in early January . I think we’d be foolish to assume this is the last time we get to see this spot-on impression of Barack because Jordan Peele’s not a fool, and he knows what the people want to see. Frankly, I wouldn’t be shocked if we see in on SNL in the very near future busting out this impression.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:56:35.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
