King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 9 hours ago 8 Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett was recently asked by Chinese That's Mag to single out \"the most important thing to every guitar player when it comes to guitar solos.\"He replied: \"Well, first of all, if you attempt to play guitar solos, you need to know basic rhythm. And you need to know where all the notes are on the neck.\"And then, you need to start learning scales - major minor scales, pentatonic scales, modes, scales in one, two, three octaves, relative major scales, relative minor scales, harmonic major scales, harmonic minor scales, octaves, arpeggios in two octaves and three octaves.\"You have to learn all that stuff if you wanna be a pretty well-rounded guitar player. There are other guitar players out there who didn't learn that stuff who were brilliant guitar players, so, you know, if you fall somewhere in the middle, I think you'll be alright.\"As widely reported, Kirk took a peculiar approach to crafting guitar solos for the band's new album \" Hardwired... To Self-Destruct \" by not practicing them at all .Explaining how he's quite pleased with how it all turned out, the guitarist told Radio 21: \"I purposely did not prepare at all. I prepared maybe this much [shows not a whole lot of much with fingers], maybe 5%. But for most of everything, the idea was to go in there, be as spontaneous as possible, improvise as much as possible, and capture a real musical moment of time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:58:45.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
