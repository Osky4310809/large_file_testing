PHOTO RELEASE \nDAVAO CITY — Despite the word war and fighting on the ground, the government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) on Sunday (Philippine time) agreed to resume formal peace talks. \nMembers of the peace panels of the NDFP and negotiators from the government led by Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza met for backchannel efforts on March 10-11 in Utrecht, The Netherlands, to fix the stalled peace negotiations. \nThe NFDP was led by peace panel chair Fidel Agcaoili and chief political consultant Jose Maria Sison along with other consultants and panel members that included Benito and Wilma Tiamzon, who were earlier allowed by the government to travel despite an order for their arrest.

MARLON GAYOG/CONTRIBUTOR \nFor the next round of talks, the government and the communists are expected to move closer in completing the drafting of the Comprehensive Agreement on Social and Economic Reforms, which they believe would address the root causes of the conflict. \nSignificant progress is also expected in the discussions for the Comprehensive Agreement on Political and Constitutional Reforms with the Communist Party of the Philippines publicly expressing its willingness to help in the creation of a federal republic, which was one of the campaign promises of President Duterte. \nPresident Duterte earlier withdrew the government’s indefinite unilateral ceasefire and canceled the negotiations following the announcement of the New People’s Army to end its own ceasefire effective February 10. \nThe NPA cited two reasons for terminating its ceasefire: the non-release of all political prisoners and the continuing presence of government forces in the communities. \nNumerous armed hostilities have been reported since then leaving many from both sides either dead or wounded. \nREAD: Palace: NPA ambush on Davao cops to influence peace talks revival \nTo ensure the full participation of the panel members and consultants from both sides, the government committed to release NDFP consultant Ariel Arbitrario who was arrested at a military checkpoint in Davao City earlier this year after the talks collapsed. \nThe government also said that it would “ensure the safety and liberty of all consultants, as well as undertake the necessary measure including the extension or reinstatement of bail, as the case may be, and other legal remedies to enable their free and unhindered movement.” \nAs a mechanism for the implementation of JASIG, both parties made an agreement to re-schedule the deposit and safekeeping of the reconstituted list and pictures of JASIG-holders from the NDFP on March 14. \nIt was originally scheduled on February 22 but was affected by the cancelation of the formal talks. \nOn the issue of political prisoners, the government reiterated its commitment to ensure the release of the remaining four detained consultants for them to participate in the next round of talks. \nApart from the detained NDFP consultants, 19 political prisoners would also be released on humanitarian grounds on or before April 2.
