The announcement on Wednesday confirmed earlier indications that the governing party candidate, Lenín Moreno, and a conservative former banker, Guillermo Lasso, would face off in a second round on April 2. Mr. Moreno led the nine-candidate field in the election on Sunday with 39.4 percent of votes, just short of the 40 percent threshold needed for an outright victory. Mr. Lasso finished second, with 28.1 percent. Mr. Correa, the leftist leader of Ecuador’s so-called citizens’ revolution , was first elected president in 2007. He won praise for leading the country into a period of stability after a severe economic crisis that drove three presidents from office, but he has also been accused of having an authoritarian streak, particularly toward the news media, the opposition and the judiciary. The sheen on his administration was also tarnished as once-flush government budgets were cut and thousands of employees at state-run companies were laid off after a decline in oil revenue.

The election on Sunday was the first in a long time that the Ecuadorean authorities did not declare a winner on the night of the balloting, leading Mr. Lasso and many of his supporters to level accusations of fraud, but no evidence of irregularities were reported. \nAdvertisement In a series of posts on Twitter on Tuesday morning, Mr. Correa described his opponents as “losers” and accused them of taking advantage of the vote-by-vote count to prompt violence and talk of fraud.
