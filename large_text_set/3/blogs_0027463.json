Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA UK news Pilot admits being twice legal alcohol limit before transatlantic flight \nPaul Grebenc was due to be first officer on a United Airlines flight from Glasgow to New Jersey when concerns were raised View more sharing options Thursday 23 March 2017 14.09 GMT Last modified on Thursday 23 March 2017 14.25 GMT \nAn airline pilot has admitted preparing to fly a passenger jet from Scotland to the US while more than twice the legal alcohol limit. \nPaul Grebenc was due to fly as first officer on a United Airlines flight from Glasgow to Newark, New Jersey, in August last year when concerns were raised about his fitness to fly. \nA blood test carried out later that day found he had 42 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit is 20 microgrammes. \nGrebenc, 35, a former US air force pilot who is still a reservist, pleaded guilty to the offence when he appeared at Paisley sheriff court on Thursday. \nThe court heard that on the morning of 27 August, Grebenc and United Airlines colleagues were brought to Glasgow airport from the Hilton hotel in the city, where they had spent the night having flown from the US to Scotland the previous day. \nThey were due to fly a Boeing 757 to Newark with take-off scheduled for 9am. As they passed through the search area, security staff smelled alcohol on the breath of the other first officer, Carlos Licona, and raised the alarm. Police were contacted and went to the departure gate, where Licona and Grebenc were removed from the flight. \nThe fiscal depute, Scot Dignan, said: “Police did not go on board the aircraft as they wanted to be discreet and not alarm passengers. Grebenc was asked to disembark with Licona as police also had suspicions regarding him. \n“He was taken to a quieter spot. At about 9.30am he was asked to provide a specimen of breath for analysis which proved positive and he was taken in a marked police vehicle to Govan police station.” \nThe blood test later showed he was more than twice the legal limit. \nThe plane took off later that day with a new crew and 141 passengers on board. \nDavid McKie, defending Grebenc, said his client was extremely remorseful. He said: “He has asked me to express his remorse and apologises to the court and passengers for his irresponsibility and what was a significant misjudgment on his part. He takes full responsibility for his actions.” \nAs a US air force pilot Grebenc flew in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, where his role was to carry out mid-air fuel transfers, and he has been involved in training young pilots, the court heard. \nHis wife is a pilot with the US air force and they live on an airbase in Mississippi. McKie told the court his client was under pressure at the time of the incident as there had been a recent family argument while two weeks previously doctors had found a shadow on his son’s lung they feared might be cancerous, and the family had to wait until September to find out the prognosis. However, he said Grebenc recognised the seriousness of his actions. \nHe said: “He recognises that he ought to have stopped drinking at an earlier point that evening and his failure to do so will have catastrophic consequences for him, his career and for his family.” \nMcKie said his client had been placed on a rehabilitation programme by his employers in conjunction with the US Federal Aviation Administration. \nGrebenc is due to be sentenced later. \nLicona was sentenced to 10 months in prison earlier this month after he admitted boarding a flight while under the influence of alcohol.
