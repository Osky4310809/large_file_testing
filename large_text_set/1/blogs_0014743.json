Mark Warburton's Rangers host Motherwell in the Scottish Cup on Saturday Manager Mark Warburton says loan deals \"make sense\" for Rangers as they seek to avoid paying \"inflated fees\". \nThe Ibrox club have brought in Arsenal's Jon Toral and Bournemouth's Emerson Hyndman on loan until the end of the season. \n\"January is notoriously difficult,\" Warburton explained. \n\"January can end up becoming very expensive if you overspend on players and don't get the value you have to see.\" \nThe Rangers boss hinted he would be willing to make further loan signings before the transfer window closes in 12 days' time. \n\"Right now it makes sense for us,\" he said. \n\"If you are the buyer, you end up paying inflated fees because the sellers don't want to lose their best players at this time of year. \n\"If we can bring in anybody else, we will do - but it depends if the right player becomes available at the right price for the club. \n\"It has to be somebody adding something we don't currently possess.\" Warburton understands Michael O'Halloran's frustration at not playing \nRangers, who host Motherwell in Saturday's Scottish Cup fourth-round tie, trail Premiership leaders Celtic by 19 points. \n\"Of course we plan for the summer and we'll see what becomes available,\" said Warburton. \n\"But we can't compare ourselves [with Celtic] at the moment in terms of finance. \n\"We're not going to spend recklessly. What we have to do is move at a pace which is right for Rangers. \n\"We have to move as shrewdly and as astutely as we can and when the club can gain success and the income improves, we can move forward from there.\" \nWinger Michael O'Halloran, who joined Rangers last January, has been linked with a move away from Ibrox after struggling to hold a first-team place. \n\"I've read some bizarre stories that Michael is off to Hearts,\" added Warburton. \n\"I'm sure [Hearts head coach] Ian Cathro would have called me. He, I'm sure, knew nothing about it and neither do I. \n\"From our point of view, Michael is one of our players and will be involved on Saturday. Michael is one of many players who wants to play; he needs games. It's the life of a manager that players will be banging on the door if they don't get enough pitch time. \n\"I can understand their frustration. My job is to be honest with them, to keep communicating with them and work with them every day on the training pitch.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T19:06:24.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
