Walters. “We want manageable information for anyone wishing to pay their respects.”\nThe new online feature is available to anyone with a smartphone, tablet or computer. Schedules of interments are updated hourly at www.cem.va.gov/dailyburialschedule , though some scheduled services may not be included as families may opt out of posting the information publicly.\nSearches can be conducted by location or last name. The daily burial schedule provides date and time of the committal service, the location of the cemetery, as well as the funeral home providing services. The schedule also provides a direct link to the national cemetery’s web page, directions, location of committal shelters and additional information.\nVA operates 135 national cemeteries and 33 soldiers’ lots and monument sites in 40 states and Puerto Rico. More than 4 million Americans, including Veterans of every war and conflict, are buried in VA’s national cemeteries. VA also provides funding to establish, expand, improve and maintain 105 Veterans cemeteries in 47 states and territories including tribal trust lands, Guam, and Saipan. For Veterans not buried in a VA national cemetery, VA provides headstones, markers or medallions to commemorate their service. In 2016, VA honored more than 345,000 Veterans and their loved ones with memorial benefits in national, state, tribal and private cemeteries.\nThe post VA now providing online daily burial schedules for its national cemeteries appeared first on VAntage Point .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:14:39.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
