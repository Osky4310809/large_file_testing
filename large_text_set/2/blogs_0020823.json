The same day, McNally posted a help wanted ad for cooks and dishwashers on the restaurant’s Facebook page . \nNaturally, Yelp went nuts, and I Don’t Care’s rating is now a mere one and a half stars. Yelp has posted an “Active Cleanup Alert”—for venues that have attracted undue attention for one reason or another—and ratings are now split between one-star declarations, that basically claim the owner is the worst human since Attila the Hun, and five-star Hamilton -worthy reviews. \nMUNCHIES reached out to I Don’t Care Bar and Grill for comment, but has yet to hear back. \nSome well-known chefs—including José Andrés and Tom Colicchio—supported the Day Without Immigrants and even went so far as to close their restaurants or publicly announce their support—while other chefs, like McNally, were not so keen on the whole thing. \nBut all may end well that started miserably. Dusty Oakley, the owner of a restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma called Brownies Hamburgers, says he has extended an offer to all 12 fired employees of I Don’t Care. Oakley also says his offer is not political: “They’re in need, I’m in need. So it was a win-win situation,” he told Fox23 News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:16:27.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
