The Outsider was a Steppenwolf within which was a potential Nietzchean superman struggling to emerge.\nIn the context of today’s politics, both Donald Trump and Narendra Modi are being referred to by commentators as ‘outsiders’.\nModi, the most famous chaiwala in history, has projected his humble origins to place himself outside the charmed circle of the Delhi Durbar coterie, particularly as represented by the patrician Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi during an election campaign rally in Bahraich district on Thursday. (PTI Photo)\nSimilarly, the billionaire property tycoon the previlegentsia of the Washington Beltway, a market positioning which largely helped him win over resentful voters who mistrust the political elite, as exemplified by the Clinton clan.\nBoth Modi and Trump operate outside the norms and conventions of diplomacy and protocol, and appear to take delight in doing so.\nModi’s thunderbolt demonetisation gleefully thumbed its nose at not only the authority and autonomy of the Reserve Bank of India but also at basic economic common sense.\nThe logic – or, rather, illogic – behind the move changed its tune more often than would a disc jockey on Radio Mirchi.\nDemonetisation was about getting rid of black money. No, it was an antidote to counterfeit currency being pumped into our economy by Pakistan. No, it was about helping stressed banks become flush with funds which would make them lower interest rates which in turn would stimulate growth. No, no, it was actually pro-poor and a means to ensure rural uplift. Whew.\nTrump’s plan to wall-off Mexico, his off-the-cuff telephonic conversations with various heads of government, his accusations against the media and his own intelligence services – all display the same ad horison and act-first-think-later as does Modi’s demonetisation.\nDonald Trump during a Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington (AP Photo)\nBoth Modi and Trump are given to making messianic – end often totally off the mark – pronouncements on a wide range of subjects, be it on the technological marvels of ancient India or how to make America great again by throwing out as many immigrants as possible.\nThanks to the larger-than-life images they’ve created of themselves, both Trump and Modi enjoy a following of fanatical devotees who are totally impervious to any form of rhyme or reason which questions the infallibility of their respective idols, dark horse outsiders who against the odds have become champion winners.\nSo, if Colin Wilson were to do a reprise of his Outside theme today, would he accommodate Modi and Trump in his assessment and view them as harbingers of a new evolutionary stage for humankind?\nPerhaps. Or perhaps, he might review his theory by allowing evolution to be a two-way process, one ascending and evolving from lower to higher, and the other de-volving from higher to lower.\nIn which case, NaMo and Don might be interpreted as prefigurement of Homo Sapiens becoming plain and simple Homo Saps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:11:28.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
