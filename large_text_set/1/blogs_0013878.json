Now sources say that, in fact, she and her family received death threats after she agreed to perform. Advertisement \nHer agent purportedly told the Inauguration Committee about the death threats, without mentioning the response from the LGBT community. One of Holliday’s representatives says that both issues factored into her decision, but that the singer’s paramount concern was her family’s safety. \nSo far it’s unclear as to whether Holliday received threats from individuals associated with any particular group or organization — or if they even identified themselves.

Sponsored \n“It doesn’t float my boat,” Dornan said in a recent interview with GQ Australia . “I’ve always been open-minded and liberal — I’d never judge anyone’s sexual preference. Whatever gets people off is entirely up to them, and there’s a million different ways to please yourself, sexually. \nDornan also remarked that he doesn’t think he and Grey would be pals.

I don’t think he would be my type, when it comes to choosing mates.” \nThis response prompts me to ask who, precisely, would seek out Grey as a bosom buddy. That’s a variety of emotional labor I simply cannot exert. \n[ ET Online ] In the most monumental of surprises, Ciara says remaining abstinent prior to marriage was quite difficult. [ E!
