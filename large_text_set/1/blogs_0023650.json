The straight-to-series drama stars Emmy winner Kyra Sedgwick ( The Closer ) as a TV producer whose daughter goes missing; Kinney will play Casey, the upbeat assistant who idolizes Sedgwick’s character. TV veterans Erika Christensen ( Parenthood ) and Malcolm-Jamal Warner ( The Cosby Show ) have also signed on to join the Ten Days cast in recent months. RELATED Malcolm-Jamal Warner Joins Cast of ABC Drama Ten Days in the Valley \nBut there’s an interesting wrinkle here: Kinney also costars on ABC’s current freshman drama Conviction , as a paralegal on Hayley Atwell’s legal defense team. There’s been no official word yet from ABC about Conviction ‘s fate — the network did pass on ordering more episodes in November — but this casting news would seem to confirm that Conviction is indeed one-and-done. (The season, and likely series, finale airs this Sunday.) \nKinney is probably still best known as Beth Greene, the guitar-strumming survivor on AMC’s hit zombie drama The Walking Dead . Since Beth met an unfortunate end in Season 5, Kinney has appeared on Showtime’s Masters of Sex and Cinemax’s The Knick . \nIf Conviction is indeed done, will you miss it?
