Could   \nPhillip Schofield and his wife Steph were moved to tears while filming the final instalment of their South African wildlife series. \nHe wept as he helped to tranquillise a pregnant white rhino and was overcome with emotion at the plight of the severely endangered species . \nBut the ITV star insisted he didn’t come over all dramatic. \n“It was a discreet tear,” Phil explained. “What got to me was that this rhino , Temba, had a female companion that we had to keep at a distance while the vet darted her. The entire time Temba was unconscious, her friend was stock still, watching, and as soon as we were back in the jeep, she ran over to check on her. The love that she showed her friend was extraordinary and we were all in tears.” Steph and TV host Phil with the pregnant white rhino (Photo: ITV) \nPhil , 54, is furious that poachers can make £350,000 by killing a rhino and selling its horn in the Far East, where some believe it can help to cure diseases including cancer. \n“If there was ever a dumber, more stupid thing for humans to do, it’s to assume that this horn made of hair and keratin is good for your health,” he said. Luckily Steph’s tears were those of joy as she came face to face with a giraffe for the first time. Schofield’s South African Adventures is on ITV on Friday at 8pm.
