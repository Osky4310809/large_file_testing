Here’s your menu By Chris Mohr February 23, 2017 Getty Images \nHeart disease is the No. 1 killer of both men and women in America, causing 25 percent of all deaths. \nUnfortunately that number is way too high. Fortunately, good nutrition can reduce your risk significantly. \nHere are five foods that stand head and shoulders above others in helping out your heart. 1/5 Getty Images Sardines \nThough intimidating to some, these stinky-good fish are packed with omega-3 fats, vitamin D, and calcium. A January 2017 meta-analysis in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings indicated that eating a diet high in omega-3s may be associated with reduced coronary heart disease risk. Eat these as you would tuna fish. I love them mixed with ¼ avocado, ½ diced apple, 1 stalk of celery, and a few cranks of black pepper. If you’re having trouble getting over the ick factor, check out these four recipes that sneak the stinky fish in. 2/5 Getty Images Beans \nOne serving offers about as much fiber as most people eat in a day. A 2016 review in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that adding beans to your diet may be a good way to control body weight. Try this: Preheat your oven to 450°F, toss 3 cups of chickpeas with 2 Tbsp olive oil, a generous sprinkle of rosemary, salt, and a little cayenne pepper. Roast ‘em about 20 minutes, let cool, and enjoy as a snack. 3/5 Getty Images Wine \nIn a 2016 study published in the Journal of Internal Medicine , researchers found that light, frequent alcohol consumption is the most cardio-protective kind. No, that doesn’t mean a whole bottle on Friday night will make up for not drinking the other six days. Moderation, my friend. Here’s how to tell if you’re drinking too much. 4/5 Getty Images Chocolate \nA research study published in Heart in July 2016 concluded, “chocolate consumption is associated with lower myocardial infarction and heart disease.” A King Size candy bar is certainly not the same as a little square of dark chocolate at night. Quality and quantity matter. Go with dark chocolate that’s at least 75 percent cacao. We like Green & Black's 85% Cacao Organic Dark Chocolate . 5/5 Getty Images Olive oil \nA cornerstone of the Mediterranean Diet, olive oil is well known for its health benefits. A study in the July 2014 issue of Circulation found extra virgin olive oil as part of the Mediterranean Diet may reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation. Replace less healthy oils with olive oil. Don’t deep fry your foods with it or use it to shave a la Kramer in the infamous “Butter Shave” episode of Seinfeld .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:35:27.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
