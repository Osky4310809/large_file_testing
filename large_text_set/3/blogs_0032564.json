I've already made a funfetti hot chocolate and funfetti pancakes , so why not cinnamon rolls? But to make these even better, we gave them a twist and added in a nice filling of cake batter in between.\nOn Brandi: Karen Kane Dress\nCake Batter Cinnamon Rolls From Nicole Iizuka, POPSUGAR Food\nIngredients For the cake batter rolls : 1/4 cup white cake mix 1/4 cup sprinkles 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 teaspoon cinnamon 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1 8-ounce package crescent roll dough For the glaze : 1 cup powdered sugar 3 tablespoons heavy cream 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup sprinkles Directions Preheat oven to 350ÂºF and grease a small casserole dish using non-stick cooking spray. Set aside. In a bowl, mix together cake mix, sprinkles, sugar, and cinnamon. Add in softened butter and mix well. Pop the crescent roll dough and carefully unroll the dough into a long rectangle shape. Gently press together the perforated markings. Evenly sprinkle the cake batter mix over the top of the dough, leaving 1/4-inch boarders around the outsides. Roll the dough into a tight log. Slice evenly into 8 rolls and transfer the rolls into the prepared baking dish. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown on top. While the rolls are baking, combine the powdered sugar with heavy cream and vanilla extract to make a glaze. Remove rolls from the oven and drizzle with glaze and garnish with more sprinkles.
