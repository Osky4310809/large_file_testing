(Photo: Theo Wargo, Getty Images for NBC) 81 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nChelsea Handler's Netflix show is getting a big facelift. \nIn Season 2, launching April 14, Chelsea will scrap its thrice-weekly talk-show format for an hourly program available each Friday at 3:01 a.m. ET/12:01 a.m. PT., when its other new series are released. Episodes will focus on more in-depth interviews, longer field pieces and more of her signature dinner parties, the streaming service says. \nThe hour-long format will give Handler \"the opportunity to dig deeper into the subjects that matter to Chelsea most. She will travel to India, Europe, Washington, D.C., Montana and more,\" says a statement from Netflix. \nHandler debuted her new program last May, delivering three weekly episodes, released on consecutive weekdays, over the course of 30 weeks. The shows were taped two days ahead, in front of a live audience. \nChelsea , said Handler last year, was the introduction of her \"more adult phase,\" two years after leaving Chelsea Lately , her last talk show, which aired on E!. \nThough Netflix does not disclose ratings for its shows, it was a bumpy start for Chelsea , which parted ways with its first executive producer, Bill Wolff, after just a month and has failed to spark the viral content enjoyed by Handler's network and cable counterparts including Seth Meyers and Samantha Bee. \nIn July, Netflix announced it had renewed Chelsea for an additional 90 episodes, but that order will now be cut to 30 of the longer episodes. 81 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lcw83O NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
