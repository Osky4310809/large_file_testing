Theyâ€™ve moved past the controversial firing of Bob Bradley, and new manager Paul Clement just got his first big result, beating title challengers Liverpool 3-2 in their last Premier League match. \nClement brought assistant coach Nigel Gibbs with him when he joined Swansea, and itâ€™s clear this man has been the catalyst for their resurgence.

It already looks like heâ€™s got a good rapport with his players, and as cliched as it sounds, that can make all the difference in a season where the smallest margins can be the difference between relegation and safety. \nSo, there we have it. The dab is going to save Swansea.
