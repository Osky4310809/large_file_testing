CNN repeatedly noted that Putin \"sidestepped\" President Obama in the statement, instead offering his congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump. \nIn his annual greetings statement, Putin expressed hope that after Trump is sworn in as US President on January 20, the two countries, \"acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner, will be able to take real steps to restore the mechanisms of bilateral cooperation in various areas and take their interaction in the international arena to a whole new level.\" \nThe feeling appears to be mutual. When Putin decided not to retaliate against Obama's sanctions, put in place in the wake of supposed Russian hacks that the CIA believes affected the outcome of the 2016 election, Trump praised his patience and intellect. Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016 \nPutin said he'd like to wait to see what Trump's policies will be when he assumes the presidency. If so inclined, Trump can veto the sanctions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T05:12:28.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
