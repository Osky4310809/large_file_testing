Leaders from both parties were all praises for the pact and Congress leader, Raj Babbar, described it as “Rahul Gandhi’s ideology of empowerment of youth and Akhilesh Yadav’s leadership”, as the bedrock of this alliance. This comes as a volte face for Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi who had declared in public that his party would never enter into such blanket alliances.\nRewind to 2007 when Rahul Gandhi had taken off on a whirlwind tour of western UP just before the assembly elections. UPA was in power at the centre and Congress was trying hard to consolidate lost ground in many states including UP. Congressmen were looking up to Rahul to deliver for the party in a state where they had been out of power since 1989. Speaking to reporters in Muzaffarnagar, Rahul had said, “The 1996 alliance was a sell-out and a blanket one… There would be future alliances with other regional parties, but not as the one we had in 1996.”\nThen: Congress said – '27 saal, UP behaal' Today: Congress weaves an alliance with Samajwadi Party.

Congress had surprisingly agreed to play the junior partner where it contested 126 seats and won 33, while BSP fought on 296 seats to win 67. Former chief minister and SP supremo, Mulayam Singh Yadav, had then famously predicted that Congress would lose its Dalit base to BSP- which it did.\nNalin Mehta's column | #RahulGandhi ’s UP campaign cannot resurrect @INCIndia by harking back to older battles https://t.co/JNMjUUe1Ar\n— Times of India (@timesofindia) September 15, 2016\nRahul Gandhi was entirely correct in his assessment that the alliance was a sell-out. He didn’t blame other political parties, but organisational problems for the party’s downfall. Now ten years later after his comments, Congress has agreed to contest 105 seats while SP will fight on the remaining 298 seats in the state. Political pundits are unanimous in their view that Congress has got more seats than their presence on the ground across 403 seats. Post 1996, Congress has been unable to touch the 30 figure mark in UP assembly. This time around, Rahul seems to have made his peace with ground realities.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/ModiVsRest?src=hash", "https://t.co/hTnY5VlbTs", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/RahulGandhi?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/776260545636732928", "https://twitter.com/TimesNow/status/821373825300369409", "https://twitter.com/INCIndia", "https://t.co/JNMjUUe1Ar"], "published": "2017-01-24T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T07:42:45.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
