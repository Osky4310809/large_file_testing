ADVERTISEMENT \nThe group added: “This would ensure that the presence of condoms does not ‘promote’ promiscuity but is an educational tool that evokes questions and encourages discussion that takes sexual behavior seriously and promotes health and honesty in sexual relationships.” \nThe NCCP was reacting to the DOH plan to distribute condoms in schools as part of its human immunodeficiency virus prevention drive. \nThis plan has been met with fierce opposition from the Catholic Church and other sectors, which warned that the move would promote promiscuity among students. \nThe NCCP noted that condom use had been proven to be effective in preventing HIV transmission between couples, in which one is HIV positive. \nIt also stressed the role of comprehensive and age appropriate sexuality education in countering misinformation accessible to the youth. \n“There is more to be desired in addressing certain conditions in society that make our youth vulnerable to pressure and being exposed to HIV,” the NCCP said, citing poverty and other economic imbalances. \nThe religious group also pointed to the stigma attached to youths who grow up to be lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex “and where the lack of social and religious acceptance leaves them no room to be authentic.” \nThe NCCP affirmed that sexuality was a gift from God and there should be a “deliberate, careful and responsible celebration of that gift.” \n“Abstinence, being drug free, fidelity and committed relationships are paramount. This should not exclude other evidence-informed prevention strategies such as the use of condoms,” it added.
