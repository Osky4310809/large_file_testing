Chelsea landed a telling blow on their title rivals, says Gary Cahill \nHe told Standard Sport: “The international break gives me a good chance to rest my knee. It’s a very good thing for me. \n“Only I feel the pain so nobody knows [how hard it’s been to cope with]. But we have amazing medical staff and they have been great with me. \n“Every single match, every single player they are there for every player. They have helped me a lot. Premier League round-up: Chelsea remain 10 points clear at the top \n“I won’t need an operation in the summer. But it’s very good for me to rest, not just the knee, but the body as well. \n“I am disappointed to not be in the Brazil squad, but I respect the decision. I’m playing regularly and trying to do my best to come back [into the squad]. Have I been told why I wasn’t picked? No.” \nLuiz left Chelsea for Paris St German in 2014, only to return to the club in a £34million deal last August. \nHe has never won the title and knows Chelsea have to stand firm if they are to lift the trophy. \nThey need a maximum of 21 points from their remaining 10 matches to be champions and Luiz insists no team will outfight them. \n“We have to show every day in our lives that we are tough men as well as good footballers,” he said.

It’s not just inside the pitch, it’s about being this way every day. When you’re with people, you need to show your character. \n“The Premier League hasn’t changed since I was here before. It’s always so difficult, especially at Stoke, but we did well.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T11:27:25.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
