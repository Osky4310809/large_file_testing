The call letters have been tossed in the dustbin; they no longer serve a purpose. CBS Radio has rebranded 103.7 on Your FM Dial as the Amp , a moniker also bestowed upon energy drinks and vitamins that promise \" a lean, ripped physique .\" The Amp is now playing a handful of pop-radio hits, by the likes of Bruno Mars and Taylor Swift and DJ Snake, over and over and over , ad infinitum. Like a handful of other stations in town, at least until they all change formats again. \nI cannot say I will miss KVIL, mostly because I haven't listened to it in years -- couldn't tell you its format since, oh, 1985? Last time I dialed in for any length was the first day of September 2000, when Ron Chapman signed off after a 31-year stint as The Voice of KVIL and, by extension, Dallas radio. That was, perhaps, the last Most Meaningful Moment on local radio. \n\"They should have changed the call letters the day he left,\" said Jody Dean, who joined KVIL in 1982 and served as Chapman's producer before replacing him on the morning show. Legendary Dallas broadcaster Ron Chapman maintains sense of humor while recovering from pre-Christmas stroke \nKVIL was always my mom's station, hogging up most of the pre-sets in the '76 Cordoba and later the '79 LeBaron station wagon; it was either Ron Chapman or a Helen Reddy 8-track. Every store in town used KVIL's mellow rock as its shop-to soundtrack; it even provided the background music softly droning throughout my orthodontist's office, because what pre-teen with a mouth full of metal doesn't dig some \"Afternoon Delight.\" To this day I still get the shakes whenever I hear Chicago's \"If You Leave Me Now,\" Gerry Rafferty's \"Right Down the Line\" and anything by Anne Murray or Barry Manilow. \nBut KVIL, four letters that decorated 100,000 Dallasites' car bumpers during one notable 1982 promotion, shouldn't be allowed to vanish without a proper eulogy. It was, after all, the city's top radio station for years, throughout the 1970s and '80s and even into the '90s, when it was finally capsized by country radio. Consultants studied and copied KVIL, launching dozens of lite-rock imitations across the country. But it was impossible to replicate a station that made a growing big city feel like a small town. \nIn a 1985 issue of Billboard , the music industry's trade publication, a radio consultant called it \" dominant \" -- \"the best-run radio station in Dallas\" among a pile of worthy contenders, including K104. Fifteen years later, this newspaper called it \"the 800-pound gorilla of Dallas radio,\" describing Chapman as \"not only one of the top DJs in Dallas, but one of the most respected and feared in the country.\" \nBut as of Wednesday, KVIL is no more. \n\"And that means something,\" Mike Rhyner said Thursday morning. \nRhyner, co-founder and sage of the sports-talking Ticket, spent the '70s and '80s just down the FM dial from KVIL at KZEW , where the jocks played hard(ish) rock while Chapman and his band spun cotton candy. The Zoo crew used to regard KVIL's mushy adult-contemporary playlist as a punchline. \"But a well-respected punchline,\" Rhyner said. Ron Chapman and KVIL producer Sandi Hopkins in 1986. (Juan Garcia/Staff photo) \n\"In my own little world, the end of KVIL was something unthinkable,\" he said. \"KVIL was so big, so all-encompassing that you never thought it would go away.\" \nBut, of course, its demise was inevitable, yet another casualty of shifting tastes and platforms; it's sign-off came just two months after Clear Channel dulled The Edge by making it, too, a dull shade of Maroon 5. CBS Radio's local market manager Brian Purdy, in announcing the format change, made just a brief nod to the station's past by insisting 103.7 is \"not your mother's radio station any more,\" which hit a little close to home. \nEven Ron Chapman was not at all shocked to hear of its demise when I called him Wednesday afternoon to tell him his beloved KVIL was now, um, the Amp. After a brief, hoarse \"Oh my God,\" he shrugged off the news with all the oh-well of an 80-year-old man who bowed on Dallas teenybop radio juggernaut KLIF-AM when the Beatles were still known as The Quarrymen. \n\"Well, they had to do something,\" the National Radio Hall of Famer said. Chapman's booming voice is now a shadow of its former self, the result of a stroke suffered just before Christmas in 2012. He likes to say he lost two-thirds of his voice then, but every so often you can hear peeks and hints of that booming voice that used to wake up Dallas every weekday morning. Beneath that rasp, he's still very much the man who once broadcast while skydiving and who in April 1988 asked listeners to send $20 without explaining why and wound up collecting $240,000 he dispensed to charity. \n\"But it's a different world in radio, isn't it?\" Chapman said. \"How sad that all of those KVIL things are now part of history. That's a very sad commentary on the times. After I left, there were several attempts to be 'the new KVIL,' but KVIL left such an impressive mark on Dallas that they were never able to shake this old image of its old people there, me being among them.\" Pouring out one last Zima for KDGE-FM after Dallas' 'new music alternative' died at 27 \nChapman moved to KVIL, so named for its original HQ in the Highland Park Village, in December 1968, after the station briefly flirted with Top 40 in an attempt to topple the mighty KLIF. An announcement in this newspaper heralded his arrival, along with the promise that KVIL would play music that was \"always in good taste, but contemporary in all ways\" -- a rather unwieldy slogan. \nThe station would cycle through many owners, all of whom readily admitted they were really buying Chapman -- \" a warm and fuzzy tyrant ,\" D called him in 1989, which he took as compliment. It was Chapman who gave KVIL its sound in 1969: music for young adults who'd grown up listening to him on KLIF. It was Chapman who convinced owners to ditch their paltry AM signal and go with its powerful 100,000-watt signal. And it was Chapman who ran every single nutty promo in the station's stories history, among them a scavenger hunt that involved hidden tape recorders, secret messages and, eventually, a Braniff International Airways ticket to Hawaii. KVIL stunt in 1982 by Robert Wilonsky on Scribd \n\"In so many ways around here, Chapman was the pioneer, the seer,\" Rhyner said. \"And when he left, that was it.\" \nWednesday's announcement just made it officially, finally. It would be rude not to let Ron Chapman give it a proper send-off. \n\"It's a shame it's gone, but KVIL had a great history,\" he said. \"It was what it was when it was. And now, it is no longer.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T22:17:33.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
