(Latour/Variety/REX/Shutterstock)  34 PM \nFour years later, Paul Walker's death is still a crying shame for his co-star and close friend Vin Diesel. \nDiesel choked back tears while paying tribute to his late pal and \"Fast and Furious\" co-star at CinemaCon in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Variety reports . \nDiesel told the crowd that the long-running action franchise's eighth chapter, next month's \"The Fate of the Furious,\" was all thanks to Walker. \n\"It was Paul Walker who promised eight,\" he said, before surprising the audience with the debut of the film in full. \"It played over and over again in my head … Part of Paul's legacy lives through every frame that we shoot. You are reminded of this angel that was so integral to this concept of brotherhood for our millennium. There's something beautiful about that. There's something celebratory about that.\" Diesel and Walker starred together in the “Fast and Furious” franchise. (AP) \nWalker died in 2013 at the age of 40 following a fiery single-car crash in California. \nIn 2015, Diesel honored his friendship with Walker by naming his daughter Pauline . \n\"While I was in the hospital, the name that I will give you is … I named her … I named her Pauline,\" he said at the time. \"There's no other person that I was thinking about as I was cutting this umbilical cord. I knew he was there and it felt like, you know, a way to keep his memory a part of my family and a part of my world.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:06:02.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
