With that in mind, ESPN FC takes a look back at the 2016 season with an eye to some of the best tifos fans created over the course of the year to show support for their favorite teams. \nSeattle Sounders \nThe defending MLS Cup winners have some of the best support in the league at CenturyLink Field, home to a group of fans that have brought some of the most creative tifos in league history to life during the club's existence. Seattle fans unfurled this banner on Nov. 22, ahead of the team's Western Conference first-leg match against the Colorado Rapids. \nToronto FC \nHost fans felt that 2016 was their year when the MLS Cup final was played at BMO Field, but Toronto failed to turn a majority of possession and opportunities on goal into victory in Seattle's penalty-shootout win. Toronto fans felt their time had come in the MLS Cup final, but the team failed to bring home the trophy against Seattle. \nNew York Red Bulls \nHarrison, New Jersey, home to Red Bull Arena, is also home to some of the loudest and most passionate fans in MLS. The best team in the Eastern Conference in the regular season fell short in the playoffs yet again, but it certainly wasn't from a lack of support from fans. New York fans showed support for the Red Bulls in their season opener on March 6, but the team dropped the match 2-0 to Toronto FC. \nSporting Kansas City \nPeter Vermes' team reached the playoffs in 2016, but were bounced by eventual champions Seattle and an 88th-minute Nelson Valdez strike in the first round. SKC should factor into the postseason picture again this season, with the core of an experienced squad still intact and a home fortress at Children's Mercy Park. When teams come to Children's Mercy Park, supporters are quick to remind visitors whose house they are in. \nNew England Revolution \nRevs fans turned out this Star Wars-inspired \"Force Awakens\" tifo on March 12 in a season that saw New England's on-field \"Rebels\" miss out on the last playoff spot on goal differential to Philadelphia. A Star Wars-inspired tifo is rolled out to help New England defend their fortress at Gillette Stadium. \nFC Dallas \nFans of the 2016 Supporters' Shield winners set partisan dynamics aside when Orlando City paid a visit on July 4, following the June 12 Pulse nightclub shooting in the visitor's hometown to show solidarity following the tragedy that left 49 people dead. FC Dallas fans show support for the families and victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting ahead of a July 4 match vs. Orlando. \nNew York City FC \nThe team may still play its home games in Yankee Stadium, but as this tifo suggests, fans believe the world of football is theirs. Pictured David Villa helped the team finish third in the East by scoring 23 goals, second-most in the league in 2016. David Villa scored 23 goals in 2016 as New York City FC soared to second in the Eastern Conference only to flame out against Toronto FC in the playoffs. \nHouston Dynamo \nLone Star state fans in Dallas have had a good few years, but those in Houston have seen the once-mighty Dynamo struggle. That hasn't stopped supporters of the two-time MLS Cup winners from showing their colors at BBVA Compass Stadium. 2016 was another disappointing season for Houston, who haven't reached the playoffs since 2012. \nPhiladelphia Union \nAs Philadelphia were in the midst of a playoff battle in 2016, supporters laid down a marker on Aug. 20 when Toronto FC came to town that their team should not be taken lightly. The Union lost 3-1, but they went on to make the postseason. Fans at Talen Energy Stadium drew a line in the sand when Toronto paid a visit in August last year. \nPortland Timbers \nThe northwest is home to more than just one team with vocal -- and very creative -- fans. The Timbers Army put this tifo together ahead of San Jose's June 14 visit to Cascadia. The Timbers won that U.S. Open Cup fourth-round match 2-0. The Timbers Army rivals neighbors-to-the-north Seattle for some of the most creative and cutting tifos in the league. \nSan Jose Earthquakes \nWith neighbors to the south the LA Galaxy visiting on June 23, Quakes supporters staked claim to ownership of the city of San Jose and the larger state in general. It wasn't a great year for the proud franchise, as it failed to make the playoffs, but confidence should be trending up at Avaya Stadium ahead of the 2017 season. San Jose fans claim ownership of of the city and the home state during a mid-summer visit of So Cal's LA Galaxy. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.
