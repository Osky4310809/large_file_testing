Feb 22 Building an activist ecosystem: part 1 In the last week, 2* critical incidents in Texas foreshadow the death rattle of our already labored immigration system: A transgender Latina was arrested by ICE in a El Paso courthouse . A victim of domestic violence, she was filing for a protective order against her abuser — the only person besides her legal support who knew where she was. A young man with DACA was arrested over a small amount of marijuana possession in San Antonio. As his family waited outside the jail for him to be released on bail, they were informed he had been detained by ICE. Thanks to the work of RAICES, he has since been released but is not out of danger. Lawyers and organizers stepped up in San Antonio and El Paso to provide immediate legal support. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has long been considered a rogue agency by activists but both cases show a new audacity to immigration enforcement. Even though the incidents raised red flags, there simply weren’t enough resources for Texas advocates to turn these flash points into opportunities for community organizing. With attacks from all levels of government, immigrants wake up to a new threat every day in Texas. But a lack of movement infrastructure holds immigrant organizers back from fighting back effectively and sustainably. In New York and California, deep networks of advocates exist with funding, training, and the capacity necessary to slowly transform these states into champions of immigrant integration and mobilization. Responses to urgent situations are often rapid, scalable, coordinated, and attempt to leverage a bad situation into a movement opportunity. California is the model everyone talks about. But in even Illinois, the Congressional delegation has a significant number of Republican supporters of comprehensive immigration reform due to a well-organized network of business and community leaders. While immigrants and communities of color still face a lot of problems in these states, Texas’ activist infrastructure pales in comparison. This has long been a mystery. Why does a state with the second largest population of immigrants, undocumented or otherwise, have such a fragmented activist ecosystem? Why is Texas neglected for funding and institutional support from progressives and the movement across the country? And how do we begin to build an immigrant rights’ movement to bolster existing activism while respecting the uniqueness of Texas politics? For years, a combination of scrappy grassroots networks and conservatives’ need to preserve a pro-business climate staved off anti-immigrant legislation in Texas. While movement infrastructure remained sparse, this patchwork activism was enough for vulnerable immigrants fly under the radar. As long as no one drew attention to the immigrants who live, work, and worship in the state, no bad policies passed — but nothing good happened either. A stalemate was all we had. Gov. Rick Perry branded Texas as the premier destination for business so state leadership listened when industry lobbyists pushed back against immigrant crackdowns. The current Texas Governor and Lieutenant Governor fully embrace using immigrants as a political wedge. As the 85th Texas Legislature meets in 2017, any semblance of a political middle ground has crumbled . Trump’s election not only emboldened xenophobic legislators in the state but made it harder for business interests to make the case for benign neglect. Now Texas is ground zero for mass deportation. A few weeks ago, a “show me your papers” law similar to Arizona’s SB 1070 zipped through the Texas Senate . Immigration enforcement ramped up across the state, paralyzing immigrant communities . Residents in the already-militarized Rio Grande Valley anxiously await plans for a massive border wall. And the executive memos released by the Trump administration make it clear nearly all undocumented immigrants in this country are fair game for arrest, detention, and deportation. For a strained mass of lawyers, nonprofits, and grassroots activists, the worst case scenario is unfolding. What we can pull together by the skin of our teeth is no longer enough. And the only way we get through it all is by building the activist ecosystem we should have had all along. It’s tedious to think about strategic planning when I spend my day consoling friends sobbing hysterically over the fear of their parents getting deported and running around Austin checking out rumors of ICE activity. Many of us are working in overwhelmed and traumatized communities stretched to their breaking point. But those same communities deserve connected, collaborative, and strategic advocates who can deliver a long term vision of justice alongside avenues for short term relief. “Building an activist ecosystem” is a series of posts based on my 6 ½ years of observations in Texas advocacy and the national immigrant rights’ movement. It is not an exhaustive framework nor does it speak for every immigrant justice organizer in the state. It’s an evolving project as my colleagues and I hold listening sessions to assess what our communities want and need. As the earth slips out from under us, most advocates spend so much time working they don’t take a step back and troubleshoot campaigns or tactics. My goal is to provide a diagnostic for people without the luxury of time and a rough guide for non-Texans or new allies looking to understand and support our work. I approach this project with several biases. First, my experience heavily indexes Austin. I became an organizer in 2010 while I was a sophomore at the University of Texas-Austin. The immigrant student activists there are among the most privileged in the state and the campus is a known source of talent for the national youth movement. I can’t begin to explain the fears and the challenges facing immigrants in South or West Texas. I can’t tell you what organizing against in-state tuition looks like in a community college, where 75% of the undocumented Texas students in school are enrolled. I also transitioned from campus activism at an elite university to a salaried job in Austin as an organizer with an influential and well-resourced nonprofit as soon as I graduated. My activism has benefited from stability and access. Second, I’ve spent the last 3 years activating conservative business and tech interests on immigration policies at my day job. I pay more attention than most to leveraging non-impacted constituencies. Someone has to do the work to make the middle. For a few years now, that person has been me. While building a base is critical, I don’t think we can win in Texas if we don’t offer a moderate alternative for the extremist politics hijacking state governance. Third, I dabble in Democratic Party work but don’t conflate a political party with a social movement. I helped write the state party platform on immigration in 2013 and successfully lobbied them to incorporate support for in-state tuition in 2011. I’m not a partisan and don’t think that Democrats winning statewide is the biggest priority in building a progressive Texas. There are parts of Texas where simply holding an elected official accountable for anti-immigrant stances or mobilizing non-voters will go further than trying to elect a Democrat. Fourth, my identity and personal history plays a strong role in all of this. As an immigrant South Asian woman from a persecuted Muslim family, there has been little space for someone like me in the immigrant rights’ movement. This lack of belonging is a powerful motivation to be critical of current advocacy frameworks. I also have privileged identity markers as a cisgender straight woman, and don’t face the same sort of criminalization that Black or Latino immigrants face. While I criticize the movement for not being inclusive of non-Latino immigrants, my approach in this series focuses more on Latinos than anyone else because of Texas demographics. Next, because I fit in nowhere, I’ve built a career out of being everywhere. This is neither a privilege or a disadvantage but a fluidity I know most people aren’t capable of. I spend a lot of time comfortably talking to Republicans, conservative business leaders, and liberal white people. The best friends I’ve made from this work are Latinas and queer immigrant men. What I do and who I am is unique, and I don’t expect people to be comfortable navigating these disparate spaces. But this flexibility teaches me there is a place for everyone who wants to help and for everything people have to offer. Lastly, America ignores what happens in Texas at its own peril. We have lessons to teach the rest of the country. A steady drumbeat of increasingly conservative rule and an absence of political competition make us a petri dish for race-to-the-bottom style governance. Trump is not new here. If this country wants to survive or if allies are asking how they can make a big impact, start by looking, listening, and learning here. P.S.
