This particular bag was spotted at Rite Aid, so head to your nearest store if you want to grab one ASAP. We're inclined to think that these will taste like the Strawberry M&M's from last year but a peanut-filled version instead (yum). In a world where regular M&M's are getting all the love, it's nice to see Peanut M&M's getting some exciting attention, right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:33:26.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
