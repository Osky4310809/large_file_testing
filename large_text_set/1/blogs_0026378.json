Photo: FC Bayern Munich \nApple Music has announced its entry into the world of high profile sport sponsorship, by agreeing a sponsorship deal with top German soccer club FC Bayern Munich. \nThe club, which is the biggest in Germany, has revealed that as part of the deal it will be offering exclusive Apple Music playlists and other content. \n“From inspirational and uplifting songs to listen to during training to celebratory playlists post-match, there will be music for everyone to enjoy throughout the season,” a press release from the club notes. “The first team playlist is available now. Alongside exclusive content and videos, Apple Music will also be FC Bayern Munich’s music service of choice.” \nThe club previously had a deal with the Apple-owned Beats, which will continue its current role as the club’s “official sound partner.” Last year, Apple and Bayern Munich also crossed over in a TV commercial, starring the team’s 28-year-old central defender Mats Hummels. \nWhile Apple sponsoring a German soccer club may not seem like big news to Apple fans in the United States, it could turn out to be an important step. \nThe company has previously taken steps to embrace the sport world by bringing marathon runner Christy Turlington Burns into the Apple fold to talk about the benefits of training with an Apple Watch. Top NBA players and other athletes have also been spotted wearing the device, although Apple hasn’t previously gone down the sponsorship route. \nPerhaps the closest previous instant was Apple’s unofficial Olympics-style Watch bands , which were sold at the games, but were not officially endorsed by the Olympics. \nStill, as Apple makes it clear that fitness-tracking is its big focus with the Apple Watch, it makes sense to take a note out of Beats’ playbook and capitalize on the sport market. We’d expect to hear of some other similar sponsorship deals very soon!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T14:47:56.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
