Considering that fact, it’s no wonder that storytelling skills can be of great value even today. According to a research [1] by John Donahue from University of North Carolina and Melanie Green from University at Buffalo, storytelling abilities have an influence on women when choosing long-term partners. The research consists of three studies conducted on 388 undergraduate students (55% women) where they were asked to rate the attractiveness of potential partners whose picture they were shown while providing information about their storytelling skills at the same time. It appears that one of the qualities women look for in long-term partners is the ability to tell a good story.  Why is storytelling so important?\nGood story can go a long way in improving relationships When you are in a long-term relationship, you tend to stop telling stories and end up exchanging ordinary small talks. That can lead to the extinction of all that is romantic, but you want to keep the spark burning. Is there a better way to bond than over telling stories about the moments you shared together? It will help you relive the great moments and remind you why you fell for each other.\nWhen you hit the rocks in your relationship, telling stories can help resolve the conflict. By retelling your story, it helps you observe it from a different angle and have a better grasp on what has happened. If couples can tell their individual perspectives on a certain event, and then make it into a single story, it helps them create a bond and overcome the difficulties.\nStorytelling can empower both speaker and the listener It is quite an intimate experience when you share your story with someone. Thus getting recognition from the listener in terms of understanding what you’ve gone through is empowering. In return, sharing your emotions weaved into intimate stories provides an insight to the listener into your real self, which empowers the listener. It creates a sense of mutual trust and understanding.\nHow you tell your story can impact your health When something unexpected or traumatic happens, you try to make sense of it. By retelling your story it will help you cope with it and feel less traumatized each time you share it. Telling your story starts the healing process and it sets you on the path of overcoming the trauma.\nFurthermore, how you approach your personal narratives can help you become a happier person. The way you construct your personal story helps you come to terms with your true self, thus it is important to always take a positive approach in telling your story. Even when you ponder about some mistakes you’ve made, approach them in your story as a learning experience rather than a negative experience. By presenting yourself in a positive light, you will be able to envision a positive future and start the road to reach it.\nHow you can improve your storytelling skills Include real emotions: The best way to capture someone’s attention is to include the real emotions, even if the main narrative is constructed around an unrealistic event. Capturing real emotions will help listeners feel included in the story, and empathize. Follow the basic structure: Your story needs to be crafted so as to have an introductory beginning, a middle with some plot twist, and an end where all the issues resolve and we learn a certain lesson. It also needs to communicate a unique voice. Reminisce the past and look forward to the future:  Bring out the great memories you shared with your partner to revive the connection. Also, tell stories about the future events you wish to take place, picturing the great moments you want to share together, and it will help you visualize the direction you want to go in. Practice: As with anything, practice makes perfect. Read a lot to get the ideas from the best.
