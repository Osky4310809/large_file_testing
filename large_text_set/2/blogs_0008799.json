It is a snapshot rather than a forecast. \nFor a start, it is not a poll which are weighted by age, geography and class and use previous polls as benchmarks. \nBut the sheer size of then Google survey and that fact it is of Mirror website readers makes it of interest. There are mixed results for Theresa May in the Mirror survey (Photo: Getty) \nThe findings also show that a majority of people believe Theresa May was right to put regaining control of our borders as the priority for Brexit. \nThe Prime Minister also comes out strongly when people are asked their opinions of party leaders. \nThe survey also underlines that Jeremy Corbyn has a long way to go before he can convince people he is a credible Prime Minister in waiting . \nCorbyn’s fate could hinge on what happens in next week’s by-elections in Copeland and Stoke. \nMy colleague Ben Glaze has now been to test the waters (and probably, like any self-respecting journalist, the beers) in both seats. \nIt is noticeable that even some of Corbyn's strongest supporters in Parliament are now speculating about how long he should stay if there is no turn around in Labour’s fortunes. \nIan Lavery, the party’s new campaign manager, said there were plenty of potential leaders waiting in the wings should Corbyn decide to stand down “of his own volition.” \nParliament is on a half-term break this week which may be reflected in the morning newsletter.
