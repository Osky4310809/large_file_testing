Long before SS Homme became the choice of celebrity stylists. \nI first checked out the brand while third-level stalking someone on Insta and accidentally stumbled on a suggested post for butonnière that SS Homme stocked. \nStore Location: In the heart of Bandra West, excellent for suburban dwellers in Mumbai. Though it might be a bit of a trek if you live in SoBo. \nFirst Impressions: With clean, minimalist interiors, the store is divided into two sections: one where you get your stuff tailored, and the other half where you can buy off the rack. They have fancy names – bespoke, prêt, etc. \nThere’s a convenient outdoor seating area just as soon as you enter the gates, which is most often occupied by the store’s staff when they’re on a break. \nOwners Sandeep Gonsalves and Sarah Sheikh are a married couple who double up as brand ambassadors by way of looking like perfectly styled mannequins, no less impressive than runway models. \nThe duo found me a handful when I complained that their rates for tailoring were astronomically ridiculous. It was then concluded that I be handled by their manager, Ritika, who had a far higher tolerance for my BS. \nVerdict: SS Homme has been subject to my eccentricities and highly specific demands when I tailored a couple of bundis, a blazer, and an achkan (a shorter version of the sherwani, usually worn in Rajasthan). \nThey’re pricey and very particular about payment upfront (50% now or take a hike, buddy), but their quality is, for lack of a better word, flawless. \nHigh point: SS Homme's strength lies in their two-fitting rule; they insist you visit them twice before releasing your order to you. \nIn the case of my blazer, I actually managed to go there 4 times before returning home with the goods. Their staff is mercurial when it comes to fittings and receptive to your requests. Think Saville Row meets Swami Vivekananada Road. \nThey don’t mind accepting suit lengths from outside, though I'd urge you to check out their in-house collection as well. They're great with accessories, and the store stocks some impressive metallic buttons, butonnières , bow-ties, cufflinks etc. \nLow point: Many of the fancy accessories the store has have been imported and are tres pricey. Also, the 2-week wait period for an outfit is tough, especially if you have an event coming up and you need something ASAP. \nPrice: Rs.24,000 for the achkan , another Rs. 18,000 for the blazer, and a meagre Rs.12,000 for the bundi… those are just the tailoring charges. I dare to imagine what they’d be if I’d bought the cloth from the store! \nSS Homme is probably one of the priciest tailors in Mumbai, but the quality and finish are definitely worth the scalding sensation on your pockets. \nFull disclosure: I initially flaunted my publishing credentials in the hope of getting a discount. They promptly told me to go to Big Bazaar… I jest. They told me to go to Zara instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T16:02:06.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
