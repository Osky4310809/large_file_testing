It now looks like the official launch is just around the corner, as the company is already taking registrations for early access to Samsung Pay in the country.\nTo use Samsung Pay, you’ll need one of the devices that support the service. These include the Galaxy S7 Edge , Galaxy S7 , Galaxy S6 Edge+ , Galaxy Note 5 , Galaxy A7 (2016) , and Galaxy A5 (2016) . Additionally, you also need a credit or debit card issued by one of the banks that support Samsung Pay. For now, the tech giant has managed to get Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI Cards, and Standard Chartered Bank on board. More banks will be added soon, with one of the first being Citibank India.\nSee also: Android Pay vs Apple Pay vs Samsung Pay Overview April 27, 2016 Mobile payment services will be big business in the future. That is why companies like Samsung are trying to expand them to as many markets as possible. Samsung Pay does have an advantage over some of its competitors, as it uses both NFC as well as Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST), which supports older magnetic credit card machines. The payments service can, therefore, be used in most shops in the country, as the vast majority of card readers are compatible with MST.\nIf you own one of the above-mentioned smartphones and a supported credit/debit card, you can try out Samsung Pay before it gets officially released.
