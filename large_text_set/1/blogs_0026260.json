Batman v Superman stars Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill: ‘Batman’s like Hamlet’ \nHowever, according to Variety , rumours began circulating a month ago that Affleck would step down from the directing role. Affleck finally pulled out with a statement in which he said: “Performing this role demands focus, passion and the very best performance I can give. It has become clear that I cannot do both jobs to the level they require.” He added: “I am still in this, and we are making it, but we are currently looking for a director.” \nVariety have named War for the Planet of the Apes director Matt Reeves as a potential replacement. It has also reported sources denying that the recent huge loss that Warner Bros incurred on Affleck’s gangster film Live By Night was connected to the decision.
