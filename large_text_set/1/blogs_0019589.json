Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA Tory MP's \"attack\" on striking workers has been defeated at its very first hurdle in Parliament. \nChris Philp wanted to ban rail, NHS and other state workers from striking unless their actions were labelled \"reasonable and proportionate\" by a High Court judge. \nHis law would have also set out a \"minimal required level of service to the public\" during strikes. \nBut his backbench Bill was defeated today after just 20 minutes in Parliament after an effort by Labour and SNP MPs.

Lost because Labour & SNP whipped against, and Govt Ministers cannot vote\". \nDuring the short debate he acknowledged unions had a \"long history\" of campaigning for rights including maternity pay and set hours. \n\"I applaud those achievements... and I respect what trade unions have achieved in the last 150 years,\" he said. \nBut he added: \"I must also recognise that strikes have a profound effect on the wider public, especially where those strikes occur on critical national services. \n\"It is time to consider again the impact that strikes have on the wider public and to protect the public as well as upholding the right to strike.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T17:46:07.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
