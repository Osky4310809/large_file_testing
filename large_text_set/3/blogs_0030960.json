by Christy Doran Source: FOX SPORTS IT’S been a rocky start to the year for Australia’s five Super Rugby franchises. \nSix wins from a 23 matches makes for dire reading in anybody’s books. \nBut amongst the doom and gloom from Australia’s underwhelming performances are some rays of sunshine. \nWe look at five players who have had a breakout start to the year and will be on Wallabies coach Michael Cheika’s radar. \nKarmichael Hunt (Reds) \nThe Reds’ season might be evaporating before their very eyes, but the early season form of Hunt is something to cheer about. \nOn the verge of Test selection in 2016, a groin injury stopped Hunt dead in his tracks in the lead up to last June’s three-match Test series against England. \nIn truth, his form was hardly spectacular. \nHe was still learning the game, still putting on the extra kilograms lost during his stint in AFL and still finding his feet after a turbulent 2015. \nBut it seems only injury can derail his Wallabies aspirations this season. \nHunt issued an early statement at the Brisbane Tens where he took the ball to the line, showcased his silky ball playing skills by putting teammates into holes and hit brutally hard in defence. \nIt was those characteristics that defined him as a rugby league player and it’s why Cheika has pushed his name in the past. Karmichael Hunt has been the Reds’ best player in 2017.

Ryan Louwrens is playing his way into a Wallaby jersey.

Everything is too predictable, too slow. \nFrench-based Will Genia is head and shoulders Australia’s No 1 scrum-half, but the battle to be his deputy is wide open. \nNick Phipps and Nick Frisby have gone backwards in 2017, so much so that the former was dropped by his Super Rugby club. \nNic Stirzaker seems burdened by the Rebels captaincy and needs to stay fit to get back to the heights of 2015, while Wallaby squad member Joe Powell had a tough night against the Highlanders after starting the season in promising touch. \nForce scrum-half Ryan Louwrens is, however, one player putting up his hand for higher honours. \nLike the Force’s season to date, Louwrens is having a go and showing he’s up for the fight after a couple of seasons waiting in the wings. \nLouwrens has a crisp pass, has a good sense of when to run the ball and is one of the better kicking No 9’s in Australia. \nHis contest against Pulu this weekend shapes as the key in the Force’s match against the Blues. Tolu Latu is putting pressure on Stephen Moore and Tatafu Polota-Nau Source: News Corp Australia \nTolu Latu (Waratahs) \nCapped four times for the Wallabies on last year’s Spring Tour, Latu has picked up where he left off last year. \nThe Waratahs hooker has been among Australia’s best three players each week since the season started. \nLast year he was the Waratahs’ third choice hooker behind Tatafu Polota-Nau and Hugh Roach. \nBut Polota-Nau’s departure to the Force has opened up a starting spot and Latu has grabbed it with both hands. \nWhile he’s always been strong over the ball, what Latu has done particularly well is improve his workrate across the field and become more consistent at the set-piece. \nNo hooker can get away with a dodgy throw and, at present, Latu seems to have honed his skills at the lineout. \nFor the time being Wallabies captain Stephen Moore is Australia’s best choice at the hooking role, but at 34 his powers are starting to wane and with a World Cup still more than two years away expect to see Latu rotate with Polota-Nau for the reserve position. Sam Carter is back to his best after a quiet 2016. Source: Getty Images \nSam Carter (Brumbies) \nA familiar face in Australian rugby, Carter has caught a second wind since being handed the co-captaincy. \nWith his fellow co-captain Christian Lealiifano on the comeback from cancer, Carter has been leading the Brumbies and doing a superb job too. \nAfter the departures of Moore, Matt Toomua, Joe Tomane and the year-long sabbatical of David Pocock, the Brumbies were anticipated to struggle in 2017. \nBut instead they lead the Australian conference — albeit with just two wins. \nWhile it’s still not quite clicking for the Brumbies with ball-in-hand, the leadership and fighting display by the club can’t be questioned and Carter must be credited for his skill in galvanising the young team together. \nLeadership aside, Carter is back to his best in the second row. \nDespite playing 13 Tests for the Wallabies, the 27-year-old has played just two Tests in two years and one of the reasons behind that is he’s struggled to dent the line last year. \nBeing a pillar in the lineout is no longer good enough. You have to get over the advantage line and be able to catch and pass. \nA knee injury in 2015 slowed his momentum and it’s only now that he’s back fully fit and firing. Sam Talakai has taken over from scrummaging king Greg Holmes. Source: News Corp Australia \nSam Talakai (Reds) \nFilling the gap left by Wallaby Greg Holmes was never going to be easy, but Talakai continues to develop as a tight-head prop. \nHolmes was one of the best scrummagers in the country and his exit has been profoundly felt at the Reds. \nAfter the season-ending injury to James Slipper, Talakai’s muscle in the pack becomes all the more important. \nWhat we need to see from the front-rower is Talakai carrying the ball forward more. \nWhile the Kiwis are the best ball-in-hand runners in the world, they also know how to keep it tight, pick and drive and are lightning to the breakdown. \nNotable mentions:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:04:19.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
