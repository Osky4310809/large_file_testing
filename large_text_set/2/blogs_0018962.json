He broke former President Barack Obama's record for most executive orders in his first week, implemented highly controversial immigration policies and accepted the resignation of his national security adviser after just 23 days, just to name a few. \nJust over a month into his new job, Trump has already logged more travel miles than most presidents in their entire first 100 days in office. His trips to a members-only resort he typically calls the \"Winter White House,\" are some of the most expensive and frequent of any modern president's initial travels. \nTrump has spent 11 of his first 33 days as president at his luxurious, sprawling Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, celebrating Super Bowl festivities and hosting world leaders like Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Eyebrows were raised when Trump dealt with a security crisis involving North Korea on his cellphone in front of restaurant diners. \nPresident Donald Trump announced his new National Security Adviser Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster (L) and that acting adviser Keith Kellogg (R) will become the chief of staff of the National Security Council at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida Feb. 20, 2017.

Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders wouldn't name the president's golf partner that day, telling reporters the president’s time on the course was “a couple of holes.” Sanders backpedaled on Monday when she acknowledged in a statement that Trump had been on the course much longer that previously stated after McIlroy publicly commented that he and Trump played 18 holes. \nPast presidents have mostly adhered to spending their first few months in office crafting legislation in the Oval Office. Dating back to the Franklin Roosevelt administration, the president's first 100 days have long been considered a way to measure the commander-in-chief's accomplishments and successes. \nObama hadn't played a single round of golf by the time Trump enjoyed a full game with McIlroy. Having taken office amid a financial crisis, Obama spent his first month as president signing orders to drastically overhaul the nation's financial regulations. \nFresh off a bitter recount battle, George W. Bush pushed for his massive tax cut plan in his first 100 days but also dealt with a U.S. reconnaissance plane that was forced to make an emergency landing on a Chinese island after being hit by a Chinese fighter jet.

Clinton was also dealt some immediate domestic crises, which included a deadly 51-day siege in Waco, Texas, that eclipsed most other issues the new president faced. \nRonald Reagan spent his first 100 days almost entirely in Washington, D.C., prioritizing tax cuts and economic reform, while his successor, George H.W. Bush, took a four-day-long trip in April 1989, visiting six states to discuss the plans he laid out and the successes his administration were already celebrating. \nTrump, meanwhile, has remained consistent in challenging presidential protocol. He has spent a sizable portion of his time traveling to states he secured during the presidential election as part of his national \"thank you\" tour, as well as his weekend trips to South Florida. \nTrump's excursions also come with a hefty bill. Taxpayers are already expected to pay $10 million for his Florida trips– a figure that could reach hundreds of millions by the time he leaves both of his apparent \"White Houses.\" Join the Discussion Everything You Need To Know, Right Now. \nThe IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy.
