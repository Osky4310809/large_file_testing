Domino's other sister, Lola, posted a sweet photo on Instagram confirming her newlywed sister. \nThe couple met in 2014. \n\"When someone gets married in a courthouse, it's really an open invitation to everyone but the beautiful bride to explore all that fashion has to offer,\" Lola Kirke said. \"Here, I try a look simply called 'Pants,' as Cassius goes for 'That Dude from #incubus' and Jemima experiments with 'Off to Therapy!' Congratulations @dominokirke. We love you.\" A post shared by Lola Kirke (@lolakirke) on Feb 27, 2017 at 8:37am PST A friend of the couple also shared a sweet photo of the newlyweds at their ceremony.
