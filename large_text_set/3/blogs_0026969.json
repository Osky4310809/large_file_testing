She actively took part in photoshoots, walked down fashion ramps, never shied away from the paparazzi, and most importantly, she never tried to hide or veil her pregnant body or bump. What she has done is nothing short of a narrative game-changer in an industry ‑ Bollywood ‑ where women are usually written off post-marriage and post-motherhood. For long, we have seen women in workplaces being relegated to the side-lines during their pregnancies. But, whether a woman chooses to work through her pregnancy, or decides to take time off during it, it is her prerogative only, and these Bollywood celebrities proved just that. But, she isn't the first actress who worked during her pregnancy; there have a been a few actresses who paved the way. Here are the ones who came before Kareena. Kajol While shooting for the 2010 film We Are Family, Kajol was pregnant with her second child, son Yug. He was born on September 13, 2010, 10 days after the film released. Nandita Das Nandita was in her second trimester during the shoot of Onir's I Am. She was playing the role of a single woman who wants to become a mother through the help of a sperm donor in the film . Juhi Chawla Juhi continued working during both her pregnancies. When she was pregnant with her first child, Jhanvi in 2001, she was working on two films, Ek Rishtaa and Aamdani Atthani Kharchaa Rupaiyaa . In 2003, when she was pregnant with her son Arjun, Juhi was working on Jhankar Beats . Jaya Bachchan While Sholay was being shot in 1973, Jaya Bachchan was pregnant with Shweta Bachchan Nanda. Shweta was born in March, 1974, and by the time Sholay released in August, 1975, Jaya was pregnant with Abhishek. Farah Khan Choreographer-turned-director, Farah Khan was pregnant with her triplets when she was working on her second directorial venture Om Shanti Om . She gave birth to her triplets in 2008. Konkona Sen Sharma Konkona was working on two films that released in 2010 - Right Yaa Wrong and Mirch . She had just wrapped up shooting for these when the news of her pregnancy broke. She gave birth to her son in March, 2011. Interestingly enough, she also became the first-ever Bollywood actress to be featured on a magazine cover with a visible baby bump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:39:51.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
