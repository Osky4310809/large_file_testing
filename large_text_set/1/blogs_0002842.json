Her daughter Joyce had died about a year earlier, in 1945, at the age of 17. Mrs. Andrews saw nothing unusual when she took this photo of Joyce's gravemarker. \nWhen the film was developed, Mrs. Andrews was astonished to see the image of a small child sitting happily at her daughter's grave . The ghost child seem to be aware of Mrs. Andrews since he or she is looking directly into the camera. \nIs is possibly a double exposure? Mrs. Andrews said there were no such children nearby when she took the photograph and, moreover, did not recognize the child at all â€“ it was no one she would have taken a picture of. She remarked that she did not believe it was the ghost of her daughter as a child. \nInvestigating this case, Australian paranormal researcher Tony Healy visited the cemetery in the late 1990s. Near Joyce's grave he found the graves of two infant girls.
