She was lying in the bed moments before she was chased out of the room at knifepoint by one of Manson's followers, and stabbed 28 times.\nCrime scene pics of the bed are featured in the book, 'Helter Skelter' -- and Ole Hound Auction House expects it to fetch at least $10k. An Ole Hound spokesperson says there's still blood spatter on the footboard, which can be seen under black light.\nAnd there's this morbid thought -- we're told the frame's price could jump up significantly  if Manson dies  before February 10 ... the day it hits the auction block.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T11:07:39.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
