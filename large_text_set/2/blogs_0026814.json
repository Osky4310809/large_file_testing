Canadian television and the NHL Network provide all-day coverage. It’s like Christmas Day for fans because everyone receives gifts. Contenders get veterans to help with playoff preparation and teams low in the standings reload with draft picks and prospects. \nBut deadline day, and the days leading up to it, can be emotional for players. \nArizona Coyotes captain Shane Doan, close with teammate Martin Hanzal, expressed frustration with his team’s situation after Hanzal and Ryan White were traded to the Minnesota Wild on Sunday. \n“It’s really hard.” Doan told Fox Sports. “Obviously (Hanzal) was a huge part of our team and someone you get to play with for 10 years, you appreciate and you understand how valuable and how you can’t really replace him. ... It’s hard to understand, exactly. You understand people’s hands are tied. (But) you just don’t get it.” Martin Hanzal trade shows Wild are thinking Stanley Cup \nWe’ve seen as many as 31 trades involving 55 players (2010) on deadline day. Last season, there were 19 trades involving 37 players. With key rental forwards Patrick Eaves and Hanzal, plus goalie Ben Bishop moving over the weekend, the expectation is about 15 deals Wednesday. \nWith playoff races tight, there’s a shortage of sellers. The Detroit Red Wings, Coyotes, Tampa Bay Lightning, Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars are the primary sellers, although the Buffalo Sabres might also move a player or two. \nThe top prize is St. Louis Blues puck-moving defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk. The Blues are a playoff team, but they don’t relish losing him to free agency this summer without getting something in return. He could fetch a first-round pick and a prospect. \nThe most intriguing rental forward remaining might be Detroit’s Thomas Vanek, who is represented by Bartlett. \n“You try not to think about it, but everybody does,” Vanek said. “It’s hard not to.” \nThe last-place Red Wings have qualified for the playoffs for 25 consecutive seasons, meaning they are usually buyers. It’s a new situation for Detroit players to be wondering if they will be traded. The Red Wings could move Vanek, defenseman Brendan Smith and perhaps forward Steve Ott. Center Riley Sheahan is also a possibility. \n“The NHL is a lot of fun, but it’s a business, too,” said Smith, who could still be re-signed. \nSmith has been attached to Detroit since being drafted by the Red Wings in 2007. “I only know Red Wings hockey and I like it,” Smith said. “I’ve loved every moment here, good and bad.” \nBartlett said he has seen the emotional extremes when it comes to deadline deals. \n“Some guys are excited about the opportunity and other guys are crushed,” Bartlett said. “But the beauty of hockey is that when you go to a new team and enter a dressing room, you end up with new friends pretty quickly. It's the culture of the sport -- the reception a traded player receives from his new team is always exceptional.\" \nNew York Islanders interim coach Doug Weight, traded four times in his career, says players use gallows humor to relieve the tension. When a player is linked to trade rumors, his teammates will remind him to pack extra suits if the team will be on the road for deadline day. \n“It’s not a great time of year for players,” Weight said. “But right now we have other things to focus on.” \nIn 2006, Weight was dealt by the St. Louis Blues to the Carolina Hurricanes a few weeks before the trade deadline. \n“He was stunned at the time,” said Bartlett, who represented Weight. “But he ended up getting a Stanley Cup out of it. That one had a happy ending. But there are other situations where it hasn’t worked out.” \nFormer NHL player and agent Tom Laidlaw said ego issues add to the family and logistical concerns for a traded player. \nIt happened to him years ago when the New York Rangers traded Bobby Carpenter and him to the Los Angeles Kings for Marcel Dionne. \n“You don’t want to feel like the team just wanted to get rid of you,” Laidlaw said. “To me, it was important who they got in return. Today, I would say I was traded for Hall of Famer Marcel Dionne.” \nBut that’s not how he felt when he first heard about the deal. Dionne was 36 and nearing the end of his career. “I remember thinking, I just got traded for a 90-year-old guy,\" Laidlaw recalled, laughing.
