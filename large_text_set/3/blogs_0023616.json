To show their support, celebrities are making the “w” symbol with their hands to raise awareness about the global water crisis and once you know more about it, you may just want to join them.\nAccording to the World Water Day website:\n“1.8 billion people use a source of drinking water contaminated with faeces, putting them at risk of contracting cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio.” Because of these devastating statistics, the organization drop4drop created the campaign #W4Water , which encourages people to take and share a photo of themselves holding their hands in a “w” ( not like the “Whatever” symbol that was so popular in the ’90s) to show that they support clean water for all.\nW is for...Whatever it takes! These children in Africa are getting involved with our campaign too! #W4Water \nA post shared by drop4drop (@drop4drop) on Mar 22, 2017 at 4:18am PDT \nAnd celebrities jumped on the cause by sharing their own “w” photos. Tomorrow is #WorldWaterDay Help us to raise awareness for the 663 million people living without #clean #water. We need YOUR help, take your pic and make sure you tag @drop4drop, and hashtag #W4Water everywhere! @caradelevingne @ritaora @jamesbaymusic @bigsean @j_corden @imgizzle @cassie @yarashahidi @teddysphotos @adwoaaboah @davidguetta @nicolescherzy @niallhoran @ladygaga #jenniferlawrence #jayz \nA post shared by drop4drop (@drop4drop) on Mar 21, 2017 at 8:03am PDT \nThe outpouring of support is incredible as shown by the caliber of celebs who have participated so far .
