Schwarzman, chief executive of the investment firm Blackstone Group. “It’s easy for the private sector to at least see where the friction is, and to do that very quickly and succinctly.” \n“I’m hopeful that Jared will be collaborative with our industry in moving this forward. When I talk to him, he does remind me of a lot of the young, scrappy entrepreneurs that I invest in in their 30s,” said Silicon Valley billionaire Marc Benioff, who was a Hillary Clinton supporter. \nAndrew Liveris, chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical, contrasted the Trump approach to past White House panels that involved the private sector. \n“Rather than entering a vacuum, I’m getting emails from the president’s team, if not every day, then every other day — ‘Here’s what we’re working on.’‘We need another meeting.’‘Can you get us more input on this?'” he said. \nGinni Rometty, the chairman and chief executive of IBM, said the effort is moving forward. \n“Jared is reaching out and listening to leaders from across the business community — not just on day-to-day issues, but on long-term challenges like how to train a modern workforce and how to apply the latest innovations to government operations,” she said.
