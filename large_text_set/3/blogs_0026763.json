Within this context, Jacob’s teachings are analyzed to “examine the city of today through the lens of one its greatest champions.”\n\nThe 90-minute-long film will open theatrically and on-demand on April 21st. Check out the trailer above, and a review of the documentary here .\n\nNews via Altimeter Films, IFC . \nCities Need Change: The Durability of Jane Jacob's Legacy \nCities Need Change: The Durability of Jane Jacob's Legacy In an exclusive half-hour episode focusing on the life and legacy of Jane Jacobs, \"one of the most influential urban thinkers and city activists of our time.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:21:04.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
