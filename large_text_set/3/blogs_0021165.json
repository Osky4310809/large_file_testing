Perhaps the most memorable thing about his run as the Mexican head coach was being able to watch replays of him losing his mind in the technical area. \nWell, now Piojo is coaching at Xolos in Liga MX and, to celebrate his 49th birthday last week, the Tijuana players decided to bring the celebration to him. That, of course, meant shoving a cake in his face when he didnâ€™t expect it: Â¿QuiÃ©n fue? Â¿QuiÃ©n sabe? ðŸ˜‚ðŸŽ‚ðŸ‘‹ Â¡Felicidades, @MiguelHerreraDT y JosÃ© Torruco! #10AÃ±osDeLealtad . pic.twitter.com/VorGVyNccY \nâ€” Xolos (@Xolos) March 21, 2017 \nDonâ€™t let whoever was holding the camera record your next prank, Xolos. They managed to miss the exact moment that said cake met Piojoâ€™s face. \nBut donâ€™t worry, the footage captured the best moment of all: Herrera, face covered in frosting, looks stunned for a moment, but then he points at the perpetrator and gives a respectful nod. Game recognize game. \nPiojo should savor the celebration since heâ€™s in a little bit of hot water these days. He was spotted getting into a scuffle with a fan and the Mexican federation is currently deciding whether or not he will face punishment . Herrera should learn from the Xolosâ€™ prank and if heâ€™s going to go at anyone, it should only be with a cake in hand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:27:55.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
