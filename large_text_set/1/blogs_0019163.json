How about getting rid of entire departments dramatic:\nThe departments of Commerce and Energy would see major reductions in funding, with programs under their jurisdiction either being eliminated or transferred to other agencies. The departments of Transportation, Justice and State would see significant cuts and program eliminations.\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be privatized, while the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities would be eliminated entirely.\nOverall, the blueprint being used by Trump’s team would reduce federal spending by $10.5 trillion over 10 years.\nThe proposed cuts hew closely to a blueprint published last year by the conservative Heritage Foundation, a think tank that has helped staff the Trump transition.\nTrump promised to drain the swamp, and he apparently means to follow through. What's more, he has the full support of Republicans who have supported similar proposals in the past:\nMany of the specific cuts were included in the 2017 budget adopted by the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC), a caucus that represents a majority of House Republicans. The RSC budget plan would reduce federal spending by $8.6 trillion over the next decade.\nTwo members of Trump’s transition team are discussing the cuts at the White House budget office: Russ Vought, a former aide to Vice President-elect Mike Pence and the former executive director of the RSC, and John Gray, who previously worked for Pence, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) when Ryan headed the House Budget Committee.\nVought and Gray, who both worked for the Heritage Foundation, are laying the groundwork for the so-called skinny budget — a 175- to 200-page document that will spell out the main priorities of the incoming Trump administration, along with summary tables. That document is expected to come out within 45 days of Trump taking office.\nSome conservatives, after decades of being disappointed by Republicans, can't believe this is actually happening.\n\"As with everything else in the world of Washington, I’ll hold off on popping the champagne cork until I actually see it done,\" writes Jazz Shaw at Hot Air :\n... but this is the level of cutting which might eventually return us to a point beyond a balanced budget and (dare we say it … ) reducing the national debt. And if it does somehow come true, I’ll have to ask the same question I’ve been posing time and time again over the past couple of months, particularly with companies bringing jobs and investments back to American soil.\nWas it really this easy all this time but nobody bothered to try?\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/19/report-trump-actually-draining-the-swamp-preparing-huge-cuts/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts", "http://hotair.com/archives/2017/01/19/oh-baby-dramatic-cuts-are-coming-to-federal-government/"], "published": "2017-01-19T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:02:01.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
