My little Angel is gone.  — Jim Ross (@JRsBBQ) March 23, 2017 \nEarlier today, J.R. posted a full update of the situation on his blog. \n\"Monday night at approximately 9:30 pm while I was recording the Ross Report about 30 miles from our home, my wife Jan was riding her Vespa home from the gym when when was struck from behind by an automobile driven by a 17 year old young man. Jan suffered a catastrophic brain injury including multiple skull fractures. My little Angel was unfortunately not wearing a helmet which arguably would have prevented the extreme nature of her injuries. \nI will fully admit that there has been no experience in my life that could have prepared me for this life changing week. To see one's life partner and love of one's life being kept alive via life support equipment is tragically heartbreaking.\" \nOur thoughts and condolences go out to J.R. and his family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:35:30.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
