The critics have also given mixed reactions towards the movie, making it a really bad start for it. However, the fact that everyone has been raving about Anushka, Diljit and Suraj’s performance will give the makers something to be happy about. But the fact that no one has spoken so highly of the movie is worrisome. After NH10 got critical appreciation and was successful at the box office, everyone had high hopes from Anushka’s second production venture. However, it could only manage mixed reviews. Check out what the critics had to say right here… \nIn their 3 star review, Times of India mentioned, “Conceptually, Phillauri is a winner and that much was evident from the trailer. The idea is superbly original, culturally on point and has great potential. The problem is, you only get what you see in the trailer. Nothing more (and thankfully nothing less). The hilarious, exciting one-line plot develops into a two-and-a-half hour film that is full of romantic-movie tropes. The invisibility of the ghost can only get so many laughs; the narrative shifts between Shashi’s past and Kanan’s present seem abrupt; the soulful songs are easy on the ears but strain your eyes by adding to the runtime, and most importantly, Shashi’s story (the emotional core of the film) is largely formulaic.” \nIndian Express, on the other hand, mentioned how the film lacked energy and was very slow at some points. In their 2 star review, they said, “The pacing is not just languid, it is positively slow, and it allows scenes to go on for much longer than they should. I found myself getting impatient in too many places. And though Suraj Sharma and Mehreen Peerzada are likeable and easy on the eye, they are flat. Anushka Sharma is good, but not as good as she can be, and that too only in bits and pieces. A lovely song, which features her and Dosanjh, made me sigh. With pleasure. As a romantic interlude between two adults, it is the beating heart of ‘ Phillauri ’. If only the whole film pulsed with the same skill and energy.” ALSO R EAD – Phillauri public review: Audience praise Anushka Sharma, Diljit Dosanjh and Suraj Sharma’s fantastic performance but call the movie boring -watch video \nRaja Sen mentioned in his review for NDTV that Phillauri hasn’t been able to take advantage of Anushka’s talent. He revealed, “I can simply declare that Phillauri is too spoofy to feel like a drama and too mournful to be funny. This is a shame, because Anushka Sharma, who has also produced this film, is one of our most intriguing actresses. She’s fine in her part, and often beguilingly pretty, yet the film wastes her. The fundamental problem with Phillauri , I believe, may be one of miscasting. Raza Murad, the man with the greatest voice of all, is around but doesn’t get to speak much. Sharma, similarly, is perfectly suitable as a ghost when gliding around or trying to blow out a chandelier bulb, but, despite sparkly translucence, she has no aura. It is in flashback that she sparks brightest, when she listens to a record for the first time, or when she allows herself to grin at the idea of shamelessness.” \nFirstpost in their 2 and a half star review, also mentioned, “The USP of Phillauri is its music and the way it is used to recount a large part of Shashi and Roop’s love saga. Music director Shashwat Sachdev and lyricist Anvita Dutt deserve kudos in particular for the beautiful song Sahiba – a reference to the legend of Mirza and Sahibaan which serves as a red herring of sorts here – in Romy and Pawni Pandey’s lovely voices. Lal deserves a big salaam for how this number has been woven into the narrative to such soul-stirring effect.” ALSO READ – Anushka Sharma and Diljit Dosanjh’s Phillauri off to a disappointing start, registers only 15 per cent occupancy \nHindustan Times also emphasised on the slow pace of the movie. In their two and a half star review, they confessed, “ Phillauri does not give away any interesting bit almost till the interval. It is only in the second half when the film focusses on Diljit-Anushka’s story that it becomes engaging enough. And the credit for this must be given where it is due – the enchanting presence of the two actors and the lovely chemistry between them. The incidents of Kanan’s marriage and the flip-flop between the two love stories make the film rather disjointed. The story develops quite slowly. The current day story is overloaded with stereotypes about Punjabis – from over-the-top welcome to alcohol flowing freely all day and the loud Punjabi ways only mar the otherwise subtle tone of the narrative.” ALSO READ – Phillauri movie review: Anushka Sharma’s ghost act ends up being a tiresome experience \nHave you watched Phillauri ?
