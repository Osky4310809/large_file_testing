And neither will the millions of Americans who stand with me. We will fight like hell to stop you. With words, with actions, with dollars. With everything we have. We will not back down. Not ever.” \nVice President-elect Mike Pence will meet with Republican lawmakers this week to discuss implementing major planks of President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda, which includes repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood. \nPro-life groups have called for Planned Parenthood’s funding to be redirected to women’s health centers that do not perform abortions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T20:20:18.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
