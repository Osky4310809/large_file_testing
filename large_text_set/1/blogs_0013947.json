Bancroft Street, on the corner of McKean Street in South Philadelphia. \nIts principals are John Longacre, the developer and founder of South Philadelphia Tap Room and American Sardine Bar, and Curt Decker, who owned Nodding Head Brewing, late on Sansom Street in Center City. \nThe name comes from the location, in Philly's Second Council District. It's also about four blocks from the new Brewery ARS , which has a tasting room. \nBrewer Ben Potts' background includes Dock Street, Dog­fish Head, and most recently Tired Hands. He'll offer eight on tap from the start — details to be announced. Decker says the menu will be \"fun, smart, tight beer food.\" \nThey're targeting February for the opening.
