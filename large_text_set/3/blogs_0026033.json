TrumpScratch.com is now a pornography site.\nAn alleged cease and desist letter later threatened legal action, leading Lucy to switch the site's domain name to KittenFeed.com. Lucy claims Trump's lawyers continue to go after her.\n\"I was going to just let this go, but I think it’s, pardon my French, fucking outrageous that the president of the United States has his team scouring the internet for sites like mine,\" Lucy wrote in an email to the Observer. \"HOW ABOUT BEING THE PRESIDENT?\"\nAfter the story was published, Trump Organization's executive vice president and chief legal officer Alan Garten denied any of it was true.\n\"This is completely false,\" he told the Observer . \"No such letter was ever sent by us.\"\nGarten claimed the Observer never reached out to Trump Organization for comment, while the publication insists they did.\nEven before the official denial, Twitter sleuths noted that Lucy's story didn't seem to add up . The most telling clue is that TrumpScratch.com was only registered as a domain for the first time the day after the piece went live.\n\nKittenfeed.com, supposedly the \"new\" domain, has been registered for weeks. But Twitter user Asher Langton noticed that the first two people to tweet the link out both work for the same California-based digital marketing firm: Hawke Media.\nSite allegedly created by teen who then received Trump C&D was first mentioned here. cc: @SageLazzaro @Tom_Maguire pic.twitter.com/wtt2ziiqJp \n— Asher Langton (@AsherLangton) March 22, 2017 \nWhen the article's author was asked to share a copy of the cease and desist letter on Twitter, she declined.\n@loweringthebar Hi, I can't because of an agreement with my source.\n— Sage Lazzaro (@SageLazzaro) March 21, 2017 \nThe post The New York Observer Published a Seemingly Fake Anti-Trump Story appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:01:17.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
