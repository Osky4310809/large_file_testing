TB regularly mutates, resisting antibiotics developed to cure it. Credit Photo by Jon Lascher / Partners In Health For decades there were few developments in the fight against tuberculosis — at least by humans. The bacteria that causes this airborne disease, in contrast, regularly boasts a number of deadly new upgrades, including mutations conferring resistance to almost all antibiotics developed to cure it. It has also made common cause with new allies (AIDS, weak health systems and budget cuts further sapping them) while maintaining its longstanding alliances with war, hunger, overcrowded and poorly ventilated housing, prisons, and workplaces. One of TB’s lamentable champions is a common strain of public-health expertise, which has long lowballed what it takes to cure tuberculosis and halt transmission of increasingly resistant strains of it. A host of ill-conceived and unambitious policies have all but ignored TB’s innovations. That’s why humans aren’t winning the war against TB, which last year killed 1.8 million people, regaining its old title as the world’s leading infectious killer of adults. Happy World TB Day. It gets worse, at least for the humans. Tuberculosis lost its world-killer title to AIDS at the new millennium. But the humans fought back hard against that virus and against attendant stigma, which was even worse than that reserved for TB. Ambitious programs like George W. Bush’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and a new agency called The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria sunk billions into AIDS treatment in Africa and the Caribbean. Leaders of such programs turned to experts for advice on the right therapies for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Long socialized for scarcity and lacking new tools to fight back, these experts squabbled about whether or not to even bother to treat it. The arguments marshaled to explain why we shouldn’t bother treating tuberculosis were numerous: therapy was costly, toxic, involved painful daily injections, and people would never submit to it for two years. The first three of these observations were true. But it’s not like there was an effective alternative to such treatment, which is why the fourth one was not. In any case, it was the amateur math in fashion in the mid-90s that doomed many afflicted humans to an early death, even as they spread the disease to their families: multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment was not, in the gravest of insults in the public-health lexicon, “cost-effective in resource-poor settings.” These patients were, in other words, too poor to treat. Since these squabbles — even when registered in glittering conference centers in Paris, Geneva, or Cape Town — were about the fates of the destitute sick, most humans, even those with medical training, never heard them. We’d like to think that if they had, the broader community of humans would think such arguments foolish in the face of an airborne, deadly and treatable disease. If the army of drug-resistant bacilli could speak, its commanders would surely reassure foot soldiers and friends that the humans will continue to invest too little in fighting back as long as TB disproportionately affects the poor and marginalized. Its intelligence agency might even predict a microbial victory if U.S. contributions to the fight against tuberculosis, AIDS, and malaria are cut.

Rollins/Partners in Health Finally, however, we may be able to chalk one up for our species. After a 50-year drought, there are at last a couple of new drugs effective against tuberculosis — including highly resistant strains. Only rigorous clinical trials will permit us to conclude that we humans have a better shot of winning the war against tuberculosis in all its varied forms. Such a trial was just announced by Médecins Sans Frontières and Partners In Health. These two NGOs have gathered all the tools and built the relationships to make revolutionary change possible in the way this disease is treated. Our “endTB” trial deploys new drugs and new tactics that were previously reserved for the all-out war on cancer. New financing mechanisms, such as UNITAID, are essential to ensure access to new tools for populations that need them. Although the humans have gained territory with new diagnostics that speed up the glacial pace of identifying mutant strains so that patients might benefit from the new drugs, these rapid tests are based on decades-old discoveries. As with the new drugs, their commercial development was delayed since the potential beneficiaries were too poor to treat. UNITAID supports this new trial as well as the necessary steps to bring its fruits to those previously disregarded. Ultimately, we need staff to deliver on the promise of these developments before we can declare a victory for the humans. The last front in the Partners In Health and Médecins Sans Frontières project is a joint operation with another NGO, Interactive Research and Development , ensuring that we remain on the frontlines against the wily bacterium. By finally countering TB’s cunning battle plan with a bold, multipronged approach that embeds science and care delivery and keeps the poorest people in mind, some year soon, World TB Day may be a day for celebration.
