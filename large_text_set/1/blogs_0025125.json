Lily Cole warns young Londoners: You are the future of the internet \nLeading a discussion on power in London, he continued: “History tells us that young londoners with big ideas can achieve extraordinary things.” \nThe Mayor called upon John Boyega, Adele and Good Chance Theatre creators Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson as stellar examples of young Londoners who have achieved great things. \n“I’ll never be as cool as them,” he joked, “but as someone who is the child of an immigrant, brought up on a council estate, 5 ft 6 and the Mayor of London, anything is possible.” \nThe Mayor was joined by designers, entrepreneurs, tech innovators and politicians to discuss the challenges facing young people at the Evening Standard's Young Progress Makers event. \nDiscussions centred on the themes of power, possibility and performance. Humza Arshad: Don’t jump on a trend because it’s popular on YouTube \nAmong those speaking today were ex-Olympics minister Tessa Jowell, YouTube star Humza Arshad and Kate Unsworth, whose firm Vinaya combines high-fashion jewellery and hi-tech design. \nEvening Standard editor Sarah Sands said: “The Young Progress Makers day is a chance for our youth to solve the challenges of this city — they may well do a better job than the rest of us. We reckon we can identify a sensibility for the capital — entrepreneurial, optimistic, creative, socially responsible. \n“The YPM Day should be inspiring, fun and I hope will produce brilliant ideas that could become realistic policies. We intend to create a network from which jobs and friendships should flow. Last time we held a much smaller-scale forum such as this, a speaker came up with the idea of a Night Tube, which was taken up by Transport for London. We can improve London, and the YPMs are the people to do it.” \nFollow us on Twitter: @eslifeandstyle and Instagram @standard.lifestyle More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:59:36.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
