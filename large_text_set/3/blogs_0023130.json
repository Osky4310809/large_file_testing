Instagram \n\"While on that bench, they were approached by an adult female and two punk males who asked them if they’d #help them out by going into the bathroom where her boyfriend was hiding from the doctor and see if they could convince him to come out and get treated.'\" \nThe mum explained how her 10-year-old, CJ, replied 'no, thank you' but they kept asking him, saying: 'Please? You could really save his life if you'd just go in that bathroom and tell him it's safe to come out.' \nLuckily, CJ continued to forcefully tell them no and they finally gave up. Instagram \nBefore the neighbour arrived to pick up the boys, they saw a third man emerge from the hospital bathroom, jump into a car with the other strangers and drive away. \nJodie said her mouth \"hung open\" the whole time her sons were telling her the story - but her anger turned to gratitude when they explained why they hadn't gone off with the strangers. \n\"I heard CJ spout off a family 'stay safe' rule we went over way too long ago that helped him know these creeps were up to no good. Most specifically, a tip for identifying a 'tricky person'.\" \nCJ had said: \"Mom, I knew they were tricky people because they were asking us for help. Adults don’t ask kids for help.” What is the 'tricky people' concept? \nThe 'tricky person' or 'tricky people' concept was created by Safely Ever After . Founder Pattie Fitzgerald advises: \"Stop telling your kids not to talk to strangers. They might need to talk to a stranger one day. \n\"Instead, teach them which sorts of strangers are safe.\" \nOne of the things the program encourages parents to teach kids is that only 'tricky people' ask kids for help. If a safe adult needs help, they'll ask another adult - not a child. \nShe also advises: :\"Replace the word 'stranger' with 'tricky person'. It's not what someone looks like, it's what they say or want to do with a child that makes them unsafe or 'tricky'. \n\"A tricky person can be someone you know well, don't know at all or know just a little bit. Like your mail carrier or the ice cream man. Anyone who tries to get a child to break their safety rules or hurt their body is not OK.\" \nPattie has many other prevention tips and 'red flags' on the Safely Ever After website. \nJodie has notified police of the incident and they are reviewing CCTV footage outside the hospital.
