MARC JAYSON CAYABYAB/INQUIRER.net \nMembers of the parliament from Cambodia and Malaysia expressed alarm at the moves in the Philippines to restore the death penalty, calling their Asean neighbor their model in the fight to respect life. \nKasthuri Patto from Malaysia and Mu Sochua from Cambodia on Wednesday attended the “Legislators for Life” forum to express solidarity with Philippine opposition lawmakers in the fight against the reimposition of capital punishment. \nIn a press conference after the dialogue, the members of the parliament shared the experience of their countries, one of which has a violent history of state-sponsored killings and genocide. ADVERTISEMENT \nSochua, whose parents were killed during the genocide perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge, urged the Philippines to learn from the Cambodian experience and instead look for restorative ways to solve criminality. \n“I am here with the endorsement of the members of the parliament from Cambodia who like me [had] gone through years of atrocities, genocide, that killed our people, Cambodians killing Cambodians, what is called a state-sponsored killing, and genocide is part of it,” Sochua said. \nSochua said Cambodia has always looked up to the Philippines as “heroes or fighters for human rights,” and was inspired by the country’s experience during the 1986 people power movement that ousted the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. \n“We want to continue to put you on that very high position,” Sochua said. \nSochua said death penalty may have been abolished in Cambodia, but corruption is prevalent in its democratic institutions like the military, police and the courts. \nPatto meanwhile said that in the Malaysian parliament, Philippines and Cambodia are always mentioned as examples of countries in the Asean region that abolished the death penalty. \n“These are the two nations which we should be looking up to move forward to abolish death penalty,” Patto said. \nShe expressed hopes that the Philippines would not renege on its abolition of the death penalty, and would continue to be in that “moral high position” in the fight against capital punishment. \nPatto said in Malaysia, death penalty is being imposed on the commoners who are convicted for crimes such as drug trafficking and use, while there are no members of the royalty or relatives of ministers who are charged with these offenses. \n“I think this shakes the social fabric in our country. It’s rare that you see the son or daughter of a minister, or son or daughter of royalty, being charged with trafficking drugs… But you’ll see a contractor, common laborer, bus driver, being convicted for crimes like these,” Patto said. \nPatto said the reimposition of the death penalty in the Philippines would have an adverse effect on the moves in Malaysia to abolish capital punishment. \n“If, God forbid, the Philippines decides to (restore) death penalty, it would have an adverse effect on Malaysia which has a one foot here, one foot there… If we want to abolish death penalty, how are we going about it if we’re looking at examples like Cambodia and Philippines?” Patto said. \n“It would generally change the political situation. It would generally change the social fabric of the region,” she added. \nLawmakers in the Philippine Congress expressed hope that the country would learn from the experience of its Asean neighbors. \nAlbay Rep. Edcel Lagman said the Philippines will lose face in the Asean region if it takes back its abolition of the death penalty. \n“The Philippines will lose its preeminent leadership in the region if we backtrack and reimpose the death penalty,” Lagman said.

Tom Villarin said if the Philippines rescind the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), it would be the first country to renege on its treaty obligations against the reimposition of death penalty. \nThe ICCPR under the Second Optional Protocol states that “Each State Party shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within its jurisdiction.” READ: Solons torn between death penalty and international treaty \n“If, God forbid, the Philippines renege on that commitment… we’ll be the first country reneging on our international commitment on the right to life. That would be so abhorrent, it would lose face in the international community of nations,” Villarin said. \nSenator Risa Hontiveros said the opposition was able to muster a simple majority or 13 of 24 members against the death penalty. \nShe said death penalty is not an effective deterrent to crime, adding that government should instead look at the roots of criminality and reform the criminal justice system. \n“The real deterrent is not simple retribution, not simple vengeance. It is to get to the roots of criminality, especially the economic and social roots that breed crimes,” Hontiveros said. \nThe bill seeking to restore death penalty is under plenary debates in the House of Representatives, where lawmakers are more amenable to passing it because death as a punishment is no longer mandatory, giving leeway to the judge or justice to impose life imprisonment. \nThe reimposition however faces rough sailing in the Senate, where senators centered on the country’s treaty obligations against the death penalty. \nThe bill seeks to impose death penalty on more than 20 heinous offenses, such as rape with homicide, kidnapping for ransom, and arson with death. \nAccording to the original version of the bill , the following are punishable by death under the Revised Penal Code – treason, qualified piracy, qualified bribery, parricide, murder, infanticide, rape, kidnapping and serious illegal detention, robbery with homicide, rape, intentional mutilation or arson, and destructive arson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T11:46:02.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
