Today the Senate was alive with oratory as people spoke for and against the proposal. \nNow, there is a lot of room for debate on how we should regulate ISPs and who should do it, and a healthy opposition is essential for good governance, but this here is just plain a bad idea, and several Senators said so, in a great many more words than that. You can review the whole debate over at C-SPAN . \nSenator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who has been a strong supporter of net neutrality and the FCC‚Äôs most recent internet regulations, gave a long and passionate speech about the proposal (quotes were taken live and may not be word for word): \n‚ÄúHow much privacy are people in this country entitled to?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúAre we going to allow the broadband companies to determine that?‚Äù üö® ALERT: @SenateGOP will vote tomorrow night to allow ISPs to sell your personal info to the highest bidder. Protect #BroadbandPrivacy üö® \n‚Äî Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) March 22, 2017 Related Articles FCC votes to negate broadband privacy rules Trump's FCC Chairman pick Ajit Pai heralds a weaker, meeker Commission ACLU calls for tech firms to lobby for surveillance reform ‚ÄúYes, there are two sides to this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou want the entrepreneurial spirit to thrive, but you have to be able to say no, I don‚Äôt want you in my living room. Yes, we‚Äôre capitalists, but we‚Äôre capitalists with a conscience.‚Äù\nThis is the guy who led the creation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, by the way, so he knows what he‚Äôs talking about. \nFlorida Senator Bill Nelson said: ‚ÄúPassing this Senate resolution will take consumers out of the driver‚Äôs seat and place the collection and use of their information behind a veil of secrecy, depsite rhetoric surrounding our debate today suggesting that eliminating these common snse rules will better protect consumers‚Äô privacy online or will eliminate consumer confusion. \nHawaii‚Äôs Senator Brian Schatz said the repeal would be ‚Äúthe single biggest step backwards in online privacy in many years.‚Äù \nThe broadband privacy rule, among other things, expanded an existing rule by defining a few extra items as personal information, such as browsing history. This information joins medical records, credit card numbers and so on as information that your ISP is obligated to handle differently, asking if it can collect it and use it. \nYou can see the utility of the rule right away; browsing records are very personal indeed, and ISPs are in a unique position to collect pretty much all of it if you‚Äôre not actively obscuring it. That means every product you look up, every malady you search for, and every site you visit. Facebook and Google see a lot, sure, but ISPs see a lot too, and a very different set of data. \nShould they be able to aggregate it and sell it without your permission, perhaps to other aggregators, in order to better target ads or add to a profile of you and your demographic? The FCC thought not, and proposed the rule, part of which was rescinded by the new FCC leadership before it took effect. \nThis resolution would not only rescind it all the way, but because it is an official disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, it would prevent the FCC from enacting similar rules in the future. Even if Congress doesn‚Äôt like these rules, should the requisite agency be forbidden from creating any like them at all? \nFlake‚Äôs announcement of the resolution, by the way, is very misleading. \nThe FCC‚Äôs midnight regulation does nothing to protect consumer privacy. It is unnecessary, confusing and adds yet another innovation-stifling regulation to the internet. My resolution is the first step toward restoring the FTC‚Äôs light-touch, consumer-friendly approach. It will not change or lessen existing consumer privacy protections. It empowers consumers to make informed choices on if and how their data can be shared. \nFirst, this ‚Äúmidnight regulation‚Äù was discussed for years and there was a lengthy public comment and review period. \nWhether it‚Äôs necessary is arguable, but it isn‚Äôt confusing. It really is very simple, especially the data protection rules; anyway, it‚Äôs just an expansion of earlier rules companies were already subject to. \nIt wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúrestoring‚Äù the FTC‚Äôs approach, first of all because the FCC rules are in line with the FTC‚Äôs already, as one of the latter agency‚Äôs commissioners already stated. Second, the FTC‚Äôs authority over privacy rules is questionable since a very recent court decision that removed that authority in many states. \nThe Republican Senators speaking in support of the resolution, by the way, made a big show of the technical and statutory jurisdiction of the FCC being lacking, which is far from established and the subject of considerable controversy right now. Senator Thune, hilariously, suggested the FCC‚Äôs role was ‚Äúgradually diminishing‚Äù as people used the internet more than phones. The exact opposite is true, in fact, and the FCC‚Äôs role has become far more important over the last two decades. \nThat the resolution ‚Äúwill not change or lessen existing consumer privacy protections‚Äù is true ‚Äî because they‚Äôre repealing it before it takes effect. It‚Äôs like saying they‚Äôre not stealing something from you because you haven‚Äôt picked it up yet. \nIt does not empower consumers to make informed choices; it removes the ability to make informed choices. Broadband providers do have to provide some information on what they collect, but the choice consumers would have would be choices between providers. And as some have pointed out, with no regulations like this one, no provider will voluntarily provide anything more than the minimal possible level of privacy for this data. \n‚ÄúLet the marketplace sort it out, they say,‚Äù Markey said. ‚ÄúWhat marketplace? Most places there are only two companies to choose from. And they‚Äôre both going to say, privacy protection is voluntary! it‚Äôs take the broadband service or leave it, and if you take it, you have no privacy. Asking ISPs to write their own privacy rules is like asking a burglar to program your security system.‚Äù \nAmazingly, this dangerous proposal garnered 34 co-sponsors ‚Äî and support for it is definitely not bipartisan. Today was the first time the opposition in the Senate had a chance to speak their piece on the floor, and the vote on the joint resolution will take place tomorrow evening.
