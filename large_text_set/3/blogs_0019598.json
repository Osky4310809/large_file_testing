For the uninitiated, Sunil had requested Kapil to not use foul language in front of women during a flight to Mumbai. Kapil, who was reportedly under the influence of alcohol, ended up abusing Sunil and having a physical fight with him. Kapil then took to Facebook to deny the rumours while Sunil refused to comment when Times Of India called him up to clarify. \"I would not like to comment anything at all on it,\" was his response to questions about the fight and whether or not he will return to the show. \nKapil took to Twitter last night to apologise to Sunil. Paji @WhoSunilGrover sry if I hurt u unintentionally.u knw vry well how much I luv u. M also upset .love n regards always:) \nSunil responded to his Tweet with this note.
