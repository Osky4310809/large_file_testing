Smith . Earlier in the week, Assistant Secretary of State Gregory Starr and director of the Bureau of Overseas Building Operations Lydia Muniz also resigned. All served under both Democratic and Republican administrations. \n“It’s the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember, and that’s incredibly difficult to replicate,” former department chief of staff David Wade told WaPo . “Department expertise in security, management, administrative and consular positions in particular are very difficult to replicate and particularly difficult to find in the private sector.” \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T20:32:34.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
