James Comey is unpopular across the political spectrum , according to a new poll that finds voters have a negative opinion of Comey by a more than two-to-one margin . \nAs The Hill reports, according to data from a Harvard-Harris Poll survey of registered voters provided exclusively to The Hill, only 17 percent have a favorable view of Comey, compared to 35 percent who have a negative view of him. \nForty-one percent of Democrats have an unfavorable view of Comey , with only 12 percent saying they view him positively. \nComey is almost at break-even among Republicans, with 26 percent viewing him positively and 27 percent viewing him negatively. \nAmong independents, Comey has an overall negative rating, with 17 percent holding a positive view compared to 36 percent with a negative view of the FBI director. \nHarvard-Harris Poll co-director Mark Penn said, \"Comey’s ratings, which are two-to-one negative, suggest a crisis of confidence in his leadership as top law enforcement officer.\" \nThat could change for the worse , as the Harvard-Harris Poll survey was conducted prior Comey’s testimony on Monday before the House Intelligence Committee that frustrated many Republicans. Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) lamented that Comey had cast “a big, gray cloud” over the Trump administration. \nFinally we note that a plurality of voters - 40 percent - say Congress is spending too much time on Russia and Trump’s wiretapping claims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:39:43.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
