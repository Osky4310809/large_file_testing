I just get criticised for everything I do.\" (Photo: Rex Features) (Photo: Rex Features) \nShe added to The Sun : “For example what my baby is wearing. I get criticised for weaning and feeding too.” \nOnly back in December Sam was criticised by other mums for using her car seat \"incorrectly\" after sharing a video on Instagram. \nIn the seemingly innocent video, the cute tot is pulling funny faces. \n“Words can't describe my love for you my baby... You make me laugh all day long,\" Sam wrote. Sam and Billie Faiers \nBut it wasn't long before it sparked a backlash, with other mums accusing her of using the swivel seat - designed to safely move a baby in and out of the car - in an incorrect manner. \n“She can't be that well advised when several of us have seen her use the seat sideways when it isn't meant to be (and the headrest is too high)!” one wrote under the video. \nAnother said: “This isn't the first time she has been seen using the car seat, unfortunately incorrectly.\" \nWhile a third argued: “Seat's too big, the head support is around his temples! Should stay in the smaller seat until he's tall enough. He may hit the weight requirements but he's not tall enough.” Sam Faiers (Photo: Rex Features) Video Loading  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:01:16.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
