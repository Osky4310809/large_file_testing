If they're older, they're older. If they're younger, they're younger. It depends on whether or not I'm attracted to their spirit, their soul, their whatever... their energy.\" Jennifer previously dated dancer Casper Smart She was linked to Drake until earlier this year (Photo: Instagram/worldstar) \nWhile speaking about her brief romance with Drake, she added: \"We did a song together.
