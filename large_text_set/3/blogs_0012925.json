Or snake news. It's all about lizards. Lizards called Justin Bieber.\nLook, we know the internet is a place where theories about world leaders and celebrities being reptiles in disguise abound, but when said theories make it to mainstream news, it's time to worry.\nAccording to some ~very~ reputable sources we've never heard of , Australian news website Perth Now published a story during Bieber's recent visit that claimed hundreds of witnesses saw their idol turn into \"a giant reptile.\" Not this again .\nSEE ALSO: Justin Bieber is sick of overeager fans, and he ain't afraid to say so\nThe alleged story allegedly interviewed several witnessed, who served up some very exciting Quote: s like: \"There were girls hiding in toilets, crying. Guys were running for the exits, jumping in taxis to get out of there.\" Because I know the first thing I do when a pop star shapeshifts into a lizard in front of me is notice how each gender of witnesses respond.\nCelebrity conspiracy fans assemble, Australians think Bieber might be a giant lizard https://t.co/Usa9M54Whd pic.twitter.com/m6PW7pvQUr\n‚Äî Michael Richardson (@HRFMichael) March 16, 2017\nApparently, Bieber as a reptile has a \"black stripe down the middle\" and \"big scaly claws\" that \"lash out angrily.\"\nYour Newswire (who keep suggesting we're living in a \"golden age\" of reptilian citings ) claim the article was deleted without a trace, within an hour of publication. Suspicious? Maybe. Ridiculous?

You see, a \"local skater\" reportedly told them he saw Bieber transform into a lizard at Leederville skate park in Perth.\n\"He was hanging around with this big guy, his bodyguard I guess, and we were just staring because he kept turning into a huge reptile,\" said the unnamed and definitely real skater.\nwhy am I reading a theory about justin bieber being a reptilian instead of doing my work\n‚Äî Gunny üê∞üê• (@eyesonewww) March 16, 2017\nwhere do I apply to be an illuminati reptilian person like Beyonc√© and Justin Bieber? pic.twitter.com/upyKm5xKRl\n‚Äî Trenton Smith (@TrentonWSmith) March 16, 2017\n\"His bodyguard was pointing at us, shouting that he'd kick our teeth in if we didn't put our phones away.\" Cool story, bro. Interestingly, \"witnesses\" also allegedly say Bieber is a female reptilian. Get it right, media!\nAccording to Buzzfeed (who originally brought Your Newswire's important reportage to light), the head of digital content at Perth Now , Ben Martin, said \"I'm sad to say that we did not publish that piece.\"\nHe would say that though, wouldn't he? The truth is out there. Wake up, sheeple! etc. We've reach out to Perth Now for further comment.\n\"fans were distressed after witnessing justin bieber shapeshift into a lizard at perth airport\" pic.twitter.com/SYToEBPLwS\n‚Äî lexi (@gallexiii) March 16, 2017\nCue the robot-voiced YouTube videos!\nWATCH: This adorable emoji python will cure your fear of snakes", "external_links": ["https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/reptilian-justin-bieber?utm_term=.ova0nEwExw#.kagQm9q91q%20", "https://twitter.com/Cosmopolitan/status/842408506229723137", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/hnOAtSB0.jpg", "https://t.co/SYToEBPLwS", "https://t.co/Usa9M54Whd", "http://yournewswire.com/queen-elizabeth-shapeshifting-on-live-tv-goes-viral/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zEJWlF9-NV27T-8heCdO53c-jSo=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F417251%2F1c47d980-9d22-4974-9e01-eb19b192fa26.gif", "https://twitter.com/HRFMichael/status/842454760850522112", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gZ_TxoZ7TzPq3hCrcYsBG73YxT4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F417251%2F1c47d980-9d22-4974-9e01-eb19b192fa26.gif", "https://t.co/IgD4xbPced", "https://twitter.com/eyesonewww/status/842501835281907712", "https://t.co/upyKm5xKRl", "https://twitter.com/gallexiii/status/842295962626211840", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl12afrfLD8", "http://www.neonnettle.com/videos/615-justin-bieber-shapeshifts-into-reptile-at-airport-causing-mass-panic", "http://yournewswire.com/justin-bieber-shapeshifting/%20", "https://t.co/m6PW7pvQUr", "https://twitter.com/TrentonWSmith/status/842249732537888768", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/hnOAtSB0.m3u8", "https://t.co/YLatPuKKyV"], "published": "2017-03-17T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:24:29.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
