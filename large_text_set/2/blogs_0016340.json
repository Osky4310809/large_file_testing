Memos suggest all illegal immigrants at risk of Donald Trump crackdown \nSpeaking ahead of the motion on Monday, he said: “You have a lot of these people who are victims. They have been victims of terrorist acts. They have been kicked out of their country or went out because of their situation, sexual orientation, [and as] political refugees. \n“I think we should straighten up that situation and find a way to address the undocumented,” he said. \nAt the Quebec boarder, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has converted an unused basement into a refugee claimant processing centre, as authorities attempt to process the growing number of asylum seekers crossing into the country from the United States. The CBSA said the number of people making refugee claims at Quebec border crossing has more than doubled from 2015 to 2016. Last month, 452 people made claims in Quebec compared with 137 in January 2016, the agency said. \nMany “sanctuary cities” in the US protect undocumented immigrants by limiting how much local police and local authorities can work with federal immigration services to allow people to be reported and deported. Trump considers \"brand new\" travel ban \nThis kind of protection has not been explicitly offered by the city of Montreal, but Mr Coderre has promised the city’s public security committee will examine how migrants are dealt with by police and transit officials.
