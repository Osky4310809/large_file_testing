Uber has since scaled that ability back, but Jalopnik has learned the company still deploys a revamped version of it, along with other secret internal tools, to target its drivers who also work for competitors.\n\n\nReport: Uber Can Track Any Customer Using Its 'God View' Tool Report: Uber Can Track Any Customer Using Its &apos;God View&apos; Tool Report: Uber Can Track Any Customer Using Its… Uber changed its privacy policy yesterday, but even that may not cover its back this time.
