Something is going on with Lana Del Rey, and we think that witch craft might be involved. Could Lana Del Rey be hinting that she’s the new Supreme?\nThe last seven days have been a bit of a rollercoaster ride in the world of Lana Del Rey. Firstly, strange billboards appeared on the streets of L.A. teasing something. Then, after a pesky internet leak, the singer shared her new song “Love,” the first track taken from her yet-to-be-titled fifth album.\nAs if that wasn’t enough, Lana held an Instagram live video chat with her fans, after which she dropped the space-themed, eerily cosmic video for “Love,” and we, well, fell in love with it.\nYet there’s something else that Lana Del Rey has been teasing, and we’re not quite sure what to make of it. On Twitter, the chilled Queen of Coney Island sent out a cryptic message that has left fans puzzled.\n“At the stroke of midnight Feb 24, March 26, April 24, May 23 ❤️ Ingredients can b found online ,” Lana tweeted. At the stroke of midnight \nFeb 24, March 26, April 24, May 23\n❤️\nIngredients can b found online \npic.twitter.com/PsjNpIODZE \n— Lana Del Rey (@LanaDelRey) February 24, 2017 Many have been pondering as to what Lana is referring to, with some suggesting that the singer might be sharing dates for when she plans to release new music .\nHowever, as PopCrush have noted , the dates that Lana shared have another significance: They are also the dates of the waning crescent moon each month.\nWhile we know that Lana has an interest in astrology and space (it appears she was very excited NASA’s recent discovery), this still seems rather arbitrary.\nhttps://t.co/oxey64zG9e \n— Lana Del Rey (@LanaDelRey) February 23, 2017 So what does it all mean?\nWell, it’s been suggested that Lana shared the dates after witches (yes witches) around the world revealed they were going to cast “binding spells” on President Trump so that “he may fail utterly.” \nWhat’s more, these witches plan to cast these spells on, you guessed it, the dates of the the waning crescent moon.\nSo Lana's tweet is about a mass spell against Donald Trump caused by an alliance of witches... #what pic.twitter.com/qiDwV1tgAo \n— Lana Del Rey (@noirnostalgia) February 24, 2017 @LanaDelRey pic.twitter.com/n0xAWw1y3U \n— igneous roxx (@simpleroxx) February 24, 2017 Whether Lana also plans to release music on these dates (although today *is* the February 24th) remains to be seen.\nEssentially, though, Lana Del Rey is the new Supreme.
