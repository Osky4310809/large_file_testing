ADVERTISEMENT \nMorente said he issued the mission for Haddon’s arrest after being informed by the US embassy that the fugitive’s passport has been revoked by the State Department, thus making him an undocumented alien. \nHadden is wanted in the US following the arrest warrant issued last year by a US district court in Virgina. \nHe was reportedly facing a case for capital murder, killing for hire and solicitation of adult to commit felony. \nHaddon will be placed in the immigration blacklist after he is deported to prevent him from returning to the Philippines, Morente said. \n“US authorities have described him as a dangerous felon, thus his continued presence here poses a serious threat to public safety,” the BI chief added.
