Her eyes were closing and she appeared to be not breathing.\nThe boy unlocked his mother’s iPhone by pressing her finger on the home button, and then used Siri to call emergency services. Paramedics and police rushed to the location, and were able to provide life saving first aid to his mother. The incident was reported by the BBC .\nThe home was occupied by Roman, his twin brother, and a younger brother. The police pointed out that the incident highlighted the need to teach children how to use technology to contact emergency services, and how to call the police when a situation arises where urgent assistance is needed.\nSiri, the voice assistant in the Apple iPhone, was used by the boy to dial 999, which is the official emergency number across the United Kingdom.\nThis is not the first time that Siri has been used to save a life. In June 2016, a one year old toddler in Australia stopped breathing, and her mother was able to use call out to Siri to contact emergency services , while she continued to resuscitate her child.\nAn eighteen year old man from Washington in the United States also used Siri to contact emergency services. A truck he was repairing fell on top of him, fortuitously triggering Siri , and the man just yelled out “Call 911”.\nThe post Four year old boy in London uses Siri to save his mother’s life appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T14:51:23.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
