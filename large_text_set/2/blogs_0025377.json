Media caption The risk of avian flu has \"not gone away\", Wales' chief veterinary officer Christianne Glossop said \nChief Veterinary Officer for Wales, Dr Christianne Glossop, told BBC Wales the risk of avian flu had not gone away and there had been new cases since the restrictions were introduced. \n\"We are not in a position to completely lift the requirements, yet we are very mindful of the fact that we have been under these restrictions for 12 weeks now... We've learned a lot of things in that time,\" she said. \n\"We believe we understand the risks better.\" \nOne of the reasons for the change in regulations was because some poultry were not being kept indoors in \"ideal circumstances\", Dr Glossop said. \nShe said \"simply keeping birds indoors will not completely protect them\". \nShe added the Welsh Government was \"trying to give our free range producers a way of continuing to protect their birds whilst maintaining their free range status\". \nEngland, unlike Wales, does not have a country-wide protection zone and restrictions only apply in high risk areas. \nNFU Cymru and the Farmers' Union of Wales welcomed the measures.
