He told the Daily Telegraph : \"We wanted to move to a system where the Crown Prosecution Service is more involved as this would feel more independent. \n\"We have seen some evidence of cases where the RSPCA has taken animals from their owners and then later they can't be found. Now, we would welcome them setting up a truly independent committee to check what they are doing.\" \nThe Government said: \"[We] do not consider, at this time, that the RSPCA should be made a specialist reporting authority. Instead we believe that the RSPCA should be given the opportunity to implement the recommendations of the Wooler Review and demonstrate its commitment to responding to the concerns that have been raised by the Committee.\" \nThe Wooler Review, commissioned by the RSCPA in 2013, recommended a range of measures including the creation of an appeals process, as well as an independent audit committee to check lost cases and perform spot checks on successful ones. The Government has indicated it could create new laws to prosecute people who irresponsibly breed dogs to give them exaggerated features Credit: Larry Williams \nY esterday the RSPCA confirmed that these measures were finally in the process of being put in place. \nMr Parish also expressed frustration that the Government had ignored the Committee's recommendations to increase the maximum sentence for animal abuse to five years, saying he felt the crime was being put on a par with computer theft which was \"not good enough\". \nAt present the maximum sentence for animal abuse crimes is six months, however defendants who plead guilty in court are granted an automatic 30pc reduction, reducing prison time to four months. \nIn a surprise move the Government used the report to signal its intention to prosecute people who deliberately over-breed pedigree dogs and knowingly put them at risk of being born sick or deformed. \nUnder current rules people who breed dogs irresponsibly cannot be prosecuted, as the law only relates to crimes committed against puppies which have already been born. \nThe report said: \"We will explore the possibility of further protecting the progeny of dogs within the proposals to modernise the dog breeding regulations.\" \nJeremy Cooper, chief executive of the RSPCA, said: “We are extremely pleased that the Government continues to recognise the exceptional role carried out by the RSPCA in investigating and prosecuting those accused of the worst cases of animal cruelty and neglect. \n“We know that the public overwhelmingly wants us to undertake this role, and we welcome the support we have to carry out our prosecutions work from vets, local authorities and other animal welfare organisations.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:21:07.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
