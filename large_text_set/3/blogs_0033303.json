It’s on a 20-month mission to map the poles, atmosphere and interior of our solar system’s largest planet. Here are five things to know about the probe, and the incredible images it has just sent home to Earth.\n1. It took some of the first ever pictures of the planet’s poles \nJupiter is a gas giant, a thousand times the size of Earth, and its orbit means its equatorial regions are visible by telescope from Earth, but its poles cannot be seen from Earth’s perspective. You just have to go there, as the Pioneer 11 spacecraft did in 1974. But Juno has far better cameras. It launched from Florida in 2011 and arrived in its orbit last summer, an elliptical circuit that brings it close to the planet once ever 53 days. Its most recent flyby, its fifth, was on March 27 in the early morning, Canada time. It was travelling more than 200,000 km/h relative to the planet, or almost 60km/s, many times faster than the International Space Station orbits Earth. It was in an orbit just over 4000 km above the tops of Jupiter’s ammonia clouds.\nNASA A newly released photo of Jupiter from NASA’s Juno probe. 2. It has found some shockingly powerful storms \nSome of the most exciting images to scientists are of the atmospheric storms known as the string of pearls. These eight storms are each smaller than the famous Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been rotating for at least 150 years, but they seem to be more dynamic, and changing faster. Over the last 30 years, their number has varied from as few as six to as many as nine. “Every time we get near Jupiter’s cloud tops, we learn new insights that help us understand this amazing giant planet,” said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas.\nNASA A newly released photo of Jupiter from NASA’s Juno probe. 3. It is looking for more than just weather \nJuno — named for the mythical daughter of Saturn, consort of Jupiter, and mother of Mars — has eight scientific instruments to collect data about Jupiter’s gravity, atmosphere and electromagnetic fields and radiation, with a focus on the glowing auroras that are thought to be caused in part by charged particles being blasted out of volcanoes on Io, the closest of Jupiter’s four moons.\nNASA A newly released photo of Jupiter from NASA’s Juno probe. 4. Juno has already seriously malfunctioned \nThe spacecraft’s orbit was supposed to be brought much shorter and closer by a planned engine burn in October, but a problem with helium valves meant those plans were scrapped. It will stay in its longer orbit until next year, when it will be deliberately sent hurtling into Jupiter’s atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, and beyond that into its liquid interior, never to return.\nNASA A newly released photo of Jupiter from NASA’s Juno probe. \n\n5. The images are reconstructed on Earth \nMost images from satellites are not ready for publication. Their colour and contrast needs to be reconstructed, adjusted and enhanced. NASA has posted the raw images from its JunoCam on the internet, and invited the public to add their own colour enhancements, or crop them to highlight a particular feature of the atmosphere.\nNASA A newly released photo of Jupiter from NASA’s Juno probe. – With a file from The Associated Press \nRelated Potential water plumes on Jupiter’s moon Europa would ‘allow us to search for signs of life in the ocean’ ‘Like nothing we’ve ever seen before’: New view of Jupiter unveils solar system’s ‘biggest, baddest’ planet See the Juno mission’s first photo from Jupiter — three moons and the centuries-old Great Red Spot ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:15:02.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
