It employed millions and spent billions on buildings, structures, and projects that changed the face of the nation. Despite these buildings becoming aging octogenarians, many are still being used today. From grandiose airports in the northeast to public universities in the southwest, these are only 10 projects of a much larger program that impacted nearly every single American.

And when the airport opened in 1939, it did not disappoint. Situated on 432 acres of land with four concrete runways and six enormous aircraft hangers, it was perhaps the most advanced airport in the world. Part of the complex on Flushing Bay was the Marine Air Terminal, where massive seaplanes like the great Pan Am Clipper could allow transatlantic travelers to disembark. Many described LaGuardia as \"the airport of the New World.\" As Nick Taylor, author of the book American-Made: The Enduring Legacy of the WPA , tells Popular Mechanics , it helped \"bring on the age of commercial aviation in this country.\" \nToday, LaGuardia's reputation is not nearly as glowing. The aging historic airport is often used as an example of the urgent need to upgrade America's transportation infrastructure. Constantly rated as the worst airport in the country , even Vice-President Joe Biden lamented it in 2014 by comparing it to an airport found \"in a third-world country.\" Thankfully, new facilities and upgrades are on their way with a portion of it being opened to the public in 2018 . Getty Mario Tama New Orleans City Park \nLocation: New Orleans, Louisiana \nWhile New Orleans City Park was established in the mid-19th century, one of the most visited parks in country owes much of its popularity to the WPA. Starting in 1936, the New Deal agency financed an enormous $12 million project to improve the park, including sidewalks, bridges, and an art museum. It's believed that more than 20,000 local New Orleanians from the WPA's relief rolls worked on many of the park's projects. \nTo this day, among the slumping cypress trees, WPA-built sculptures and bridges dot the park, with many still brandishing the stylized WPA logo . Getty Brendan Smialowski Arroyo Seco Parkway \nLocation: Pasadena, California \nOriginally started as a WPA flood control project , the Arroyo Seco Parkway—also known as the Pasadena Freeway—is considered one of the most important roads in American history . Built by the WPA and PWA (in conjunction with local agencies) and mostly completed by 1940, it was the first freeway west of the Mississippi . At the dedication, California Governor Culbert Olson stated, \"It takes courage to do a thing the first time, no matter how simple and obvious it may appear after it is done. And this, fellow citizens, is the first Freeway in the West.\" \nDesigned in the parkway tradition, it features lush landscaping, windy curves and highlights the unique geographical features of Southern California, including views of the San Gabriel Mountains. It was also practical, becoming the initial stretch of road for the well-known (and, now, much maligned ) Los Angeles freeway system. Today, it's still in nearly the same configuration it was in 1940 and is a American Society of Civil Engineers Historic Landmark . Washington Park Zoo \nLocation: Michigan City, Indiana \nThis small zoo sitting on picturesque Lake Michigan is believed to be the only zoo in the country that was completely designed and landscaped by the WPA . With more than a dozen of the zoo's buildings on the National Register of Historic Places , including the Castle (pictured above) and Monkey Island (though, it's been refurbished in recent years ), it is one of the best examples of New Deal infrastructure in the midwest. Amy Borland / Indiana Division of Historic Preservation Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The Waterside Theater \nLocation: Manteo, North Carolina \nOn the edge of the Roanoke Sound, this naturalistic, stone and wood open-air amphitheater in the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site was completed in 1937 by the WPA in partnership with the CCC . Gray Brechin, geographer and founder of the online archive The Living New Deal , says many theaters like this one were built during the New Deal because it epitomized a core American value. \"They felt these open-air amphitheaters were symbolic of democracy like they were in Greece,\" explains Brechin, \"and it was where Americans could come together.\" \nWhat makes the Waterside Theater particularly unique is what continues to be performed there. The theater opened on Independence Day 1937 with a rousing debut of \"The Lost Colony,\" a \"symphonic drama\" written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Paul Green . Featuring actors from the WPA's Federal Theater Project , the production told the story of Roanoke's infamous lost colony . The show was so immensely popular, with even FDR in attendance for one performance , that it has been almost continuously performed for the past 80 years, making it the longest-running show of its kind in America. The 2017 season begins in May. NPS San Antonio River Walk \nLocation: San Antonio, Texas \nSan Antonio's River Walk is a perfect example of how the WPA built infrastructure that intersected utility, economic growth, and beautification. In 1921, a devastating flood killed dozens and destroyed a huge portion of the city. In following years, San Antonio struggled with the financing of proper flood control and making the area around the river livable. \"It was just a place where bums, addicts and drunks hung out down by the river,\" says Taylor. \nIn 1938 local businesses and city government worked together to secure funding from the WPA (though, perhaps, by less-than-ethical means ) and ground broke a year later on what would be a $430,000 project. By the time the WPA turned the River Walk back over to the city of San Antonino, they had constructed 17,000 feet of new sidewalks that covered 21 block and 8,500 feet of riverbank. The project also included 31 stairways, 21 bridges, and 3 dams, not to mention dozens of stone and wood benches. In effect the River Walk transformed the city of San Antonio. \"It's a gorgeous example of the kinds things you can do when you pay attention to infrastructure,\" says Taylor. Daniel J. Simanek Timberline Lodge \nLocation: Mt. Hood National Forest, Oregon \nAbout a hour's drive outside of Portland near the top of 11,000-foot Mount Hood sits what is arguably the WPA's masterpiece . The skier's haven Timberline Lodge is, as FDR put it when he dedicated it in 1937, \"a monument to the skill and faithful performance of workers on the rolls of the Works Progress Administration.\" \nMade nearly entirely from local materials like Stayton stone, Douglas Fir wood, and Port Orford cedar , it's the epitome of what the New Deal agency did so well—creating highly functional and beautiful buildings by employing the largest number of workers possible. \"It was a total effort of the WPA...the workers did everything from cutting timber to hammering nails... to weaving the bed spreads to the artwork on the wall,\" says Taylor. \nToday, the Lodge and the surrounding property welcomes over two million visitors a year looking for a warm respite from skiing Mount Hood—or those who are huge fans of the movie The Shining . Getty Bob Pool Tomato Bowl \nLocation: Jacksonville, Texas \nBuilt with local red iron ore rock that gives it the hue of a fresh tomato, the Tomato Bowl in the small town of Jacksonville, Texas, is one of the country's most recognizable high school football stadiums. Built with funds and area workers off the relief rolls of the WPA, it was completed in 1940 and just in time for the Jacksonville Fightin' Indians to play the Dallas Tech Wolves . \nToday, the Tomato Bowl hosts Jacksonville High's football team and both soccer teams, but it's in urgent need of upgrades. Earlier this month, a preliminary proposal was unveiled that would modernize the 76-year-old stadium. As the county school's superintendent said, \"Our dressing room facilities now are deplorable...that is unacceptable in Texas.\" Larry D. Moore University of New Mexico \nLocation: Albuquerque, New Mexico \nMany of this public university's 27,000 students still study in buildings built by the workers of the WPA, from Scholes Hall to anthropology buildings . However, it's the Zimmerman Library (pictured above) at the center of campus that stands out. \nUsing WPA funds and workers, the library was designed by famed architect John Gaw Meem, who was known for his romantic Spanish Pueblo style . The exterior of the building is made from tons of poured concrete, load-bearing brick, and clay tile . The interior is still dotted with tin light fixtures, elaborate wood carvings, and handmade furniture that gives visitors visions of stepping into a 18th-century Spanish mission. \nWhile the University of New Mexico is not the only public university that the WPA had a big hand in building (the University of Washington and Boise State University are others), it's definitely the most distinctive. PerryPlanet Statue of Liberty \nLocation: New York, New York \nOne of the lesser-known successes of the WPA was the restoration of culturally significant sites. \"We wouldn't have a lot of our historic landmarks it wasn't for the work the WPA,\" says Brechin. And perhaps the most famous was the Statute of Liberty . \nIn 1886, France's gift to the United States was finally revealed to the world. However, by 1938 and after more than five decades of being exposed to the elements, Lady Liberty was not looking too good. \"It was in really bad shape and the WPA came in and not only restored it...but they did all the landscaping and built the buildings on Liberty Island, says Brechin. \nAccording to Edward Berenson's 2012 book The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story , the WPA built new docks, walkways, and a visitor center to improve the public experience. They built a seawall and a copper apron to protect the statue from the violent storms that sometimes rocked the region. Most importantly, they restored and even replaced badly rusted sections of the statute's skeleton, some of which were threatening to collapse into the water below.
