Mike WiLL Made-It continues to kill it with another collaborative single, “Razzle Dazzle,” featuring Future, and Lecrae and Ty Dolla $ign return with visuals for “Blessings.” Music from Consequence, Papoose and Peedi Crakk, King Magnetic, Slug and Masta Ace, Wiki, Zoey Dollaz, CyHi The Prynce, and an interview with GoldLink round out the Top 10. Kick back and listen up. Drake & XXXtentacion –“look at me”&“KMT” (MASHup)” \nSome clever person known on SoundCloud as “brad.” decided to mashup XXXTENTACION’s “Look At Me” instrumental with Drake and Giggs’ vocals from “KMT,” which comes from the Toronto superstar’s new playlist, More Life . XXXTENTACION’s beat is right on time with Dreezy’s delivery and there have been accusations that Drake stole the flow from the Florida rapper, including XXXTENTACION himself. Although he initially brushed it off, he eventually took to Twitter and addressed the issue by writing, “I’m not gonna twitter rap with niggas for stealing my flow, I slap niggas don’t come to Florida. It’s funny how the industry let this pussy Nigga sit at the top for so long, all y’all suck kill yourselves, Meh dun chat.” Whatever the case may be, it doesn’t take away from the fact the mashup is pretty dope. Listen above. dave chappelle –“jimmy kimmel live (Interview)” \nNetflix finally delivered the two ( very ) long-awaited Dave Chappelle comedy specials the network promised and it appears the beloved comedian is truly “back” after his self-imposed 13-year hiatus. During an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live! , he talked about his reasons for doing the specials (“money”), hiding out in Ohio and lessons he’s learned along the way. MIKE WILL MADE-IT F. future –“razzle dazzle” \nPieces of the puzzle to Ransom 2 have been coming out non-stop since producer Mike WiLL Made-It re-announced the project. After sharing “Come Down” featuring Rae Sremmurd and Chief Keef, he’s now back with a high-profile collaboration with Future titled “Razzle Dazzle.” lecrae f. Ty dolla $ign –“blessings” \nLecrae has returned with a video for his Ty Dolla $ign-assisted single, “Blessings,” which features Mike WiLL Made-It on the beat. Throughout the four-minute song, the pair details what life used to be like and how many things they have to be grateful for today. HipHopDX was on set during the making of the video and got an inside look at what went into the creation of the feel-good visual. consequence f. Papoose & Peedi Crakk –“say my name” \nWhen Consequence isn’t working on material or performing with A Tribe Called Quest, he’s focused on his solo output. His latest is in the form of “Say My Name” featuring Papoose and Peedi Crakk, which thankfully has little to do with Destiny’s Child. king magnetic f. masta ace, slug & Dj Eclipse –“alone” \nArmy of the Pharaohs MC King Magnetic has resurfaced with another Khrysis-produced single, “Alone,” featuring Masta Ace, Slug of Atmosphere and DJ Eclipse on the 1s and 2s. The Pennsylvania rapper is preparing to launch his upcoming project, EH4AR (Everything Happens 4 A Reason) , on March 31 and has already shared “Cash 4 Catastrophe” and “I’ll Show You,” which features Wu-Tang’s Cappadonna. wiki –“icarus” \nRocking his stained sweatpant swag, New York City rapper Wiki has rolled out of bed apparently to shoot a new video for “Icarus.” Self-directed, the visual is filmed in Central Park, and involves plenty of 40 ounces and a curious cane. Wiki recently dropped the What Happened To Fire? EP with Your Old Droog . zoey dollaz f. Sam Sneak –“blame me” \nAfter tirelessly pumping out single after single, Zoey Dollaz is back with “Blame Me” featuring Sam Sneak, a track that leaked during SXSW. Produced by Smash David, the song borrows heavily from Shaggy’s 2000 hit “Wasn’t Me.” cyhi the prynce –“legend” \nCyHi The Prynce has been keeping busy with a recent appearance on Sway’s 5 Fingers Of Death freestyle segment and now another video for “Legend.” The track comes from his forthcoming album, No Dope On Sundays , and now gets the visual treatment from director R. Malcolm Jones. goldlink –“meditation (Interview)” \nGoldLink sat down with Genius to talk about the meaning behind his Kaytranada -produced song “Meditation” and explained that it stemmed from a visit to the DMV. In the lyrics, he talks about the “stupid bad” woman from the DMV and said to Genius, “She sounded like a hood jawn but she go to college. She was so tight.” GoldLink’s new album, At What Cost, is expected on Friday (March 24).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:04:13.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
