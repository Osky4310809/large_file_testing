In 42 games this year he has recorded 21 goals and 16 assists, putting him at the top of the rookie scoring race. \nHis move to the injured reserve puts his participation in the NHL All-Star Game in jeopardy after he was named to the team earlier this week. \nMelchiori has played in four games with the Jets this season and has been held without a point, posting a minus-three rating. %2Fhockey%2Fnhl%2Fjets-place-patrik-laine-ir-call-julian-melchiori%2F", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:16:39.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
