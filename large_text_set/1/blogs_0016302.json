Are RB Leipzig the real deal? \nFor the first time in five seasons, Bayern's holiday-break lead at the top of the table is only three points. What's even more surprising: The team responsible for Bayern's narrow lead is RB Leipzig, perhaps Europe's most surprising story of the season's first semester. \nThe unlikely contenders have had a meteoric climb to the top division since they were founded in 2009. In their current debut season in the first division, Ralph Hasenhuttl's men broke several records, even becoming the league's debutant with the most points through the first 13 games. The only newly promoted side to have ever lifted the title is Kaiserslautern in 1997-98. \nUp until the 13th match week, Leipzig were top of the table. However, two losses in the past three games (one of those against Bayern) handed the lead to Carlo Ancelotti's men. \n2. Will Bayern extend their title record? \nLast season, Bayern became the only team in Bundesliga history to win four league titles consecutively. Only Juventus (1931-35, 2012-16), Real Madrid (1961-65, 1986-90), Inter Milan (2006-10), Lyon (2002-08) and Torino (1943-49) have done what Bayern can accomplish at the end of this season (win five in a row). \nRobert Lewandowski ended the year on fire with six goals in his past five games in all competitions, with five of those goals in league games. With 12 Bundesliga goals, the Poland international is Bayern's top scorer this season, and he is four goals behind Borussia Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. \nIn recent years, securing the league with plenty of games still to play has not transformed into European success; Bayern have lost in the Champions League semifinals for three consecutive seasons. Will a closer title race force Bayern to alter their approach in continental priorities? \n3. It's not if, but when the drought will end \nAmid transfer speculation, Bayer Leverkusen's Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez has not scored an official goal since Oct. 1. It was a game against Borussia Dortmund in the 79th minute of Matchday 6. Since then, he has played 1,097 minutes spread out through 16 games with his club. \nWhat is most concerning about Chicharito's current low form is the numbers behind the drought. Since Oct. 2, among Bundesliga players with at least 11 shots (which is the number of shots he has taken during the drought in Bundesliga), Hernandez has the lowest goal above average rate (-3.08). Given the probability of shots he has taken, he should have scored at least three goals in that span. One of these is a penalty he missed against Freiburg. \nDespite this, certain tendencies imply that Chicharito could get back into form sooner rather than later. During this drought, Leverkusen's striker has taken relatively fewer shots than other forwards (Aubameyang took 29 more shots, Lewandowski 28) with a high on-target percentage (46 percent, compared to Lewandowski's 38 percent). With fewer chances, he has hit the target at a higher rate. Raf Honigstein says Borussia Dortmund are 'absolutely desperate' to renew Christian Pulisic's contract. \n4. What to expect from Borussia Dortmund \nInconsistency is the word that best describes Borussia Dortmund this season; they ended 2016 with four draws in a row. Thomas Tuchel will not have his prolific goal scorer Aubameyang in the beginning of the year due to the African Cup of Nations. The Gabon international leads the league with 16 goals and the highest on-target percentage among players with at least 25 shots. This season, he has scored 20 goals in 22 games. \nExpect 18-year-old American Christian Pulisic to continue getting more minutes under Tuchel. In 12 Bundesliga games this season, Pulisic is tied for second on the team with four assists, and he has scored two goals. \n5. Julian Nagelsmann's Hoffenheim \nHoffenheim narrowly avoided a relegation playoff last season, as they ended the season one point above the 16th place. Managed by 29-year-old Julian Nagelsmann, who is the youngest coach in the history of the league, the team has lost only one game this season (domestic cup), and they are the only unbeaten team remaining in the Bundesliga. \nSandro Wagner is the team's leading scorer this season, and he has scored five goals in his past six games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T11:58:20.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
