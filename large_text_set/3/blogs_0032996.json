Seriously, we’re expecting the Madeira airport to become a mecca-like destination for horror fans near and far. If you’re at all familiar with Cristiano Ronaldo’s actual face , though, based on the fact that we chose the word “horrifying” to describe a statue of his face should probably communicate just how inaccurate this statue is. We’ve seen truly awful wax figures before , but we’re especially confused and upset about this bronze sculpture.\nUnsurprisingly, the internet has a lot of feelings about this really vexing not-very-lookalike. \"You got a pic of Ronaldo for this bust?\"\n\n\"Nah...got 1 of Sloth from Goonies tho?\"\n\n\"That'll do...\" pic.twitter.com/dkBB966Llg \n— Dan O'Connell (@danocdj) March 29, 2017 Twitter was quick to point out all the things this sculpture looks like that definitely aren’t Cristiano Ronaldo.\nThe Cristiano Ronaldo bust at the airport carrying his name. This is Art Attack... pic.twitter.com/tTVmQBMgms \n— Simon Peach (@SimonPeach) March 29, 2017 Shockingly, this wasn’t the first time Ronaldo got some questionable statue treatment. We’re wondering if perhaps he’s so good-looking, his proper likeness simply can’t be captured. You can’t recreate perfection, after all.\nFor a very handsome man, Ronaldo has had some appalling luck with statue-makers pic.twitter.com/M74YEDng4c \n— Tom Williams (@tomwfootball) March 29, 2017 The internet was also super on its photoshop game, and we’re really loving the results.\nSome of the all-time great Cristiano Ronaldo moments pic.twitter.com/57Tx9VhbUm \n— Bleacher Report UK (@br_uk) March 29, 2017 We also weren’t the only ones to think this statue might be better suited to starring in a horror film than welcoming travelers to Madeira…\nNew horror movie trope: Ronaldo's bronze face. pic.twitter.com/MKrumgHdLv \n— The Football Ramble (@FootballRamble) March 29, 2017 The sculpture was unveiled for the renaming ceremony of the Madeira airport to the Cristiano Ronaldo Airport, which seems like a huge honor. We hope that Ronaldo was able to find the humor in the statue as easily as the denizens of the internet did, and wasn’t disappointed by it, but wow. Really easy to see why this statue was…a bust.
