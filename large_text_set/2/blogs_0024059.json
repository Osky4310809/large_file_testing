Prices nationally rose 7 percent during that time.\n“Some of the fastest home value growth is in places like Orlando and Tampa where prices are relatively affordable,” said Aaron Terrazas,senior economist for Zillow. Prices are edging back up to pre-Recession levels but still showing double-digit growth for now, he added.\nThe Orlando region was behind Nashville, Portland, Tampa and Dallas for price growth.\n“Florida and Texas home values have grown quite a bit over the past several years, stealing the spotlight from slower moving markets like San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles,” said Zillow Chief Economist Dr. Svenja Gudell.\nOrlando-area rents grew 3.3 percent — more than double the national rate — and hit a median of $1,391. The rent growth was the 13th highest out of the top 40 metro areas in the country.\nAnd the disappearance of house listings that has affected most of the country hit harder in Metro Orlando, which lost 11.5 percent of its inventory in January from a year prior.\nLooking at large and small metropolitan areas throughout Florida, Orlando lagged behind in terms of price growth in January from a year earlier, according to a new report by Florida Realtors. The member association reported median prices of $222,000 for single-family homes in Metro Orlando during January — an 8 percent increase. Prices in 20 metro areas across the state grew more than 10 percent during that time.\nThe previously quiet condo market gained some momentum during January.\n“Throughout much of this housing cycle, growth in single-family home sales has outpaced that of condos and townhouses, but in January – for the first time since November 2015 – this was not the case, though one month’s worth of data alone doesn’t indicate a long-term trend,” stated Florida Realtors Chief Economist Brad O’Connor.\nmshanklin@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5538\nCaption January home sales by the numbers The National Assn. of Realtors said home sales rose 3.3% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.69 million.
