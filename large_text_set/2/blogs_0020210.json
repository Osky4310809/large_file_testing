The aesthetic, featuring Ari Marcopoulos, adidas team riders Mark Gonzales, Tyshawn Jones, Nestor Judkins, Kevin Lowry, Frankie Spears, and friends skating the streets of New York, in turn brings the limited edition zine to life while combining artful behind-the-scenes footage and modern street skating.\nYou’ll have to check back with us for the reveal of the adidas x Ari Marcopoulos collection, slated for February 27.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:03:16.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
