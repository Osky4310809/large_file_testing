In case of unconvincing replies by the DMs, action can be taken against them, reported The Indian Express quoting sources. \nIn February, 128 serving and retired officers attended the meet in Patna and demanded a CBI probe into the paper leak case including the above-mentioned DMs. A top government source told IE that the chief secretary’s office issued the notice to the DMs seeking an explanation on whether they sought requisite permission before leaving headquarters and also asked them to cite valid reasons for the move. The commissioner sanctions leave for DMs. \nAccording to the source, the government has a right to know why the DMs left headquarters. The source further said that if it is not convinced with their replies, action can be taken against them, adding that was the first time when such a big number of IAS officers left headquarters for Patna. \nYou may also like to watch: \nMeanwhile, the DMs who were served the notice said they had sought due permission from the commissioner.
