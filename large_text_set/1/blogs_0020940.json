By Mike White / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nSince Doug Biega became the boys basketball coach at Beaver Falls High School in 1999, he is practically unmatched in the WPIAL in terms of wins. But Biega’s chances to win more games are numbered. \nRetirement beckons. \nBiega, one of the most successful coaches in the WPIAL the past two decades, confirmed Thursday morning that he will retire at the end of the season. He gave Beaver Falls athletic director Jim Carbone a letter Tuesday informing him of the decision. \nBiega has won four WPIAL championships and two PIAA titles in his career. His record is 378-115, close to an .800 winning percentage. The only WPIAL coach who has won more games during Biega’s 18 years is Chartiers Valley’s Tim McConnell. \nBiega is only 46 but is adamant about retiring, not resigning. Biega insists the reason for his decision is his family and not because Beaver Falls is only 6-7 this season. Biega and his wife, Cary, have a 7-year-old son, Jack. \n“People who don’t coach look at the ‘family reason’ and think that’s not a legitimate excuse,” Biega said. “But there isn’t one head coach of a high school varsity sport that doesn’t know how legitimate of a reason that can be. Nowadays, more than ever, high school sports are 12 months. It’s year-round. There’s so much to do. I loved every minute of it, but now I have someone else at home to monitor — and I take that job as a father seriously. \n“I told my athletic director this on Tuesday. I just wanted to be as fair as I possibly could to Beaver Falls. They have treated me so great over the last 18 years. I want to make the transition as easy as possible for them and that’s why I let them know now. Things happen immediately after basketball season with budgets, scheduling and other things. I didn’t want to be selfish and hold out on letting them know.” \nBeaver Falls has a rich basketball tradition, but the program fell on hard times before Biega took over. The Tigers had losing records in four of the five previous seasons before Biega arrived. Beaver Falls was 6-16 in Biega’s first season, but then the Tigers flourished, winning at least 20 games in 14 of the next 16 seasons. Beaver Falls won 12 section titles under Biega and made the PIAA playoffs 15 consecutive years. \nBesides winning four WPIAL and two PIAA titles under Biega, Beaver Falls lost in a WPIAL title game four times and a PIAA championship twice. Last year’s team won the WPIAL 3A title. Biega coached a number of excellent players, including Lance Jeter (played at the University of Nebraska) and his cousin, Sheldon Jeter (currently at Pitt). \nBiega will continue as a teacher at Beaver Falls Middle School. Coaching Beaver Falls was challenging at times, Biega acknowledged. But he also said “everywhere you coach has challenges. Other districts have their own set of challenges. You can’t be a head coach and not expect to incur some sort of challenges, no matter where you are. Expectations when I got here were non-existent. The difficulties we experienced as far as expectations were created on my own because we won almost 80 percent of our games.” \nBeaver Falls is in danger of not making the WPIAL playoffs this year for the first time since 2000, Biega’s first season. But that didn’t affect Biega’s decision. He has come close to stepping down the past few years. He insists he will not coach again, unless it’s when his son is much older. \n“I talked to the team yesterday because I wanted them to hear it from me,” Biega said. “They understood. We then had one of our most positive days of the entire season. \n“This team has fought. Five of our seven losses are by five points or less. We play two freshmen. These kids are fighters. They’re going to play real hard the rest of the year. That’s why I am adamant in saying I retired. Nobody is quitting. We’re going to fight until the bitter end of this season.” \nMike White: mwhite@post-gazette.com and Twitter @mwhiteburgh", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T17:55:38.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
