It will serve Italian salads, sandwiches, and pastas starting next Saturday, when the two-level grocery store opens. It will feature about a dozen seats at the counter, though diners can order to sit in the general seating area with more than 200 seats. Though it’s in the Whole Foods, the Franks will be running the outpost with their own staff.\nThe Franks, who are also expanding to Pittsburgh , will be joined by a raw food restaurant called Harbor Bar , a project where Daniel Boulud has created some dishes with his smoked salmon line . The restaurant will also feature oyster towers, lobster rolls, small plates, beer, and wine. Both tahini kiosk Seed + Mill and Turkish bakery Simit + Smith will be at the location as well. \nBeyond the brand names, Whole Foods will be capitalizing on several big local food trends with some in-house venues on the second floor dining area. The location will be the first Whole Foods in the city to serve Detroit-style square pies , an increasingly popular, breadier-style of pie served at places like Emmy Squared and Massoni. Another spot will serve “ artisanal toasts ” with toppings like almond butter, avocado, and jam or ricotta, berries, and hot honey. And Nashville-style hot chicken and Indian-inspired Indie Bowls — two more big national fast casual food trends — will be available as quick serve options at this Whole Foods.\nThe outpost officially opens on Saturday, Jan. 28 at 9 a.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T03:33:26.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
