Proper sushi requires years of knife-training in Japan, and no one knows how the fuck fondant fancies start life. It’s why Kim K flies to New Orleans to eat doughnuts . \nIt’s probably a blessing in disguise that most of us have neither the culinary skills nor Kardashian-sized disposable income to produce our favorite treats on demand. Can you imagine how much tighter our “going out” skinny jeans would be if we did? RECIPE: Beer Cheese \nBut here’s a dangerous exception to the rule: beer cheese. Yes, the classic Deep South dish combining two of the most delicious and fattening things on God’s green earth is ridiculously easy to make. \nThis recipes comes from Kentucky via Decatur, the Deep South-inspired kitchen of London chef Tom Browne . All you’ll need is a bottle of beer (what kind of heathen fridge doesn’t contain beer?), a block of Cheddar (ditto), a basic-grade spice rack, and some hot sauce. After warming the beer in a pan, simply combine with the cheese and some spice, and blend until it starts to look like hummus. Except way tastier. \nServe with Ritz crackers or spread over warm sourdough. Just be warned, once you know how to make beer cheese, you can’t un-know. \nDon’t tell your bathroom scales we didn’t warn you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:15:22.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
