The brand claims it to be the world’s first smartphone to offer download speeds up to 1Gbps, thanks to support for 5G mobile network internet service. The ZTE Gigabit Phone is also one of the first smartphones to utilise Qualcomm’s latest flagship Snapdragon 835 SOC. \nThe ZTE Gigabit Phone is packed with Qualcomm’s X16 LTE modem, which is capable of achieving extremely fast data speeds – over ten times faster than previous-gen LTE devices. The phone utilises the 4×4 MIMO antenna technology and 256-QM modulation to achieve such high download speeds. \nThe company has independently developed its Pre5G Giga+ MBB solution for the Gigabit Phone. The device processes data three times faster in the same network as compared to other 4G-enable devices. The brand says that 1Gbps of internet speed is capable of 360-degree VR streaming, instant cloud storage access and streaming music and movies in high quality. The vendor calls the phone “a forward-looking 5uper Generation smartphone”. \nZTE didn’t reveal any other specs of the Gigabit Phone since it’s a concept at the moment, and is just meant to showcase the connectivity prowess of 5G networks. The brand expects first large-scale commercial deployment of 5G networks by 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:49:12.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
