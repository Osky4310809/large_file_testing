Through two years of content that has brought two seasons of Daredevil and the first seasons of Jessica Jones and Luke Cage , these shows have been so well-received that additional seasons have already been ordered. This year, however, sees them expand their output to three shows a year, with Iron Fist up first, ahead of The Defenders and the first season of The Punisher spinoff.\nBased on the track record of the shows to this point, it seems all but a formality that each of these new Marvel/Netflix series will also get additional seasons at some point. Even though The Defenders is still currently filming and the actors have just now begun to talk about it, one of the stars is already wanting a second season of the team up mini-series.\nEW had the chance to interview Jessica Jones herself, Krysten Ritter, when visiting set of The Defenders that’s already resulted in numerous photos and interviews. In their latest post, EW asks Ritter what her experience has been like on set so far, and it has been nothing short of greatness. In fact, Ritter is so pleased with how things are going and the smaller workload that she is already down to come back for a second season as soon as possible:\nWith Jessica Jones, I’m in almost every frame of the show. This is spread out so we’re all working about three days a week. We’re all in celebration of that. It’s honestly kind of a dream job. [Laughs] If they want to do a Defenders 2, I’m in.\nDefenders gives each of the regular leads – including, Charlie Cox in Daredevil , Mike Colter in Luke Cage , and Finn Jones in Iron Fist – a chance to work together, and similar to how the actors on the Marvel film side have vocally enjoyed the big team-up movies, that appears to be the case once again on the small screen. In addition to not having the entire weight of a show on her shoulders, Ritter has enjoyed the time with her co-stars:\nIt just feels fun. We’re all having a blast. We’re all excited to be working together. It’s fun to see their work, how they work, what their style is, what the integrity of their characters are. We’re all so invested in our characters that everybody just wants everything to be great.\nAs long as Defenders follows in the footsteps of the previous Marvel/Netflix series, Ritter should get her wish of doing a second season of the mini-series. The next seasons of Daredevil , Jessica Jones , and Luke Cage are waiting in the balance – not to mention the possibility of Iron Fist getting renewed and any other possible spinoffs getting announced – so a second Defenders season could be a few years away from hitting the streaming service too. Should Defenders season 2 happen, fans can likely look to 2019 as the earliest release date for it. And who knows, maybe next time the Defenders team will be larger than just four heroes.\nNEXT: How Iron Fist Unites the Defenders Daredevil season 1 and 2, Jessica Jones season 1, and Luke Cage season 1 are now available on Netflix. Iron Fist will premiere on March 17. The Defenders and The Punisher will arrive at some point this year. Premiere dates for the newest seasons of Jessica Jones , Daredevil , and Luke Cage have not yet been announced.\nSource: EW", "external_links": ["http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/marvel-netflix-defenders-magazine-cover.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/marvel-netflix-defenders-magazine-cover.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop", "http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/16/krysten-ritter-defenders-season-2/?xid=entertainment-weekly_socialflow_twitter", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/marvel-netflix-defenders-magazine-cover.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/marvel-netflix-defenders-magazine-cover.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/marvel-netflix-defenders-magazine-cover.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/marvel-netflix-defenders-magazine-cover.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1417&h=708&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/marvel-netflix-defenders-magazine-cover.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/marvel-netflix-defenders-magazine-cover.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-16T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T03:22:43.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
