Hopefully he will help us,\" he told Fotbollskanalen after his nation's 2-1 win over Sweden in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. \n\"He is a very good player. He has great qualities and will certainly do well if he comes to us.\" \nAlthough it would add competition for a place in United's defence, Bailly said it would boost his team – and he believes his partnership with Lindelof would be strong. \n\"We have many good central defenders – Chris Smalling, Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones – but I hope I get to play with Lindelof,\" he said. \n\"I don't have a guaranteed place and I know I have to be good to play. We're all fighting to play. I think we have done well. We have done our best. \n\"The day we get to play, if it comes, we must take advantage of that opportunity. I think we would fit well together.\" \nBailly was left on the bench for Ivory Coast's win as Wilfried Zaha marked his debut by setting up Giovanni Sio for the winning goal early in the second half. \nTorino confirm Arsenal bid for Belotti \nZaha, who previously played twice for England's senior side, came on at half-time and made an instant impact as his cross from the right was headed in by Sio. \nSweden had gone ahead through a Wilfried Kanon own goal before Serge N'Guessan equalised in first-half additional time.
