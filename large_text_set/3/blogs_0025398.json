announced his intention to vote against the American Health Care Act. He issued this statement on his Facebook page, citing issues with the bill’s provisions regarding Medicare I’m eager to support legislation that doesn’t reduce funding in the Medicare trust fund and actually helps lower healthcare costs for the more than 465,000 people in my district who obtain their health insurance via their employer. Those individuals, who make up 65 percent of the district, have seen nothing but higher premiums, higher deductibles, and higher co-pays. We need to find solutions to help them and their families. The middle class cannot keep bearing the brunt of everything. \nKatie and Guy have been following the vote all day. The bill’s failure seems all but certain as at least 36 Republicans (CBS News has the count as high as 38) plan to vote against the bill. Rep.
