ADVERTISEMENT \nThe PBA D-League’s voting process differs from the PBA, as the individual stats are only used as indicators for the standout players for each teams. \nPlayers with teams advancing to the semifinals are more favored to win the award, with votes from the media, the TV coveror, and the Commissioner’s Office deciding the victor. \nTeng has been stellar in his first D-League stint, topping the league in scoring with 26.0 points, fourth in dimes with 4.3 assists, and eighth in boards with 8.7 rebounds per game while leading AMA to a 4-2 slate halfway through the conference. \nBut he’s not the lone hopeful, with other contenders from the league’s top squads not far behind him for the award. \nBong Quinto is silently having a promising campaign, averaging 16.8 points (6th in the league), 4.4 rebounds, 4.0 assists (5th), and 1.2 steals for Tanduay. \nThe same goes with fellow Rhum Master Mark Cruz who has netted 13.4 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 4.4 assists in his D-League return. \nPaul Desiderio has also been a gem for Cafe France, netting 15.4 points (8th), 4.4 rebounds, and 1.8 assists. \nLeague-leader Racal has had its fair share of candidates led by Kent Salado (13.6 points. 3.6 rebounds, and 3.0 assists), Sidney Onwubere (13.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 1.4 steals), Rey Nambatac (11.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 1.4 steals), and Jackson Corpuz (10.4 points, 8.0 rebounds, 1.4 steals, and 1.2 blocks). \nJason Perkins (12.8 points, 9.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists) and Robert Bolick (11.2 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 2.8 assists) have also towed Cignal-San Beda to the upper half of the standings. \nOther candidates from lower-ranked teams have also emerged. \nVictoria Sports-MLQU has had a couple of aspirants with swingman Robbie Herndon (18.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.8 steals) and the league’s rebounding leader Aris Dionisio (15.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, 2.8 blocks). \nJoseph Sedurifa has also been the undoubted leader for Batangas, averaging 16.8 points, 6.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists. \nVeterans have also made their case, with Jhaps Bautista anchoring Jose Rizal University with averages of 13.2 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 1.2 steals, while Marlon Gomez has been steady for Wangs Basketball with 14.0 points, 9.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.0 blocks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T15:59:24.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
