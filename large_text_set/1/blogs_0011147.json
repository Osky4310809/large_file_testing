Time zones, that is. Over the past few weeks, the actress has zipped to Mumbai for work, returned to New York for Quantico’s shooting schedule, and then hopped over to Los Angeles, where her Golden Globes look—a plunging gold Ralph Lauren Collection dress paired with a full-stop berry lip—betrayed no sign of travel weariness. Then again, acting is her trade. “A little overworked, a little jet-lagged, but I’m good,” she reports with a breath of optimism. Such grace under strain has served the India native well—through her school-age years in the United States, her victory in the Miss World 2000 pageant, and a subsequent roster of films spanning Bollywood and Hollywood. It’s little wonder that she can handle the breakneck pace that comes with playing Quantico ’s Alex Parrish, the FBI agent turned CIA analyst at the center of the ABC thriller, which resumes its second season on January 23. \nChopra’s drive to take on outsize challenges is something of an inherited trait. “My mother is a huge, huge influence in my life,” she explains of her “overachiever” mom, a double-M.D. who manages a medical practice while running her daughter’s production company. “She speaks some eight languages. She’s just someone who believes in being a woman of the world.” \nChopra’s own global presence has recently grown twofold. Late last month, Pantene anointed her the brand’s newest ambassador, a move that comes as no surprise to anyone familiar with the screen star’s voluptuous head of hair. “It’s been consistently my crowning glory,” she says with a laugh, crediting the new strengthening Smooth & Sleek shampoo with taking it to the next level. (This is not a shameless plug, she stresses: “Just try it once, and you will see that I’m not lying.”) She’s also taken on a new role as a global UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, lending her efforts to help support children’s rights and gender equality. \nWith so much resolve already on display, Chopra doesn’t have use for New Year’s pronouncements. “Like every single person, by the time [the] third [of] January arrives, I break my resolution!” she confesses. Instead, she offers up wisdom that’s worth adopting—and reaffirming—all year long, including a body-positive mindset and an Ayurvedic coconut-oil scalp treatment passed down from her grandmother. \nThe Scalp Saver “I’m someone who believes in beauty products that are both Ayurvedic and, I guess, ‘normal.’ Because of the fact that I was born in India, I’ve been exposed to a lot of herbal tricks and remedies; the women in the family always have easy ways of [caring for] things, especially hair, actually. It started with my grandmother. Three days of the week at least, she would sit me down, and it was sort of a traditional thing in India that you do: Moms oil their daughters’ hair and braid it. Coconut oil is healthy for the scalp and the growth of hair, [making it] longer and stronger. I heat up the oil a little bit and do a coconut-oil massage, then I wrap it with a hot towel, so it soaks [into] the scalp. I do it twice a month, and then you just shampoo and condition it normally. I guess thanks to that, I have extremely luscious hair that can stand up against the brutality of my profession!” \nThe Confidence Game “The pressures on women around the world, I think, are the same: the reach of trying to look like perfection, which is not possible for real women. I don’t think it’s just America or India at all, [the ideal of] being impossibly skinny or having impossibly perfect skin. What is very important for women is to own who you are and accept who you are and run with that. To be able to own your own personality is one of the most difficult things on the planet because we are inundated by these extreme, unachievable ideologies of what beauty should be. But I think true beauty really comes from having a sense of confidence—that you walk into a room and people wonder why you’re so confident. I think that makes for intrigue.” \nThe Daily Fix “In everyday life, we wake up in the morning and go for our jobs. Nobody has the luxury to spend time taking care of their hair or their skin or giving it a regimen, right? I don’t have time to get a facial. I don’t have time to go to the spa and get my body wrapped in seaweed or whatever. I don’t get deep-conditioning treatments. That’s why my shampoo is awesome. It’s important for us to have products that give us the ability of looking like we’ve just stepped out of a salon. It’s really important to find things that protect and preserve us how we want to be protected and preserved. Like, for example, drinking as much water as you can and staying hydrated, or trying to eat foods that are [rich] in antioxidants, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator—things that you can build into your life to take care of yourself.” \nThe Body Positive “Lucky for me, in Baywatch [slated to hit theaters May 2017] I don’t have to wear the red swimsuit because I play the antagonist; I’m not a lifeguard. It was great because I didn’t have to train like the others! [ laughs ] But I have had moments, whether it’s been in my music videos or in Quantico or in my movies in India, where there’s a sense of, ‘Oh my god, I better be in the best shape of my life’—because when you run in slow motion, everything moves! You want to be toned. The camera sees everything. We all have an idea of what shape we want to be in when we step into that bikini, but it’s very different for each person. I think being in swimsuit-body [shape] does not mean that you have to have washboard abs and muscular thighs; I don’t. I’ve always been curvaceous, and I don’t believe in being extremely skinny. That’s the best shape for my body, and I think each one of us needs to figure out what our best version of us is, individual to us.” \nThe Greater Good “When you are in a privileged place—and by privileged I don’t mean affluent; I mean where we have the ability to live our lives the way we want, be healthy, [go] to work, go to school, and make our own decisions—and you look around the world, you see how many people, especially women and children, aren’t allowed to do that. The one thing that I want to stand for when it comes to UNICEF is rights: The right of a child or a female to make her own choices. The world is not making it easy for us to stand up for ourselves and say we [believe] in equality. I think the ability for us to find our strength within ourselves [is key], going back to the whole confidence thing. That’s why it’s so great to work with Pantene because it has always advocated exactly that: ‘Strong is beautiful.’ It’s not saying skinny is beautiful; it’s not saying being a beauty pageant winner is beautiful or an actress is beautiful. Strong is beautiful, and it is such an important time for women to be strong right now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:52:10.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
