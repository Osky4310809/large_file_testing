Should all products be taxed exactly the same in America?” he said. “Because today our tax code gives special tax breaks to foreign products over made-in-America.” \nBrady noted the majority of other countries use a territorial system, arguing the United States needs to shift its policy if it wants to become more competitive in the global marketplace. The Texas Republican said the country’s current tax rates are driving businesses abroad, adding he believes lifting the tax burden on domestic products could help bring jobs back to the U.S. \nHe said he thinks the GOP’s blueprint is more effective than a border tariff in helping the country get ahead. \n“So, tariffs are about trade policy and tend to match what our competitors do — our tax policy unfortunately doesn’t,” he continued. “You know we give a huge advantage to China and Mexico, Canada and Europe today, and so what we’re proposing is to no longer just sit idly by and watch our jobs and our plants move overseas.” \nThe plan will jump-start economic growth and help stimulate job creation, according to Brady. \n“We know, not only does it grow from jobs in America, not only does it stop businesses from moving overseas — it restores America as the best place on the planet to create that new job, or build that new manufacturing plant, or come up with that medical breakthrough,” Brady said.
