An Immigration Attorney Explains (Guest Blog) \nHow the British journalist’s resignation from Breitbart News could jeopardize his U.S. residency Sarah Edgecomb | February 22, 2017 @ 1:32 PM Getty Images \n(Editor’s note: Despite his ardent support of President Trump, conservative firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos isn’t a U.S. citizen. In this guest column, immigration attorney Sarah Edgecomb lays out his options if he wants to stay in the U.S. after resigning from Breitbart News in light of his comments about pedophilia . His former boss at Breitbart, Steve Bannon, is Trump’s chief adviser.) \nMilo Yiannopolous’ resignation from Breitbart News has prompted many to wonder whether his immigration status in the United States could be in jeopardy. Yiannopoulos may not have much time to act, but he likely has some options that would allow him to remain in the United States and continue his work. \nAt the same news conference where he announced Tuesday that he was leaving Breitbart, he said he resides in the U.S. on O-1 status. That’s an immigration status for individuals who possess extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics. Also Read: Steve Bannon and 'Daddy' Trump Silent on Milo Meltdown Over Pedophilia Comments \nYiannopolous has said that he holds O-1B status, which specifically applies to artists — who can include journalists. To qualify for that particular immigration status, the individual must be sponsored by an employer, or through an “agent.” The agent can be any U.S. business or individual. \nWhen an individual is terminated or leaves the employer for any reason, he or she must generally have a new petition filed by a new employer, or be prepared to leave the country as soon as possible. \nIf a new petition is quickly filed with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS), the employee can begin work for the new employer as soon as the petition is approved. In some situations, he or she can file an amendment to the original petition in the event of a major change in the terms of employment. \nBut the law was changed in January to formally provide individuals with 60 days after leaving a job to have a new petition filed on their behalf, or leave the country. Should Yiannopoulos be worried? Not really.

If this is the case, he may have been sponsored by an “agent” on behalf of Breitbart and other employers. If Yiannapolous were sponsored solely by Breitbart, he would likely need to find a new job, fast, and have a new employer file a change of status petition for him within 60 days . \nBut he may have more flexibility if he was sponsored by an agent on behalf of Breitbart and a mix of other employers. In this case, the law would clearly allow him to add new engagements to his itinerary without notifying the government of the changes. This provision allows flexibility for O-1B workers, such as musicians, who may pick up new gigs after arriving in the U.S. \nThis rule would potentially also allow Yiannopoulos to easily add new engagements to his schedule. And adding gigs seems to be what Yiannopoulos intends to do. In his press conference Tuesday, he announced a “new, independently-funded media venture of my own and a live tour in the coming weeks.” Also Read: Milo Yiannopoulos Promises to Remain 'Offensive' After Breitbart Resignation (Video) \nIt is possible that such a business could sponsor Yiannopolous for future work even if his current O-1 status has been terminated for some reason. Though the immigration rules prohibit “self-sponsorship,” such a business could potentially serve as a proper sponsor for Yiannopoulos if he can establish that his co-founders, other major shareholders, or a board of directors supervise and control his employment. Alternatively, a U.S. agent could potentially serve as a sponsor on behalf of an enterprise controlled by Yiannopolous. It’s also possible that Yiannopoulos may have had multiple, simultaneous O-1 petitions approved for him to cover the present time period. For example, he could have had Breitbart sponsor one petition, while an agent filing on behalf of other employers (such as media outlets or universities) could have filed another petition for him to cover the same time period.

If the other petition was filed by an agent, he could even add those new gigs. This would be the most straightforward scenario for Yiannopoulos. In short, it looks like Yiannoplous has a range of immigration options available to him. Although the time may be short, he will likely find a way to remain in the U.S. with the help of his immigration lawyers, if he chooses to do so. Milo Yiannopoulos' Rise and Fall, From GamerGate to Pedophilia Comments (Photos) \nBreitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos' rising star has turned into a meteor plummeting toward Earth. After video of Milo voicing support for adults to have sexual relationships with boys began circulating the internet, the Conservative Political Action Conference dropped him for its keynote and his book deal was canceled. \nHere's the complete timeline of Milo's rise, from his opportunism in the \"GamerGate\" harassment campaign against women in the video game industry, to his resignation from Breitbart News. \n2011 — Milo founds “The Kernel” The British journalist launches the London-based blog, which covered tech startups.

Through GamerGate in particular, he rises as a figure in the “alt-right” movement.

His appearances are met with protests, with critics claiming he spreads hate speech. These protests sometimes cause university officials to cancel his speaking engagements. \nJuly 2016 — Milo goes after \"Ghostbusters\" Again gaining notoriety in conservative “geek” circles, Milo pans Sony's all-women “Ghostbusters” reboot on Breitbart. His review of the movie coincided with many complaints around the internet , mostly leveled by men, claiming the reboot with a female cast was somehow an attack on culture by the forces of political correctness and feminism. \nJuly 2016 — Milo attacks Leslie Jones and is banned from Twitter Milo takes to Twitter to insult \"Ghostbusters\" co-star Leslie Jones, and in so doing kicks off a harassment campaign against Jones by his followers. Jones leaves Twitter, and Milo is permanently banned from the site for “inciting harassment.” Milo positions the ban as an attack on his free speech rights. \nJuly 2016 — Milo stumps for Trump Gaining fame and notoriety, Milo throws his particular influence behind Donald Trump's campaign for president. He hosts a \"Gays for Trump\" event at the GOP National Convention, and refers to Trump as \" Daddy .\" \nDecember 2016 — Milo blasts transgender student on stage While visiting the University of Milwaukee , Milo showed the photo of a transgender student, named her, and disparaged her on stage. \nDecember 2016 — Book deal Threshold Editions, an imprint of publisher Simon & Schuster that focuses on conservative works, signs a $250,000 book deal with Milo for a book titled \"Dangerous.\" \nJan. 23, 2017 — Milo supporter shoots man at protest A Milo appearance at the University of Washington prompts a student protest during which a supporter of Milo and Donald Trump shot a protester , seriously injuring him. The shooter claimed he was acting in self-defense. \nFeb. 2, 2017 — Protesters force speech cancellation at Berkeley Protesters appear before a Milo event at the University of California at Berkeley, including members of the “Black Bloc” anarchy group. The protests turn violent . Police break up the rally, and Berkeley cancels Milo’s appearance as a result. \nFeb. 18, 2017 — Comedian Bill Maher hosts Milo on “Real Time” Maher interviews Milo on HBO's “Real Time With Bill Maher,” despite the controversy the move created. Maher, responding to the Berkeley protest in particular, claims that bringing Milo to the show was essential to the protection of free speech. \nFeb. 18, 2017 — CPAC announces Milo will headline conference The Conservative Political Action Committee announced Milo as its keynote speaker. \nFeb. 20, 2017 — Milo on video defending sexual relations with boys A recording from Milo’s appearance on the podcast “Drunken Peasants” begins to circulate the internet. In it, Milo defends the idea of adults having sexual relationships with adolescent boys . He also joked that his experience of being molested by an older man when he was a young teen had made him good at oral sex. \nFeb. 20, 2017 — Milo suffers backlash Milo's comments defending pedophilia draw backlash from both progressive and conservative quarters. CPAC rescinds its invitation to Milo to speak and Simon & Schuster cancels his book contract . \nFeb. 20, 2017 — Milo resigns from Breitbart Milo says in a statement, \"I would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues' important reporting, so today I am resigning from Breitbart, effective immediately. This decision is mine alone.\" Previous Slide 1 of 19 \nA timeline of the conservative pundit’s high-profile career \nBreitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos' rising star has turned into a meteor plummeting toward Earth.
