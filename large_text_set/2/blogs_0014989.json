We attract businesses. We attract tourists. This is a state that is friendly and welcoming.” \nSan Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor said the NCAA and the NAACP might pull their events from the city over the transgender bathroom bill. \n“That would have a huge, multimillion-dollar impact on our city,” Taylor said . \nSenate Bill 6, also dubbed the Women’s Privacy Act, would prevent transgenders from using the bathroom according to their gender identity in public buildings and schools.
