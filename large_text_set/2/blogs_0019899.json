one mini-uzi, a Submachine Gun, and one AK-47 rifle were recovered from the two cars on the premises. \nOther items recovered from the premises, according to the security agency, include 23 luxury designer watches and 45 keys to various exotic cars. \nIt stated, “The operation was informed by intelligence that some incriminating items were stashed in the boots of cars parked at the property, particularly a Mercedes Benz S550 (BWR 135 AH), and Masarati 4.7 (BWR 207 AJ), which were subsequently confiscated.” \nThe DSS said at 10pm on Saturday, in the presence of two private security officers employed by Dunes Investment, the cars were searched. \nIt added, “The following items were recovered: \n(i) Glock pistol with two magazines and a total of 29 rounds of ammunition \n(ii) Mini-Uzi with two magazines containing 10 rounds and four rounds respectively; \n(iii) Forty-two extra rounds of ammunition contained in a pack and \n(iv) One AK-47.” \nThe DSS added that it also seized 21 Certificates of Occupancy and one offer of statutory right of occupancy. \nIt stated, “Following this discovery, the service launched further investigation, which revealed that the cars and the recovered items belong to the former Governor of Benue State, Gabriel Suswam, who has already been invited by the service and presently helping in the investigations.” \nThe DSS warned persons and groups that it would “no longer tolerate any acts of lawlessness by those who ought to be law-abiding and responsible citizens.” \nIt warned politicians against hate speeches, saying it would get tough with those heating up the polity. \n“The service has also observed with total dismay the inciting utterances of some political actors whose activities heat up the polity. \n“It also wishes to express its disappointment with these politicians who, in their desperation, are engaging in hate speeches and even sponsorship of radio campaign jingles when the electoral umpire has not authorised such campaigns in line with the Electoral Act,” the agency stressed. \nThe DSS also expressed concern with what it called “the unpatriotic involvement of some media outfits in these divisive tendencies which negate their constitutional role as the fourth estate of the realm.” \nIt added, “In line with its statutory mandate of maintaining the peace and internal security of the country, the service hereby restates its commitment to go after anyone, no matter how highly-placed, who engages in acts capable of causing the breach of peace in the country.” \nCopyright PUNCH.
