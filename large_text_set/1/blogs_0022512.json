For example, promoters of music festivals and large concerts have sometimes inflated attendance; it stokes expectations and ticket sales for the next event. \nIn any case, experts, including experienced police who have helicopters at their disposal, say estimating large crowds is largely a guessing game. \"Crowd-size estimation is a murky science, positioned at the intersection of statistical precision and political sleight-of-hand, and plenty of people are motivated to either exaggerate or low-ball an event's attendance,\" according to a Popular Science story on the art and alchemy of crowd estimation. \n\"We generally avoid providing crowd estimates and leave that up to the event organizers to provide,\" LAPD's Neiman said. \"We have been criticized in the past for providing crowd estimates which are in conflict with the event organizers', so we have a general practice now of not providing crowd estimates. \n\"There is no exact science when the crowds occupy open areas such as streets,\" he said. \"Any crowd estimates are just that, estimates based on a best guess. There may be formulas that are used to calculate crowds, but I am not familiar with them and we generally do not use such formulas as a practice.\" \nBut during contentious political times — when Trump is falsely claiming up to 1.5 million in attendance at his inauguration and his administration is floating the bizarre concept of \"alternative facts\" — it's important to try to determine some sense of reality. Alternative facts battling alternative facts doesn't get us there.
