Diana Carrillo went to lunch with her sister and some friend at an upscale restaurant in Huntington Beach, CA. Before Diana arrived at the restaurant, her sister and one of the friends were seated, at which point their waiter asked the pair for “proof of residency” before he would serve them.\nWhen the friend questioned the strange, offensive request, the waiter went on to say, “Yeah, I need to make sure you’re from here before I serve you.” The waiter asked the same of Diana and another friend when they arrived, and, aptly outraged, the group reported the incident to the restaurant manager . Diana also shared her experience on Facebook. Her post has since been shared almost 1,500 times.\n& A few friends and I went to Saint Marc's in Huntington Beach today.

More are simply vowing to not return to the restaurant.\nnow I wonder what the manager is going to do... smh! #sad #nbc #abc7eyewitness #spreadthenews \nA post shared by Ayyyy Criiss (@christophercatalan) on Mar 13, 2017 at 2:08pm PDT \nAnd in case you were wondering, the management of Sant Marc has since fired the waiter in question and reached out to Diana to apologize.\nDiana told the L.A. Times, “I’ve never felt so judged in my life…It sends a chill through your entire body.” Diana’s mother, Guillermina Carrillo, told the L.A. Times she immigrated to the United States from Mexico 30 years ago, and has been a citizen for nearly 20 years. She was infuriated that her daughters had to experience this prejudice, and it’s been eye-opening for all involved.\n& Posted by Brenda Carrillo on  Wednesday, September 16, 2015 \nAs a means to make amends, Saint Marc donated 10% of all proceeds from the weekend’s sales to a nonprofit of the sisters’ choice. The Carrillos and their friends told Saint Marc to donate their funds to Orange County Immigrant Youth United, which advocates for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\nWith tension amping up daily, we need to do all we can to stick up for our fellow humans. Speak up if you see injustice and be an ally to anyone and everyone who might need one.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:54:41.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
