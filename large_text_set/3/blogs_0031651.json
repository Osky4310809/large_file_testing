Shares \nThe Hearthstone Global Games, or HGG to its friends, is Blizzard’s first attempt at creating a national tournament for Hearthstone. Scheduled to start on April 11, a total of 48 countries will participate in the months-long event, each with its own four-man roster of players based on competitive results and community voting. \nBringing together players from both ends of the spectrum, and running alongside the main Hearthstone Championship Circuit, HGG is meant to act as a bridge between esports and more casual fans. Yet weeks ahead of HGG’s debut, the tournament has already suffered from multiple dramas. Mats “P4wnyhof” Kathage, image via Twiiter \nThe first sparks flew in mid-February, when popular streamer Mats “P4wnyhof” Kathage was announced as one of the nominees for his home country of Germany. P4wnyhof has had a controversial history with Hearthstone, dating back to 2014 when he acted as both player and admin for the Gentlemen Cup, a team league organized by TakeTV—the organization behind the hugely successful SeatStory Cup franchise. \nP4wnyhof’s involvement in the tournament resulted in his own team—Planetkey Dynamics—receiving an undeserved seed into the playoffs due to skewed tiebreaker scores , leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of his pro-gaming peers. The streamer has also been the subject of accusations that he uses viewbots to boost his popularity, though that has not been proved. \nP4wnyhof’s inclusion as a potential Global Games community nominee led to vocal pushback from both his potential HGG teammates and other countries’ nominees. CompLexity’s Jan “SuperJJ” Janssen vowed to forfeit his spot in the tournament should his controversial countrymen be voted in, and the same intention was echoed by Sweden’s Sebastian “Forsen” Fors. \nDespite the negative reaction, P4wnyhof was voted in to represent Germany in the Global Games by the community. Keen on giving a prompt answer, Forsen announced later the same day he was following through on his promise and forfeited his spot in the tournament. Liquid’s Jeffrey “Sjow” Brusi was subsequently named his successor and fans expected that to be the end of the dispute. \nNot so lucky. Today Blizzard announced the disqualifications of not just P4wnyhof, but also Thomas “Sintolol” Zimmer, Germany’s top HCT points-earner and therefore “anchor” of the team. \n“In the light of recent, inappropriate, and unsportsmanlike comments made by Thomas “Sintolol” Zimmer and Mats “P4wnyhof” Kathage, we have decided to rescind their invitation to represent Team Germany in the upcoming Hearthstone Global Games,” Blizzard’s Valgrimasz wrote today . “We’re in the process of identifying replacement players, and will reach out to them privately.” \nAlthough the exact comments these players made were not specified, it almost certainly relates to some less than grown-up exchanges between the two players made in the day since the rosters were finalized.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:49:06.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
