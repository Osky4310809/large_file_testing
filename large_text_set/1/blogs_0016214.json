President Trump: Seven ways the world could change \n\"Since Mr Trump has not issued a retraction, as I requested, he has therefore left me with no alternative but to sue him in order to vindicate my reputation,\" Ms Zervos told journalists in Los Angeles. \nShe was joined by her lawyer, Gloria Allred, a Democratic party activist, who said the plaintiff's allegations had passed a lie detector test. Media caption A woman who accused president-elect Donald Trump of sexual assault, which he denied, asks him to retract \"liar\" claims. \nMs Zervos is one of several women who came forward to accuse Mr Trump of sexual assault in the weeks leading up to the presidential election. \nThe 41-year-old former reality show contestant said Mr Trump sexually assaulted her during a meeting to discuss job opportunities at a Beverly Hills hotel. \nShe said he \"began thrusting his genitals\" as she fended off his advances. \nThe president-elect has dismissed the claims as \" false and ridiculous \" and vowed to sue the accusers for their allegations. Image copyright EPA Image caption Ms Zervos asked Mr Trump to retract his words \nMr Trump, a Republican, has not filed a lawsuit against any of the women. \nMs Zervos' lawsuit alleges that the president-elect defamed her by denying her account and accusing her and other women of fabricating sexual assault claims. \nShe asked Mr Trump to retract his words late last year, but he declined to do so. \nMs Allred said Mr Trump \"knowingly, intentionally and maliciously threw each of these women under the bus,\" and that repeatedly calling them \"liars\" in public caused distress. \nMs Zervos added that she would be willing to rescind the lawsuit if the president-elect retracts the statements he made and acknowledges his behaviour towards her. \nThe incoming 45th president faced a series of sexual assault allegations after the October release of a 2005 videotape in which he is caught making lewd comments about groping women. \nThe video prompted several women, including Ms Zervos, to come forward. \nAs it fought her allegations, the Trump campaign released a statement from someone it identified as Ms Zervos' first cousin. \nJohn Barry wrote that he was \"shocked and bewildered\" by her allegations, insisting Ms Zervos had only previously said \"glowing\" things about Mr Trump.
