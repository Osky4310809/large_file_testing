But now when we look at the options, we find not one, not two, but quite a few devices achieving this feat, without burning a hole through your pocket. So without further ado, let’s take a look at some of the top smartphones that ship with 4GB of RAM, all priced under Rs 15,000.

The new phone is a metal-clad 5.5-incher that boasts a Snapdragon 625 SoC, complete with MIUI 8 with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Along with these improvements comes an option to opt for a variant that comes with 4 gigs of RAM and 64GB of storage. Now this is what makes the deal even sweeter. Not to mention the device also scores big points when it comes to battery life. Coolpad Cool1 Dual (Rs 13,999) \nWhat do you get when two Chinese giants join hands to design a smartphone? Yes, it’s the Coolpad Cool1 Dual. Coming from LeEco and Coolpad, the smartphone makes use of a Snapdragon 652 SoC to keep things running. There’s an ample 4GB of RAM to enhance multitasking, while the dual rear cameras keep the shutterbugs busy. If you’re one for media consumption, you’d appreciate the crisp 5.5-inch full HD IPS LCD display on-board. Lenovo K6 Power (Rs 10,999) \nEnough with these big phablets. If you’re looking for a 5-incher with 4GB of RAM, then the K6 Power from Lenovo might be a perfect choice for you. Under the hood, it packs in a Snapdragon 430 processor, aided by an Adreno 505 GPU and 4 gigs of RAM. The K6 Power sources power from a 4,000mAh non-removable battery, meaning battery life shouldn’t be a problem. Features like a fingerprint scanner and Dolby Atmos sound also make this phone worth looking out for. vivo V3 Max (Rs 13,994) Even after about nine months since its launch, the V3 Max from vivo holds its ground against some of its newer counterparts. Beneath the 5.5-inch full HD display resides an octa-core Snapdragon 652 SoC, coupled with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage.

Moreover, the V3 Max comes with other features like a metal unibody design and a fingerprint scanner. Coolpad Note 5 (Rs 10,999) \nThe Note range has been one of the most popular in Coolpad’s portfolio, and the Coolpad Note 5 tries to take that legacy forward. Talking about specs, the device comes powered by a Snapdragon 617 processor, 4GB of RAM and a respectable 4,010mAh battery which thankfully comes with quick charging support. Much like most of the smartphones in its range, the Note 5 also features a 5.5-inch full HD display.
