(Ashley Hardacre/Facebook) \n\"I used my windshield wipers to try to get them off but the shirt was completely wrapped around my wiper blade,\" she continued. \nThe teen said instead of getting out to remove the shirt, she drove to a safe place and rolled her window down to get it. \n\"I had seen posts lately about people finding things under their windshield wipers in the burton/flint area as an attempt to get girls out of their cars and distracted,\" Hardacre wrote. \nSince Hardacre posted her message, the Facebook post has been shared over 100,000 times. \nSarah Dunsey reunites with family in emotional video \nFlint Township Police Detective Sgt. Brad Wangler told CBS News that there haven't been any other reported incidents like Hardacre's but advised people to be \"vigilant.\" \n\"If something doesn't seem right, or the hairs on the back of your neck stand up,\" he said. \"But by all means, we need to know about this stuff when it happens.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:28:24.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
