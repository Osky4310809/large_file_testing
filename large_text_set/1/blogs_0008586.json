(Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage) More Chrissy Metz, the breakout star of NBC’s This Is Us, made a head-turning appearance on the Golden Globes red carpet Sunday night — and not only because she looked stunning. Metz, who is nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television, surprised those who have been following along by appearing not in a Christian Siriano gown as planned , but in a bejeweled, deep-purple creation by Nathan Paul. “[Nathan Paul is] a new designer,” she told Glamour . “I had a couple choices for dresses, which, wow, I didn’t think I’d have — what an honor. And I just was like, ‘I want to feel comfortable, I love purple, why the hell not?’ It spoke to me.” Paul, based in New York is also a Project Runway alum (Season 10), and has worked with brands including Ralph Rucci and Vera Wang, according to his website . The switch was a bit of a shocker as Metz, 36, had been quite public about her planned team-up with Siriano, inviting E! News to the final fitting and telling the network that she “got really lucky” to end up working with the Project Runway grad, who is known for being inspired by women who don’t fit cookie-cutter fashion molds regarding body size, age, and other expectations. Siriano even designed two gown options for Metz’s big night — one, a flowing red number with intricate beading, and the other a one-shouldered turquoise gown. His only comments on the matter so far have been a pair of tweets: Correction: She’s not wearing Siriano tonight https://t.co/P1qk2ZAmv6 \n— Christian Siriano (@CSiriano) January 8, 2017 \n. @chelofthesea @YahooStyle @ChrissyMetz We made two options and her team chose to tell press beforehand. She went with another. \n— Christian Siriano (@CSiriano) January 9, 2017 Some of his fans reacted with disappointment: @CSiriano @chelofthesea @YahooStyle @ChrissyMetz I was wondering… was waiting to see what she choice. She should’ve stuck with you!! \n— Renee Biernbaum (@PinkGlitz_84) January 9, 2017 \n@CSiriano bummed she didn’t wear one of yours! They were both stunning \n— Brittany Curtis (@b_curtis) January 9, 2017 But Siriano instead spent most of his Twitter time focusing on the other stars he dressed tonight — Issa Rae, Angela Bassett, Rachel Bloom, and Kelly Preston — as did his biggest supporters, including Nina Garcia, who gave him a big “Bravo!” shoutout on Twitter.
