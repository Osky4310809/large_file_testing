As a part of the project, 10 models of the original Range Rover will be restored, awarding interested buyers with the opportunity to purchase a version of the OG Range Rover, brand new.\nEach Land Rover Reborn will undergo comprehensive restoration courtesy of an experienced automotive team. This group of mechanics will then work alongside the customer in order to find the best possible base vehicle for the restoration process. Interested buyers will in turn be advised on collectability, unique characteristics of their chosen vehicle, and preferable chassis numbers. The restorations will follow the original 1970s factory specifications using Land Rover Classic parts and prices for Reborn Rovers.\nTim Hannig, director at Land Rover Classic, insists that the Range Rover Reborn program is “a wonderful way to preserve the much sought after three-door original Range Rover from the 1970s, from period-correct color ways to interior trim and accessories.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:31:57.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
