It was first announced about three years ago, but it's been longer than that. I mean, the last major Zelda game, Skyward Sword , came out on November 18th, 2011 . That means someone who beat that game the day it came out has been looking forward to another romp through Hyrule for five years, seven weeks, and four days. Of course, not everyone sat down and played through it that day — I myself have been waiting five years, one week, and three days. \nIt took me a long time to beat Skyward Sword , okay? Shut up, I'm busy. (source) \nAll that is to say, any update on the release of the open-world Zelda game is like word of a parole hearing for a prisoner. And the way it was sounding, we Zelda fans were gonna have us a long wait — rumors swirled that Breath of the Wild wouldn't be ready for the Nintendo Switch's March release date and would make it to stores in June. Keep in mind, this game was originally announced for the Wii U, meaning it was already delayed long enough to move onto a whole new console . Were we going to have to hold out even longer for another chance to rescue Princess Zelda from a bunch of pig-mans? \nI want SO BADLY to murder some pig-mans! (source) \nBut according to Eurogamer , those fears were for naught. At least in Japan and North America, it sounds like Breath of the Wild is on track to make the Switch's release date in March. If this holds true, it means we're less than three months away from a new Zelda game. \nAnd while it's nice to know when our long wait will end, it still hasn't ended. What do we play until March? Might I suggest we all run through Skyward Sword again? Yeah, that would be great! We could all one more time fly the bird and go into temples and-- and fight that, uh, end boss? You know... the guy at the end? Gannon? Was Gannon in that one? \nOKAY I NEVER BEAT SKYWARD SWORD , ALL RIGHT? THE PUZZLES ARE VERY VERY HARD. \nLike, what is this box supposed to be? Did I even get this far? F*CK I AM SO ASHAMED.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T08:23:25.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
