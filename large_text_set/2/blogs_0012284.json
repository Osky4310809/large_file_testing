The relevant section is archived in the video, below.\nThe mode sees Ryu do fireballs and Dragon Punches against waves of Shadaloo grunts. To do a fireball you move the Joy-Cons forward. To do a Dragon Punch you move one up. To do a hurricane kick, move the Joy-Cons from side to side. You can even do a super after you build up your meter.\nTo be honest, it doesn't look great. Based on the gameplay demo, the motion performed doesn't trigger the correct animation - or any animation - half the time. The whole thing rekindles memories of the worst of the Wii waggle era. And it looks like Capcom has reused assets from Street Fighter 5's story mode in the creation of the environment and enemies. It's little more than a throwaway mini-game.\nThe first-person mode comes in beginner, standard and extra difficulties. The guy playing picks beginner. Perhaps standard and extra are better.\nAnyway, it's hard to get too upset with this mode, since you can just not play it, right?", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/xI_IvLl69F0"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:56:35.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
