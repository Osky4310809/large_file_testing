The Richardson Family Murders The couple was apparently inspired by the movie ‘Natural Born Killers’ Natural Born Killers \nIn Canada in 2006 a husband and wife were found dead in their home with their 8-year-old son. The couple’s 12-year-old daughter was missing and everyone initially assumed she had been abducted. \nNope. As it turns out the daughter, Jasmine, committed the murders with her boyfriend.

A lab technician, Raymond Clark, had strangled her before hiding the body. He never gave a reason for the murder. The Robison family, Mike V \nThe scene is familiar, while vacationing at an upper-middle class, remote cottage, the six members of the Robison family were gunned down by a lone assailant. The attacker began by shooting patriarch Richard Robison through the window, before entering an unlocked screen door and killing the rest of the family. 4. The McStay family \nA California couple and their two children were reported missing. Their home seemed as if they had decided to leave and packed up in a hurry, though their dogs were left behind. Four days after they disappeared, their car was towed from a lot in San Diego, indicating they may have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border on foot. \nThe remains of the family were found a year and a half later in the desert. \nWhy would the family have suddenly left their home and life? 5.
