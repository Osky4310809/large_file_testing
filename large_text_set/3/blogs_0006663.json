This week, Republicans introduced a plan to replace Obamacare , conservative groups howled at it, doctors rejected it, analysts said it could kick millions off insurance rolls, and two House committees dove in to mark it up. That was just in 58 hours. That’s why today I’m launching a daily newsletter, VoxCare, as its editor and lead writer. My goal is to explain the day’s most important health care news — from the Hill to the White House to policy land. Some of my colleagues — editor-in-chief Ezra Klein, White House correspondent Andrew Prokop, and health care correspondent Julia Belluz — will weigh in with their expertise, too. Sign up for VoxCare, edited by Sarah Kliff By signing up, you agree to our terms. For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page. After each hectic day in the health care debate, our goal is to deliver some clarity to your inbox — about why the GOP is really fighting with the Congressional Budget Office, or the seven hurdles the party needs to clear to pass its bill. You can sign up to receive VoxCare here , and expect to receive it in your inbox Monday through Friday, right around the end of the workday. We launch with our first edition Thursday evening. We’ll see you soon! Was this article helpful?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:27:51.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
