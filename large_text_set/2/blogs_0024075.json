Giphy \nIn the beginning on the text strand, it seemed like he was being a sincere guy who was offering his friend chocolate. \nEvery girl loves chocolate, and if a guy told me he’d bring me some, you better believe I’d let him come over. \nAfter asking him if he remembered which dorm room she lived in, the overly excited (and obviously horny) guy sent a proud message that said he was about to have sex. \nThe mortifying text said, \nBout to get BALLS DEEP BRO. Reddit \nAfter the text was sent, I could imagine the Reddit user tried to come up with a witty response to the accidental text, but I’m sure he looked a little bit like this: \nQuickly, he tried to backpedal and claimed he sent the text to the wrong person. \n(YEAH, OBVIOUSLY.) \nMoments later, the girl he was planning on going “balls deep” with told him not to come over — and rightfully so. \nThe text message that he accidentally sent was obviously meant for one of his “bros,” and Reddit commenters felt compassion for him. \nOne user called NateDogTX commented and said, \nAh, the rare self-cockblock.

Yeah, didn’t think that was possible either. \nWell, surprise! It’s possible — especially when you tell the girl you’re giving chocolate to that you’re about to go “balls deep” into her. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
