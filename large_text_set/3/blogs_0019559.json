With the season down to a dirty dozen games, Anthony better get used a view from the bench — even in closer contests.\nOne day after he sounded as if his future in New York was in doubt , Anthony revealed Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek told him at Tuesday’s practice that his minutes will decrease, so the coach can get a closer look at their six rookies. With the Knicks at 27-43, out of the playoff race and facing the Jazz Wednesday, Anthony said he’s OK with it.\n“Coach is starting to realize — he mentioned today he’s going to start shortening minutes,’’ Anthony said. “I’ve been understanding with the situation. I understand.’’\nExcept for a sore shoulder that cost him a December game against Golden State, Anthony, who turns 33 in May, has been surprisingly healthy. However, he soon may start sitting out games, particularly the second leg of back-to-backs.\nIn perhaps his finals weeks in a Knicks uniform, Anthony said he wants to be a role model for the young guys.\nRookie Willy Hernangomez and Anthony Paul J. Bereswill “My role won’t change as far as helping guys out,’’ Anthony said after a weight-lifting session. “When I’m out there, I’ll play. When I’m not, I’ll help everyone else. I’ll still come in here and get my work done.\n“All the young guys, it’s an opportunity to get that experience instead of having getting practice experience, individual workouts — actually getting it live and direct in a game against top-level opponents. It’s best to take advantage of that and for me to help them.’’\nWith both having played for Duke/U.S. Olympic Team coach Mike Krzyzewski, Anthony has an affinity for undrafted rookie center Marshall Plumlee, who collected 20 minutes against the Clippers.\n“I’ve come to peace with that,’’ Anthony said of being out of the race. “I’m not happy about it. I’m not sad about it. I’m at peace with it.’’\nSEE ALSO \nNBA's rest problem is real — here's how to fix it 0:0 Adam Silver is right to be worried, because there is... Anthony said he’s fine with coaches resting their star players in big games for the long run, but sees why commissioner Adam Silver is fuming. “I’m not against guys sitting out,’’ Anthony said. “The problem is TV games, ratings. It’s a money game.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:08:07.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
