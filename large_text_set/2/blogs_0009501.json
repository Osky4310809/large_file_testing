They are gonna give you the tools that you need to destroy yourself.” \nAdding to the anticipation for the film is the eeriness in how much Demetrius Shipp Jr. — playing the iconic rapper — looks like ‘Pac. We’re also offered a brief look at Biggie Smalls and Suge Knight , played by Jamal Woolard and Dominic L. Santana, respectively. \nThe biopic is set to be released June 16, the legendary rapper’s birthday. \nWatch the entrancing new trailer for All Eyez on Me — via Consequence of Sound — below. \n[embedded content]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:16:42.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
