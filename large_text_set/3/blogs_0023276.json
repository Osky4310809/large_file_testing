At the time of writing, there was no word on whether the vote had been rescheduled. \nThe delay could have implications for President Trump's legislative agenda. He has promised steep tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and $1 trillion in public and private spending on infrastructure projects. Speaking to Reuters, Brookings Institution senior fellow William Galston compared the Trump agenda to \"a one-lane road with this big truck called 'healthcare' in the lead,\" meaning that \"if that truck breaks down, everything else will back up.\" Last Minute Negotiations \nIn the run-up to the vote, CNN reported on Wednesday night that after 24 hours of negotiations, Republican leaders had not secured the necessary votes to pass the bill. The Republicans account for 237 of 430 votes in the House (five seats are currently empty), meaning that only around 23 Republicans could vote against the AHCA. That cushion was insufficient, as most members of the 29-strong ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus objected to the bill's perceived similarity to the existing law. According to the New York Times, 31 Republicans had committed to vote \"no\" as of 3:40 p.m. EST Thursday. ( For more on the changes the AHCA makes to Obamacare, see here .) \nKentucky Senator Rand Paul, who calls the proposal \"Obamacare Lite,\" had lunch with members of the Freedom Caucus Wednesday. Shortly afterwards a spokeswoman for the group tweeted that more than 25 members had committed to vote \"No.\" BREAKING: more than 25 Freedom Caucus 'No's' on AHCA -- group says \"start over\" \n— Alyssa Farah (@Alyssafarah) March 22, 2017 \nLater that evening the caucus' leader, North Carolina Representative Mark Meadows, told Fox News that he and the president had reached an \"agreement in principle\" regarding the bill, but Meadows' press secretary tweeted Thursday morning that he'd spoken with Trump: \"We're not there yet, but I am very hopeful we can get this done.\" Essential Health Benefits \nEarly Thursday afternoon Politico reported that the administration may give into pressure from the Freedom Caucus and removed the 10 \"essential health benefits\" that Obamacare requires insurers in the individual and small business markets to cover: \nAffordable Care Act section 1302 via obamacarefacts.com \nThe Freedom Caucus argues that Americans should be able to buy simpler plans that omit some of these benefits, resulting in lower premiums overall. Democrats argue that the change could expose patients to financial risk due to unexpected medical issues and that insurers would be better able in practice to discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions. Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, predicted that insurance policies would become \"skimpy\" without the requirements: With no benefit requirements, insurance policies could get quite skimpy. No insurer wants to be the one most attractive to sick people. \n— Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) March 22, 2017 \nThe possibility that these predictions come to pass is not the only issue Republicans faced going into the canceled vote. Making concessions to the Freedom Caucus was likely to alienate centrist representatives who fear that their constituents would lose coverage or be faced with heftier premiums. \nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan research arm of the legislature, released an assessment of the Republican proposal on March 13. The CBO forecast that 14 million more people would be without insurance in 2018, a figure that would rise to 24 million by 2026. The report attributed much of this change to younger, healthier people choosing to forgo insurance, since they would not be punished by Obamacare's individual mandate – which the Republican plan would scrap. \nThis decrease in coverage would leave nongroup insurance markets older and sicker than under Obamacare, the CBO wrote, leading premiums to rise faster than projected under current law. By 2026, however, premiums would be about 10% lower than under Obamacare. The report predicted that older, lower-income patients would see their premiums rise dramatically under the AHCA: while a 64-year-old making $68,200 per year would see their net premiums – accounting for tax credits – fall by 5% under the AHCA, for example, a person of the same age making less than 40% that amount would see theirs rise by 759%.

The changes focused on the ways the federal government would provide Medicare funding to states, allowing states to require able-bodied recipients to work and giving them the option of receiving Medicare funding in the form of block grants – a Trump campaign promise – rather than on a per capita basis as in the original version. Another change would immediately stop states from expanding Medicaid, rather than allowing them to do so until 2020. Take 63 \nRepublicans bitterly opposed the passage of Obamacare in 2010, calling it socialist and accusing it of setting up \"death panels.\" Not one Republican voted for the bill in the House or Senate. The law provided penalties for not obtaining insurance – known as the \"individual mandate\" – and set up exchanges where patients without employer-provided plans could purchase coverage. It also allowed children to stay on their parents' plan until age 26 and prevented insurers from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. \nThe last two measures are popular and the AHCA would leave them intact. It would scrap the individual mandate, however, replacing it with a 30% penalty for those who let their insurance lapse. It would allow insurers to charge older customers five times as much as younger ones, compared to the current three times. It would raise contribution limits to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and eliminate most of the taxes Obamacare introduced – though according to the Hill, it may allow the \"Cadillac\" tax on high-cost health plans to take effect in 2025, rather than 2020 under Obamacare. \nRepublicans' last-minute haggling over Obamacare's replacement may be surprising in light of the fact that repealing and replacing the health law has been a top party priority since it passed. MSNBC has estimated that Republicans voted to repeal the law 62 times during the Obama administration, but never agreed on what would replace it. Trump campaigned on a number of promises – allowing the sale of insurance across state lines, allowing drug imports, funding Medicare through block grants to states, expanding the use of HSAs – but did not formulate a coherent policy. \nPresident Trump's choice for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, wrote a bill to replace Obamacare, but it was just one of several conflicting Republican proposals. The AHCA retains some of its provisions, but leaves others out. It also leaves out several of Trump's campaign promises, which he acknowledged when – following the March 6 release of the proposal – \"don't worry\": Don't worry, getting rid of state lines, which will promote competition, will be in phase 2 & 3 of healthcare rollout. @foxandfriends \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017 Exchanges and the Industry \nRepublican criticisms of the health law gathered steam when prices began to spike on the Obamacare exchanges. In October 2016 the Department of Health and Human Services said premiums rose an average of 25% from 2016 to 2017. Anxiety began to build that the markets had entered a \"death spiral,\" in which rising premiums drove the younger and healthier to leave the exchanges – paying the penalty and taking their chances when it comes to coverage – which would in turn drive up premiums for the older and less healthy remaining pool, driving further defections. \nInsurers began to leave the exchanges. Aetna Inc. ( AET ) announced that it would cut its participation from 778 counties to 242 in August, joining UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH ) and Humana Inc. ( HUM ), which had announced similar pullbacks. Trump, calling the law a \"disaster,\" accurately pointed out that according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 32% of counties would have just one insurer on their exchanges in 2017, up from 7% in 2016. Pinal County, Arizona would have none. \nAccording to the CBO, however, the \"death spiral\" scenario was unlikely to take hold: \"The subsidies to purchase coverage combined with the penalties paid by uninsured people stemming from the individual mandate are anticipated to cause sufficient demand for insurance by people with low health care expenditures for the market to be stable.\" \nObamacare may also have permanently altered Americans' expectations regarding healthcare. Trump promised shortly before his inauguration, \"We're going to have insurance for everybody.\" Republicans did not necessarily embrace that goal prior to Obamacare, as President Trump acknowledged: \"There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to happen with us.\" \nAccording to the CBO, however, the AHCA will not lead to universal coverage: 52 million people are projected to lack insurance in 2024.
