I hasten to add I have no ill will against the Irish. Indeed, my mother was a Donnelly from County Tyrone. \nThree years ago Blundering Bill Shorten also backed the plebiscite. \nIf he had supported it in the Senate I suppose gay couples could be getting married now. \nWhat really annoys me is the hectoring tone and indignation of the gay marriage proponents. It seems they have little respect for other people’s views. \nI won’t fly Qantas again if I can avoid it. \n**** media_camera Labor and some unions have been accused of backing wage deals that would leave workers even worse off than proposed cuts to weekend penalty rates. File picture \nI HAVE been saying for some time now that Blundering Bill is a hypocrite. And I was right. \nLabor and the unions have been trying to block the proposed cuts to weekend penalty rates while at the same time backing wage deals that allow fast-food ­giants like McDonald’s and KFC to pay their staff less than the Fair Work Commission’s suggested new pay level . \nMalcolm Turnbull will today expose union-sanctioned enterprise bargaining agreements showing many workers at the ­nation’s large fast-food chains earn about $3 an hour less now than they would even under the Fair Work Commission’s lower Sunday penalty rates. \nTurnbull will also move to ban secret payments between businesses and unions of the kind revealed by the Royal Commission into Trade Unions involving Opposition Leader Bill Shorten’s former union, the Australian Workers’ Union, when the Labor leader was at the helm. \nTurnbull’s laws will involve maximum sentences of 10 years in jail and a $900,000 fine for individuals who infringe them, and a $4.5 million fine for corporations. \nThe Heydon royal commission uncovered a raft of payments between employers and unions, which it called “corrupting benefits” designed to ensure companies favourable treatment from unions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T03:09:51.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
