The update is seeding to all eligible devices that have signed up for the Android Beta program, but if you are looking to manually update to this latest build, you’ll have to wait until the system image page gets updated .\nNexus 6P Fingerprint Scanner Gesture Credits: @Marnett05 \nThe fingerprint scanner gesture to pull down the notification bar is finally here for Nexus 6P users. The feature was initially only available for Google Pixel owners, but eventually made its way to the Nexus 5X in the first beta update .\nPixel C Gets New Launcher, Nav Bar Icons, and Revamped Multitasking Users commenting on an AndroidPolice article who received the update on their Pixel C have posted screenshots showing that the update has brought a new UI for multitasking, a new launcher, and changes to the navigation bar icons.\nThe multitasking screen now shows a large card view of recently opened applications rather than the carousel that most of us are accustomed to. Furthermore, you can quickly open these applications into the multiwindow mode by simply dragging and dropping the card handle to one side of the screen.\nAs you can see in the second screenshot, the Pixel C also receives the Google Pixel Launcher, but with one caveat. It appears that this launcher is a different package ( com.google.android.apps.pixelclauncher versus com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher ) than the one present on the Pixel or Pixel XL. Why Google has decided to split the launcher into two separate packages is unknown, but hopefully this package continues to be updated with more tablet-specific features in the future.\nFinally, the navigation bar icons have been modified to look like the ones found on the Pixel and Pixel XL. A very minor change, but it unifies the design across the Pixel device spectrum.\nIt’s certainly welcome to see that Google isn’t relegating the Pixel C to the sidelines, in a time when many owners were feeling that the device was becoming the redheaded step child of the Pixel family.\nHave you received the update on your device yet? If so, let us know your thoughts about these changes, or if you’ve discovered something else that we haven’t covered, in the comments below! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:23:45.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
