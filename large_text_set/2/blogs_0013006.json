According to the emails obtained by the New York Post in 2012, Dr. Luke sent messages to Kesha’s manager, Monica Cornia, defending his criticism of the singer’s weight .\n“We were having a discussion on how she can be more disciplined with her diet. There have been many times we have all witnessed her breaking her diet plan,” he allegedly wrote.\nIt appears Dr. Luke was upset that she’d broken a juice cleanse with a Diet Coke and turkey. Monica Schipper/WireImage “A-list songwriters and producers are reluctant to give Kesha their songs because of her weight,” the messages continue. Right, because Kesha’s gorgeous body has anything to do with her incredible voice and songwriting and performance ability . \nstarzfly/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images Kesha has been open about her battle with an eating disorder, and a negative body image. The emails from Cornia detailing Dr. Luke’s criticisms certainly appear to be contributing factors.\nIn a separate email, Cornia recounts a dispute between Dr. Luke and Kesha over her song “We R Who We R.” The lyrics, written by Dr. Luke, painted Kesha as a party girl. When Kesha objected, Cornia says Luke responded, “I don’t give a shit what you want. If you were smart you would go in and sing it.”\n“[Kesha] didn’t feel comfortable talking to him,” Cornia says. Prince Williams/GC Images Kesha’s lawsuit against Dr. Luke is proceeding in court, after a Manhattan judge ruled last year that Kesha couldn’t walk away from her exclusive recording contract despite claims that Dr. Luke had raped her and called her a “fat fucking refrigerator.”\nIt’s probably pretty obvious, but we’ll say it again: Kesha is our hero. We’re so eager for these legal troubles to be behind her so she can own her career once again, and show us all that KESHA IS BOSS.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:39:50.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
