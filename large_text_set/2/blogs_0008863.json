The Reds impressed in the 2-0 win over Spurs (Photo: Getty for Tottenham Hotspur) \n\"No matter what happens from here on in, it will just be one of those seasons when they have once more knocked on the door but not stepped over the threshold,\" he writes in the Sun . \n\"Their league campaign has faltered because they have not always taken the opposition seriously enough, too. \n\"They can get up for the big games but Saturday was their first win in six in the league. Second-placed Spurs were seemingly no problem. They also drew with table-toppers Chelsea. \n\"But Hull, Sunderland and Swansea in that recent run were another matter.\" Mane netted twice to see of Pochettino's men (Photo: Andrew Powell) Read More 10 things we learned this Premier League weekend \nAnd unlike some pundits, Shearer doesn't believe that Klopp's high-pressing style of football is to blame for their recent slump. \n\"I donâ€™t buy that at all,\" he continues. \"The players should be fit enough to cope with that. Without midweek European football, they had a great chance this season but have not taken it.\" \nPrior to their win over Spurs, Klopp urged his side to win every single one of their 14 remaining games.
