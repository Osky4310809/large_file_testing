There was always a summer camp, a body-switch, or a human with an alien friend, or so it seems. In spite of the complexities of the Cold War, the themes of Hollywood movies during the decade were often ridiculously simple: Get laid, ski to the bottom of the hill first, or outrun the slasher. It obviously wasn’t all bad, of course, otherwise the 1980s wouldn’t be such a rich resource for remakes and reboots. \nBelow are 15 of the best ’80s movies on Netflix streaming to watch tonight. Some highlight the excesses of the decade. Others flaunt formula and subvert topes made famous by other 1980s films. Still others are singular achievements that would stand out in any decade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:16:35.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
