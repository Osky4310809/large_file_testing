But this time, things turned violent quickly. \nPolice say the suspect walked into the store around 10 a.m. Tuesday and pepper sprayed the 80-year-old owner, identified as Mrs. Chuong, and a 60-year-old customer. \n“I feel bad for her; she’s been here a long time,” said Mary Gratton, a long-time customer of the market. \nThe robber then demanded and received an undetermined amount of money. \nBut as he tried to leave, police say the customer began throwing items in the store at him. The two got into a fight. Officials say the robber pulled out a knife and stabbed the customer in the neck. \nThe suspect got away, and the victim was treated at UPMC Mercy Hospital for a superficial stab wound. He was last listed in stable condition. Mrs. Chuong was treated by paramedics at the scene. \n“I pray that she’s okay and hopefully they catch the person or persons who have done this to her,” said customer Eric Griffin. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \nAfter meeting with police the owner closed the store. \nNeighbors say this is the only market in in the immediate area. So, they’re hoping police make a quick arrest and that the store will soon reopen. \n“This is our market, this is where we go. You want a snack, you want a drink, you want cigarettes, you go here,” customer Luke Shannon said. \nThe suspect is described as a white male, about 5-feet-7-inches tall and weighs 120 pounds. \nPolice are asking anyone with information about the incident to contact them.
