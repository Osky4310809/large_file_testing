A dele won album of the year for “25,” her third studio album, and we can’t deny we were surprised. Although she was up against Beyoncé, Justin Bieber, Drake and Sturgill Simpson, Adele pulled through. But, it was her acceptance speech that left us shocked. The British musician thanked Beyoncé for her album “Lemonade” and said it was her who should of won, and we have to agree that it was an iconic album, in ways “25” wasn’t.\nChristopher Polk/Getty Although Adele looks stunning in her green dress, we have to admit that we do feel like Beyonce deserved the award. Lemonade explored social justice issues, infidelity and modern-day racism in ways that no other album has.\n\"You move my soul every single day, and you have for 17 years. I adore you, and I want you to be my Mummy.\" - @Adele to @Beyonce #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/6M7K4WL5Gd \n— HelloGiggles.com (@hellogiggles) February 13, 2017 Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for NARAS We absolutely love that Adele took the time to explain what Beyonce meant to her. As a woman of color, Beyoncé doesn’t have the same platform or boost that a white woman like Adele does, no matter how talented Adele is. And by recognizing her privilege in such a public manner, we believe that Adele is helping pave the way for other stars.\nAdele is basically apologizing to Beyonce for winning. That's extremely classy.\n— Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) February 13, 2017 Adele also won “record of the year,” so we didn’t necessarily expect for her to win “album of the year” as well. Either way, we love Adele and are happy that she was so empathetic when she accepted this award.\nSeeing Beyoncé love-cry at Adele, and Adele acknowledge the race issues surrounding her winning was what I needed to see in 2017.\n— Alexandra Herstik (@Alexherstik) February 13, 2017 We just hope that Queen Bey can sleep okay tonight.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:08:22.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
