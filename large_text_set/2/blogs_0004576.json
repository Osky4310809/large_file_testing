Anonymous posters attack Pope Credit: Beatrice Larco/AP \nT he posters appeared several hours before the Vatican announced the name of the pope's personal delegate to the troubled order, a move that side-lined conservative Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, who had been its chaplain since 2014 and is a frequent critic of the pope. \nIn a letter released by the Vatican on Saturday, Francis told Archbishop Angelo Becciu that he would be the \"exclusive spokesman\" for the pope at the Order until elections are held for a new Grand Master in several months.. \nThe posters were even more mysterious because sections of the text were written in the working class dialect Romanesco, spoken only in the Rome area. \nCity authorities pasted white paper over them with the message \"illegal advertising\", as they had been put up without authorisation or the payment of a tax. \nThe Vatican had no comment. But Father Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit who is close to the pope, said in a tweet that they were a sign that Francis was doing a good job and therefore irritating many people.
