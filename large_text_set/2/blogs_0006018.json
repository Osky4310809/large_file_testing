Well, now you don’t have to put yourself through all the whistles, flags, and other sportsball stuff you don’t really understand . You can stream them all online—some even before the big game—and make all those companies feel silly for spending $5 million to air a 30-second spot. The Super Bowl is Sunday, with the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots vying for the… Read more Read more Watch Commercials Now With YouTube AdBlitz \nYou can watch all of the Super Bowl ad teasers (yes there are teasers for ads now) and pre-released ads on YouTube right now. If you’re using a browser, just head to the YouTube AdBlitz home page . From there you can browse the currently released Super Bowl commercials, or search for specific commercials by keyword or brand. Advertisement \nIf you can’t use your browser (or just don’t want to), you can still access the same content on your mobile device or through your streaming devices. The YouTube app is available on iOS phones and tablets , Android phones and tablets , Apple TV, Amazon Fire , Roku, Playstation 4, Xbox One, and Google Chromecasts. Download it if you don’t have it already, then search for the “YouTube AdBlitz” channel . It won’t have the same slick interface the dedicated web site has, but you’ll still be able to see all the teaser and pre-release ads. You’ll also be able to find and watch all of the Super Bowl commercials from previous years if you feel like comparing. \nKeep in mind, not every ad is released early. You’ll probably have to check back after the game to see every ad that aired. It’s safe to say, however, that YouTube AdBlitz will probably have most, if not all, ads up by Sunday night, and definitely the ones people will be talking about on Monday. Super Bowl party food is glorious in its decadence. Meaty, cheesy, crunchy, and greasy, these… Read more Read more Check for New Ads With Super Bowl Hashtags on Twitter \nIf you’re hoping to catch Super Bowl ads as they drop, follow the #SB51 and #SuperBowl hashtags on Twitter. Open up your Twitter app or head to the Twitter home page, and search those hashtags. Then choose the “video” tab. You’ll see a lot of videos, but if you browse through them, you’ll also see when major brands share their newly-aired commercials with the twitterverse. Not the most efficient method, but helpful if you’re mobile or only want to catch certain commercials. How to Watch Just the Halftime Show \nWho doesn’t want to see Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett perform a free live concert? Besides, the best commercials are at halftime anyway. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. EST (3:30 p.m. PST), and according to Joe Flint at the Los Angeles Times , the average NFL game runs for about three hours and 12 minutes (including actual game time, commercial breaks, and time in between plays). So we’ll split that in two, making the first half about an hour and a half long. \nIf you want to catch the halftime show, change the channel to Fox—or tune into the free Fox Sports Go livestream — no later than 8:00 p.m. EST (5:00 p.m. PST) . To be safe, check in with the game around 15 minutes before then. If you want to catch Luke Bryan sing the national anthem tune in for the Fox Kickoff Show from 6-6:30 p.m. EST (3-3:30 p.m. PST).
