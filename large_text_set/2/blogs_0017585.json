Winners then would have to pay taxes on their winnings. \nThe game’s six numbers will be drawn at 10:59 p.m. eastern time. Five white balls are drawn from a drum with 69 balls and a red ball is drawn from a drum with 26 balls. \nPowerball is played in 44 states, plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Powerball jackpot has climbed above $400 million for the first time in nearly three months. (Ben Margot/AP) \nThe odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are incredibly small, at one in 292.2 million. \nIf there is no winner, the prize will increase before the next drawing Saturday night.
