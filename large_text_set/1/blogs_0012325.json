Enter New York-based art collective Snarkitecture and its art installation called \"The Beach,\" which allows — no, encourages — people of all ages to embrace their inner child while merrily swimming in 1,120,000 white plastic balls. \nThe installation, which was displayed in the National Building Museum in Washington DC, is now gracing Sydney Festival in Australia . There's something mesmerizing (and kind of beautiful) about witnessing the bliss people experience while enjoying the installation. Check out the images of \"The Beach\" ahead, which guests can visit throughout the festival (it runs Jan. 7-29), and reminisce about the good old days when plunging into an ocean of balls was a completely natural thing to do.
