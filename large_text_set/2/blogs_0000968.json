She has previously had a miscarriage on Nauru. \nDoctors for Refugees says five obstetricians in Australia, including the president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Michael Gannon, have reviewed the woman’s case notes and said she faces a complex and difficult delivery, and that she should be urgently transferred to a hospital with appropriate neonatal facilities. \nNauru – a country of 10,000 people – has limited medical facilities and only one small hospital. Nauruan women facing complex delivery are regularly flown to Australia, Fiji or Singapore to give birth.

Such decisions remain that of health professionals based on patient medical evaluations. \n“Both mother and baby continue to be monitored by skilled and professional medical staff, who have extensive experience in the delivery of babies and pre- and postnatal care. Our medical teams and specialists are available and prepared with patient care as our first priority. We will always recommend treatment in accordance with the best interest of the patient and will not hesitate to recommend a medical evacuation if the situation requires.” \nSince 2015, it has been Australian government policy that asylum seekers and refugees deliver babies on Nauru because of their “ propensity ” to exercise their legal rights in Australia’s courts and seek an injunction against their removal from Australia. \nThe policy has led to extraordinary circumstances on the island for pregnant refugee women. \nIn 2015, a government health contractor advertised on LinkedIn for a neonatologist to fly the very next day to Nauru to oversee a complex birth. The ad even invited doctors to nominate their salary for a week’s work. Doctors told the government the mother should be flown, with the baby in utero, to a tertiary hospital. \nLast year, a Somali refugee and her newborn infant were medically evacuated from Nauru in a critical condition and placed on life support in a Brisbane hospital after she gave birth by caesarean on the island one-month prematurely.

Doctors refused to discharge the baby from hospital, stating the Nauru detention centre was not a safe environment for her. Baby Asha was ultimately discharged to live in the community in Australia. \nThe government’s policy around babies born to refugee women has led to an unusual legal sophistry. \nBabies born in Australia to women moved from offshore detention are regarded by the department as “illegal maritime arrivals” to the country, despite having never been on a boat nor having left Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:32:09.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
