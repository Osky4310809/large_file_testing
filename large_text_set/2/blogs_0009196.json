In its capacity as automotive support, BMW will be deploying approximately 200 vehicles from its BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad range of models. \nAmong the models to be used are the MINI Countryman, 2 Series GT , X1 , X4 , X5 , and the 330e plug-in hybrid , with the Motorrad presence represented by one R1200 GS . The majority of models to account for BMW’s presence throughout the event will be the 2 GT and the X4, according to BMW Group Malaysia head of corporate communications, Sashi Ambi; all vehicles will be petrol variants. \nBMW is also sponsoring the White Jersey, which is the award for the best Asian rider at Le Tour de Langkawi. The White Jersey is part of BMW Group Malaysia’s recognising, developing and supporting of rising talent from the region, particularly when cycling has traditionally been a Euro-centric sport, according to Sashi. \nThe key Malaysian interest in this year’s running of Le Tour de Langkawi will be the title defence for Best Asian Rider, won last year by 26-year-old, Terengganu-born Muhamad Adiq Hussainie Othman. This year will be Adiq’s participation in the event for the eighth year running, and he was the first Malaysian to win the award since the 1998 edition of Le Tour de Langkawi. \n“Adiq’s courageous defence of the white jersey with the backing of his team, TSG has been one of the highlights of last year’s race. Throughout this special classification, we’re delighted to show that Malaysians can successfully compete against the best riders of the continent,” said chief executive officer of Le Tour de Langkawi, Emir Abdul Jalal. \nGALLERY: BMW X4 \nGALLERY: BMW 330e plug-in hybrid Research BMW Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:58:07.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
