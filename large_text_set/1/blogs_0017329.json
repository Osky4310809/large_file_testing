One day the duo might be at loggerheads and the next time you see them, they're hanging out like nothing ever happened. Hence we usually don't get surprised when celebrities fall out because we feel the drama won't last. So, it came as a shock to learn that director-producer, Karan Johar really is dunzo with bestie actress Kajol. They're legit finished with each other, it seems. It all began with KRK accusing Karan of bribing him to give good reviews of his film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil which was competing with Ajay Devgn's Shivaay . Then, Ajay Devgn tweeted about KRK's accusation and Kajol retweeted Ajay's tweet, which was quite shocking! Of course, this allegation didn't go well with Karan. Kajol as always Karan's lucky mascot. So much so that he would make sure Kajol made a cameo in all his films. But their relationship went kaput when Kajol believed KRK and didn't trust her 25-year-old friendship with Karan. \nIn his latest book, Karan confessed that Kajol is not a part of his life and they aren't friends anymore which kind of broke our hearts! Let's just have a look at the good times of this duo, and remember when things were all right in the Bolly-verse. \nThe two have been friends since the Kuch Kuch Hota Hai days. \nThey were always spotted together at several events. Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Karan were an inseparable pack. \nSoon, Kajol became Karan's lucky mascot. All his movies would have Kajol making a cameo. \nKajol and Karan always had good things to say about each other. \nAnd together they were like house on fire! \nIn fact, Kajol's episode on Koffee With Karan was no less than EPIC! \nBFF ... well, not \"forever\" anymore. \nHope the two leave behind all the bitterness and reconcile soon!
