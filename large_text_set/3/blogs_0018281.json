At the same time, tea party groups were forced to wait up to seven years or were denied altogether. \nThe tax-exempt status is meant for charitable, religious, and educational groups that operate as nonprofits. The “After School Satan Club” is operated by The Satanic Temple, which says Satanism is a “religion that endorses scientific rationalism as our best model for understanding the natural world.” \nThe club seeks to counter the Evangelical Good News Club, which the group claims “robs children of the innocence and enjoyment of childhood, replacing them with a negative self image, preoccupation with sin, fear of Hell, and aversion to critical thinking.” \nIn 2016 the Satanic Temple released the following video on their YouTube page announcing the launch of its after school club in schools across the nation. \nWarning: It’s extremely creepy. \nJudicial Watch has more on the club’s background: \nThe principle goal of establishing the Satan clubs in public schools throughout Washington State appears to be to counter existing enterprises operated by a Christian-based group. Documents obtained by Judicial Watch include the process of establishing an after-school Satan club at Point Defiance Elementary in Tacoma. The entity behind the club is a nonprofit called Reason Alliance, which is based in Somerville, Massachusetts, and operates in Washington State as the Satanic Temple of Seattle. Its director, Lilith X. Starr, established the Point Defiance Elementary Satanic club, the records show. In its application the club states that its purpose is “character development” and that adult instructors are vetted by the Satanic Temple’s “Executive Ministry.” Children ages 5-12 will develop basic critical reasoning, character qualities, problem solving and creative expression, according to the Satanic Temple filings included in the documents. The club logo is a pencil with devil’s horns. Records obtained by Judicial Watch from the Treasury Department show that the Satanic cult applied for tax-exempt status on October 21, 2014 and received it on October 31, 2014. \nSo while the Obama administration's IRS illegally targeted conservative groups, it evidently saw no problem whatsoever with fast tracking the application of a leftist satanic group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T10:04:29.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
