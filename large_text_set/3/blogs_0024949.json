The unidentified man drove a car into pedestrian traffic on the Westminster Bridge, crashed the vehicle outside parliament, and then attempted to enter the building armed with a knife before he was fatally shot by police. \nTwo people on the bridge were killed, as well as a police officer, and 29 others were sent to the hospital. \nThe way ISIS took responsibility for the attack suggests it was inspired, rather than directed by the terror group, New York Times reporter Rukmini Callimachi tweeted Thursday. \n“IS calls attacker a soldier of the Islamic State,” she said. “This is how they call any1 that does an attack in their name.” \nAuthorities believe the man acted alone, but hundreds of detectives participated in raids on residences in London and Birmingham Thursday morning that resulted in eight arrests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:28:00.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
