Citing sources, Stein reported a timetable for Embiid's recovery won't be established until after the surgery. Embiid was initially ruled out for the remainder of the regular season on March 1 after an MRI revealed a meniscus tear that was \"more pronounced\" than in previous scans. The Philadelphia Inquirer 's Keith Pompey later reported Embiid was getting opinions from doctors in Los Angeles about his surgical options during the team's West Coast road trip. According to Pompey, \" A partial meniscectomy is the most common. That involves the removal of the torn piece of the meniscus. A meniscal repair is the second type of surgery. That one fixes the damage and helps to prevent deterioration. It's a more complex surgery and has a longer recovery time.\" News of Embiid's likely surgery will undoubtedly sound some alarms. The 23-year-old has already undergone a pair of foot surgeries and dealt with stress fractures in his back, and the meniscus surgery will add to that extensive list of medical woes. However, it should be noted that players can return from meniscus surgeries and be plenty productive. One case that hits close to home is that of Sixers center Jahlil Okafor, who was shut down a year ago after he suffered a partial meniscus tear in his right knee. Okafor has dealt with right knee soreness on occasion during the 2016-17 season, but he's largely been healthy despite some brief absences. \"I just feel very confident given what he's been through and what he's seen himself do on an NBA court, that we'll move on,\" head coach Brett Brown said, per Pompey . \"He'll come out of this thing OK.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:17:46.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
