Trump indefinitely blocked those fleeing Syria, where a civil war has raged, and imposed a 90-day ban on entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim majority nations.\n“We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,” Trump said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. “We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.”\nAP Photo/Andres Kudacki In this Jan. 25, 2017 file photo, Muslim women shout slogans during a rally against President Donald Trump's order cracking down on immigrants living in the U.S. at Washington Square Park in New York. Many citizens of Muslim-majority countries affected by President Donald Trumpís curbs on travel to the United States say they were hardly surprised the restrictions rank among his first orders of business. Trump said the halt in the refugee program was necessary to give agencies time to develop a stricter screening system. While the order did not spell out what additional steps he wants the departments of Homeland Security and State to take, the president directed officials to review the refugee application and approval process and find any more measures that could prevent those who pose a threat from using the refugee program.\nThe U.S. may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government will continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, “provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country.”\nIn an interview with CBN News, Trump said persecuted Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status.\nAP Photo/Susan Walsh President Donald Trump, center, grabs the hand of Defense Secretary James Mattis, right, after he signed an executive action on rebuilding the military during an event at the Pentagon in Washington, Friday, Jan. 27, 2017. Vice President Mike Pence watches, left. “We are going to help them,” Trump said. “They’ve been horribly treated.”\nThe order was signed on Trump’s most robust day of national security and foreign policy at the start of his presidency. He met with British Prime Minister Theresa May and had a lengthy phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.\nAs a candidate, Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to the U.S. He later shifted his focus to putting in place “extreme vetting” procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties.\nThe State Department said the three-month ban in the directive applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — all Muslim-majority nations.\nAlan Diaz / AP Protester Gregory Saint-Jean holds a sign during a rally against President Donald Trump's executive order on Muslim immigration, Thursday, Jan. 22, 2017, in downtown Miami. Protesters manifested their opposition to Trump's executive order restricting immigration from some Middle Eastern and African countries. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of the executive order.\n“There is no evidence that refugees — the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation — are a threat to national security,” Lena F. Masri, the group’s national litigation director. “This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.”\nDuring the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Barack Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000.\nAccording to Trump’s executive order, he plans to cut that to 50,000. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later.\n(AP Photo/Russell Contreras) Faisal Nabulsi, president of the Islamic Center of New Mexico, speaks at a news conference at the center in Albuquerque on Friday, Jan. 27, 2017, denouncing President Donald Trump on his executive action. Trump Wednesday signed an executive action implementing \"new vetting measures\" that he says are aimed at keeping \"radical Islamic terrorists\" out of the United States. The president was applauded by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said it was “time to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process.”\nBut many Democrats cast the measures as un-American.\n“Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\nTrump’s order was signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day, which brought to mind the global effort to help refugees during World War II and its aftermath.\nThe order makes no mention of a plan to provide safe zones in Syria and the surrounding area. A draft of the order had directed the Pentagon and the State Department to produce a plan for safe zones in the war-torn Mideast nation.\n(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Women listen to a speaker as area muslims and local immigration activists participate in a prayer and rally against President Donald Trump's immigration policies on January 27, 2017 in New York City. President Trump has taken actions since the inauguration to start the building of a long promised wall along the Mexican border and to cut federal grants for immigrant protecting 'sanctuary cities'. The president’s directive capped a hectic first week for Trump at the White House, giving Americans an initial look at how he intends to position the United States around the globe.\nEarlier Friday, he hosted May at the White House for his first meeting with a world leader since taking office. Asked about whether he would revert back to Bush-era use of torture, Trump said he would defer to the views of Defence Secretary Jim Mattis.\n“He has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. … I don’t necessarily agree,” Trump said. “But I would tell you that he will override because I’m giving him that power. He’s an expert.”\nThe Associated Press and other news organizations have obtained copies of a draft executive order signalling sweeping changes to U.S. interrogation and detention policy. The draft, which the White House said was not official, also requests recommendations on whether the U.S. should reopen CIA detention facilities outside the United States. Critics said the clandestine sites have marred America’s image on the world stage.\nTrump held firm on another matter of contention, trade and illegal immigration from Mexico. He told reporters he had a “very good call” with Pena Nieto earlier in the day, but he reaffirmed his belief that Mexico has “outnegotiated and beat us to a pulp” on trade — and that would change.\n“We’re no longer going to be the country that doesn’t know what it’s doing,” he declared a day after the Mexican leader cancelled his visit to Washington in response to Trump’s plans to build a border wall and have Mexico pay for it.\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T17:06:30.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
