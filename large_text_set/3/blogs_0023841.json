Henderson boost for Klopp Henderson could return against Everton (Photo: Liverpool via Getty) \nLiverpool captain Jordan Henderson has joined his teammates on a week-long trip to Tenerife as they begin preparations for the Merseyside derby with Everton on April 1st. \nThe Reds boss Jurgen Klopp is making the most of the international break by taking those players not involved with their countries to the Spanish island for a mid-season training camp, reports the Liverpool Echo. \nHenderson has been ruled out of the last four matches with a foot injury he suffered in training prior to the loss against Leicester, but is expected to continue having treatment in a race to be fit for the derby clash. \nKlopp remains hopeful that the Reds midfielder will prove his fitness in time for the Merseyside derby at Anfield a week on Saturday. Klopp on Woodburn call-up Woodburn has been called up by Wales (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \nJurgen Klopp has admitted his “surprise” that Chris Coleman didn’t call him first before calling up Ben Woodburn to the senior Wales squad, writes David Maddock. \nThe Liverpool teenager was a shock inclusion for the 23 man squad Coleman selected to face Ireland in a World Cup qualifier on Friday. \nReds boss Klopp insisted he wasn’t about to criticise Coleman, but openly questioned whether it was normal for a national team coach to ignore club managers before selecting players of such a tender age for their country. \nThe German seemed to imply that in the Bundesliga it is standard practice to approach the club boss first to get full information on the youngster, and he said: “Actually, I was surprised about this. I don’t know exactly how it’s normal here. \n“This should not be a criticism. But usually when you call up a player, a 17-year-old player, I thought it would be possible to call me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T07:45:57.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
