By Kevin Vote 6 hours ago 136 shares By: Kevin Vote | 6 hours ago \n  revealed their new uniforms for the 2017 season this week and they’re, well, a bit strange. Why did they do this now? \nDue to an NFL rule that states jerseys can only be changed by a team in a complete rebranding effort, the Rams will have to don their jerseys with the gold trim on it from their St. Louis days. \nMeanwhile, the rest of the uniform will be changed to a throwback blue and white look. #Rams Unveil Uniforms for 2017 Season \n— Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) March 3, 2017 \nThe team paid homage to the historic uniforms that the “Fearsome Four” of Rosy Grier, Deacon Jones, Lamar Lundy and Merlin Olsen wore from 1964-1972. \nThat is a fantastic idea, but not so much if only part of the uniform reflects the throwback look. Instead, the 2017 uniforms look like they’re the product of an amused child who recently found out how to change the uniforms in a Madden video game. \nThe Rams also made it a point in the reveal to mention that the organization reached out to the fans when choosing the uniforms. But did they really? Related: Rams debut fan polls to help design their new 2017 uniforms \nThe fans got to choose whether there was one stripe or two for the pants. Fans also helped decide the color of the face mask for the helmet: white or navy. \nIn essence, the Rams gave their fans the illusion of control as the number of pants stripes and color of the face mask are such minute details in the overall look of the uniform. \nWhy pull this Machiavellian-ish maneuver? Why even try to redesign the jersey right now? Los Angeles could have easily waited until the 2019 season when they plan to unveil a complete rebranding of their uniforms at the opening game of their new stadium. \nMaybe the organization is trying to distract the fans from the on-field product last year, but this is not the way to do that.
