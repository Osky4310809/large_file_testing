PUBLISHED: 22:00,   22:04, Mon, Jan 23, 2017 \nMr Farron, 46, has written to Mr Corbyn asking him whether or not he would compel his 229 MPs to back legislation to formally start the process of leaving the European Union. \nIn the letter the Liberal Democrat leader, who currently commands nine MPs in the Commons, warned Mr Corbyn that supporting the Conservatives would give a “blank cheque” to Prime Minister Theresa May in her drive for what many see as a ‘hard’ Brexit, divorcing completely from the EU bloc. \nThe fourth largest party in the Commons is hoping to steal some supporters from Labour by adopting a strong pro-EU stance which would keep the UK in the single market and the promise of Mrs May guaranteeing a second referendum to decide on any final negotiated Brexit deal. PA Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron (left) and Labour counterpart Jeremy Corbyn \nMr Farron said in the letter: “I am clear that the Liberal Democrats will not vote to trigger Article 50 if the public are not guaranteed a referendum on the outcome of the government’s negotiation, where people can decide to accept the deal the Government makes and leave the European Union, or reject the deal and remain within the European Union. That is a red line.” \nA Liberal Democrat spokesman confirmed to Express.co.uk that Mr Farron would accept a simple majority verdict in another potential referendum, no matter how close. \nIn the past Mr Corbyn, 67, has stated that Labour MPs will not block legislation allowing Mrs May to trigger Article 50. Getty Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has written to his Labour counterpart Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit There is nothing progressive about giving Theresa May a blank cheque to decide what form of Brexit she thinks is best and impose it on the country Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron \nBut he has declined to state whether that would be enforced with a three-line whip, demanding they vote for the measure should the Supreme Court rules the Prime Minister cannot trigger Article 50 without the approval of both the Commons and the Lords. \nIn the letter, Mr Farron wrote: \"I am clear that the Liberal Democrats will not vote to trigger Article 50 if the public are not guaranteed a referendum on the outcome of the Government's negotiation, where people can decide to accept the deal the Government makes and leave the European Union, or reject the deal and remain within the European Union. \n\"That is a red line.
