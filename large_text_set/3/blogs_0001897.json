Bush, delivered a speech yesterday at a fundraiser for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. \nNot one to ignore any headline that mentions Planned Parenthood — much less one that name-drops the daughter of America’s most anti-abortion president in recent memory — evangelist Franklin Graham took to Facebook to voice his discontent. This diatribe should be familiar by now: \nPlanned Parenthood is the #1 abortion provider in the United States. Raising funds for this organization is like raising money to fund a Nazi death camp — like Auschwitz , except for innocent babies in their mother’s wombs! Reports say they perform over 300,000 abortions per year. And this is the organization whose employees were caught on video trying to sell baby body parts over wine. Disgusting. \nFirst of all, the myth that Planned Parenthood profits from “selling” baby parts has been debunked . Secondly, abortions amount to only 3% of the services that Planned Parenthood offers, most of which include breast cancer screenings, STD treatment, pap smears, and prenatal care. If you didn’t know any better, it would be easy to assume that Graham has some kind of issue against women’s health… \nThirdly — and most importantly — even if you believe that abortion is tantamount to murder, it’s still ridiculous (not to mention completely offensive) to liken it to Nazi death camps at Auschwitz. The Nazis were given orders to rid the world of Jews, among other “undesirable” groups, in an effort to create a so-called “master race.” It should go without saying that no one is trying to rid the world of babies, as that would be counter-productive to the future of humanity. \nIf Graham had done any research at all, he’d know that one of the biggest causes of abortion is poverty . \nSurely a man of his means could help do something to alleviate that problem, but that would just make too much sense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:44:41.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
