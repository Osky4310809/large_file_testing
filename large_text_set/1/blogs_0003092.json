Two St. Louis-area women in the arts are fighting to reverse the St. Louis Art Museum’s decision to loan the painting for Donald J. Trump’s inaugural lunch on Jan. 20. Credit George Caleb Bingham, Saint Louis Art Museum George Caleb Bingham’s painting “The Verdict of the People” (1854-1855), which depicts the results of a small-town Missouri election, is in many ways a celebration of democracy. That is why the St. Louis Art Museum made it available on loan as the centerpiece of Donald J. Trump’s inauguration luncheon on Jan. 20. It is also why two St. Louis-area women in the arts are fighting to reverse the museum’s decision. In a petition on Change.org , the art historian Ivy Cooper and the artist Ilene Berman called on the museum to cancel the loan, which was initiated   Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. “We object to the painting’s use as an inaugural backdrop and an implicit endorsement of the Trump presidency and his expressed values of hatred, misogyny, racism and xenophobia,” the petition states. “We reject the use of the painting to suggest that Trump’s election was truly the ‘verdict of the people,’ when in fact the majority of votes — by a margin of over three million — were cast for Trump’s opponent.” Mr. Trump won 56.4 percent of the vote in Missouri, which tends to lean Republican. In the St. Louis metropolitan area, however, Hillary Clinton received the majority of the vote. \n  “Ilene and I reject the use of the painting at the inauguration, as it would serve to represent us — the local St. Louis community and the wider arts community,” Ms. Cooper said in an interview. “We are concerned that the loan of the painting for the inaugural luncheon implies that our local community, and the arts community in general, support the election of Trump.” Brent R. Benjamin, the museum’s director, received the petition last week. On Thursday, he said in an interview that he was scheduling a meeting with Ms. Cooper and Ms. Berman “in the near future.” The petition had about 1,950 signatures. “Clearly there are a range of opinions about the decision to make this loan, and that’s not surprising,” Mr. Benjamin said. “We don’t take a position. When the U.S. Senate requests a loan from the collection, it’s really an honor for the museum to participate in that.” The collections committee of the museum’s board approved the loan on Dec. 6, after Mr. Blunt had visited and worked with a curator to select “The Verdict of the People” from a pool of options. The painting depicts a time when votes took days to count and townspeople gathered to hear the results read aloud. “This seemed topically appropriate,” Mr. Benjamin said of the painting, by one of Missouri’s most treasured artists, who also had a foray in politics as a member of the state house. It is unlikely that the board would reverse its decision, Mr. Benjamin said. “Shipping arrangements have already been made,” he added. He said that he would meet with Ms. Cooper and Ms. Berman because “it’s always good to understand other points of view.” Ms. Cooper said she would be disappointed if the museum moved forward with the loan. “But in any case, I’m extremely gratified by the number of supporters of our petition,” she added. “Art is always implicated in politics, but the situation surrounding the Bingham painting reveals the fact with unusual clarity.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:11:56.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
