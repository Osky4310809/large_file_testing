Sear the Portobello mushrooms in a hot pan until soft, and then make a little pan sauce out of the browned mushroom bits, some minced garlic and shallots, tomato paste, tamari soy sauce, and vegetable stock. Coarse sprinkles of black pepper on the mash are a must. Stuffed sweet potatoes : Roast some whole sweet potatoes until soft. Towards the end of the sweet potato cooking time, roast the chickpeas with olive oil and whatever seasoning you like until crispy. Heat up the cooked grains and stuff them into the cut open sweet potatoes. Put the crispy chickpeas on top and a tangle of chopped greens. Douse the sweet potato with the dressing. Make some soup! Sauté some red onion until soft and blend with the roasted root vegetables, seasoning of your choice (something spicy is great!), a few spoons of the dressing, and vegetable stock. Serve the soup hot with crusty bread, a few extra creamy swoops of the dressing on top, and coarse black pepper. The crispy chickpeas from the sweet potato meal are also delicious on top of a creamy soup like this. Taco night : Sauté some red onion with the black beans, garlic, and spices like cumin or chipotle chili powder. Finish the beans with a big squeeze of lime. Serve the hot beans in warmed corn tortillas with salsa (homemade or store-bought), shredded cabbage, sliced avocado, big drizzles of the creamy garlic dressing, hot sauce, and extra lime wedges. \nWhat would you drizzle this creamy garlic dressing over?
