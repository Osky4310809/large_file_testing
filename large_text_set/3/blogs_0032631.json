In like a, \"congrats on the rest of your burgers continuing to be made with not-fresh meat in a majority of locations a full year from now\" kind of way. \nSEE ALSO: Why does Wendy's want to take spicy chicken nuggets away from us? \nYes, this is good news, but it's really just calling attention to some of the less-than-flattering facts about McDonald's meat. \nWendy's, which prides itself on its \"fresh never frozen\" policy, took note: \n. @McDonalds So you’ll still use frozen beef in MOST of your burgers in ALL of your restaurants? Asking for a friend.\n— Wendy's (@Wendys) March 30, 2017 \nThey replied to McDonald's initial announcement by basically saying \"yeah... and?\"\nIn the fast food wars, there are going to be clear winners and losers in terms of beef freshness. At this moment in history, Wendy's has that winning slot on lock. If you're coming to the fight with anything less than all fresh beef... they're going to mock you. Sorry, I don't make the rules. \nWendy's didn't stop there. Lots of people replied to the initial clapback and it really seemed to add fuel to the fire: \n@realJoshAbraham @McDonalds We'll stick to our fresh beef. They can have those ice chips they're serving.\n— Wendy's (@Wendys) March 30, 2017 \nICE CHIPS? \n@vidagene @McDonalds We didn't come to play, we came to win.\n— Wendy's (@Wendys) March 30, 2017 \nWhoever runs Wendy's Twitter is pretty much setting their keyboard on fire.\nIf the best drama of the day is about fresh vs. frozen, we're here for it.\nWATCH: Samsung has unveiled the new Galaxy S8, and it's beautiful", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T09:55:38.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
