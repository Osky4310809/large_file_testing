And at noon today, with the help of Frank Olivieri, Jr. and Christina Pirello, the fourth annual 2017 Best Vegan Cheesesteak in Philly contest launched with the opening of online voting. \nEveryone can vote once per day per platform. The online ballot is HERE . Additionally, twitter users with a valid account can vote each day with a tweet containing the venue name and the hashtag #vegancheesesteak. See complete 2017 rules here. \nVOTE RANK UPDATE: MARCH 11 - 12:30 p.m. \nThe first 24 hours of voting are done and the race is on! Currently our top 10 among Philly Vegan Cheesesteak Eaters' votes looks like this: \nFrankies on Fairview \nMeanwhile, the top vote-getters in Vegan Cheesesteak Lovers Everywhere are \nBlackbird Pizzeria Wiz Kid The Tasty \nSince I would have expected to see a little more overlap among these, I'll underscore this once for clarity: Philly-area cheesesteak eaters can vote once a day in both the 'Philly' and 'Everywhere' categories. The 'Philly' category is the one from which finalists will be drawn. The 'Everywhere' category, in which anyone anywhere can vote, will determine 'Fan Favorite' and be used to break a tie. Any further clarity needed on this - just . Thanks. \nAs vegan cheesesteak lovers know, this is an exciting time, with 2016 champion (and first-year winner) Blackbird Pizzeria defending the crown against dozens of fine vegan cheesesteaks including several newcomers this year. Philly voters are encouraged to try the sandwiches at as many venues as possible to assure the highest-quality decision-making in the 'Philly' category. Everyone can vote in the 'Everywhere' category, which will serve to break a tie in the final judging. \nVoting results and ranking will be updated on this page every day from March 11 to March 20, when the voting period ends. The top three vote-getters with qualifying sandwiches will advance on to the final round. One voter chosen at random will win a deluxe dinner for 2 at Miss Rachel's Pantry . One twitter voter will be named '2017 Vegan Cheesesteak Superfan' ( see rules ) and will win a prize package including a custom-cooked cheesesteak and more. \nThe Final Judging event will occur on March 23rd at 6:00 p.m. at The Ethical Society (1906 Rittenhouse Square) and will be emceed by Frank Olivieri, Jr, owner of Pat's Steaks, the originator of the cheesesteak sandwich. The March 23rd event will feature vegan cheesesteak sampling by at least five venues. (Yes, we know the 2016 event had just two, and the logistical issues behind that have been dealt with to assure a diversity of sampling options this year.) \nThis event will also feature appetizers by Lenka Zivcovic of The Plough and The Stars, plus special surprises. Advance tickets are $5, or $7 at the door. \nThe top three finalists will have their sandwiches tasted and judged by a panel of 4 esteemed judges who will be named on Monday, March 13. The winner will become the 2017 champion holding the title of Best Vegan Cheesesteak in Philly!
