U.S.-backed Iraqi forces launched a large-scale military operation to dislodge Islamic State militants from the western half of Mosul city on Sunday. Maher Chmaytelli and Isabel Coles Reuters \nFebruary 19, 2017 BAGHDAD AND ERBIL, Iraq — U.S.-backed Iraqi forces on Sunday launched a ground offensive to dislodge Islamic State militants from their remaining stronghold in Mosul, in the western part of the city, and put an end to their ambitions for territorial rule in Iraq. \nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced the start of the offensive in the northern Iraqi city, asking the armed forces to \"respect human rights\" during the battle and to take care of those displaced by the fighting. \nIslamic State militants are essentially under siege in western Mosul, along with an estimated 650,000 civilians, after they were forced out of the eastern part of the city in the first phase of an offensive that concluded last month, after 100 days of fighting. \nUp to 400,000 civilians could be displaced by the offensive as residents of western Mosul suffer food and fuel shortages and markets are closed, United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Lise Grande told Reuters on Saturday. \nIraqi federal police units are leading a northward charge on the Mosul districts that lie west of the Tigris river, aiming to capture Mosul airport, just south of the city, according to statements from the armed forces joint command. How much do you know about Islam and violence? Take the quiz \nThey dashed through several villages, reaching Zakrutiya, a hamlet 5 km (3 miles) south of the airport by the end of the day, the statements said, and captured a power distribution station along the way, killing several jihadists, including snipers. \nThe Rapid Response, an elite Interior Ministry Unit, is advancing alongside the federal police and captured several villages, according to an officer, who said they were largely abandoned. \n\"Mosul would be a tough fight for any army in the world,\" the commander of the U.S.-led coalition forces, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, said in a statement. \nTo date, the coalition has conducted more than 10,000 air strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and trained and equipped more than 70,000 Iraqi forces, the statement said. \nIslamic State has escalated its insurgency in retaliation for the military setbacks that have, over the past year, forced it out of most Iraqi cities it had captured in 2014 and 2015. \nTwo militants blew themselves up in eastern Mosul on Sunday, killing three soldiers and two civilians, and wounding a dozen people, security sources said. \nLEAFLETS \nIraqi planes dropped millions of leaflets on western Mosul warning residents that the battle to dislodge Islamic State was imminent, the Iraqi Defence Ministry said on Saturday. The leaflets told the jihadists to surrender \"or face a fatal end.\" \nCommanders expect the battle to be more difficult than in the east because tanks and armored vehicles cannot pass through its narrow alleyways. \nThe militants have developed a network of passageways and tunnels to enable them to hide and fight among civilians, disappear after hit-and-run operations and track government troop movements, according to residents. \nWestern Mosul contains the old city center, with its ancient souks, Grand Mosque and most government administrative buildings. \nIt was from the pulpit of the Mosul Grand Mosque that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a self-styled \"caliphate\" over parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014. \nThe city, Iraq's second biggest, is the largest urban center captured by Islamic State in both countries and its de facto capital in Iraq. Raqqa is its capital in Syria. \nIslamic State was thought to have up to 6,000 fighters in Mosul when the government's offensive started in mid-October. Of those, more than 1,000 have been killed, according to Iraqi estimates. \nThe remainder now face a 100,000-strong force made up of Iraqi armed forces, including elite paratroopers and police, Kurdish forces and Iranian-trained Shi'ite paramilitary groups. \nThe westward road that links the city to Syria was cut in November by the Shi'ite paramilitary known as Popular Mobilisation. The militants are in charge of the road that links Mosul to Tal Afar, a town they control 60 km (40 miles) to the west. \nCIVILIAN LIVES \nCoalition aircraft and artillery have continued to bombard targets in the west during the break that followed the taking of eastern Mosul. \nThe United States, which has deployed more than 5,000 troops in the fighting, leads an international coalition providing key air and ground support, including artillery fire, to the Iraqi and Kurdish forces. \nIslamic State imposed a radical version of Islam in Mosul, banning cigarettes, televisions and radios, and forcing men to grow beards and women to cover from head to toe. Citizens who failed to comply risked death. \nCapturing Mosul would effectively end the Sunni group's ambitions for territorial rule in Iraq. The militants are expected to continue to wage an insurgency, however, carrying out suicide bombings and inspiring lone-wolf actions abroad.

Medical and humanitarian agencies estimate the total number of dead and wounded - both civilian and military - at several thousand. \n\"The ultimate success of the offensive will be judged not on how many districts and villages are taken back but on how well Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition protect civilians in the coming weeks and months,\" said the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Country Director in Iraq, Wolfgang Gressmann. \"The lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians are on the line.\" (With additional reporting by Stephen Kalin in Erbil; Editing by Janet Lawrence) What'd we miss?
