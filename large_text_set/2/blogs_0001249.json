'You might think that the ground you're standing is solid, but equally it might be soft and make you plunge into the lava. You must be very careful.' Mr Santos used a drone to film his footage from above the lake, alongside four 4K resolution cameras that could handle the scorching conditions around the lake's rim. He said: 'I needed to be so close to monitor the drone, since the heat waves are so, so strong, they could cause it to melt or crash. I had to be very patient.' Mr Santos added: 'Every two or three minutes you can hear a small hiss of pressure beneath the volcano and all of a sudden - you can't predict when - a crack just opens wide. 'Then it's like fireworks - the whole volcano starts bursting with lava into the air.' The Danakil Desert, where the volcano lies, is officially the hottest inhabited place on earth, meaning Mr Santos could only film in the early morning or late at night Mr Santos used a drone to film his footage from above the lake, alongside four 4K resolution cameras that could handle the scorching conditions around the lake's rim The Danakil Desert, where the volcano lies, is officially the hottest inhabited place on earth, meaning Mr Santos could only film in the early morning or late at night. Despite the challenges of filming in such intense heat, Mr Santos is proud to have visited such an epic location on two separate occasions. He said: 'It's a basaltic shield volcano and there's only six in the world. 'This is one of those that you can actually approach. It's an unbelievable experience. 'It still amazes me how nature works and I think it will continue to amaze me.' Little is known about Erta Ale, as the surrounding terrain is some of the most inhospitable on Earth, and the natives are said to be hostile towards visitors. In 2012 a number of tourists were kidnapped, injured and some killed in the area. Mr Santos warns: 'You have to be very careful, because although it's a really beautiful show nature presents you, it's very dangerous' The Erta Ale is a basaltic shield volcano, of which there are only six in the world and one of the few that you can actually approach Mr Santos explains: 'The volcano is quite close to the border with Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia has a very difficult relationship, as it is known. 'Since then, an Ethiopian military camp site was established nearby and you must now always have a military escort with you while you climb up to the volcano. 'But, at least to me, they were extremely friendly and helpful with finding the most secure places to set up the tripods. They have an excellent knowledge about the terrain.' In 2009, BBC TV show The Hottest Place On Earth went there to record a world first 3D laser image of the volcano. Durham University earth scientist Dr Dougal Jerram and a team from the BBC explored the surrounding desert. He later wrote for BBC News: 'Like a true journey to the centre of the Earth, volcanoes provide a unique window into our planet's interior. 'Standing at the lip of the lava lake you can see why the locals see this as 'The Gateway to Hell', as the incandescent bubbling lava lake hisses like some badly burned porridge cauldron, overturning and occasionally belching molten lava.' The volcano's most recent eruption was in November 2008, with additional excavations ordered due to lava flow previously in August 2007 Mr Santos said of the project, 'It's an unbelievable experience It still amazes me how nature works and I think it will continue to amaze me' Little is known about Erta Ale, as the surrounding terrain is some of the most inhospitable on Earth, and the natives are said to be hostile Despite the challenges of filming in such intense heat, Mr Santos is proud to have visited such an epic location on two separate occasions Mr Santos (pictured) said, 'Erta Ale is probably the most overwhelming, unreal and mesmerizing sight one could see in a life time' Share or comment on this article 12", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:00:23.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
