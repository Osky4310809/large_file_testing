The body, which claimed that a monarch, the Alapoje of Alapoje community in Ife, Oba Ademola Ademiluyi, was arrested along with 14 other indigenes, said it was wrong of the police to embark on indiscriminate arrest of Yoruba residents. Vowing to resist further indiscriminate arrests by the police, the group said some of the arrested residents were transferred to the Osun State Police Command headquarters in Osogbo, while other were transferred to the Force Headquarters in Abuja. A statement by the Afenifere, entitled: “Ife Crisis: The Hounding after and Yoruba’s Stand”, urged the Federal Government to call all the stakeholders in the crisis to a meeting and find an amicable solution to it. Recalling that the crisis started when a Hausa resident assaulted a Yoruba woman, the Afenifere said an undergraduate with the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Yekini Saka; Francis Eludoyin, Oshowade Lukman, Sikiru Jimoh, Isaac Omisanmi, and Adigun Osuolale, were arrested, among others. It said, “Leading citizens of Yoruba nation are grieved by the recent disturbance in Ile-Ife, the cradle of Yoruba civilisation. We are concerned that lives were lost on our land as it is not in our character to open our land for bloodletting. The whole world acknowledges that we welcome foreigners and go the extra mile to make them happy. And this explains why our space is hospitable and allows strangers to prosper and feel at home. “In Ife, in particular, the Arewa community has a record of over 80 years’ stay in the ancient city and has never come under attack not even when there were serious disturbances between the local communities. The Sabo area was a safe place to be in those disturbing days. This is why it is very important to interrogate the cause of the recent disturbance. Our way of life is being violently violated with sheer impunity. We shall not take it anymore.” Afenifere also commended the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, for physically going to the scene to quell the conflict. Meanwhile, the Acting Governor of Kaduna State, Barnabas Yusuf-Bala, on Wednesday, met with security chiefs, Yoruba, Igbo and Igala leaders in Kaduna so as to avert a reprisal. The meeting was sequel to the clash between Yoruba and Hausa residents in Ile-Ife. The Kaduna State Police Commissioner, Agyole Abbeh; Garrison Commander, One Mechanised Division, Nigerian Army, Kaduna, Brig.-Gen. Samaila Isah, and other top government functionaries attended the meeting along with the leaders of Yoruba, Igala and Igbo communities in Kaduna. Yusuf-Bala said, “Those trying to incite unnecessary tensions in the state because of what happened in Ile-Ife, Osun State, should desist from circulating videos and images with inciting commentary and calls on citizens for reprisals.” In another development, the senator representing Osun-East senatorial district, Babajide Omoworare, has donated bags of rice, beans and cows to the Hausa community in Ife. Omoworare also donated bags of rice and beans to the Ife Central Working Committee for the Yoruba victims of the clash. The lawmaker, who visited the scene of the incident, pleaded with residents of the town to live in peace. Speaking at the Oba Sijuwade Memorial Hall, Ile-Ife, Omoworare attributed the clash to the non-availability of mechanisms to detect conflicts at early stages. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
