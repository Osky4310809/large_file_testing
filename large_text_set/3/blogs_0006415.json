They have a big event on Sunday, March 12th and if you’re in the area there’s more info available here . \nBut if you simply want to donate to this cause and help some children in need, please feel free to donate here . On a personal note, if there’s one thing I just don’t understand it’s the suffering of children. Anything we can do to ease their pain is a worthy cause and I’ll always support St. Baldrick’s for just that reason. Donate here . \n– John", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:26:23.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
