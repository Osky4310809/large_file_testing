Jouer Cosmetics , the makers of the rose gold lip color that sent beauty vloggers into a frenzy, has busted out yet another glorious hue to keep your pucker poppin’ this spring . This time it’s Papaye, the peachy-metallic color-of-the-moment that’s already been pinned nearly 200k times . Take a look at makeup’s new lip color that’s well on its way to making Lip Kits yesterday’s news. \nPapaye ($18) gives you the VIP treatment with all the hints of pink and metallic shimmer that a pout could want. It’s no wonder the color is selling out faster than we can type “#trending.” \nThe unique, peachy undertones, paired with the glitz of Jouer Cosmetics’ Long-Wear Lip Topper ($16), are a match made in #MOTD heaven. Oh, and did we mention that this shade comes in a creamy, super-smooth liquid lipstick? That means it not only feels ah-mazing on, but it’s lightweight and a cinch to apply. \nDo you think Jouer Cosmetics could have just stolen King Kylie’s throne? Tell us on Pinterest ! \n(Featured photo via @lipstickkitty /Instagram)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T00:59:47.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
