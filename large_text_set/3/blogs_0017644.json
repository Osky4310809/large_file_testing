March 19, 2017 / Posted by: Michael K 23 The Little Professor! \nIf yesterday’s HSOTD, the Echo Mini Piano , turned chirrun into a master pianist, then The Little Professor turned every kid who played with it into Sir Isaac Fucking Newton! Texas Instruments, who later gifted the world with Speak & Spell, released The Little Professor in 1976, and it was apparently the first electronic education toy. If you played with one of these as a kid, this is the part where you let the brats know that in your day, you used your little electronic tablet thing to actually learn shit and you didn’t use it to like a stupid Instagram post starring Kylie Jenner’s double shellacked plastic turkey or chase those Pokemons! And after you do that, turn the water hose on those kids until they get off your lawn.\nUsing The Little Professor was easy, you’d turn it on, choose your difficulty level and then answer the equation he spit up at you. If you got it right, you’d move on to the next one. If you got it wrong, you got two more chances to get it right. If you got it wrong after three tries, The Little Professor would pull an, “ugh, I can’t with your dumb ass, ” and just give you the answer.\nTexas Instruments doesn’t make The Little Professor anymore (they did put out a solar version in the early-aughts), but you can get one on eBay. There’s also a Little Professor app for Android.\n\nI bet if I played with The Little Professor now (that sounded sexy and it didn’t mean to), I’d make him combust with my mathematical knowledge! I’d answer every single equation right the first time, and only because after he hit with me a problem, I’d say to my iPhone, “ Hey, Siri, what’s 3 times 3?” \nPic : Like Totally 80s", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:12:43.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
