Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mother and daughter perished in a horrific house fire in front of her devastated family after trying to save the 11-year-old who went back inside to rescue her pets. \nThe bodies of Alina Kordaszewska, 41, and her youngest child, Emilia, were discovered alongside each other in the youngster’s upstairs bedroom. \nThe fire started when a scented blue candle left on a coffee table set light to a sofa, with flames quickly engulfing the home in Braintree, Essex, just days before Christmas. \nA full inquest into the deaths was held today at Essex Coroner’s Court in Chelmsford.

Milena Kordaszewska with her mum and dad Rafal and Alina Kordaszewska (Photo: SWNS-Cambridge-+44 (0)1179066550) \nAlina’s husband, Rafal, 41, returned from work and had to be restrained by emergency service workers as he desperately tried to get back inside the detached red brick Edwardian property. \nThe home was adorned with a Father Christmas decoration on the outside. \nDetective Inspector Mark Cadd told the inquest Emilia had gone back upstairs, followed by her mother after the fire broke out just before 10.45pm on December 22. \nHe said: “Milena was woken up by her sister who was screaming. \n“She woke up and ran down the stairs and has seen the coffee table and sofa were alight at that stage. The flames were orange and were as tall as her.” \nMilena told investigators she tried to battle the flames but was overcome by thick black smoke and had to leave the house, thinking her younger sister was alongside her. The scene at the house in Braintree town centre, Essex (Photo: SWNS-Cambridge-+44 (0)1179066550) \nThe inquest heard how Milena and her aunt desperately tried to get back inside, with help from brave members of the public. \nDet Insp. Cadd, from Essex Police, added: “They were outside and realised the other two were still inside. \n“Emilia had returned to her bedroom, perhaps to get some pets which she wanted to get out of the fire. \n“A dog managed to get out of the fire but there was a family cat and a number of gerbils or guinea pigs. \n“She returned to her bedroom to save her pets or get something. I believe her mother was looking for her daughter and has gone to get her out.” Firefighters at the scene (Photo: SWNS-Cambridge-+44 (0)1179066550) \nAccording to a fire report into the blaze: “Alina, worried for her daughter, has attempted to assist or save her. \n“In doing so, she as also overcome by smoke inhalation.” \nBoth electronics worker Alina and her daughter died inside the home. \nAlina’s cause of death was given today as inhalation of fumes whilst her daughter died from burns and smoke inhalation. \nMilena, who is studying economics at Plymouth University, and her aunt were both treated for smoke inhalation but were not seriously injured. \nRafal, a shop fitter, chose not to attend this morning but was aware the inquest was being held. Emila Kordaszewska, 12 who died in the fire (Photo: SWNS-Cambridge-+44 (0)1179066550) \nPolice and the fire service carried out a joint investigation into the the blaze and concluded a candle left burning in the lounge started the fire. \nThe inquest heard today that flames ripped through the house, shattering windows on both floors. \nIt was so ferocious that firefighters were only able to fight the blaze from the outside. \n“It was a very severe fire”, Divisional Officer Mark Earwicker told the inquest. \nThe battle against the fire was made even trickier because the electricity supply to the home was still live, making it highly dangerous during the first stages of the rescue efforts. \nOnce fire crews managed to get into the building they found Alina and Emilia in an upstairs bedroom at the back of the house. \nThe surviving family members told investigators candles were regularly burned in the home. \nThe “very severe” fire started in the downstairs lounge, with the flames and gases spreading upstairs into the upstairs bedrooms. Crews survey the wreckage of the home last year (Photo: SWNS-Cambridge-+44 (0)1179066550) \nFirefighters concluded the cause of the blaze was accidental due to candles in the lounge area which caused a two-seater sofa to catch light. \nChristmas decorations were also considered as a possible cause but there was no evidence to support the theory they had triggered the blaze. \nSenior Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray concluded both deaths were accidental. \nTalking of Alina’s death, she said: “It was the most tragic of accidents and how sad it is indeed what happened is that she went upstairs to her daughter’s bedroom in order to try to save her. \n“She clearly was a much-loved mother and wife.” The investigation of the scene last Christmas (Photo: SWNS-Cambridge-+44 (0)1179066550) \nMrs Beasley-Murray said Emilia’s death was “another tragic accident”. \nNeighbour Yasmin Leigh, 24, spoke of her horror the following day and how she tried to calm Milena as she wailed for her mum. \nThe graphic designer said: \"We were watching a film last night and there was a massive bang and then someone screaming, it was horrendous. \n\"I came running out and this young girl was covered in soot and crying for her mum and dad. \n\"She just kept saying 'they're going to be alright aren't they, tell me my mum and dad are going to be alright'.

The scene on December 21 last year (Photo: SWNS-Cambridge-+44 (0)1179066550) \n\"We grew up together as children and married when we were 21. We had our first daughter, Milena, 18, then our youngest daughter, Emila. \n\"We came to England ten years ago and moved to Braintree. Alina was a very quiet person but had lots of friends at her workplace, Tyco Electronics, where she had worked for nine years. \n\"Emila went to John Ray Junior School and had started at Notley High School in September - she had lots of friends and she was always trying to help people. \n\"Alina and Emila were very much loved and we will miss them greatly. We would like to thank everyone for their support and everything they have done for us. \n\"We have had so much support from our friends and the community; we are overwhelmed by their generosity. Friends have also brought us clothes and food and have helped us with housing.\" Read More Two huge mountainside blazes in Welsh valleys were started DELIBERATELY - fire chiefs confirm \nThe fire was extinguished by 1.24am and firefighters remained at the property dampening down 'hotspots’. \nDavid Conway, headteacher at Notley High School in Braintree, said: \"Emila Kordaszewska was a likeable and popular member of her teaching and tutor groups and will be greatly missed. \n\"As others have said this news is all the more distressing so close to Christmas. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Emilia.\" \nThe youngster's tutor, Martin Higgon said: \"Emila was a delightful, friendly and positive student who was always smiling and was well liked by everyone in her tutor group. \n\"She had settled in well during her first term at Notley High School, even contributing to a week of assemblies as an active member of our popular action equality group. \n\"She will be sorely missed and long remembered by those of us who knew her.\" \nA fundraising page was set up to by Milena's friend, Sophie King, to support the family with nearly £25,000 donated. \nAfter the blaze the town’s MP James Cleverly spoke of his shock at the double death. \nHe said: “It is such sad and shocking news when members of a young family lose their life in any circumstances and at any time but obviously under these circumstances, just before Christmas, it’s absolutely tragic.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:27:02.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
