The filing was first reported by FlightGlobal . \nIn the filing, American said its objection is based on ”the failure of the Civil Aviation Administration of China to make commercially viable slots at Chinese airports available to American and other U.S. carriers on a reciprocal basis.” \nAmerican was awarded the rights to operate a daily flight from Los Angeles to Beijing Capital International Airport by the DOT in November, beating out rival Delta Air Lines for the coveted slots. American Airlines beats out Delta for LA to Beijing flight \nUnder the current bilateral aviation agreement, U.S. carriers are limited to a total of 154 weekly flights to China. \nAmerican currently operates 35 weekly flights from the U.S. to China. That includes daily services from DFW and Chicago to both Beijing and Shanghai, as well as a daily flight from Los Angeles to Shanghai. \n“Even though American was recently awarded the U.S.-China frequencies and necessary exemption authority from the (DOT) to inaugurate Los Angeles-Beijing service, American cannot serve this route without slots in Beijing,” American wrote. “To date, the (Civil Aviation Administration of China) has refused to provide any slots to allow American to exercise its bilaterally conferred rights.” \nAmerican said the Chinese government did not even offer landing and takeoff slots during the midnight and sunrise hours, a commercially unfavorable window that has been offered to U.S. carriers in the past. \nAir China currently operates three daily flights between Los Angeles and Beijing, the only current nonstop service between the two destinations. By denying American slots at the Beijing airport, the Fort Worth-based carrier said the Chinese government “has acted to preserve Air China’s nonstop monopoly on this route, to the detriment of the U.S. traveling public, U.S. carriers, and the U.S. government.” \nAmerican said the recent denial falls into a pattern of the Chinese aviation administration obstructing U.S. carriers’ access to its airports. American listed three other instances, including an ongoing refusal to award United Airlines space at the Shanghai airport. \nIn its filing, American said it plans to continue to object to any requests to serve U.S. routes by Chinese carriers until it is granted commercially viable takeoff and landing times at the Beijing airport.
