PUBLISHED: 13:20, Tue, Mar 21, 2017 | UPDATED: 14:05, Tue, Mar 21, 2017 \nThe Tokyo premier said he wanted to see Brussels “forge through with integration” despite Britain’s decision to leave as he gave a vocal thumbs up to the EU project. \nIn a series of closely choreographed remarks he heaped lavish praise on the bloc and claimed it was bringing “various challenges under control” including migration, populism and terror. \nHe made his remarks as eurocrats look to speed up the signing of a trade deal with Japan in light of Brexit and Theresa May’s plan to pursue a global agenda for an independent Britain.

Against this backdrop I am greatly encouraged to see the EU bringing various challenges under control and as a global player continuing to show a strong will to contribute to the maintenance and strengthening of the international order. \n“Japan supports a strong Europe and a strong Europe will be good and conducive for the world, Japan and Europe.

Going forward Japan, the EU and the US should hand in hand work to maintain and reinforce the free and open international order.” \nThe Japanese premier’s omission of the UK from his list of global players seemed like a pointed snub over Brexit, which he then reinforced by saying he did not want to see Britain’s decision to leave negatively impact on the rest of the EU. \nHe said: “As for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, of which the negotiation will be started soon, ensuring transparency and productivity as well as providing for a transition period will be important for all the relevant parties. \n“I hope that the EU and the UK will continue your close partnership as the Brexit process moves forward.
