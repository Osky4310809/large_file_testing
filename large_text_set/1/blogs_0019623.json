Some of the spices and the name “yakhni” are Kashmiri but this dish is not made in Kashmir but in modern-day Uttar Pradesh – one of the theories about the origin of this pulau was that it was made in the palace of the ruler of Oudh (modern-day Lucknow) by Kashmiri cooks in the middle of the 19th century. This is a wonderful one pot dish to make – if you omit the fresh green chillies or add a couple of mild chillies, it is great for the entire family as children can also eat this easily. Use bone in chicken thighs for preparing the stock in which to cook the rice – don’t try and make it with boneless chicken or breast, as the stock will have absolutely no flavour. The essence of this dish is the yakhni – the delicate flavour of the stock which is absorbed by the rice. The pale colour of the pulao is very deceptive; it is packed with flavour and spices. \nFeeds family of 6 or 4 hungry adults basmati rice 400g onions 2 medium, finely sliced oil 3 tbsp skinless chicken thighs 1kg, bone in, cut in half – ask your butcher to do this for you if you don’t have a cleaver fresh green chillies 2 or 3 (optional) spice bag (see below) mint a sprig, for garnish (optional) \nFor the spice bag garlic 6 cloves, cut in half fresh ginger 5cm, cut into thick slices green cardamom 6 pods cinnamon stick 2 pieces, 2½cm each black cardamom 1 pod bay leaves 3 or 4 fennel seeds 2 heaped tbsp whole coriander seeds 2 level tsp \nStart by washing the basmati rice, then leave it covered in water to soak with half a teaspoon of salt. Place all the spice bag ingredients in an infuser bag or square of muslin or other clean coth and tie up tightly with kitchen string. \nNext, fry the sliced onions in 3 tablespoons of oil till they are caramelised and golden brown. Remove the onions from the oil to prevent them from burning and spread them on a plate. Keep the heat on medium high and add the chicken to the pan and seal it in the hot oil. Return half the onions to the pan together with the spice bag (the bag should be tied securely so it does not open in the cooking process). The other half of the browned onions will be used as a garnish at the end. Add enough water to cover the chicken and season with salt (just as a rough guide, I usually use 2¼ teaspoons of salt). Once the water is boiling, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid, and leave it to cook for 20 minutes. Half way through, check the chicken to make sure it is not falling apart! \nAfter the chicken is cooked, remove the chicken gently with a slotted spoon and put it on a plate, in a single layer as much as possible to prevent the meat from coming off the bone. You will need approximately 960ml of yakhni for the 400g of rice. Reduce the stock or add some water if required to make it 960ml. My grandmother would squeeze the spice bag at this stage to get the last bit of flavour out of the spices. You can try that too, as long as you can do it without bursting the bag! You can remove the spice bag now. It has done its job. \nReturn the 960ml yakhni back to the pan. After that, take the rice out of the water it was soaking in and add to the stock, together with the chicken and green chillies if you are adding any. \nPut the stock with the rice and chicken on medium-high flame. Once the stock is boiling, lower the flame, cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer. Check the rice often to see when the stock has been absorbed. The rice should be cooked but al dente (if that makes sense!). \nAt this point, remove the pan from direct heat and put the flame on a low setting and put the pan on an iron plate – a flat pan or tawa, or the closest thing you have to a tawa in your kitchen. The aim is for the heat to be diffused. If you do not have anything appropriate you could put the rice pot in a low oven for 10 minutes. Once you remove the rice from the heat source cover the top with a kitchen towel and leave the rice undisturbed for 10 minutes. Then serve garnished with the caramelised brown onions and sprig of mint. \nAs an accompaniment you could serve yakhni pulao with a raita or a salad.

Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Observer \nThis pasta is a complete revelation. The sauce is magically made from the pasta water and tomatoes as the pasta cooks all in one pan. No fuss, one pan and a killer bowl of pasta. \nPasta and gluten sometimes get a bad press. I think there is a time and place for a good bowl of pasta – saying that, I opt for interesting pastas as often as I do the traditional kind. Try corn, chickpea or buckwheat spaghetti – they are gluten-free, all have incredible individual flavours and make a welcome change if pasta is a staple in your house. \nThe key to this recipe is to measure your water carefully and to use the right pan: you need a large shallow saute pan or a casserole large enough to fit the pasta lying down. A large deep frying pan or wok would work well too. \nServes 4 generously", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T10:14:34.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
