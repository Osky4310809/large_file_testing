Here's what you need to know!\n\nRene Ritchie has been covering Apple and the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial director for Mobile Nations, analyst for iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him on Snapchat, Instagram, or Twitter @reneritchie.\n\nTwo items have been high on App Store wish lists for a while now. Developers have wanted to be able to respond to App Store review and customers have wanted some control over how and even if developers prompt them for reviews. Well, with iOS 10.3 and macOS Sierra 10.12.4, Apple is checking those wishes off the list — but it's how the company is doing it that'll matter.\nHow will the new review prompts work? Apple will be providing a new API for app review prompts. Instead of a pop-up that boots you out into the App Store app, you'll be able to give your review in-line, from an embedded App Store review sheet. It's similar to how you can quickly send an email from an app without getting booted into the Mail app and having to find your way back. Developers can also prompt for review from any place within the app, from right at launch to right after you post a photo or win a challenge, for example.\nWhat's to stop developers from prompting all the time? In exchange for the new power, though, Apple's requiring new responsibility. Namely, developers can only prompt for review a maximum of three times a year. That's per 365 days, not per calendar year. Also, developers can't prompt again if you've already given a review during that period.\nCan the prompt do anything more than as for a review? It doesn't look like it. Developers may have others ways of offering support or additional services, but not through the review prompt.\n@reneritchie The way the review prompt is currently shown, there's no option for getting support instead of leaving a bad rating.\n— David Barnard (@drbarnard) January 24, 2017 Can the prompts be disabled? You bet. Apple's adding a system-wide toggle to turn review prompts off. It'll be left on to start but can be turned off at any time if any user finds the process disruptive or annoying.\nWhat about review responses, how will those work? Apple is also going to start letting developers respond to reviews. Like with reviews, developers will be able to edit their responses. So, if they have updated information or simply want to change something they later regret sending, they'll be able to do it. Users will also be able to mark responses as helpful or unhelpful, and report them, just like reviews.\n@reneritchie Key concerns will be the ability to provide useful replies - like including a documentation link.\n— Greg Pierce (@agiletortoise) January 24, 2017 Will that make the App Store a tech support channel? Fair question. Since developers will be able to respond to reviews customers may start to expect responses. That could easily turn App Store reviews into an additional support channel developers may feel pressure to monitor, which means it'll require more time and resources. Indie devs will need to figure out how to make the benefits exceed the costs in that regard.\n@reneritchie Conscientious developers with good customer service will benefit from being able to respond to complaints.\n— Jean MacDonald (@macgenie) January 24, 2017 @reneritchie simply put, we won't conversate within a review thread. We will direct them to the proper channel such as an email....\n— Dexter Talbert (@DexterTalbert) January 24, 2017 Any changes to how the App Store shows reviews? Nope. No changes to the current filtering system, so reviews and responses to older versions of the app won't show up unless a user expressly taps or clicks to see reviews from all versions.\nThat's going to create some tension between developers who want new reviews for new versions and that hard 3-times per year limit on prompts.\nBottom line it for me? The App Store has been making steady improvements since senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, took over sole responsibility for it in late 2015. While a lot remains to be addressed, things like submission turn around and abandoned apps have all gotten batter. Now, review prompts and responses.\nGoogle Play Store has offered the ability for developers to respond to reviews for a long time now and, overall, everyone seems happy with the dynamic. Time — and the public availability of the new features — will tell how well it works on the App Store and Mac App Store, but I'm optimistic.\nAny new feature invites the potential for new issues, but overall I think this will provide customers and developers of good intent a powerful new way to interact and that's good for everyone.\nReviews are a big component of the front-facing part of the App Store experience. They're important to how many people browse and ultimately choose apps.\nAnd now, developers are part of that process as well.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:07:20.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
