Ruby Sahali Tan (Photo from the official website of the House of Representatives at www.congress.gov.ph) \nMANILA — State prosecutors have formally charged Tawi-Tawi Rep. Ruby \nTan before the Sandiganbayan for allegedly violating asset disclosure rules when she was vice-governor from 2008 to 2013. \nThe Office of the Ombudsman Mindanao filed on Dec. 19 six counts of violation of Section 8 of the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees against Tan. ADVERTISEMENT \nIn 2008, Tan allegedly failed to file her 2007 Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) under oath, according to the charge sheets. \nFor the next four years, she allegedly failed to file her SALNs for the years 2008 to 2011 under oath and on time. In 2013, she also failed to file her 2012 SALN within the period provided by law. \nProsecutors recommended that bail be fixed at P10,000 for each count, or a total of P60,000. \nUnder Section 8 of the Code of Conduct, public officials are required to disclose their family’s business interests and political connections under oath. The rule also mandates that SALNs be filed on or before April 30 each year. \nThe Oct. 17 resolution finding probable cause to criminally charge Tan also contained a warning by Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales for the province’s Human Resource Management Office to comply with the period required to submit copies of the SALNs of officials and employees. She warned that “failure to do so shall be dealt with accordingly.” \nSahali Tan was one of the prominent politicians from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao who were indicted over the violation of SALN rules in recent months. \nThe Ombudsman suspended Maguindanao Vice-Governor Lester Sinsuat in October for simple negligence. Sinsuat was also indicted for perjury for failing to disclose his ownership of five agricultural lands, two commercial properties, and one residential lot. \nShe also imposed administrative sanctions on Sulu Governor Abdusakur Tan II, his father and former vice-governor Abdusakur Tan, Maimbung mayor Samuel Tan, and former Lugus mayor Al-Zhudurie Asmadun.
