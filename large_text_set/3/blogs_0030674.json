(Baltimore Sun video) \nBaltimore Orioles beat writers Eduardo Encina and Jon Meoli on starting pitcher Kevin Gausman being made the Opening Day starter. (Baltimore Sun video) Caption Remembering the 1997 Orioles \nThe 1997 Orioles (98-64) were just the sixth club in big league history to go wire-to-wire. \nThe 1997 Orioles (98-64) were just the sixth club in big league history to go wire-to-wire. Jon Meoli on Monday, manager Buck Showalter provided a glimpse at just how complicated roster construction can be in the final week before the season.\nOn his own merits, Mancini, one of the top prospects in the Orioles ' system, would be a lock to make the team. He has a .357/.410/.643 batting line with three home runs, seven doubles, and 13 RBIs in 56 at-bats this spring. He has put together some of the club’s most competitive plate appearances all month long, and fills a need as a right-handed bat who can hit lefties. \nYet whether he stays in Norfolk after Friday’s exhibition or comes to Baltimore is still unsettled. \n“He’s made himself a worthy consideration, so we’ll see what the next few days bring,” Showalter said. “There’s some things in the hopper that can help or hinder that. \n“This time of year, there’s guys where people are having to kind of show their hand, so to speak. There’s three or four guys who came across the waiver yesterday. There’s a lot of moving parts there. We’ve got to stay on top of it, because there’s going to be somebody that’s available this time of year you’re going to be really glad you got — or wish you had. [Executive vice president Dan Duquette] has got a lot of things going on — we’ve got to satisfy the Rule 5. We kind of know where [Anthony] Santander is headed. But Trey has done his part.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:34:26.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
