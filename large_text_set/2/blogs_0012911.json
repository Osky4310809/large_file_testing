Canada is listed as one of five countries working on human intelligence parts of the operation however there are no specifics on which parts of the operation, if any, Canada was involved in.\nThe Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Communications Security Establishment Canada, the Department of National Defence and the Department of Global Affairs did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\nChristian Alminana / Associated Press French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen on Feb. 13 2017. These revelations come amidst claims by the U.S. intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The orders are all marked “NOFORN”, meaning they are supposed to be restricted to U.S. eyes only so no potential allies are offended. Leaked documents showing Canadian spying on allies have caused significant diplomatic issues before.\nIn 2013, documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden showed that the Communications Security Establishment Canada spied on Brazil’s mining and energy ministry in an attempt to gain economic intelligence. At the time, NDP leader Tom Mulcair said the revelations gave Canada “a black eye in the world.”\nRelated NSA leaks reveal Canadian spies targeted Brazil’s Mines and Energy Ministry: report U.S. counterintelligence agencies have intercepts between Russian officials and Trump associates America’s intelligence agencies outplay the White House and reveal power of the Deep State Economic intelligence was also a focus of the spying during France’s 2012 election. Agents were asked to answer questions about non-ruling political parties and candidates including: “What are their opinions on the German model of export-led growth?” A 2012 document, marked “SECRET”, that Wiklieaks previously released, tasks U.S. intelligence with compiling information on brewing export deals or export contracts in France worth $200 million or more.\nIn addition to Canada, New Zealand, Great Britain, and Australia are all listed under a section indicating which countries are assisting with the “HUMINT” or human intelligence aspect of the operation. Those four countries, along with the United States, make up the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance.\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/339539968/2012-CIA-France-Election \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:25:34.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
