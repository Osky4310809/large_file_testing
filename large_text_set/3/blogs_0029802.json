With so many teams needing quarterbacks heading into the 2017 season and the likes of Brian Hoyer, Josh McCown, and Mike Glennon in a position to have starting QB jobs, maybe Favre is teasing teams by flaunting that he still has a powerful arm at 47-years-old.\nOn Wednesday, Atlanta Falcons cornerback Robert Alford invited Favre to help him train at Traction Sports Performance in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The 11-time Pro Bowl and Super Bowl-winning quarterback showed that he still can sling bullets. \nEven in khakis. \nHad the G.O.A.T. Brett Favre out throwing today. I asked him to come out retirement to throw a pick to me. J/P cool guy… #TAT pic.twitter.com/FljsvBSIXh \n— Robert Alford (@rockorocky) March 22, 2017 \n\nThere were definitely some lasers that you wouldn’t want to get in front of. \nWas there some inaccurate darts? Sure, but it’s Brett Favre, the career leader in interceptions (336), and the guy hasn’t played in the NFL since 2010. \nNo word on whether the Jets were in the building scouting Favre. \n[ SBNation ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:44:48.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
