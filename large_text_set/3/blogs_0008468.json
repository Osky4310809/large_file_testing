La Asociación Mexicana de Árbitros no se hará presente en la #Jornada10 de #LigaMX , luchando por el #Respeto dentro del Terreno de Juego — AMA Árbitros (@AMArbitros) March 11, 2017 \nThe league announced Friday that Club America center back Pablo Aguilar will miss 10 matches and Toluca forward Enrique Triverio is out for eight games after each was involved in incidents with referees during their midweek Copa MX contests. \nAguilar made contact with the official after America's 1-0 defeat to Tijuana on Wednesday, while Triverio shoved the ref during Toluca's loss to Morelia. El Gremio Arbitral reprueba los actos de Pablo Aguilar y Enrique Triverio, basta de agresiones. #CopaMX #CopaCoronaMX #UnidosPorUnBienComún pic.twitter.com/WoVAlQCQbM — AMA Árbitros (@AMArbitros) March 9, 2017 \nThe referee's union came out strongly against both players and reports indicated they planned a strike were the players not given hefty bans. The bans announced Friday apparently are not enough for the officials, though it's unclear whether or not Luis Enrique Santander, who is set to call Friday's game between Veracruz and Puebla, is still at the Estadio Luis Fuente. \nThat stadium will not have any fans in it Friday, with Veracruz serving a one-match stadium ban after its supporters clashed with Tigres fans during the teams' meeting on Feb. 17. \nWhile the Aguilar and Triviero incidents took place in the cup, the committee announced that both players would serve their bans in league play. That will keep Aguilar out the rest of the regular season and the first two playoff matches should America qualify, while Triverio will be out the rest of the season. \nHis teammate, Rubens Sambueza also will be out the rest of the year. Sambueza was suspended indefinitely earlier this week after his tackle on Chivas' Isaac Brizuela injured the winger and saw Sambueza sent off. Like Triverio, his ban also is eight games. \nLeon midfielder Andres Andrade also was suspended for the midweek Copa MX game after his tackle injured America's Renato Ibarra during last weekend's league draw but the committee ruled that his tackle was accidental and declined to take further action.
