If it wasn’t for Street Fighter II , the fighting game genre as we know today wouldn’t exist. You would think a classic game like this has been dissected every way imaginable by the fighting game community. However, someone has discovered combos for SFII that haven’t been seen before.\nThese combos were unearthed by Desk , who is “the world’s greatest fighting game combo technician” (according to EuroGamer ). The combos are technically not supposed to be possible. However, thanks to a glitch that has been in SFII since the beginning, they are indeed possible.\nIn the game, once you knock down an opponent with a sweep, you aren’t supposed to be able to follow up with a combo. Other Capcom fighting games let you do this, but not SFII . As you can see in the video below, Desk is doing combos after sweeping. This is because of the glitch, but it isn’t universal to every character in the game.\nThis on the ground (OTG) glitch can only be done on Vega. Desk credits Japanese fighting game player TZW with first performing this glitch “back in the days when combo videos only existed on VHS.” Desk began to play around with the glitch to see what he could do with it. Because we now live in the age of YouTube, he can show the world exactly how the glitch works.\nPulling the glitch off is tricky in and of itself. However, Desk had to also contend with the fact that Vega was one of the game’s original bosses — meaning he had to manipulate the CPU-controlled Vega so that he could get him into the right position to perform the “falling into the corner pause” which is crucial for getting the glitch to work.\n“This meant that I had to slowly learn, as much as is possible, to manipulate the actions of CPU controlled Claw,” says Desk in the video’s description. “As many of these combos require pretty exact screen spacing in order to take advantage of that ‘falling into the corner pause’ at specific points, this AI manipulation was vital.”\nFor a more detailed breakdown of the glitch, make sure to read EuroGamer ‘s article on it. It is a fascinating read, especially if you’re an old-school Street Fighter II fan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:18:47.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
