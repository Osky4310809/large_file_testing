File   An alleged leader of the New People's Army (NPA) was arrested last Sunday in Caloocan City. A report from the Criminal and Investigation Detection Group (CIDG) on Sunday detailed that the CIDG-National Capital Region (CIDG-NCR), which led the operation along with the Army's Intelligence and Security Group, served a warrant of arrest for double murder and multiple attempted murder against Ferdinand Castillo. He was arrested at a convenience store in Sta. Quiteria in Caloocan City. Taken from him was a .45 caliber pistol with five ammo as well as assorted IDs. The CIDG said that a case of violation of Republic Act 10591 or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act will be filed against him. Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), however, said that Castillo is not an NPA leader but their campaign officer in Metro Manila. Bayan and rights monitoring group Karapatan also insisted that the arrest was illegal as Castillo was handcuffed and blindfolded for four hours, and then brought to a safe house. The groups added that Castillo was interrogated by suspected Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP) operatives before he was brought to the CIDG office at Camp Crame in Quezon City at 9 p.m. on Sunday. Early Monday, Castillo called the Bayan National Office to relay his situation and request for support. The National Union of the Peoples' Lawyers, Karapatan and Bayan are currently assisting him.
