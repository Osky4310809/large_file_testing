Over the summer, we carefully obsessed over an exhibition of his work titled “Portraits 2013-2016,” which was a summation of his intimate shots of pretty much every rapper in the game. A similar subject is brought to light in “Life’s Boring,” a new zine from the photographer that features never-before-seen shots of (you guessed it) nearly every rapper in the game.\nThe zine, the title of which could not be more ironic, stars everyone from Drake to Childish Gambino to Tyler, the Creator to 21 Savage among its pages. Also included in the zine are illustrations from graphic designer Irwan Awalludin, a frequent collaborator with Rae Sremmurd.\nThe “Life’s Boring” zine will launch in February. Stay tuned to Gunner Stahl’s online store for more information.\nFollow Gunner on Instagram right here .\nIn other music news, Big Sean has shared a truly hilarious music video for his new single “Moves.” Watch it in all its big-bootied glory right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T14:21:07.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
