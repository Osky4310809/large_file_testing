What sounds like a Slash guitar intro from one of the recent shows, is actually the introduction solo to 'Welcome to the Jungle' from the Tokyo December 10th, 1988 show! Discovered it recently, but this really sounds like the opening riff of 'Chinese Democracy' to me. Please take a listen.\" \nYou can take a listen to the both tracks below.
