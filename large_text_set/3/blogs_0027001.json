[Photo/Xinhua] \nPremier suggests China, Australia explore new areas to aid growth \nPremier Li Keqiang said he is confident that China and Australia will work together and jointly help to counter global instability through steady development and cooperation in a signed newspaper article on Wednesday. \n\"We have seen in practice how the trend of economic globalization has become closely interconnected with, even inseparable from, peace, development and cooperation,\" he said in the article, titled \"We want to work with you for progress and peace\" and published in The Australian. \nLi arrived in Australia's capital, Canberra, on Wednesday night, kicking off official visits to Australia and New Zealand, the first trip by a Chinese premier to the two Oceanian countries in 11 years. \nLi said China and Australia have gradually built up trust and have properly managed disagreements in the spirit of equality and mutual respect over the past 45 years, rising above differences in national conditions and systems. \nThe premier suggested there is more cooperation to be explored in new areas such as industrial capacity and third-party markets, energy and mining technologies, infrastructure and agriculture and animal husbandry, which will bring more benefits to residents of the two nations and help boost world economic growth. \n\"I am fully confident that China and Australia will continue to move forward in our own way while working with each other, and jointly help to counter global instability with the stability that is created through our steady development and cooperation,\" he wrote. \n\"China and Australia should follow the region's trend of peace, development and cooperation, join hands to take concrete actions and send positive signals to stabilize market expectations, convey confidence and contribute our share to the region and beyond,\" he added. \nThis year marks the China-Australia Year of Tourism. The premier said he hopes both sides will take this as an opportunity to further facilitate travel between the two nations. \nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a statement on his official website ahead of Li's trip that he welcomed the visit, which \"will highlight Australia's strong economic relationship with China and mutual commitment to encouraging trade and investment in our region\". \n\"Both our economies are in the midst of important transitions, creating new opportunities for collaboration in services, innovation and investment. Premier Li and I will announce the next stage of ChAFTA's evolution to respond to these emerging opportunities,\" he said. \nSu Hao, a professor of Asia-Pacific studies at China Foreign Affairs University, said China and Australia share broad common interests in multilateral regional economic mechanisms such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. \n\"This is especially important to boost regional economic integration to tackle moves toward protectionism,\" he said. \n\"Maritime security, such as search and rescue operations and fighting piracy, is another area where the two countries can work together,\" Su said. \nmojingxi@chinadaily.com.cn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:26:35.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
