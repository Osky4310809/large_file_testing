And surprise, surprise, it’s Emma Stone for her work in the upcoming biopic , Battle of the Sexes . If you caught La La Land or any other recent Stone flick, for that matter, then you know Emma’s acting chops are seriously on-point. But her latest transformation into the ’70s tennis champ is going to be next-level good, even for her.\nThe latest news is that this film is out September 22, and this is important because this date makes it Oscars-eligible. So we can officially start crossing our fingers and toes for the 28-year-old actress. Fresh off her recent sweep of best actress nods from the Golden Globes, SAG Awards, and the Academy Awards, Emma’s certainly in-demand these days. And while it seems a ways off, her appearance in this biopic will be her first onscreen spot since La La Land hit theaters.\nWE HAVE A RELEASE DATE FOR BATTLE OF THE SEXES!!! SEPTEMBER 22 #emmastone #stevecarrell #battleofthesexes #littlemisssunshine \nA post shared by Emma Stone News (@emilystonenews) on Mar 21, 2017 at 12:16pm PDT \nThere’s no doubt that this biopic has the makings of an Oscar winner. Emma is staring opposite the one and only, Steve Carrell, who will harness the role of Wimbledon-champ Bobby Riggs. Also, biopics are total Oscar bait.\nBattle of the Sexes (2017) Directors: Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Faris Writer: Simon Beaufoy Stars: Emma Stone, Elisabeth Shue, Steve Carell #EmmaStone #SteveCarell #JonathanDayton #ValerieFaris #Movie #Film #BattleOfTheSexesMovie #BattleOfTheSexes #2017 \nA post shared by ✨ E a R t H ✨ (@earthward09) on May 4, 2016 at 6:16am PDT \nThen, there’s also the fact that Little Miss Sunshine ‘s Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris directed it. So yeah, we’d feel comfortable betting on this A-list packed production.\nFor those unfamiliar with the story, the biopic chronicles the 1973 competition between 29-year-old Billie Jean King and 55-year-old veteran athlete Bobby Riggs as the two duke it out in a male-female tennis battle.\nEmma’s been vocal about the physical demands of playing a world-renowned athlete, admitting she packed on 15-pounds of muscle for the role . Whew , that’s impressive!\nAlright folks, go ahead and mark your calendars for Sept. 22. It’ll be here before you know it, and we can guarantee you won’t want to miss this sure-to-be-nominated flick!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T07:56:00.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
