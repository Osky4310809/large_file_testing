Now it’s more about the whole team, the way we create chances and defend as a unit. \n\"We need everybody. That’s a good thing. It is always better to have a good unit than be reliant on one or two players. \n“People said when Phillipe Coutinho went out of the team [with a November injury that kept him sidelined until last Wednesday] it was going to be a big blow, but we dealt with it. Sadio Mane has gone to the Africa Cup of Nations, but we have more than enough players to help each other out.” Suarez was European football's joint-top scorer in 2013-14 with 31 league goals...

First, it comes off the post, then it comes off the bar. That’s the only way they could score. It’s a sour feeling. But we played well. \n\"They threw everything they could at us. We still created chances on the counter-attack but unfortunately we couldn’t score the second goal, which would have killed the game. \n“We set up to try to win games. Against a team a team like United [on their own patch], that’s not always as easy as when you play at home. But we played our football. It’s a massive step if everyone is disappointed when you draw 1-1 at Old Trafford.” James Milner's first-half penalty had Liverpool on course to beat arch-rivals United...

I always want to play, but it’s about making sure you stay ready. \n“At a club like Liverpool, it is normal there is going to be competition for every single place and there’s only one keeper who can play.” poll loading Who will finish higher this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:48:00.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
