The order is intended to \"improve the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of the executive branch.\" \n“This order requires a thorough examination of every executive department and agency to see where money is being wasted, how services can be improved and whether programs are truly serving American citizens,” Trump said at the White House. “Based on this input, we will develop a detailed plan to make the federal government work better, reorganizing, consolidating and eliminating where necessary. In other words, making the federal government more efficient and very, very cost productive. So we’re going to do something, I think, very, very special.” . @POTUS w his cabinet watching, signed an exec order that requires thorough exam of every executive department & agency pic.twitter.com/ugjgvCGAfy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:16:09.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
