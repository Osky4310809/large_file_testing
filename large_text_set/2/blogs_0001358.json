Our aim is to, if all performances go well, we will get a win. \n\"Absolutely, we can win a match. Our preparations for this game have been much better than last year. Certainly the investment from the Scottish Rugby Union's been huge. \n\"We've had games against Lichfield, Harlequins, Wales, and played two Rugby World Cup play-offs against Spain, so we've had a lot of games building up to this championship.
