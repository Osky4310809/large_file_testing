There's a sporting situation that's more important. \n\"There are certain commitments the players must take into account. I back their decision 100 per cent.\" \nAsked for his view on Ronaldo's remarks shortly after he collected his trophy, Luis Enrique replied: \"I'm very lucky - I haven't seen any TV for a week.\" \nThe players' absence came during a difficult week for Barca, in which Pique has once again caused a storm with his criticism of officials following some controversial decisions in the games against Athletic and Villarreal. \n\"It's Pique's opinion - he's an adult and he knows what he should say,\" Luis Enrique said of the centre-back's frustrated remarks. \"In any case, I'm happy with him as a footballer, he's a key player for us. \n\"Everyone has a way of expressing themselves. It's very easy to complain and to cry about this. \n\"I've spoken to Gerard about a lot of things. It's a personal opinion. I think what the coach and the club say has to be clear. It's not my decision. It's tough when you see situations as we've seen in the last couple of weeks but the goal is for the referees to make the right decisions, as few mistakes as possible, and put on a show.\" \nBarca trail 2-1 from the first leg at San Mames and Luis Enrique believes the meeting at Camp Nou will be more entertaining given that his side have a disadvantage to overturn. \nCafu: Neymar is world's best \n\"It's obvious that we got an undesirable result in Bilbao but having scored a goal gives us confidence for the second leg,\" he added. \n\"It's a different incentive to what we have in LaLiga. We're coming off two negative results and we want to change. They were unfair results in those two games. \n\"We know we normally play with a lot of space in behind us in defence and that we shouldn't commit many mistakes. These are risks that we know of. \n\"We need to go out and score a goal and move ahead of them on aggregate. This will make them take more risks. It makes return legs more attractive. \n\"What we need is a victory, especially when we've played as we have in the last couple of games, where we feel like we deserved more.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T16:43:18.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
