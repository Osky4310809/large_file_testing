The fact is, Bayern Munich made a promise and they intended to honor it. \nFC Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge promised Ingolstadt a sausage feast if they handed title-chasing RB Leipzig their first loss of the season. Ingolstadt delivered back on Dec. 10 and it was time for Bayern to honor their half of the bargain. Rummenigge delivered on Tuesday. \nâ€” FC Ingolstadt 04_EN (@Schanzer_EN) January 24, 2017 \nRumenigge even threw in pretzels, what a guy! \nThis isnâ€™t the first time Bayern have promised cased meats to teams helping their cause. One of the most memorable instanced came on the final day of the 1999-2000 season. Bayern needed to defeat Werder Bremen and hope for a Bayer Leverkusen loss at Unterhaching, a tiny club from the Munich suburbs who were making their debut season in the top flight. In one of the most thrilling title-deciders in league history, Unterhaching miraculously did their part to deny Leverkusen their first championship, and Uli Hoeness famously thanked Bayernâ€™s neighbors by sending them cases of sausages and beer. \nHeading into the weekend, Bayern have a three-point gap over the upstart RB Leipzig. The Bavarians donâ€™t necessarily need any more help if they win out the rest of the way, but it canâ€™t hurt to have teams swipe a few points from RB Leipzig. \nThere could be a tasty reward at the end for anyone that makes it happen â€¦ This is what awaits anyone who beats RB Leipzig this seasonâ€¦ ðŸŒ­ #SausagePromises pic.twitter.com/KltSlU7TCQ \nâ€” FC Bayern US (@FCBayernUS) January 24, 2017 \nYum!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:48:23.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
