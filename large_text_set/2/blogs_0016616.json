Maxine Waters: People in Trump’s Orbit With Russian Ties Are ‘A Bunch of Scumbags’ by Josh Feldman | 9:04   \nDemocratic congresswoman Maxine Waters went off on a bunch of advisors and aides to President Trump for their Russian ties and called them a “bunch of scumbags.” \nShe spoke with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes about what she has deemed Trump’s “Kremlin clan,” including Michael Flynn , Paul Manafort , Carter Page , and Rex Tillerson . \nShe went point-by-point down a list of people with troubling ties, all of whom she said want sanctions lifted on Russia, before saying this: \n“Can’t people see what’s going on? Why do you think they hacked into our election? They hacked into the election because they have to make sure that Donald Trump got elected, so that he could help them with what I think is a huge deal––not only to lift these sanctions, but to take over all of these Soviet countries and pull ’em back into the Soviet Union so that they could have access to all of these resources. It’s clear to me. And I just think the American people had better understand what’s going on. This is a bunch of scumbags, that’s what they are.” \nYou can watch the segment above, via MSNBC. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:06:26.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
