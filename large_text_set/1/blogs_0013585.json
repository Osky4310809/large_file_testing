A photo posted by Official Pro Era Instagram (@proerarecords) on Jan 5, 2015 at 6:12am PST \nJoey Bada$$ appreciated that endorsement just like Drake did, sharing the picture on his Instagram account, but quickly became paranoid that the Secret Service was keeping tabs on him . \n“I’d love to thank Malia in person,” he told the New York Post last July. “It’ll be a weird encounter, because the Secret Service guys are gonna be there, and they’re gonna be tapping the whole conversation. But nonetheless, I’m down.” \nWe imagine that Drake isn’t quite as worried as Joey was, if for no other reason than the Secret Service will probably has their hands full with the inauguration this week… Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
