As discovered by developer Steven Troughton-Smith, iOS 10.3 has code meant to bring to light a floating one-handed keyboard, which is meant to run on iPads running 9.7-inch displays or smaller. (The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is left out in the cold on this one, apparently.) New in iOS 10.3, a one-handed floating iPad (9.7\" or less) keyboard layout. Can be moved around onscreen like the PiP overlay \nTroughton-Smith notes that the keyboard can be moved around where the user needs it, which should be a nice benefit if it ever sees the light of day for end users. Troughton-Smith also points out that it took some digging to find the new floating keyboard, and that it’s “not publicly accessible yet.” \nWhat do you think of the idea?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:38:24.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
