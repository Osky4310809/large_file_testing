Trends Berlin Christmas market attack , Islamic State , Terrorism in Europe \nThe president of the foundation for the Haus der Geschichte museum in Bonn says, while it is “too early” to make such a sensitive decision, Germany cannot ignore its history. \nHans Walter Hutter said that displaying such type of an exhibit immediately after a tragedy is always difficult for relatives and friends of the victims. “One must wait, with respect, for the right time. But then you must act as a museum person, who is responsible for passing down the material legacy of the past – and indeed always with the necessary sense proportion.” #BerlinAttack cut short due to vehicle’s automatic emergency brakes – media https://t.co/bjW9OmKGWR — RT (@RT_com) 29 December 2016 \n“There is still an investigation procedure. And to make the right decision, you also need a time gap,” Hutter said in an interview with DPA, The Local reports. “The whole truck is probably too big. Rather, one would have to think of a certain part” to be displayed. \nOn 19 December 2016, the truck was deliberately driven into the Christmas market beside Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at Breitscheidplatz in Berlin. The terrorist attack left 12 people dead and 56 others injured. The perpetrator was Anis Amri, a failed asylum seeker from Tunisia failed who was killed in a shootout with police near Milan, Italy four days after the attack.

In what form ISIS terror in Germany will be integrated into the collection is still to be discussed,” the Hutter noted. \nIf the museum does acquire the truck, Hutter explained, anything that will go on display will have to show the face of the human tragedy and not tell a story of the jihadist. \n“You need a whole lot of informative objects, documents, photos, sound and video contributions,” to make the exhibition into the tragedy. “Certainly an exhibit must always establish the context. Otherwise it is just a weapon,” Hutter stressed. \nAccording to an ongoing poll at the Svz.de online news portal, less than 10 percent of responders approve of placing the truck at a museum. Over 87 percent oppose the idea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T07:27:03.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
