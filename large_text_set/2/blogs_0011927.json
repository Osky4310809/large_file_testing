You thrive on new experiences and would love to just hop in the car and go – no plan. Just go.\nTaurus (April 20th to May 21st) You appreciate gifts. You like beautiful things and the feeling that someone took time to pick out something for you. It’s not about being materialistic, it’s simply one of the ways you can accept and show love.\nGemini (May 22nd to June 21st) Doesn’t matter if you’re single or in a relationship, you’re hoping for an adventure this Valentine’s Day. You crave excitement and because you bore easily, you aren’t interested in the typical “romantic” date ideas. You want to do something you’ve never done before, like go paintballing or hit up a competitive trivia night.\nCancer (June 22nd to July 22nd) You don’t need anything showy or grandiose this Valentine’s Day. To you, a night of snuggling with someone you care about is hands down more enticing than a big night out. You crave intimacy and because you’re such a natural nurturer, would love to feel like this time you’re the one being taken care of. You also love candles. Seriously. Can’t turn down a good smelling candle.\nLeo (July 23rd to August 22nd) Independent and self-assured, Valentine’s Day isn’t something you really worry about, regardless of your relationship status. That being said, you’re a fan of big gestures. You’re craving a moment (or night) in the spotlight. You want to feel special and aren’t afraid of a little PDA.\nVirgo (August 23rd to September 22nd) Opposite of Leos, you do NOT WANT any big, romantic gesture. The thought of being put on the spot or looked at by a bunch of people in some emotional moment is mortifying. You’re into low-key celebrations. You’re content having a quiet, intimate dinner at home.\nLibra (September 23rd to October 22nd) Even-tempered and flexible, you’re usually down to go-with-the-flow. You’re likely happy to do whatever your partner wants. If you’re single, you might want a self-care day. Go to a spa or go to an art show. Take some time to relax and enjoy your surroundings.\nScorpio (October 23rd to November 22nd) You’re craving an evening in a dimly lit bar with someone you can tolerate. Or maybe alone. Actually, yeah. You definitely want to go alone.\nSagittarius (November 23rd to December 21st) I’m going to be totally blunt: you want really, really good sex this Valentine’s Day. Like one might guess about a fire sign, you’re passionate and, well, fiery. You’re craving a mind-blowing orgasm. Or two. Or three…\nCapricorn (December 22nd to January 20th) One of the more responsible signs, you don’t need to treat Valentine’s Day like it’s different than any other day. You’d love good, stimulating conversation and a delicious meal.\nAquarius (January 21st to February 18th) You can be a bit reserved, especially in romantic settings, so you’d prefer not to do anything that puts too much pressure on you. Going to a movie or show that doesn’t require too much talking sounds ideal.\nPisces (February 19th to March 20th) A dreamy and romantic sign, Valentine’s Day seems built for you. However, you’re not into crowds and fear being disappointed by the day being so hyped up. You’d love to deepen a romantic connection. Or if love isn’t on the menu, spend quality time with a friend with a few glasses of wine. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:17:07.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
