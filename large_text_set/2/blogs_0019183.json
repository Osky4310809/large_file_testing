PNA/Avito C. Dalan \nMANILA, Philippines ( Philippines News Agency ) —The Department of Justice ordered the Bureau of Immigration to issue an immigration lookout bulletin order against three suspects in the ‘rent-tangay’ scam that has victimized car owners from different parts of the country. \nIn a memorandum, DOJ Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre ordered Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente to put Ana Pamplona Borlon, Lea Constantino Rosales and Rafaela Anunciacion under an ILBO. \nUnder the ILBO, Immigration officers are mandated to immediately inform the Office of the Justice Secretary if people on a lookout list try to leave the country. . \n“I enjoin all our Immigration officers and everyone concerned to strictly discharge their duties. This 'Rent Tangay' scam has victimized a lot of persons, let us bring those responsible to our courts so that justice will be served,” Aguirre said.   \nHe instructed the BI to coordinate with National Bureau of Investigation Director Dante Gierran for more information about the suspects. The information includes known aliases, date and place of birth, copies of passports and their latest photos. \nAguirre also required contact numbers from the NBI and the Office of the Prosecutor that can be called even beyond office hours in case the subjects of the ILBO attempt to leave the country. \n\"Take all other appropriate actions including, but not limited to, coordinating with other concerned offices and agencies and even airlines, especially since international passengers are customarily required to checkin within a specified number of hours before the flight,\" said Aguirre in his memorandum. \nA person subject of an ILBO can still leave the country upon clearance from the DOJ. \nHe ordered the government prosecuting arm to immediately file a case in court and obtain an arrest warrant \"if it should be found that there is probable cause to criminally charge the respondents.\" \nEarlier, Aguirre ordered the NBI to investigate and spearhead the filing of cases against the perpetrators of the car rental scam. \nLawyer Ariel Inton, Jr., counsel of complainants and former Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board member, said that they have already filed a complaint and also sought for an Immigration lookout bulletin against one of the three suspected swindlers identified as Tychicus Historillo Nambio. \nAguirre responded to the request of the victims as he signed the ILBO against Nambio because he might flee from the country. Nambio is detained in Biñan, Laguna for estafa.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:58:33.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
