U.S.-KUWAIT RELATIONS The United States established diplomatic relations with Kuwait in 1961 following its full independence from the United Kingdom. The United States shares a long history of friendship and cooperation with Kuwait, rooted in shared values, democratic traditions, and institutions. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. Military forces of the United States and a multinational coalition expelled Iraq in 1991. The United States supports Kuwait's sovereignty, security, and independence, as well as its multilateral diplomatic efforts to build greater cooperation among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. From 2003, Kuwait provided the main platform for U.S. and coalition operations in Iraq. Kuwait played a key role in facilitating the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops and associated equipment from Iraq, which concluded in 2011. Kuwait is an important partner in U.S. counterterrorism efforts, providing assistance in the military, diplomatic, and intelligence arenas and also supporting efforts to block financing of terrorist groups. U.S. Assistance to Kuwait The United States provides no development assistance to Kuwait. The United States provides military and defense technical assistance to Kuwait from both foreign military sales and commercial sources. U.S. personnel assist the Kuwait military with training, education, readiness, and war fighting. Bilateral Economic Relations The U.S. and Kuwaiti governments have signed a trade and investment framework agreement, providing a forum to address mutual trade concerns and needed economic reforms. The United States is Kuwait's largest supplier of goods and services, and Kuwait is one of the largest markets in the Middle East. Provided their prices are reasonable, U.S. firms have a competitive advantage in many areas requiring advanced technology, such as oil field equipment and services, electric power generation and distribution equipment, telecommunications gear, consumer goods, and military equipment.
