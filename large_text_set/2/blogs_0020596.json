That arousal, desire, and finally, the enactment of that desire to copulate, is fundamental to being human, and that all of us have sexual urges. We have come to understand that attraction between two people of the opposite sex is not the only acceptable form of sexuality. We now understand sexuality to be fluid, and honour everything that falls on the spectrum between heterosexuality and homosexuality. But, we don't account for asexuality - that small percentage of people who experience no sexual desire leave us befuddled. Having sex is a natural and integral part of being human, and we cannot fathom how somebody can not want it. In simple terms, asexuality is a sexual orientation, just like heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality. Here are eight things about asexuality that will hopefully help you understand it better: 1. It is estimated that about 1% of the world's population is asexual. If that doesn't sound significant, consider this - this amounts to over 60 million people! 2. It doesn't happen out of the blue. Suddenly losing the ability to feel sexual attraction is probably a result of a medical or psychological condition, rather than a sexual orientation. One is born asexual, just like one is born homo or heterosexual. 3. Asexuals experience the need for love, belongingness, intimacy, and relationships. They fall in love, they get jealous, they want to spend forever with someone, they get heartbroken. They just don't feel the desire to translate this to sex. 4. They feel attraction, but it is more romantic than sexual. They experience the same kind of interest in someone they feel attracted to, than anybody else. Again, they just don't feel the desire to enact it in the form of sex. 5. When they feel romantically attracted to someone, it is usually to a particular gender. So, asexuals can be lesbian, gay, bi, or straight, depending on whom they feel attracted to. 6. Some asexuals masturbate. But, masturbation takes a different form for them, compared to the sexuals. It is more of a physically pleasurable activity, sometimes for the sake of pleasure, and at other times, simply a way of releasing stress. 7. Asexuality is not the same as celibacy. Celibacy is being sexually inactive by choice, whereas asexuality is the absence of desire to be sexually active. 8. Asexuals want physical affection. They are not averse to touch. In fact, many asexuals enjoy physical affection in the form of cuddles and hugs, like anybody else. It is only the sexual activity that they do not have an inclination towards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:02:48.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
