His name was Ted Kennedy.\nWhile Sen. Al Franken (D-Ringling Bros.) and other Democrats have the vapors over a truthful, complete, and correct answer Attorney General Jeff Sessions gave in his confirmation hearing, it's worth remembering the reprehensible behavior of Senator Ted Kennedy in 1984.\nThis reprehensible behavior didn't involve launching an Oldsmobile Delmont 88 into a tidal channel while drunk. This reprehensible behavior was collusion with America's most deadly enemy in an effort to defeat Ronald Reagan's reelection.\nYou won't hear much about that from CNN and the clown from Minnesota.\nTo recap, from Forbes :\nPicking his way through the Soviet archives that Boris Yeltsin had just thrown open, in 1991 Tim Sebastian, a reporter for the London Times , came across an arresting memorandum. Composed in 1983 by Victor Chebrikov, the top man at the KGB, the memorandum was addressed to Yuri Andropov, the top man in the entire USSR. The subject: Sen. Edward Kennedy.\nKennedy’s message was simple. He proposed an unabashed quid pro quo. Kennedy would lend Andropov a hand in dealing with President Reagan. In return, the Soviet leader would lend the Democratic Party a hand in challenging Reagan in the 1984 presidential election. “The only real potential threats to Reagan are problems of war and peace and Soviet-American relations,” the memorandum stated. “These issues, according to the senator, will without a doubt become the most important of the election campaign.”\nKennedy made Andropov a couple of specific offers.\nAmong the promises Kennedy made the Soviets was he that would ensure that the television networks gave the Soviet leader primetime slots to speak directly to the American people , thus undermining Reagan's framing of the sinister nature of the USSR. Event then, the Democrats had the power to collude with the legacy media. Kennedy also promised to help Andropov penetrate the American message with his Soviet agitprop.\nThat's right, folks. Even 30 years ago, Democrat senators were colluding with America's enemies to bring down Republicans.\nAnd no, Jeff Sessions didn't perjure himself . It's not even a close call.\nSo now they are after Jeff Sessions instead of Ronald Reagan. Ideological comrades throughout the Justice Department are helping out this time. Just before Trump's inauguration, the Obamites widely distributed intelligence information throughout the Department of Justice, where their political comrades could be counted on to leak the information after January 20.\nThis is a problem that will plague President Trump and General Sessions until they drain the swamp at the Justice Department -- something that isn't even close to getting started. Ideological leftists throughout the DOJ are serving as agents of the Obama regime and undermining the new administration.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/jchristianadams/2017/03/02/us-senator-colludes-with-russians-to-influence-presidential-election/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/27/ted-kennedy-soviet-union-ronald-reagan-opinions-columnists-peter-robinson.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/obama-trump-russia-election-hacking.html?_r=0"], "published": "2017-03-02T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:59:25.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
