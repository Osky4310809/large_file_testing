The group also advocated putting up fliers and stickers to garner recognition for the group and to let potential applicants know where other members were located. \n“ Once our network is large enough, the threat of being ‘outed’ or ‘coming out of the pro-white closet’ ” would be minimized, Damigo told the Daily Beast . \n“ Anti-white intimidation will become near impossible. From there, the future will be ours, ” he said. \nVia RT .
