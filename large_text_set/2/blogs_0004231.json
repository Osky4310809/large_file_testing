He also remembered to shout out St. Louis, a city that is left without an NFL team and was incredibly supportive of his move to the Patriots. For my old friends in StL, I felt the love tonight and I will always appreciate y'all. \n— Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) February 6, 2017 \nIn the locker room after the win, Long spoke a bit about his journey from the Rams to the Patriots: Chris Long @JOEL9ONE on going from so much losing with #Rams to winning it all #SB51 #Patriots #superbowl51 pic.twitter.com/nUa7p327xv \n— Ben Boyd (@BenBoydKMOX) February 6, 2017 \nAt the end of the season, only one team’s fan base is exultant. Everyone else is left to build up hope for next year. \nHowever there are still many Rams fans who were happy to see Long have his moment, even if he did it while wearing the despised Patriots uniform. People are mad cause I'm a Rams fan and wanted the patriots to win!! Chris long deserves it that's my only reason", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:03:01.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
