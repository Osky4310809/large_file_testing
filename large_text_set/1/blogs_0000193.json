A beta version has been available for a few days on both the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T, but the beginning of this rollout marks the finished version of OxygenOS 4.0, built on Android 7.0 Nougat, being pushed out to every user. While this update may not pack all of the under the hood tweaks and assorted small features found in the latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat that Pixel and Nexus devices are getting, it does bring all of the usual Nougaty goodness, along with a good number of overhauls, tweaks, and fixes to OnePlus’ own OxygenOS skin. As a cherry on top, this update marks the beginning of updates for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T being in sync. \nUsers can, of course, expect all of the goodies that Google has built into Android 7.0 Nougat, like the new emoji and multi-window mode. Along with all of that, however, OnePlus has rolled out a few new features of their own. For starters, you can now customize how your remaining battery life is displayed in the status bar. A new design graces the notification menu, as well as the settings menu. Status bar icons can be messed around with, and better shelf customization is on offer. On the multitasking side of things, direct replies to notifications from just about any app are now on board as well. To top it all off, you can play around with the DPI settings to make screen elements as large or small as you like. \nThe OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T are essentially the same device, with the OnePlus 3T being a minor upgrade, so it was pretty much a given that their updates would begin to sync up at some point. The starting point for that being the big update to Nougat that everybody was waiting for makes it that much sweeter. Those on the beta can update manually, while those on stock OxygenOS should be seeing the update roll on by soon enough over the air.
