Throwing caution to the wind was a reckless tactic, an approach formulated because of a clear lack of trust of the players he has in this squad. True, he inherited plenty of them. But he also spent money before the season and yet was left with two fullbacks who were deemed surplus to requirements by Arsene Wenger years ago, while the club’s best goalkeeper is in Turin. \nHis side have fallen well short of the final four that Pellegrini reached last term. \n“All managers make mistakes but I don’t think it was down to a tactical mistake,” Guardiola said. \n“It’s simple. The difference was between the first and the second half. In the second half we tried to win the game, we tried to play. \n“I did it all my career in that way. \n“We wanted to show personality, not to let them think, but they could pass and pass the ball. We forgot to do that in the first half. \n“My mistake was being not able to convince them to do that. I did in the second half but it was too late.” Monaco's first-half blitz 1:26 \nALL OUT ATTACK … 45 MINUTES TOO LATE \nGuardiola made no secret that he was going to send his side out to attack despite holding a two goal advantage from Etihad Stadium. \nThe problem with that tactic was City were so incoherent, insipid, disorganised and rattled by Monaco’s pressing and energy that they didn’t even get close to launching a single shot until near the hour mark. It is the first time in seven years they have gone a whole half without a shot. \nPlaying Sergio Aguero, Leroy Sane, Raheem Sterling, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne all in the XI horribly exposed Fernandinho, and City were simply a passenger as they watched their lead dissipate. The goal that kicked City out 0:56 \nBelgian De Bruyne was especially disappointing; flat, sloppy and not influential enough given his stature and the game’s magnitude. \nThey might have leaked twice, but Guardiola pointed the finger of blame further up the field. \n“No, it’s not about the defence. Today was not about that,” the Spaniard said. “Why was the second half a problem with the defence? The problem was the first half when we were not there.” Tonight's piece probably works best with Pep Guardiola's reaction to the third goal. https://t.co/4zYa8GLIee pic.twitter.com/ogqP24T2QK — Daniel Storey (@danielstorey85) March 15, 2017 \nSpeaking on The BBC , former Premier League midfielder Trevor Sinclair said: “I thought De Bruyne, Silva, Fernandinho didn’t take responsibility on the ball. \n“They looked shell-shocked at the start by Monaco. From the first kick of the second half they went long and the gaps appeared. They needed to realise that sooner. In the first leg, Yaya Toure did that. It happened too late here.” Manchester City's Kelechi Iheanacho leaves.

Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne, left. Source: AP \nPhil Neville added: “I am not so sure the signings over the last five years have been that good. But when Sane scores I think Pep is thinking ‘this is perfect, we can control the game from here’. Then they concede. \n“Pep Guardiola doesn’t go out there and spend the bulk of his money on defenders. He will be thinking if they had put one of those chances away they would be in the next round.” Pep can have no complaints if heavily criticised. If Pellegrini had blown 2 goal adv to go out,he'd have been panned.

Source: AFP \nDEFENCE AT SEA \nArsenal copped 10 in two games amongst 16 goals leaked in eight UCL games. \nManchester City conceded the same amount as their hapless English counterparts. \nOne first-half moment, when Willy Caballero threw Bacary Sagna a hospital pass as City tried fruitlessly to play the ball out from the back, summed up the poor decision making Guardiola’s side were making. \nStones recovered after a shaky start, and found an ally in Rio Ferdinand, who felt he was also exposed by his teammates, particularly with Aleksandar Kolarov chosen at centre-back alongside him. \n“I felt sorry for Stones, he was isolated,” he told BT Sport. Manchester City's Fernandinho reacts at the end of a Champions League. Source: AP \n“The players behind him showed no communication. Stones can do nothing about this [Fabinho goal]. I’d have been fuming.” Pep has picked the wrong team here. Not enough defensive mindset in midfield. Fernandinho getting overrun. — Mark Ogden (@MarkOgden_) March 15, 2017 Can't begin to imagine how frustrating it must be to watch this Man City side defend as a supporter. Horrendous even as a near neutral. — Daniel Storey (@danielstorey85) March 15, 2017 Terrible start. Defence all over the shop. — Mike Keegan (@MikeKeegan_DM) March 15, 2017 \nStones assessed: “Very sloppy. Not up to our standard in the first half. We wanted to correct that but we weren’t clinical enough in both boxes. \n“We didn’t score enough and weren’t defensively solid enough. \n“The second half didn’t reflect the whole scoreline. We were the City people know from this season. We should have scored more. It is a difficult one for us to take. We should have done better and deserve to be in the next round. \n“The gaffer was saying before that the more and more he plays the Champions League it is about the set-pieces. Real Madrid scored from two last week and went through. We weren’t solid enough.” Manchester City's Fernandinho reacts while Monaco's Bernardo Silva jumps.
