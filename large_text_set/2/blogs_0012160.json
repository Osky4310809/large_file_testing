Plank took out a full letter in the Baltimore Sun to address the entire City. \nWhether it’s in Harbor East or at the company’s headquarters in Locust Point, everyone is talking about Under Armour and Kevin Plank right now, but for all of the wrong reasons. \nIt’s the letter from the CEO that had all of Baltimore talking Wednesday, but last week, it was Plank’s comments on Donald Trump that stole the show. \n“To have such a pro business, president is something that’s a real asset to this country,” Plank said on CNBC. \nUnder Armour athletes wasted no time lashing out. Misty Copeland said “I strongly disagree with Plank’s comments.” \nDwayne Johnson added “these are neither my words, nor my beliefs.” \nAnd NBA MVP Steph Curry said “I agree with that description, if you remove the E-T from asset.” \n“I don’t think there are any surprises here when you look at the president,” Plank said. \nIn a letter to the City, Plank said “I answered a question with a choice of words that did not accurately reelect my intent.” \nThe CEO also voiced his support for immigration. \n“I wish him well, I’m glad he made the statement, I believe in Kevin Plank and his work,” said Mayor Catherine Pugh. \nWhile some say the letter in the Baltimore Sun was a positive step, others say Plank, just needs to move on. \n“He responded first, which is great, then you want to move on, you don’t want to continue the conversation, you don’t want to add to the buzz,” said Shana Harris with Warschawski Marketing and PR. \n“This is a little bump that’s going to happen, and when you do have strong brand and build up great reputation like Under Armour has, you’re able to overcome these more easily,” Harris said. \nHarris said it’s more crucial now than ever for Plank to focus on his company’s brand and products. Along with a Port Covington project, with stakes that are higher than ever. \n“The fact that he did what he did today, shows how important Baltimore is to him,” Harris said. \nIn support of immigration in his letter, Plank also publicly opposed Trump’s travel ban. \nMayor Pugh added that Plank was clear in his editorial about where he stands as an individual and where his company stands as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:42:52.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
