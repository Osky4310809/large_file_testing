The restaurant offers three different dining rooms themed in exquisite detail inspired by the film. The Grand Ballroom allows guests to dine in the Beast’s ballroom with a high ceiling and photo-worthy chandeliers. The Castle Gallery puts on display mementos of Belle and Beast’s relationship, and the West Wing offers a spooky look at the enchanted rose from the film.\nThe restaurant’s exterior, photographed above, appears rocky and ominous – but one only has to open the door to find the treasure of beauty on the inside. \nThanks to photographer Tom Bricker for the image.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:06:37.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
