Wilkie’s wife, who is a nurse, then took him to the emergency room where he received 5 stitches.\nEverything happened so fast Wilkie didn’t get a chance to thank the men he calls “angels.”\nOn Wednesday, a local news station brought Wilkie and Dillard together for a Skype call.\n“He’s a navy veteran and he’s been running and does about 10 half marathons a year so he’s well aware of runners’ issues,” Wilkie says. “I’m just very grateful that he was there.”\nRock ‘n’ Roll Arizona Half Marathon Tony Cottrell Wilkie explained that he took up running 10 years ago as a way to stay healthy after retiring from civil engineering. Sunday’s race was his 8 th half marathon and he has more races planned for this year.\nAfter speaking with Dillard, there’s one more event he hopes to add to his list: reuniting with his rescuer to run together.\n“We talked about maybe down the road being able to run another half marathon together,” he says. “I’ve made a couple friends for life, that’s for sure.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:36:37.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
