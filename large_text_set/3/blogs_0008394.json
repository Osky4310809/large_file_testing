She grabs me and she hugs me tight.\" Photos Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Moet & Chandon, Rich Polk/Getty Images for St. John \n\"She goes, ‘I know, I know, I know,'\" Christopher recalled. \"I needed that moment.\" \nThe actor then shared the exact moment Amy found out the news. In between chatting on her phone, the comedian interjected and asked what the twosome was talking about. When he shared his family news, Amy said \"Oh, that's terrible. Hold on one second,\" before pretending to get back on the phone. \nThe gesture—meant to be a joke—is exactly what Christopher needed. \n\"I know she was kidding,\" he shared with Sara Gilbert , Julie Chen , Aisha Tyler and guest co-hosts Betsy Brandt and Yvette Nicole Brown . \"She needed to diffuse all that obvious emotion that was filling up the boat. This is even cuter. Later on she goes, ‘You knew I was kidding, right?'\" \nTrust on Amy, you helped your co-star in more ways than one. \nThe Talk airs weekdays at 2 p.m. EST/1 p.m. PST on CBS.
