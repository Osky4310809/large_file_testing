A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone softness and other complications. Low vitamin D levels can also lead to fatigue. \n\"Research also links vitamin D deficiency to increased risk of prostate, colon and breast cancer, as well as depression and cardiovascular disease,\" Kelly Hogan, clinical nutrition and wellness manager at Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital, told AccuWeather. \nIn the United States, vitamin D deficiencies can affect 85 percent of the population at latitudes above 37 degrees north, or areas above New Mexico, Texas and North Carolina, Hogan said. \nThe colder climate leads to a lack of exposure to sunshine. \nWithout perpetual sunshine, obtaining enough sunlight to keep the body content is difficult. While some physicians may recommend taking supplements, there are foods that can easily be incorporated into a person's diet to mitigate a lack of sun. \nVitamin D levels fall in the colder months as people see less sun exposure. (Yuko Yamada/iStock/Thinkstock) \n\"Skin production of vitamin D from sunlight is virtually non-existent in the winter,\" Dr. Sharon Orrange, associate professor of medicine at Keck School of Medicine at University of Southern California, told AccuWeather. \n\"It will be even harder for you to obtain enough vitamin D if you are dark skinned, obese, consistently use sunscreen or donâ€™t absorb vitamin D well from your gut,\" she said. \nTherefore, intake of foods fortified with vitamin D is even more important. \nFew foods naturally contain vitamin D, but oily fish like sardines and salmon are exceptions, Orrange said. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T16:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T07:10:47.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
