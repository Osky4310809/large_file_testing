In front, the test mule’s air intakes within the front bumper are somewhat reduced in size compared to those on the earlier concept , but it otherwise retains much of the sleek silhouette. \nBehind the disguise, the test mule appears to dispense with Lamborghini’s signature, angular LED daytime running lights within its headlamp clusters, though this may well change when the Urus reaches production readiness. So far, only the front-and-side angle of the Urus test mule is visible from these images, though with much of the concept’s angularity retained, the rear end may also be spared from substantial restyling. \nAs mentioned earlier, the Urus will gain a 4.0 litre, twin-turbo V8 powerplant that is unique to Lamborghini (it won’t be derived from or shared with VW Group stablemates Audi or Bentley), while former Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann (now Audi Sport boss) also stated that the new V8 won’t be installed in the marque’s other supercars, saying that it goes against the company’s “one car, one engine” ethos. \nIt was also said earlier that the Urus could make its debut at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, but if all goes to plan, Lamborghini indicated that a premiere at the Frankfurt Motor Show this year is also possible. The upcoming SUV could well be a major boost for Lamborghini sales, just as the Bentayga has done for Bentley shortly after its launch, unlike the rarity that was the LM002 ‘Rambo Lambo’ .
