(Niantic/Game Informer) \nThe first two weeks of Pokemon Go have been riddled with glitches, as millions of users flood the Internet attempting to uncover solutions to some of the app’s many frustrating bugs. A common one is an error message that says “GPS Signal Not Found,” and that’s a big deal considering literally the entire game relies upon being able to access your phone’s GPS. \nLuckily, because this is a widespread problem, there are several solutions that have worked for people. Here are seven options you can try, each one of which stands on its own as a potential fix. If one doesn’t work for you, simply move on to the next. Turn on Wi-Fi. For some reason, it seems that at the moment Wi-Fi needs to be enabled even if you’re not actually connected to it. If you’re on an iPhone, simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen and make sure the Wi-Fi (second icon from the left) is enabled. On an Android, from the home screen select apps, settings, and then turn Wi-Fi on. Step outside. Presumably you’re having this issue while exploring the outdoors, but in case you’re getting it in indoors, try stepping outside and remaining in place for 30-60 seconds. Some users report that doing this allows the phone to bring the GPS back online. Make sure the GPS is turned on. On the iPhone, go to settings, privacy, location services, and make sure this setting is on. On Android, go to settings, privacy and safety, location, and make sure location is turned on. Then click “locating method” and ensure that “GPS, Wi-Fi, and mobile networks” is selected. Reset network settings. This one is specifically for iPhones, but go to settings, general, reset, and then choose reset network settings. Disable mock locations. For Androids only, go to “about phone” and then tap on your build number 7 times. This will enable developer options. From there, go to locations and disable mock locations. Leave Google Maps on in the background. This one sounds weird, but some iPhone users have said that opening Google Maps and then heading back into the Pokemon Go app actually fixes this issue. Turn your phone on/off. When all else fails, turning your device off and on again is always worth a try, and some have said that this is actually all it took for them. You can also try uninstalling and reinstalling the app itself. \nAs of right now, these are all the solutions that the majority of players have been using. Of course, the game is plagued by horribly unstable servers, and so if none of these steps have solved your problem, there’s a chance what you’re experiencing is an issue on the developer’s end and not on yours. In that case, you’ll just have to be patient and check on the game in an hour or two, by which point hopefully everything will be back to normal. Here’s a guide to figuring out whether the servers are down for everyone or whether it’s just on your end:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T05:49:12.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
