(Source: BGR) Benchmarks of the S8+ have leaked on Geekbench, revealing solid (though not game-changing) performance. by Douglas Black, 2017/03/05 ARM Phablet Working For Notebookcheck Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck?

The official launch will be in New York on March 29, but the phones won't actually be on sale until April 21. Order numbers for the S8 and S8+ are expected to be astronomical, and Samsung plans to ramp up production to 7.8 million units a month by April, according to Korean hub Naver. Alongside this news comes some benchmarks of the S8+ with the Snapdragon 835 found on Geekbench. The 835 is a capable chip, delivering a single-core score of 1929 and a multi-core score of 6084. In comparison, the S7 tops leads the official Android leaderboards with single and multi-core scores of 1787 and 5210 respectively. Geekbench benchmark scores are based on a score of 4000, which is the score of an Intel Core i7-6600U. While the 835 is certainly a step up from the previous generation, Apple's iPhone 7s (powered by the A10) still appear to be significantly faster in single-core benchmarks, besting the Snapdragon 835's score of 1929 with a score of 3305. Still, the Note 7 will likely be the fastest Android handset on the market at release.
