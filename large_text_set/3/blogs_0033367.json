More stories that slay it: 'Buffy' alum Clare Kramer on Glory days, Whedon's best advice \nThe magazine also caught up with Whedon and the cast including Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy Summers), David Boreanaz (Angel), James Marsters (Spike), Alyson Hannigan (Willow Rosenberg), Nicholas Brendon (Xander Harris), Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia Chase), Kristine Sutherland (Joyce Summers), Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), Alexis Denisof (Wesley Wyndam-Pryce), Emma Caulfield (Anya), Amber Benson (Tara) and Seth Green (Oz) to see what they think of being on the kind of TV show that resonates with fans for 20 years. \n\"The most important thing to me is that I have had people come up to me and say the show made me feel different about what they could be, about what they could do, about how they respond to problems, about being a female leader,\" Whedon told EW . \"People getting strength from my own little terrors is... There is no better legacy than that.\" \nSarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz reunite as slayer-crossed lovers Buffy and Angel for the 20th anniversary of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" TV series. Entertainment Weekly \nThere's a also a fun gallery of photos featuring Whedon and the cast in what looks like a very sinister library with plenty of shoutouts to the TV series including Emma Caulfield (Anya) posing with a white rabbit to remind us all that her character revealed that the Easter bunny was indeed evil. \nThe slideshow also included a painting of Anthony Stewart Head (Giles), who apparently couldn't be at the photo shoot due to conflicting schedules. \n\"So sad I couldn't join the reunion -- wasn't for lack of trying -- literally coincided with the tech rehearsal of Love In Idleness. Bummer,\" Head tweeted on March 29. \"EW have worked hard to have my presence felt -- in a portrait on set and an interview. Here's to 20 years and a wonderful group of people.\" \n\"This is surreal,\" Whedon commented on getting back together for the photo shoot. \"For the most part, this is like a high school reunion but much worse because they all still look really great. I was hoping some of them would puff out a bit. But that did not take place.\" \nWho is your favorite \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" character?
