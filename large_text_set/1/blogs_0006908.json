Credit: Christopher Furlong/Christopher Furlong Nicola Harley 7 January 2017 • 5:48pm \nA major row has broken out between the NHS and the Red Cross after the charity described the overcrowding in Britain's A&E units as a “humanitarian crisis”. \nHealth officials have hit back at the claims saying the NHS was wrongly being likened to a war zone. \nChair of the health select committee, Sarah Wollaston MP, said: \"There is a crisis in social care provision but the term 'humanitarian crisis' is too strong. \n\"This is not equivalent to Syria or Yemen.\" There is a crisis in social care provision but the term 'humanitarian crisis' is too strong. This is not equivalent to Syria or Yemen — Sarah Wollaston MP (@sarahwollaston) January 7, 2017 \nL abour leader Jeremy Corbyn has demanded Theresa May comes to the Commons on Monday to explain the \"scandal\" in the English health and social care system. \nOn Saturday the Telegraph revealed NHS hospitals have been trying to \"spin\" their way out of the growing winter crisis after a leaked memo revealed managers are being instructed to play down the scale of the problem and avoid using language such as “black alert” - the phrase used to denote the most serious level of emergency. \nIt comes as the Red Cross' chief executive, Mike Adamson, said extra cash was needed for health and social care to make the system sustainable after its volunteers have been forced to step in and help the NHS cope. \n\"The British Red Cross is on the front line, responding to the humanitarian crisis in our hospital and ambulance services across the country,\" he said.

There is the winter and many more people have breathing and heart problems, but we know it is also very difficult at the moment and social care and community services are not able to react fast enough to free up beds to keep up the flow through hospitals.\" Ambulances lined up outside Accident Emergency at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.

Credit: REUTERS/Darren Staples/REUTERS/Darren Staples \nM r Corbyn has demanded a statement from the Prime Minister when Parliament returns from its Christmas break. \n\"This is a national scandal - and Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt have to take both responsibility and urgent action to tackle it,\" he said. \n\"The crisis in our NHS is unprecedented. People are lying on trolleys in corridors waiting to be seen. \n\"Hospitals have had to close their doors, unable to admit patients. \n\"The health service is at breaking point.\" \nMr Hunt has not spoken publicly on the issue despite repeated requests for comment and former health minister Norman Lamb urged him to come out of \"hiding\". \nThe Liberal Democrat said: \"Jeremy Hunt must stop hiding and announce immediate measures to alleviate this crisis, including emergency funding to plug gaps across services that are putting patient safety at risk. \n\"This Government should be ashamed. It ignored calls for extra cash to support health and care services through the winter, and now it is patients who are paying the price.\" Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T19:53:50.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
