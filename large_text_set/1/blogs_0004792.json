If you are able to come up with a creative way to approach this negative perception, be it a video series, blog post, photo, or something else (and better) entirely… Keep in mind that the audience is a high school student and his/her family.” \nChicago racked up 762 murders in 2016 and over 1,000 more shootings than the year before. Though Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel insists his city is a safe haven and sanctuary city for illegal immigrants, there are more homicides in the Windy City than in New York and Los Angeles combined. \nThe university’s admission website is replete with helpful reminders of why Chicago’s image has apparently been overblown by news reports and President-elect Donald Trump: “…Hyde Park is considered one of the safest neighborhoods in Chicago…” Though the admissions staff ultimately admits that “urban life demands street smarts.” \nThe site also provides a contact list of campus and city security numbers and suggests that “being aware of your surroundings and being prepared for unexpected situations go hand-in-hand with city life. The University of Chicago encourages you to make safety practices a part of all your daily routines…” \nFollow David on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:23:55.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
