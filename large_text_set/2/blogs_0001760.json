Instead of answering the question, Brady pleaded ignorance and said he doesn’t pay much attention to what’s going on in the world.\nRussell Wilson decided to take a different path when asked about the President of the United States. Wilson did a Facebook Live while getting his haircut before an appearance on Conan and, when someone inquired about Trump, he didn’t hesitate to speak his mind. Among other things, Wilson believes that no matter who you voted for, everyone can agree that the first few days of Trump’s presidency are “getting out of hand.”\n“Basically, I think that when you think about all the negativity that’s happened in a 10-day period … it’s already too much,” Wilson said. “It’s already crazy, it’s already affecting people’s hearts and souls, their lives in such a negative way.”\nAdditionally, the Seahawks’ quarterback commented on the airport protests to voice displeasure with Trump’s immigration ban, saying “You have to be able to treat people fairly, you have to be able to love everyone.” Wilson briefly interrupted his discussion on Trump by getting a rise out of everyone in the room when he went “Come back, Barack” a few times.\n\nPart 2 pic.twitter.com/CSx1d5avIl \n— Sam HawkBadger (@hwkbgr) January 31, 2017 \n\nFrom there, Wilson talked about how he thinks people viewed Obama outside of the lens of politics, saying that he believes people had an appreciation for the way that he carried himself during his time in the White House. \n“Just because you believe in something or you’re from a certain place doesn’t mean you’re a bad person,” Wilson said when he got back to the immigration ban. He also said that handcuffing a child in due to the ban, which White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer commented on earlier this week , is “ridiculous.”\nWilson isn’t usually the type of guy to open up like this, which makes him kind of similar to Brady. The difference, obviously, is that Wilson’s willing to give an answer that feels genuine when asked about politics.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:51:02.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
