(Katie Falkenberg/Los Angeles Times via Associated Press) Despots and demagogues gain power and motivate their followers/enablers by convincing them that their misery is traceable to an identifiable enemy (“elites,” foreigners, Wall Street) that only they have the nerve to name and defeat. But what if people aren’t, you know, that miserable? The next best thing is to convince them that things are awful, terrible, the worst, the equivalent of carnage and so on. So they should be miserable!\nPresident Trump — in an economy with less than 5 percent unemployment, 25 percent of the world’s gross domestic product, a plethora of affordable consumer goods and rates of crime substantially lower than a generation ago — works hard to convince us that reality is “fake news” and, believe him, everything is awful, terrible, the worst, etc.\nOne specific way to combat Trump and the undermining of objective truth on which he depends is to repeat the real, verifiable facts — over and over. We’ll do our part with a semi-regular “Debunking dystopia” feature, looking at an area (crime, poverty, cities, trade, jobs, etc.) where Trump’s gloom-and-doom routine is demonstrably false.\nTake crime, for starters. Pew Research helps with our debunking, looking at numbers from both the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. On the rate of violent crime:\nUsing the FBI numbers, the rate fell 50% between 1993 and 2015, the most recent full year available. Using the BJS data, the rate fell by 77% during that span. It’s important to note, however, that the FBI reported a 3% increase in the violent crime rate between 2014 and 2015, including a 10% increase in the murder rate. (The BJS figures show a stable violent crime rate between 2014 and 2015, but they do not count murders.) Some experts have projected that the 2016 FBI data will show another increase in the violent crime rate – including another rise in the murder rate – when they are released later this year.\nSo, overall crime is way down, but there has been a disturbing uptick in the rate in the past couple of years. Frankly, rather than telling us the murder and crime rates have never been higher, maybe Trump’s Justice Department should identify the real causes, which are not immigrants , and do something about them. After all, Trump is in charge now.\nThe story is even more comforting when it comes to property crimes:\nLike the violent crime rate, the U.S. property crime rate today is far below its peak level. FBI data show that the rate fell 48% between 1993 and 2015, while BJS reports a decline of 69% during that span. Both the FBI and BJS reported a decline in the property crime rate between 2014 and 2015, even as the violent crime rate went up in the FBI’s data. Property crime includes offenses such as burglary, theft and motor vehicle theft and is generally far more common than violent crime.\nNow, it is not uncommon for people to think crime is worse than it is. In fact, it’s a common pattern, as both Gallup and Pew have shown over the years. In this regard, the media, especially local media, are responsible. “If it bleeds, it leads” remains a feature of local print and TV news.\nTrump amplifies that misunderstanding about crime. In particular, he plays on the fears of his rural base that U.S. cities (blue America) are worse than war zones. And by pinning violent crime on illegal immigrants, he bolsters his case for extreme measures to round up a group that he has already blamed for making his base poorer and more miserable. It helps, of course, that so many of his voters are rural voters, who can’t see for themselves the vast decline in crime in many major American cities. (Ironically, even a city such as Chicago has a lower rate for violent crime than do each of the 10 worst cities. Trump never talks about Stockton, Calif., or Memphis, both of which have a violent-crime rate far worse than Chicago’s.)\nSo if Trump fans are trying to recall the “good old days,” they should remember that a decade ago, crime was much, much worse.", "external_links": ["http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/10/22/violent-crime-statistics-for-every-city-in-america/", "https://twitter.com/@JRubinBlogger", "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/21/5-facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/trump-illegal-immigrants-crime.html"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:01:15.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
