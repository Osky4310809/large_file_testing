Issei Kato/Pool Photo via AP \nMANILA, Philippines - A one-trillion-yen aid package for the Philippines (P434 billion at yesterday’s exchange rate) is one of the commitments made by visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during his meeting with President Duterte yesterday. \nApart from this, Duterte and Abe witnessed the signing of five agreements on trade, infrastructure and low carbon growth partnership. \nJapan’s aid package covers a five-year period in official development assistance and private sector investments. \nJapanese Foreign Press Secretary Yasuhisa Kawamura said Tokyo had provided approximately $20 billion over the past 50 years. Japan is the biggest source of ODA for the Philippines. \nDuterte, in his remarks at the banquet last night, underscored the importance of Japan as a partner for development of the Philippines. He also reiterated his regard for Japan as a “friend closer than a brother.” \n“In Tokyo, I said that Japan deserves its own rightful place in the constellation of the Philippines’ friends. Tonight, let me reiterate that Japan is a friend closer than a brother. That means that Japan is a friend unlike any other,” Duterte said.
