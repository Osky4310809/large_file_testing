The vessel was also self-righting—it flips over by itself right-side up if it capsizes—a feature that was used more than once, as Bertish documented in his captain’s logs. The craft also supported solar panels, GPS, radios and all his dehydrated food for the trip. \n“I pretty much ate exactly the same thing every single day for 93 days,” he said to the people gathered to greet him on the dock, before he picked up a burger patty with his gloves still on – completely disregarded the bun and toppings – and took a massive bite. \nWhile he’s not the first person to have crossed the Atlantic by paddle power, he’s now one of the very few. Alexander Doba , at 67 in 2014, crossed unsupported from Portugal to Florida, some 5,400 miles in a specially-designed kayak with many of the same features as Bertish’s. \nPeter Bray crossed the opposite direction west to east, from Newfoundland to Ireland in 2001 with no sails or support (and has some harrowing survival tales from the North Atlantic during other expeditions). Bray held the longest open water, human-powered record before Doba broke it. \nBertish, now over 20 pounds lighter than when he started and sporting a Castaway-style bushy beard, still had plenty of energy to talk with the crowd and give a press conference a couple hours after landing. He’s in good shape and good spirits. \n“It seems mind-boggling that I’m alive at all, to be honest,” Bertish said at the news conference. “I really had a lot of support and guiding hands from many different sources, both high and low.” \nMore coverage of Bertish’s historic crossing from SUP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:27:32.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
