Cash photo: Thomas Trutschel NBA legend/ Kazaam star Shaquille O'Neal has a lot of money and he’s not afraid to spend it — especially when it involves tipping waiters and other people who help him out. Munchies notes that in 1997, Shaq once famously tipped a bellhop $100 for driving him to McDonald’s to get a Big Mac, and he generally offers $300 as gratuity for valet service. On Jimmy Kimmel Live last week, the basketball hero explained his philosophy on tipping in dining rooms: When I’m at restaurants, I am a big tipper. I like to show people my appreciation. So when they come up to the table I say, “The quicker I get my order, the bigger your tip will be.” And then the food will come fast. And then when we’re getting ready to leave, I’ll ask them: “ How much do you want? ” And the most someone said was $4,000 . And I said, “Okay, no problem.” Kimmel jokes that he should’ve “punched them in the head” for suggesting such a high number, but Shaq insists that he simply paid the requested gratuity, which was about two months’ worth of rent for the server. So remember bartenders and waiters: If you see Shaq sit down in your section, put a rush on his order and start tallying up how much money you need to pay off your credit card, car loan, or future vacation. He’s kind of like TipsforJesus without the anonymity and social media intrigue.
