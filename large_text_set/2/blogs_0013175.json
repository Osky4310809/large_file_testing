Caro—who’s also apparently on the list of directors the company’s eyeing for its upcoming Captain Marvel movie—is best known for her 2002 coming-of-age story Whale Rider . \nTaking on a job that was initially offered to Ang Lee , Caro will be facing off against Sony’s version of the story of legendary, secretly female Chinese soldier Hua Mulan. That film is being directed by Game Of Thrones’ Alex Graves , and will allegedly be much more of a war movie; it’ll be interesting to see how Graves’ bloody style contrasts with Caro’s, whose other recent projects include North Country and McFarland, USA . Disney’s Mulan is expected to hit theaters on November 2, 2018 . \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:15:11.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
