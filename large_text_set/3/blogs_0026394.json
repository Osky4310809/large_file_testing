The France international has failed to retain a starting spot in manager Mauricio Pochettino's selection, prompting rumours of a swift exit after his £30 million transfer from Newcastle United . According to James Benge of the London Evening Standard , the midfielder answered questions about his future in a video on Instagram, and he said he intends to stay in north London. \"I'm not leaving Tottenham at the moment,\" said Sissoko. \"I'm very happy.\" VALERY HACHE/Getty Images Reports from France said Sissoko is disillusioned at Spurs, and his representatives are prepared to enter into discussion with the club to find a resolution. L'Equipe (h/t Chris Waugh of Chronicle Live) reported Pochettino would be happy to sell at a loss and might take £17 million if a buyer met the price. Sissoko was impressive last summer for France at UEFA Euro 2016, but he has not replicated that form in the Premier League this term. The 27-year-old has started just six games in the Premier League this season, according to WhoScored.com , rising from the substitute bench on 11 occasions. Mike Hewitt/Getty Images In other Spurs news, the club are prepared to \"cut their losses\" with Vincent Janssen and move the striker on in the summer. According to John Cross of the Mirror , Spurs will attempt to sell the former AZ Alkmaar player before they have completed the payments of his instalment deal which brought him to the Lane. Janssen is yet to score from open play in England's top division and has failed to offer Harry Kane sufficient cover as an alternative striking option. Janssen's failure has seen Kane overused, and the England international has suffered injury at vital stages of the campaign. VI-Images/Getty Images The striker recently said he believes he has a future in the Premier League despite a difficult season. Janssen told Voetbal International (h/t Benge ) he is unhappy with his lack of playing time but is not despondent. \"Of course, I'm not satisfied with the amount of playing time in recent months, said Janssen. \"But I remain positive. Moreover, things are going very well at Tottenham Hotspur. I'm not going to walk around as the only player whining. That makes no sense.\" Pochettino has suggested the player could be given additional chances to start after his recent substitute appearances, per ESPN FC's Ben Pearce: Ben Pearce @BenPearceSpurs #thfc Pochettino on Vincent Janssen: \"He will have the possibility to play more and be more involved. I think he showed great energy.\" Sissoko was a risky signing by Spurs, achieving good form with France after an abject season with Newcastle as the Magpies were relegated. The midfielder was consistent for his former club but rarely inspired Newcastle to better results. Janssen appeared to be a good fit for Pochettino's squad and an excellent alternative to Kane, but many strikers find the pace of the English game problematic, and the Dutchman has appeared out of his depth. Both players are likely to be sold in the summer as the coach hunts for players to add real weight to his options.
