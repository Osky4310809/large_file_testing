Brown at Golden Globes, Roasts Donald Trump During Acceptance Speech by Elisa Osegueda 6:54   Getty Images Hugh Laurie can't believe he's a winner! The 57-year-old actor took home   Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Limited Series or Motion Picture made for Television, but it came as a total shocker. Laurie, who won for his role in The Night Manager , beat fellow nominees John Lithgow ( The Crown ), John Travolta and Sterling K. Brown ( The People v. O.J. Simpson ), and Christian Slater ( Mr. Robot ) and quickly addressed his disbelief. \"Thank you, this is obviously a terrible mix-up,\" he said upon accepting his award. RELATED: Donald Glover Thanks 'Black Folks' After 'Incredible' 'Atlanta' Golden Globe Win \"Thank you to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for this amazing honor,\" he said. \"I suppose made more amazing by the fact that I'll be able to say that I won this at the last-ever Golden Globes. I don't mean to be gloomy, just that it has the words, 'Hollywood,' 'foreign,' and 'press' in the title.\" Pausing for a second after receiving a loud applause, Laurie continued, \"I also think that to some Republicans even the word 'association' is highly sketchy.\" \"Thank you, also, to the many people who gave me this wonderful, extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I accept this award on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere,\" he concluded.
