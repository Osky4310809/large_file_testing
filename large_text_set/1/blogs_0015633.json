Related Stories Report: NFL investigating Richard Sherman's undisclosed injury \nCable, 52, interviewed with San Francisco brass on Sunday, one day after Seattle's season-ending 36-20 loss to the Falcons in the NFC divisional round. But on Tuesday agent Doug Hendrickson announced Cable was taking his name out of the running to replace the fired Chip Kelly with the 49ers. \n\"Just spoke with my client Tom Cable and he is reaffirming his commitment to the Seahawks,\" Hendrickson wrote in a tweet . \"He wishes to thank the 49ers for the consideration.\" \nCable's decision to withdraw came shortly after co-director of player personnel Trent Kirchner, one of John Schneider's key lieutenants in Seattle's front office, pulled himself out of the running to replace Trent Baalke as the 49ers' general manager. NFL Network's Mike Garafolo first reported news of Kirchner's decision. \nKirchner, who heads Seattle's pro scouting department, interviewed with the 49ers on Monday morning, while fellow Seahawks executive Scott Fitterer, the director of college scouting, interviewed with the Niners in the afternoon. \nKirchner and Cable, who served as the head coach of the Oakland Raiders from 2008 to 2010, were viewed as a package-deal option for San Francisco, but after New England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels withdrew from consideration on Sunday, it became clear that Shanahan was the team's first -- and now it appears only -- choice. \nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Seahawks news .
