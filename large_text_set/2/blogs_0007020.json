St. Louis man gets 25 years in string of violent street robberies along South Jefferson 9 hrs ago ( … ) \nJason Mosby , of St. Louis, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for a string of robberies in St. Louis. \nST. LOUIS • A St. Louis judge has sentenced a convicted sex offender to prison for 25 years for a string of violent street robberies along South Jefferson Avenue in 2015. \nCircuit Judge Julian Bush sentenced Jason D. Mosby, 31, to prison Monday after Mosby pleaded guilty in six robberies of women of their purses, cash and other items. Mosby lived in the 2000 block of South Jefferson Avenue, and robbed people near that address, police say. \nMosby, whose criminal history includes 2008 convictions of statutory rape, statutory sodomy and child molestation, targeted women late at night as they were waiting for buses, leaving restaurants or walking down the street in June 2015, charges say. \nMosby was originally accused of sexually assaulting one of the victims, but those charges were dropped as part of a plea deal. In another case, a woman’s finger was broken in a struggle over her purse, and her finger later had to be amputated because of infection. \nThe cases include: \nJune 17 • Mosby approached a woman from behind about 10:40 p.m. in the 2100 block of South Jefferson Avenue, pointed an object in her back and demanded her money. The woman dropped everything she had and Mosby scooped up her wallet, taking cash from it. Before running off, Mosby grabbed her breasts and shoved his hand down her pants, fondling her, authorities said. \nJune 18 • Mosby approached two people in a parked car in the 2600 block of Allen Avenue about 11:45 p.m., shortly after they left a McDonald’s on South Jefferson Avenue near Interstate 44. He asked one of them for $10, and as she looked for change to give him, he opened a car door, showed a large knife and demanded money. She gave him $25; he then patted the other person’s pockets looking for money. \nJune 19 • Mosby sat down next to a woman at a bus stop in the 2000 block of South Jefferson Avenue about 4:30 p.m. As the bus was arriving, he grabbed her purse and ran. He got about $35. \nJune 21 • A woman and her 7-year-old son were walking home about 11:10 p.m. in the 2600 block of Russell Avenue when Mosby ran up, grabbed her purse sprayed her in the face with mace. \nJune 22 • Mosby approached a woman in her car about 11:50 p.m. in the 2600 block of Russell Avenue and asked for a cigarette. She gave him one, and when he asked for $20, she refused. He then put what she believed was a handgun to her head and demanded money. “Don’t make me hurt you,” he told her. Mosby grabbed a leopard print wallet and ID from her purse and ran. The wallet held about $400, a debit card and gift cards. \nJune 24 • Mosby approached a woman at a bus stop at South Jefferson and Russell avenues about 9:30 p.m., sprayed mace in her face and grabbed her purse. She broke a finger in the struggle over the purse; her finger became infected and was later amputated. \nMosby was arrested after police circulated surveillance images of Mosby and his girlfriend using a stolen debit card at a store. An anonymous tip identified Mosby for detectives. Police found some of the stolen property in Mosby’s home. \nMosby pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal to nine felonies and two misdemeanors Monday including charges of robbery, armed criminal action, child endangerment and physically taking property from another. Assistant Circuit Attorney Alison Bischoff dropped two counts of sodomy and sexual abuse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:12:49.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
