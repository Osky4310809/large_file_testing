But recently, proposals to change the names of various airports have been proving controversial among commuters and journalists alike. Just before the new year —admittedly a silly season for the news—the Birmingham Mail reported that there were ideas being mooted to rename the city's gateway \"Ozzy Osbourne International Airport\", in homage to the Black Sabbath musician and former resident. Jim Simpson, a record label boss who discovered Black Sabbath, is reportedly behind the proposal. He wants Birmingham to follow in the footsteps of Liverpool's John Lennon Airport, Warsaw's Frederic Chopin Airport and New Orleans's Louis Armstrong Airport. In Hungary, their capital gateway was rebranded in 2011 to Budapest Ferenc Liszt Airport (a more familiar name than \"Ferihegy\", which foreign visitors had invariably mispronounced). It is not just musicians getting in on the act. Heads of state are also popular. New York's John F Kennedy Airport, Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport and the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris are the obvious examples. Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Queen Alia of Jordan, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the first president of Turkey, and Ayatollah Khomeini, an Iranian politican, all have their names etched in terminal concrete. The Guardian recently reported on a furore over proposed plans to rename Forli Airport in Emilia Romagna, the birthplace of Benito Mussolini, after the Italian dictator. Most rebranding attempts are similarly divisive. In 2005 Glasgow Prestwick Airport decided to adopt the slogan \"Pure Dead Brilliant\", a Glaswegian colloquialism. Embarrassed locals promptly campaigned for it to be renamed after Robert Burns, an 18th century Scottish poet. Cardiff Airport had similar difficulties with its attempted rebranding in 2008. The Welsh gateway had invited suggestions from the public for a new name, but seemed to back down once results came in. Criticism has also been levied at those airports in the south of England which market themselves as London gateways, despite being quite a way out from the city. London Oxford Airport is 60 miles from the capital. Manston Airport in Kent, approximately 70 miles from the city, was formerly known as London Manston. When I asked Charles Buchanan, its chief executive, if he wanted to restore the name last year, he said he simply didn't see the point. The local gateway subsequently won the business of KLM Cityhopper, securing a lucrative feeder service to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Whatever their name, airports will still have commuters travelling to them.
