Efigenio Toledo IV/Alex Nuevaespaña, file \n  Vice President Leni Robredo and Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III suffered declines in their approval and trust ratings in the last quarter of 2016, according to the latest Pulse Asia survey. \nRobredo received a 62 percent approval rating in the Dec. 6 to 11 survey, down from 66 percent in September. \nThe Vice President’s trust rating also plunged to 58 percent from 65 percent. \nThe survey was conducted at the time Robredo quit the Cabinet after President Duterte barred her from attending meetings at Malacañang due to “irreconcilable differences.” \nMeanwhile, Pimentel obtained a 55 percent approval score, which was below his September score of 61 percent. \nHis trust rating dropped to 50 from 55 percent.   \nPublic satisfaction with Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez’s work stayed at 43 percent. Trust in Alvarez fell to 38 from 41 percent. \nChief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno garnered a 47 percent approval rating in December, up by a point from 46 percent in the previous quarter. \nShe registered a trust rating of 41 percent, down from 44 percent. \nBetween September and December last year, Pulse Asia noted the only significant movement in these officials’ national performance ratings is the increase in the overall disapproval score of Robredo (+7 percentage points). \nAcross geographic areas and socio-economic classes, the only marked movement in these officials’ ratings is the drop in approval rating of Pimentel in Class ABC (-25 percentage points), it said. \nThe President’s ratings were released by Pulse Asia last week, wherein he received 83 percent approval and trust scores from 86 percent in September. \nMeanwhile, Congress and the Supreme Court received majority approval ratings – 51 percent to 58 percent – and trust scores – 51 percent to 57 percent – in December. \n“There are hardly any significant changes in these government institutions’ performance and trust ratings between September and December,” Pulse Asia said. \nMost Filipinos expressed approval and trust in the Senate, 58 percent and 57 percent, respectively; the House of Representatives, both at 51 percent, and the Supreme Court 55 percent and 53 percent, respectively. \nThe nationwide survey used face-to-face interviews of 1,200 representative adults 18 years old and above. It has an error margin of plus or minus three percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level.
