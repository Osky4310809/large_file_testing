It literally plays out the imagination I always thought Star Wars was but truly never saw. Without spoiling it we see Vader do what we've always said he's capable of, the story is gripping even though it is all new characters and it's a dream come true to view. This is without a doubt the Golden Age of Star Wars, lets all bask in its glory One of the Best Star Wars Films by Gillen, Father of 2 As a hardcore Star Wars fan, I had been looking forward to Rogue One coming out for awhile. It by far exceeded my expectations as the story, characters, and connection with the other movies was amazing!! I don't want to ruin anything for anyone so I will only say that this is now one of my favorite Star Wars films of all time right next to Empire Strikes Back and Felicity Jones knocked if out of the park with her Jyn Erso character!! I definitively plan to see it again before it is out of the theatre. The best Star Wars Prequel EVER!!! by Noah Pfister I had my doubts and fears with the whole reshoot shpeal, but this...this is incredible. This is what a Star Wars Prequel should have been. Okay yes, it has some flaws here and there, but the characters and action more than make up for it. I cannot wait to see it again.
