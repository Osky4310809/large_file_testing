Sadly, during that drive, the hood was damaged, and now there’s a shitstorm happening on YouTube and Twitter. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nYou should only continue reading if absurdly dumb, petty drama is your thing. Still here? That’s what I thought.\nFirst off, watch this video of Rob Dahm explaining how Parker from Vehicle Virgins damaged Rob’s three-rotor RX-7's hood, and then later talked shit about him to his friends after Rob was invited to a Michelin event and he wasn’t:\n\nIn the video, Rob says Parker slammed the hood, and jammed the latch instead of closing it. When Parker got up to speed, Rob says, the hood lifted and banged against the windshield, causing significant damage.\nRob says he wasn’t initially upset, and appreciated that Parker offered to buy a new hood as compensation. Rob ignored the hood issue for a while, and focused on putting together his legendary four-rotor RX-7. “I really never planned to take him up on that [offer to buy a new hood],” Rob says in the clip.\nAdvertisement \n\nBut then, Rob says he got a message from mutual friend that included screenshots from Parker, which read:\nLow key super jealous, somehow rob Dahm and doctam3 who barely do YouTube got invited to thermal racetrack to drive a bunch of supercars on michelins new PS4 tire... lol I get more views per hour [than] rob does per day﻿.\n\nLet’s forget about the fact that whoever sent that message to Rob clearly doesn’t understand what “low key” means, and just call this message out as some seriously petty shit. But it gets worse, as Parker then allegedly messaged him, asking “Why did you get to go to this event and I didn’t?” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:10:20.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
