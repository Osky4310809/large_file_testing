We’re trying to interpret the law faithfully, taking principles that are enduring and a Constitution that was meant to last ages and apply it and interpret it to today’s problems,” Gorsuch told the Senate Judiciary Committee, speaking of the 1868 amendment.\nThe Colorado federal judge was responding to a question from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who said protecting abortion rights and the rights of gays was not the intent of the men who drafted the 14th Amendment.\n“When it comes to equal protection of the laws, for example, it matters not that some of the drafters of the 14th Amendment were racists, because they were, or sexists, because they were, the law they drafted promises equal protection of the law to all persons,” Gorsuch responded in the third day of his confirmation hearings.\n“A good judge starts with precedent and doesn’t reinvent the wheel. So to the extent there are decisions on these topics — and there are — a good judge respects precedent,” Gorsuch said.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:25:04.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
