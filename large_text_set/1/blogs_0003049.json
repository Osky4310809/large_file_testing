You have two assignments ahead of you this weekend. One is sweet and wonderful, a little life-affirming gift of flowers from you to your home. The other is a big old bear of a job (the \"famous\" floors), but I promise, you and your home will honestly feel great when it's done. Most importantly, though, I want you to hear this: right now, commit to staying with your Cure, no matter what you get done this weekend. T his is about improvement, not perfection and floors or no floors, we're sticking together. We want to see you back on Monday morning for Assignment 6. Now, let's GO! This Weekend's Assignments: Buy Flowers. \nI know, this sounds a bit fluffy but it is actually a very real part of the Cure. Think of the purchase as a gift to your home. It is an enjoyable, (affordable!) little luxury but it goes beyond just that. The flowers are a visual symbol of the commitment you are making to care for your home. \nIn the Eight Step Home Cure , Maxwell wrote: As simple as it sounds, the act of buying flowers for your apartment holds great significance and will heal your home on many levels. They are a reminder of what you are doing by working through the Cure, they are beautiful, they add life to the space and help to humidify the air. Try and find time to pick up flowers ASAP so you can enjoy them throughout the weekend. \n(Note: During previous Cures, some participants opted for a house plant or a bowl of fresh fruit to enjoy instead - whatever works for you in the spirit of giving this type of a small, healthy gift to your home is 100% fine.) Vacuum the Rugs and Clean ALL the Floors. \nThis is a big one, I realize, so block out enough time so you can really do this job right. You can power through all in one shot or split it up over today, tomorrow and Sunday. Pretend you have to pass \"inspection\" when you are through and really do your best. \nThis floor cleaning task will have you really connect with each room and will help you to spot issues that you may have missed when making your to-do list - feel free to add them now. And, if you come across things for the outbox, pop them in! \nFrom one end of your home to the other, it's time to sweep, mop and vacuum. Move things out of the way as you go so you can do a thorough job. This will take a while but trust me, it will make a huge difference in how clean your home feels and actually IS. Turn on some music, set your mind to it and see how quickly you can get it done! \nPlease use this post's comment thread over the weekend to help each other out. Check in and let us all know when you complete your floors - the positive energy as one of us gets the job done helps pull us all through. Don't be shy if you are fading or feeling frustrated - come and vent! This is the one place where EVERYONE knows just how you feel. Think of it as a place to take a break, ask questions, chat and maybe even seek (or share!) a bit of moral support.
