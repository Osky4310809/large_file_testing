Isaac Ross, 40, a Singapore permanent resident, had begun touching and hugging the 30-year-old Filipina inappropriately from Jan 7 to 10 last year, shortly after she started working for his family. \nShe did not like what he was doing and rejected the Malaysian every time, the court heard. ADVERTISEMENT \nSometime after Jan 10 last year, he told her that he “wants her by the end of the month.” \nTerrified, she decided to inform her agent and Ross’ wife. \nThe agent then warned him to stop molesting her. He apologized to the victim. But not long after, he told her to apply medicated oil on his lower back, using a roller. \nShe became worried and informed his wife, who took her on March 9 to a police station to make a report. \nOn Monday, Ross was sentenced to 11 months’ jail and three strokes of the cane after he admitted to two of four counts of molesting the victim. \nDeputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Chee Ee Ling said Ross entered the children’s room on Jan 7 and kissed the victim, who was tidying the room. She pushed him away and told him he could not kiss her because she was his maid. \nTwo days later, he again molested her and hugged her while she was working in the children’s room. \nWhen she pushed him away, he asked whether she wanted to see his private parts. She said no and immediately turned away and left. \nCiting aggravating factors, DPP Chee said Ross had abused his position of authority, and it was not something that had occurred on the spur of the moment but sexual harassment that occurred continually over a span of four days. \nRoss could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, caned or received any combined sentence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:18:47.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
