Rooney began his United career with a debut hat-trick vs Fenerbahce 12 years ago (Photo: Manchester United via Getty) Read More \nUnder Sir Alex Ferguson he was shunted all over the pitch. \nHe also occupied a deeper-lying midfield role under ­Mourinho’s ­predecessor, Louis van Gaal. \nMourinho acknowledged Rooney’s inherent team-player ethic when he said: “I saw him always sacrificing for the team. \n“He played against me when I was in Madrid. He played almost left-back. I always saw him sacrifice for the team and with me he is the same. \n“He’s on the bench, he comes in. He plays, he doesn’t play, but he’s always positive with the group, a good captain, so I’m really happy. He is what I always felt — a humble guy, a good guy, professional, a team guy.” United are confident of reuniting forward Griezmann with France team-mate Paul Pogba (Photo: AFP/Getty) Read More Wayne Rooney's record — How much do you remember about his 249 United goals? \nUnited made light work of Reading, managed by their former defender Jaap Stam. \nRooney opened the scoring, Anthony Martial added a second and a second-half double from Marcus Rashford sealed the emphatic win. \nBut the day belonged to Rooney, a player who divides opinion and who has had to deal with criticism throughout his career – yet one whose achievements ensure he will be remembered as one of the all-time greats.
