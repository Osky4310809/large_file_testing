In it, Yiannopoulos can be heard saying that some relationships between adults and 13-year-olds are consensual and joking that his own experience as a victim of molestation made him good at oral sex.

The site quotes an unnamed senior editor at Breitbart. \n“The fact of the matter is that there’s been so many things that have been objectionable about Milo over the last couple of years, quite frankly. This is something far more sinister,” the senior editor says. “If the company isn’t willing to act, there are at least half a dozen people who are willing to walk out over it.” \nA spokesperson for Breitbart declined TheWrap’s request for comment. \nYou can watch the complete Fox Business report in the video above.
