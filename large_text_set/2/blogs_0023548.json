The Creators Project asked me to pull together a weekly roundup of the best newly-released pins. Most of these will probably sell out. If you like them, smash that \"add to cart\" button. Fradadaland \nModern art is like Pogs for celebrities and oligarchs. Bygones are bygones, though, like Duchamp's revolutionary Fountain. It's the readymade sculpture's 100th anniversary, so let's give credit where credit is due with this tasteful Simpsons bootleg, a wonderful metaphor for the current state of the art world. Duchamp himself would be the first to tell you to go play some chess instead. \n$6.42 here . RTF \nThere are a lot of real wimpy pins out there, but this is decidedly not one of them. If you don't love wrestling, you either used to wrestle or are lying. Now you can have a humble replica of the ultra-over-the-top million dollar belt right on your lapel. People who don't know will think it's a grill. People who know will give you a high five and then a pile-driver. \n$10.00 here . The Ancients \nGhostbusters was so good that even the remake worked. That's enough to put the franchise in a league of its own. Making a generic Ghostbusters pin would be easy, but these guys did a real fine job with the details, and the result looks fantastic. \n$10.00 here . Elkfoot \nIn the pin game, there's an unspoken law: whoever pins the meme first gets the meme, and none shall encroach-eth upon the newly crowned Meme Lord. For their ingenuity, they are allowed to do things like charge $15 for a pin, because that's how it works. I don't love the nickname \"salt bae\"; I prefer STEAK GOD. But I'm still gonna splurge on this one. \n$15.00 here . Jad Dovey \nThis pin makes me hungry, so it's doing something right. Food pins are a dime a dozen, yet somehow I've never seen a good nachos pin. \n$10.00 here . \nThe potential is endless, folks. You can literally make a pin of anything. Go make one yourself!
