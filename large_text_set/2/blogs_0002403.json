While he has denied the authenticity of the claims, some of his family members have lent weight to the allegations, saying that he is indeed married and even the makers of the show were aware of it. I AM NOT MARRIED: MANVEER \nIn a video posted on YouTube two days ago, Manveer can be seen dressed in a white sherwani and a red pagdi , the traditional wedding attire for a groom. The video shows him with a his mother Mala Devi before the ghudchadhi ceremony , while the song Chote Chote Bhaiyyon Ke Bade Bhaiyya can be heard in the background. Some pictures of his `wife' have also been shared by multiple sources on Twitter. Manveer calls the controversy a needless publicity gimmick. He says, \"I am not married. Shaadi jaisi cheez aise chhup nahi sakti . I have been in the Bigg Boss House since October. Ab tak kisi ne to issue raise kiya hi hota . This has just been done by someone for cheap publicity and nothing else.\" HE HAS BEEN MARRIED FOR THREE YEARS: RELATIVES \nDespite Manveer's insistence that he has never been married, some of his own relatives have said that not only is he married, but the fact was known to most people in the Bigg Boss house, including the host Salman Khan. Manveer's maternal uncle Karan Singh Nagar, says, \"He was married three years ago. He also has a oneand-a-half-year-old daughter named Aashi. He never hid the fact on the show.\" \n\"He had shared it with Lopamudra Raut, Manu Punjabi and even Nitibha Kaul, who was trying to get close to him. Salman bhai , too, was told about it. There were too many intelligent people there. How did a common man rise amid them?\" he asks. \nSuresh, who is married to Manveer's cousin, says that the marriage was hidden from the public eye for a reason. \"If he had revealed his marriage, would so many girls vote for him?\" she asks. IT IS JUST A PLOY TO MALIGN HIM: BROTHER \nManveer's brother Sachin calls the entire episode a ploy to malign Manveer's good image.He tells us, \"Manveer has the image of a grounded and humble person. Throughout the show, he has been like that. He has been in the public eye for four months now. If he was married, why did nobody come and claim that till now? Doing this now when he has won and is being loved by all means it's just someone who is jealous of his achievement. They are just trying to malign him for some cheap publicity .\" \nResponding to his own relatives' claims about Manveer's wedding, Sachin says, \"I don't know why they have said all this. Manveer and I will speak to them about this. Maybe they were confused. We will need to see what exactly they said and then talk to them about it. The fact remains that the claims are false.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:47:05.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
