As late as this past Saturday, those two names rolled off the lips of scouts from other teams who had seen the right-handers as well as Adam Warren, Luis Cessa and Chad Green.\nSEE ALSO \nYankees prospect comes from out of nowhere into Opening Day picture 0:0 LAKELAND, Fla. — Joe Girardi said he was “really curious”... In some eyes, lefty Jordan Montgomery has pushed himself into the conversation, but if the rookie makes the club, it’s more likely to be in long relief. And some believe the 24-year-old would be better served opening the season in Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre’s rotation. He went 5-1 with a 0.97 ERA in six starts at Triple-A last season.\nWhen Severino got spanked for three runs and six hits in 3 1/3 innings by the Astros on Sunday in West Palm Beach, it raised the question: Do Yankees have enough starting pitching to chase a postseason bid with what they have?\nCashman, who isn’t likely to trade the prospects the organization has developed or the ones he got for Andrew Miller and Aroldis Chapman last July, says the final two starters will be decided shortly.\n“We have to lock in sooner than later,’’ Cashman said. “And one of those guys isn’t going to pitch until the 16th [of April] with days off. We have to make some decisions soon and get people in the right spots, whether it’s the bullpen or Scranton.’’\nJoe Girardi takes the ball from Luis Severino during a March 3 exhibition game. Charles Wenzelberg Those decisions could come within a few days.\n“We have had one official roster meeting and the next roster meeting is coming up this week,’’ Cashman said.\nA scout said, “For any team that has a chance to win, starting pitching is essential. The Yankees have questions in the back of the rotation, and don’t forget Sabathia and Pineda. If they somehow would get Quintana, it would make everybody there feel better.’’\nThirteen days before Opening Day against the Rays in St. Petersburg, it sounds as if the Yankees are willing to go with what is already wearing pinstripes.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:13:23.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
