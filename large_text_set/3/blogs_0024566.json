While we have speculated about how he fits with the Rams many times, today he spoke about that idea. Related: \nWhen asked about the thought of staying in his hometown, Smith-Schuster seemed to have a positive reaction. \nHe also was glad to see that the Rams signed former USC star receiver Robert Woods. Smith-Schuster added he was happy to see Robert Woods sign with the Rams. \n— Myles Simmons (@MylesASimmons) March 22, 2017 \nDuring interviews at his Pro Day, he also told reporters that he created his own character on the EA Sports Madden video game. \nHe was drafted by the Buffalo Bills and demanded a release because it was snowing in November, which is not something that he would tolerate. \nIf there’s one place in the NFL we can promise it won’t snow in the winter, it’s certainly Los Angeles. Smith-Schuster is familiar with where the Rams are playing next season — he also played at The Coliseum during college. \nPlus, Smith-Schuster has already worked out with Rams quarterback Jared Goff. Could he be destined to stay in Southern California? Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:34:36.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
