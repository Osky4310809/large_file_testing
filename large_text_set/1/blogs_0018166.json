in which banners could be seen showing solidarity with the victims of the hotel disaster in the mountains of Abruzzo - but Napoli held out for a win that moves them to within a point of leaders Juventus, having played two games more. \nFor Milan, who have won only one of their last five in the top flight, the seven-point gap to the top three is looking difficult to bridge. \nNapoli needed only six minutes to break the deadlock with a spectacular piece of counter-attacking play. \nJorginho won possession and found Mertens, who switched the play first time to Insigne, and the Italy international blasted a left-footed shot into Gianluigi Donnarumma's top-left corner from 20 yards out despite the goalkeeper getting a touch on the ball. \nThree minutes later and Napoli doubled their lead, Mertens this time sliding the ball through to Callejon down the right, and the Spaniard steadied himself before slotting beneath Donnarumma at the near post. \nNapoli's incisive one-touch passing was causing problems for Milan's high line and Mertens wasted a glorious chance for 3-0 when he beat the offside trap to reach Allan's cross only to scuff his half-volley into Donnarumma's grasp. \nMilan should have halved the deficit 10 minutes before the break but Gustavo Gomez steered his header wide when he met Giacomo Bonaventura's cross from the left unmarked near the penalty spot. \nBut moments later, Kucka kept his composure far better to prod the ball beyond Pepe Reina and into the bottom-right corner after their high press forced Lorenzo Tonelli into conceding possession. \nPasalic headed against the crossbar and Jose Sosa brought a low save from Reina inside the first three minutes of the second half as Montella's side pressed for an equaliser. \nCarlos Bacca came inches from turning Ignazio Abate's cut-back over the line before Insigne almost produced one of the goals of the season, twisting his way into space just inside the Milan half before sending a 45-yard chip onto the roof of the net. \nReina denied Bacca following a good run from Bonaventura before Mertens failed to make the points safe for Napoli, as Donnarumma - making his 50th Serie A appearance - saved low to his left to deny the Belgium winger after he broke through the Milan defence. \nCallejon became the eighth player to be booked as the game became scrappy in the closing stages, with both teams visibly tiring, but Napoli held out for a result that will give them renewed belief in their title chances.
