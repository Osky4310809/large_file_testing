Thom Tillis and Democrat Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, was joined by 30 other senators who are asking DHS chief Kelly to conduct an audit of the H-2B program and ensure that any remaining visas are properly issued to eligible businesses. \nFearing that the lowered cap for the year would soon be reached, and citing figures from 2015 which revealed about 5,000 H-2B visas went un-issued, the senators asked that any unused visas from the first half of the year be applied toward the second half. \nAs NumbersUSA noted, the H-2B visas generally go to unskilled foreign laborers who work in a variety of low-skilled jobs that could be filled by the scores of unskilled American workers without the education or experience to obtain higher paying jobs. Advertisement - story continues below \nIt is worth pointing out that, of the 32 senators who signed the letter asking for more unskilled foreign labor in the American job market, 21 of them are Republicans, with the remaining senators being 10 Democrats and one independent. \nIn addition to the authors, Tillis and Warner, the 30 senators who signed the letter are: \nJohn Barrasso (R-WY), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Richard Burr (R-NC), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tom Carper (D-DE), Bob Casey (D-PA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Thad Cochran (R-MS), Chris Coons (D-DE), Susan Collins (R-ME), John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), James Lankford (R-OK), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Patty Murray (D-WA), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Tim Scott (R-SC), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Ron Wyden (D-OR). \nThese senators have seemingly placed the wealth and well-being of foreign guest workers and the businesses who employ them above the needs of the millions of out-of-work Americans, many of whom would willingly accept jobs in the construction, landscaping, hotel, restaurant and food processing industries.
