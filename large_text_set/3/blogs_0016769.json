View HQ pics HQ pics: Ranbir Kapoor was spotted in Delhi today... By Karan Shah | Updated: March 20, 2017 8:45 pm Did Ranbir Kapoor meet Sanjay Dutt to discuss his biopic in detail? \nAmidst his busy shooting schedule for the Sanjay Dutt biopic, Ranbir Kapoor has taken a few days off and has been flying from one place to another. Just a few days ago, he was in Mumbai to launch his father’s book – Khullam Khulla . Over the weekend, he flew to Dubai and was spotted posing with Pakistani actress, Mahira Khan , at the Global Teacher Prize. And today, he landed up in Delhi. So was he visiting his alleged Dilliwali girlfriend or was it for something else? Well, let us inform you that RK was in the capital city to launch a new initiative by a leading multiplex chain. \nPVR, in association with HP, has launched a new way to engage their audience. They launched a VR (virtual reality) cinema, where the audience will able to watch a movie in the 360 degree format courtesy a VR headset. The actor arrived in formal attire, looking handsome in a grey suit and grey pants paired with a white shirt. Ranbir posed for the shutterbugs, inaugurated the cinema, experienced a movie in the VR setting and then spoke with the media gathered at the event. Check out all the high quality pictures from the event right here: \nWith 360 degree videos and virtual reality formats becoming popular, we think this new initiative will be a hit. However, we have to see how many films will be made for such formats. Certainly Ranbir’s last film – Ae Dil Hai Mushkil might not have been suitable for such a format. But his next two releases – Jagga Jasoos and Dragon can be made in this format. Jagga Jasoos is an spy-adventure which is very colourful and upbeat, while Dragon is a sci-fi, action thriller. Both these films would be interesting to watch in a 360 degree setting. Don’t you agree? So was that why RK launched this new initiative or was it only because of a brand association. Well, only time will tell.
