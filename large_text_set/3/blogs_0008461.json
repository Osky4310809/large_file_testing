We deeply apologize for offending @_that_kyle in our CPAC segment. We only learned of his condition today & have removed him from the piece. \n— Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) March 9, 2017 \nGoing a step further, a donation was made in the name of the TBS show to Coddington’s GoFundMe page , where he is hoping to raise funds to cover his growing medical expenses. \nAt the time of writing this, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee is listed as the “Largest Donor,” with a donation of $1000, with the note “We wish you the best, Kyle!” added. \nSince the uproar with Bee last night there have been upwards of 30 donations to Coddington’s page. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:50:31.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
