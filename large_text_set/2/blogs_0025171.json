More recently, a report suggested that Tata Teleservices is planning to merge with RCom-Aircel and MTS. Now it appears that another acquisition is taking place in the Indian telecom market. Bharti Airtel has announced acquisition of Telenor India. \nAirtel, the country’s largest telecom operator, announced that it has entered a definite agreement with Telenor South Asia Investments Pte Ltd (Telenor) to acquire Telenor India. Airtel will acquire the latter’s running operations in seven telecom circles in the country – Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP (East), UP (West) and Assam. \nThe proposed acquisition will include the transfer of Telenor India’s assets and 44 million customers, which will further strengthen Airtel’s overall customer base and network. Airtel currently leads the market with approx. 269 million users. Telenor holds spectrum in the 1800MHz band in the aforementioned circles in the country. Airtel will take over the spectrum, outstanding spectrum payments and other operational contracts, including tower lease. \nAirtel will ensure quality services to Telenor India’s subscribers, while offering them the added benefits of its product portfolio. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals, and before the deal goes through, Telenor India’s operations and services will continue as normal. The financial terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed yet.
