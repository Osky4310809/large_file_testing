Sukriti Gumber Feb . 15 . 2017 Hina Khan \nHina Khan made news recently when she quit Ye Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai owing to her differences with the makers of the show. It definitely came as a shock to many, as she played the lead for almost 8 years and some fans even threatened to kill themselves if she did not return to the show. Hina Khan with Rocky Jaiswal (Source: Instagram | @realhinakhan) \nThere were speculations that Hina has quit the show to marry her boyfriend Rocky Jaiswal and eventually open a production house together, but the actress completely denied those rumours. Reports are doing the rounds that Hina and Rocky were approached to be on Nach Baliye 8 , but they reportedly declined the offer. Rocky is reportedly too camera conscious and feels comfortable only behind the cameras. \nOh well, I am sure fans would have loved to see Hina back onscreen and even more so, to see her shake a leg with her beau. Amirite ? Are you listening, Hina? 14", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:13:10.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
