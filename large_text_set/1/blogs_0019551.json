The idea is to help students by offering them a way to be more creative by using these graphics and design editors on a bigger screen than a smartphone or tablet.\nSee also: Chromebooks vs other laptops – which should you get? \nIn a press release, Adobe said the following Android apps would be updated and optimized in the coming weeks to run on Chromebooks:\nPhotoshop Mix Lightroom Mobile Illustrator Draw Photoshop Sketch Adobe Comp CC Creative Cloud Mobile The apps will be updated to “capitalize on Chromebook’s strengths – speed and simplicity” and Adobe hopes that they will inspire people, especially students, to use them for their artistic projects. The company plans to launch another wave of its Android apps to Chromebook users later this year.\nThis move by Google and Adobe is just the latest to help add Android app support to more Chromebooks, which are becoming more popular among secondary school systems due to their cheaper price compared to Windows 10 notebooks. Earlier this week, Google confirmed that all of the new Chromebooks that are released in 2017 will be able to run Android apps via the Google Play Store . A few older Chromebooks can already support Android apps on the stable channel of the Chrome OS, and more are expected to be added in the coming months.\nIn addition, a Google rep stated this week that new tablets and 2-in-1 devices running Chrome OS are on their way soon, which makes this Adobe news much more exciting. With Android’s extensive library of apps combined with the desktop-like environment of Chrome OS, we could see these products take away sales from products like Microsoft’s Surface tablets and Apple’s iPad family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:41:25.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
