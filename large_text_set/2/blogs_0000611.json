this is unfair to those of us with analogue meters. \n“EKEDC should do something about our meters because the estimated billing is unbearable,’’ she said. \nAlso, Alhaji Folorunso Ishola, a resident, said it was disheartened to see neighbouring community enjoying regular power supply, while Aguda Community remained in perpetual darkness. \nIshola appealed to EKEDC to improve electricity supply to the area. \nResponding, Mr Godwin Idemudia, the General Manager, Corporate Communications Unit of EKEDC, pleaded with the consumers of the affected areas to show understanding. \nIdemudia said that the drop in power allocation from the national grid was responsible for the epileptic power supply being experienced in the area. \nHe assured the consumers that the company would do its best to ensure improved power supply was restored to the area. \nIdemudia urged them not to resort to vandalism of the company equipment as a result of the epileptic supply.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:36:11.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
