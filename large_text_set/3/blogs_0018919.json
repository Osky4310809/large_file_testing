We are focusing on the league. \n\"We will see at the end of the season if they offer me something. For the time being, there has not been an offer. Thibaut Courtois has said he is happy at Chelsea. \n\"I'm happy in London and I'm delighted with the success we are having this season.\" \nUnder new coach Antonio Conte, Chelsea are 10 points clear at the top of the Premier League and Courtois said: \"We are working well with Conte. \n\"I see that there is a long-term project to win trophies, not just domestically but also in Europe. There is a lot of ambition to play in the Champion League next season.\" \nCourtois said earlier this season he would like to return to Spain one day and added: \"I owe a lot to Spain and I go often there to visit the family, who are in Madrid. But I'm happy in London.\" \nReal Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas, meanwhile, refused to talk about reports that the club are keen to bring in another goalkeeper. \nThe Costa Rica international told Marca : \"Every player of Real Madrid is under the microscope.\" \nNavas has been under pressure this season after some mistakes, but Courtois said : \"Perhaps Keylor is not having the season he had last season, but we all know he is a very good goalkeeper.\" \nAdriana Garcia is a Valencia-based football writer who covers La Liga for ESPN FC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:22:31.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
