Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports \nYoan Moncada made his Major League Baseball debut at a young age, and it appears his son is headed in that direction, too. \nThe Chicago White Sox infielder’s son is just 2 1/2 years old, but he’s already displaying some pretty impressive bat flip skills. A video posted to Instagram on Thursday night showed little Robinson Moncada schooling all the other kids on the tee-ball field. \nHis baserunning could use some work, though. \nMoncada is MLB’s No. 2 prospect, right behind former Boston Red Sox teammate Andrew Benintendi.
