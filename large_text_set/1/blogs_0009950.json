INQUIRERFILE \nWASHINGTON, United States — Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) jihadists are using small commercial drones to attack Iraqi security forces in the battle for Mosul, a US commander said Wednesday. \nColonel Brett Sylvia, who commands an “advise and assist” US unit in Iraq, said IS fighters are attaching small munitions to quadcopters in an attempt to kill local forces as they retake Mosul, the last major IS bastion in Iraq. \n“They are small drones with small munitions that they’ve been dropping,” Sylvia said.
