A constant feature of last summer’s rumor mill, ‘Ninja’ eventually extended his tenure at the Giallorossi in October. And yet, that only earned us a temporary reprieve from the constant rumors, the latest of which comes courtesy of La Gazzetta dello Sport (via Sport Witness ), who claim that the 28-year-old will be one of our summer transfer targets. In a recent interview with Sky Sports, Nainggolan did not refuse the possibility of an exit from Roma in the future while also confirming Chelsea's past interest on his signature. His current form with AS Roma, including 12 goals and 4 assists in 43 appearances, have shown does show that despite his age, he’s not only able to contribute, but improve his influence over a team, as he had to and was able to do this season following the departure of Miralem Pjanic to Juventus. And even though he now plays as more of an attacking midfielder, Nainggolan’s defensive work remains top notch. Even though by the time Chelsea could sign him Nainggolan would be 29 years old already, he would still be very capable of contributing to the cause for many years to come. He would also bring a bit of additional competition to the midfield position, as well as being a good addition if we ever move to a three-man midfield scheme.
