Cory Booker gently chided TV star Mindy Kaling ’s alter ego Dr. Mindy Lahiri for poking fun at his hometown of Newark on her show “The Mindy Project,” NJ.com reported. \n“I guess anything to get out of Newark, huh?” Kaling’s character quipped in a recent show about Booker’s attendance at a party.\nThe crestfallen pol playfully took to Twitter to tout his beloved city’s rebirth. He linked to a Vogue article citing an infusion of new eateries that offer “a fusion of American comfort food with an Indian twist.”\nHe added a flirty “I still love you” – with an emoji heart for the “love.”\nKaling – who plays an obstetrician on the show — delivered a hearty reply, tweeting that the feelings are mutual.\n“You are making my day!” gushed Booker , 47, who is single. “Thanks for the clarification. And If the (love) is really mutual… Come have dinner with me in Newark?”\nThe smitten Kaling accepted , adding: “Now let me get the PATH train schedule.”\nEver the gentleman, Booker offered an alternative ride.\n“PATH train is awesome when you are Jersey bound. But you are @Lyft worthy! I will send one to you for the door to door,” he wrote. \n“The Mindy Project,” which began its run on Fox before moving to Hulu, is set in New York and has name-checked a bevy of politicians.\nBooker is considered a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic primary, according to a recent poll.\n  WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:04:23.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
