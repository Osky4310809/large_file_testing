Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 \nWhat remained unclear was how exactly the president-elect planned to deal with the North Korean dictator’s increasingly aggressive behavior .   \nAccording to Tong Zhao, an associate at Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, merely tightening sanctions, as an example, would have little impact on the dictator’s decision-making, as reported by CNN . \nLikewise, launching a military strike against North Korea would pose an exceptionally large risk given the nation’s nuclear arsenal, however undeveloped it may be. \n“It’s not a viable option — we are way past pre-emption,” said John Delury, associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. “North Korea is hard to punish because it has so little to lose. This is why it’s different to Iran — where there was an economy integrated with Europe, a middle class that we could use as leverage.” \nThe most viable option, according to both Zhao and Delury, was for Trump to simply sit down with the North Korean dictator and engage in a friendly chat — which Trump himself proposed during the general election, as noted by Politico .
