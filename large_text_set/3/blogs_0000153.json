The battery pack is integrated into the skateboard-like chassis of the car, making a self-contained drivetrain-and-energy-storage unit that allows for really flexible body packaging.

There’s more little bolts holding the thing together than what you’d find in an entire Ikea-furnished house, and there’s some fascinating custom-designed larger bolts, too.\nThere are multiple layers of aluminum skin, moisture shields, and even some sort of blue fluid they call “Tesla Soup” that must be extracted.
