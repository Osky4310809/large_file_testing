Let us count the ways!\nEmma Stone pulled out all the stops for her 2017 Oscars red carpet look tonight. We can always count on Emma to send jaws crashing to the floor. She brought the whole she-bang! \nThe Best Actress nominee channeled some serious ’20s glamour in her Givenchy Haute Couture gown, which was so figure-flattering with its subtle sweetheart neckline and a drop waist.\nThe lengthy netted, brocade bodice traversed into a slinky skirt, with four full layers of twirl-worthy fringe. And with her jewels kept to a minimum, save dangling gold earrings and few select rings (courtesy of Tiffany & Co), the La La Land actress struck a perfect balance between minimalist and goddess .\nFrazer Harrison/Getty \nMiss Stone, who’s a bit social media-shy without an Instagram of her own, has her season fashion stylist, Petra Flannery, to thank for tonight’s drool-worthy look. The stylist took to her own Insta to share a sneak peek of Emma as she headed out the door, captioning the snapshot , “Out the door… #GivenchyHauteCoutre.”\n#EmmaStone Out the Door in #GivenchyHauteCouture... \nA post shared by Petra Flannery (@petraflannery) on Feb 26, 2017 at 4:37pm PST \nWhew , we’re not sure if this whoa-worthy gown looks better from the front or the back!\nSteve Granitz/Getty Images And if you whip out your magnifying glass and look very closely, you’ll note that Emma’s also sporting a Planned Parenthood pin.\nFrom her gorgeous gown to her bold crimson lips and retro finger waves, this look is truly worthy of an Oscar-winning star. Now, best of luck tonight, Emma!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:31:15.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
