You won’t regret it Your Privacy Rights Canadian Customers \nThis pasta dish is a new way to combine the greatest things in life: Steak and carbs. It’s a twist on meat and potatoes that’s just as easy to whip up after work. And it provides 33 grams of protein to keep you satisfied and boost your muscle gains. Really, why has no one thought of this sooner? \nWhat you'll need: \n½ cup sun dried tomatoes in olive oil \n1 garlic clove \n¼ cup flat leaf parsley, chopped \n2 Tbsp. basil leaves, chopped \n2 tsp. red wine vinegar \nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper \n8 oz. flank steak \nParmesan cheese for garnish \nHow to make it: \n1. Cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, reserving ½ cup cooking water. Meanwhile, in a food processor, pulse together tomatoes and garlic. Scrape down sides, add parsley, basil, and vinegar and pulse until combined. Toss warm pasta with ¾ of the tomato mixture, adding some of the pasta cooking water to thin, if needed. \n2. Heat a grill pan over medium heat. Season steak with salt and pepper, grill until medium, about 4 minutes on each side. Spread remaining tomato mixture on one side of the steak and rest for 5 minutes. Thinly slice steak and serve atop the pasta, with a sprinkle parmesan cheese.
