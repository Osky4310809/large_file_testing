So is Donald Trump.\nMuch of liberal America is in an absolute tizzy over his impending presidency, with denunciations and declarations of defiance competing for the most apocalyptic scenarios. Will the world end Friday or Saturday?\nThe sturm und drang is not limited to the homefront. Europe is reeling from Trump’s salvo that Brexit is a “good thing” and NATO is “obsolete.”\nAnd China threatens to “take off the gloves” if Trump keeps flirting with Taiwan.\nBut if the president-elect is rattled or even worried about the turmoil, he’s doing a masterful job of concealing it.\nWhen I visited his Manhattan office Monday, he was more zen than elevator music.\nDays from his inauguration, Trump was the calmest man in America. Smiling, gracious, making jokes, laughing at mine, tossing off asides to an aide — if you didn’t know what he’s been through and the awesome responsibility he’s about to assume, you never would have guessed it.\nTo be sure, he was hardly oblivious or giddy. It was the holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. and the papers were filled with stories of Trump’s dispute with civil-rights icon John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat . Lewis started the row by saying he would boycott the inauguration because he sees Trump as an “illegitimate president,” which is a shockingly cheap shot.\nYet, predictably, most journalists hammered Trump’s counterpunch, a tweet that said Lewis “should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart.” Predictably again, Trump was accused of being racially insensitive to a black hero on the day that honors Martin Luther King Jr.\n“So unfair,” Trump said, referring to The New York Times’ tilted story, which led the front page. “It’s really dishonest.”\nIt occurred to me that this was in contrast to his Twitter personality, which gives the impression that he is almost always angry\nHis tone was more matter-of-fact than outraged, and it occurred to me that this was in contrast to his Twitter personality, which gives the impression that he is almost always angry. The platform might serve him better if he used it more often as a happy warrior.\nMy personal experience with Trump is limited, but I have known many public figures who would have spent days curled in the fetal position if they had taken half the pounding he’s endured the last 18 months. Even a single false accusation of racial insensitivity would have sent most to the medicine cabinet and the bottle.\nThen there’s that new life Trump starts Friday at noon. Maybe it hasn’t hit him yet, but he shows no sign of being intimidated about becoming the most powerful man in the world, #45 in the line that starts with George Washington and includes Abraham Lincoln, FDR, JFK and Ronald Reagan.\nHe showed some spark when he mentioned his meeting with the head of Lockheed-Martin about the soaring cost of the F-35 aircraft. I asked if it was true the company had offered $600 million in reduced costs. He nodded yes and said, “We saved $600 million in half an hour’s work.”\nAt that, I said I’d like to ask some questions I’d prepared, figuring they would light his ire.\nI started with President Obama’s latest poison pill, of having the Justice Department investigate FBI Director James Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton probe . I asked Trump if he would push to have the inspector general widen the review and examine all the evidence, including whether Clinton should have been indicted.\n“We have not gotten into that yet,” he said calmly, before saying Comey had treated Clinton “extremely well” by not recommending criminal charges.\nSEE ALSO \nDOJ watchdog to investigate FBI's handling of Hillary email probe :0 Federal watchdogs on Thursday announced a wide-ranging investigation into how... DOJ watchdog to investigate FBI's handling of Hillary email probe I then raised the prospect of his being tested soon after taking office, saying it’s almost a ritual that each new president gets tested by a foreign adversary. What do you expect and from where?\nAs I mentally raced through possibilities, he cut my speculation short. “I don’t think we’re going to be tested,” he said. “I’m not a game player. They understand me.”\nWhat about Iran, I said, thinking it was a likely source.\n“It’s a terrible deal,” he said. “Frankly, it’s worse for Israel than it is us, but it’s terrible.”\nChina? “It will all be fine” he started benignly, before switching to the trade deals he pledged to fix or scuttle. “We have a big problem with China,” he said, more emphatically. “They’ve been sapping our wealth through these horrible, horrible trade deals. Everybody takes advantage of us, but the trade deals are just so bad.”\nAt that point, Peter Thiel, the entrepreneur and philanthropist, walked into the office, and after brief bantering, I stood up to leave. I wished Trump Godspeed and walked out, uncertain of what I had learned.\nLater, it hit me — I had witnessed something important and wonderful. Donald Trump is a man at peace with his responsibility.\nThe next leader of America is standing strong in a world gone mad. Tested by fire, he is calm, confident and ready for action as he approaches\nThis rendezvous with history. May God smile on his tenure.\nBlas blows big chance The new year hasn’t improved Mayor de Blasio’s sense of duty to the city.\nInstead of looking to find ways to reap benefits with a New Yorker in the Oval Office, Mayor Putz is devoting his energies to antagonizing Donald Trump. \nSpeaking at Al Sharpton’s headquarters, de Blasio urged the crowd gathered for Martin Luther King Jr. Day to join him at a protest against Trump Thursday night at Columbus Circle.\n“It’ll be our last chance to be together under the leadership of President Obama,” the mayor said.\nImagine that. Our rabble rouser in chief is taking time off from his gym workouts to protest the next president. No doubt he also supports those Democrats in Congress who are boycotting the inauguration. And dropping Obama’s name at the Sharpton event was a not-so-veiled effort to keep black voters in his corner.\nWith all the problems the city faces, especially the endless tide of homelessness, you would think de Blasio would use his time to try to find solutions. Instead, he’s looking out for the only problem he’s worried about — his next election.\nYou’re on your own, New York.\nOur mess of a press Among media critics, reader Denis Ian goes to the head of the class. He calls the Washington press corps “that mangy collection of venomous scribblers, news-benders, and camera-mugging intolerants who decided what one should and shouldn’t think. They were more likely to create the news than report it. They lied out of habit, persuaded out of bias, and never felt a bit of shame because not a soul in that great piss-pot knows of such a thing.”\nStrong letter to follow.\nRed-hot health tip A new study says eating chili peppers may add years to your life.
