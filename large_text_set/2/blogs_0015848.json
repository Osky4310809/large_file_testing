And, well, the Long An players weren't impressed. \nNow most teams surround the referee, voice their frustration, say a few choice things and, finally, get on with the game - maybe on a booking - when they're in a similar situation. \nBut as the above video shows, this particular V-League side deal with things a little differently. Don't turn your back on me! \nAfter conceding a spot-kick, the opposition team simply go on protest. \nIt's a relatively bizarre tactic and does them absolutely no favours whatsoever, but the match footage is pretty hilarious as a result. \nAfter coaxing the goalkeeper back in between the sticks - which takes some time - the referee blows his whistle and watches in shock as he turns his back on the penalty-taker. This is surprisingly easy What. On. Earth \nThe striker of course hits the back of the net and heads to the centre circle for kick-off, before his side run the full length of the pitch to score another. \nThe Ho Chi Minh City player is able to do so because every single member of the opposition team is still in protest, and not one person makes an effort to stop him in his tracks. \nOh, and of course, because the goalkeeper does a ROLY-POLY to get out of his way. \nUnbelievable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T19:33:31.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
