Marriott team hotel in Houston. Michael Madrid-USA TODAY Sports \nMartellus Bennett is one of the most creative players in the NFL, and the charismatic tight end furthered that notion with a new project Wednesday. \nBennett released a mixtape to his SoundCloud page bluntly titled, “I’m Not A Rapper But Some Of My Friends Are…” \nThe five-track EP was a fun, artistic outlet for Bennett, as he explained in a message on his SoundCloud profile. \n“I am not a rapper but some of my friends are..” is exactly what the title says it it is,” Bennett writes. “It was just me and some of my friends hanging out in the studio making music for fun and this is what came out of it. Pretty cool to have so many talented friends and be able to create with them at a high level. I am on a mission to express my creativity in as many ways as possible in 2017, this is a part of my creative journey. Enjoy.” \nDespite Bennett having moved on from the Patriots, he appears to still have support from his old teammates in New England. Pats wideout Julian Edelman evidently is a big fan of Bennett’s project, as he shared on his Instagram story Wednesday.
