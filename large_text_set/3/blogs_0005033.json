A still image taken from an Islamic State (ISIS) video . (photo credit:REUTERS) \n\"Dress up like a Jew and make sure you have plenty of weapons under your coat,\" is only one part of the chilling statement recently made by ISIS fanatics in a call for fellow extremists to \"terrorize\" Jewish communities in the West. According to the Daily Mail , the call to arms first appeared on an ISIS-affiliated Telegram channel named Lone Mujahid, an online chat room in which aspiring terrorists encourage one another to carry out lone wolf attacks. Shin Bet: Israeli citizen arrested for attempting to join ISIS in Syria The full post read: \"IF YOU'RE STILL IN THE WEST! Dress up like a Jew! Go to your nearest Jewish area! Make sure you have plenty of weapons under your coat!\" and then urged followers to \"unleash the pain of Muslims\" on the potential victims. The Daily Mail reported that an additional message included a list of Jewish communities in Britain for jihadists to target in their attacks. This post was accompanied by a photo of Amedy Coulibaly, the Islamist gunman who carried out the Hyper Casher terror attack in Paris , France on January 9, 2015. Coulibaly, whose image is often used by ISIS-linked terrorists to hail terror attacks in the name of Islam, killed a French policewoman in a Paris suburb and then murdered four hostages at a kosher supermarket before being shot dead by police. Pointing at Jews as a favorable target once more, the post then called on fanatics to follow Coulibaly's lead: \"Take the brother's example and terrorize the Yahood [Jew].\" Relevant to your professional network?
