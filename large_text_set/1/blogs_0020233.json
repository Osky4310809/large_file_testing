During the TV spot called \"Reign\", John Goodman (who plays Bill Randa) talks about all the ships and planes that have gone down within the vicinity of Skull Island ( via CinemaBlend ). He goes on to say that the nuclear tests in 1954 weren't tests at all, but in fact were attacks against an unknown entity. \nThat entity they are referring to is not actually Kong as you might think. They are instead talking about Godzilla. In that film, footage is shown of bombing in 1954 (the year Randa references in Skull Island). The best part? 1954 is the year the original Godzilla debuted in Japan. \nFor longtime fans, it's a cool reference to the source material, and the studio would do well to keep that subtle tone as they continue to build out their universe. \nKong: Skull Island reimagines the origin of the mythic Kong in a compelling, original adventure from director Jordan Vogt-Roberts. In the film, a diverse team of explorers is brought together to venture deep into an uncharted island in the Pacific—as beautiful as it is treacherous—unaware that they’re crossing into the domain of the mythic Kong. Kong: Skull Island stars Tom Hiddleston ( Thor: Ragnarok ), Samuel L. Jackson ( The Avengers ), Oscar-winner Brie Larson ( Room ), John Goodman ( 10 Cloverfield Lane ) and John C. Reilly ( Guardians of the Galaxy ). The international ensemble cast also includes Tian Jing, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, John Ortiz, Thomas Mann, Shea Whigham, Toby Kebbell and Eugene Cordero. Jordan Vogt-Roberts ( The Kings of Summer ) directs the film from a screenplay by Max Borenstein, John Gatins, Dan Gilroy and Derek Connolly. The film is produced by Legendary’s Thomas Tull and Jon Jashni with Mary Parent. The executive producers are Eric McLeod and Alex Garcia. \nKong: Skull Island hits theaters on March 10, 2017. Godzilla 2 is scheduled for March 22, 2018. MonsterVerse is slated for May 29, 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T19:12:35.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
