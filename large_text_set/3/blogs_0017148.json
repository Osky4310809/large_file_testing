Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA British mum who accuses her ex-partner of violence and threats has told how he is using a local law in Cyprus to trap her and her children on the island. \nFormer partner Ali Reza Poor Akbar, known as Alex, has allegedly terrorised Paula Clifford for years. \nThe bodybuilder is due in court tomorrow to face two claims of domestic abuse – and a charge of burning down a pub where she worked. \nBut Paula can’t fly home to get away from Akbar because he obtained a legal order putting their daughter Alexa, five, on a “stop list”, the Daily Record reported . \nIt means Paula will be arrested if she tries to take her child out of the country, so she must stay in Cyprus with Alexa and older daughter Calli, nine, from a previous relationship.

Please someone, help me. \n“Alex doesn’t want custody of our daughter. The ‘stop list’ is just a way of punishing me.” Paula Clifford's ex-bofriend Ali Reza (Photo: Collect) \nAkbar, 39, is an asylum seeker from Iran. He was deported in 2005 but returned to Cyprus. \nHe lived illegally on the island until Paula made a domestic violence complaint against him. He was then detained by police and deported for a second time in October 2014. \nBut Akbar returned to Cyprus again, and has been able to use the law to trap Paula despite his immigration record. \nGlasgow-born Paula moved to Cyprus in 2004 and met Akbar five years later. \nShe said: “I’d just broken up with Calli’s dad and I was vulnerable. I don’t usually like bodybuilder types but he was charming and showed an interest in me even though I already had a child. \n“But he was the worst mistake of my life. He was so jealous and controlling. I finally plucked up the courage to leave him in 2013, but I’m still a prisoner.” Read More 'I befriended a MONSTER': Jealous colleague stabbed woman 20 times when she didn't want to be his girlfriend \nPaula is set to testify against Akbar this week when he appears in court in Famagusta. \nAs well as the claims of domestic abuse, he is accused of setting fire to the Luke Kelly Irish Bar in Ayia Napa in 2011. \nPaula said she tried to tell local police about the fire, but was ignored. She claims she was only taken seriously when she contacted officers in the capital, Nicosia. \nShe also claimed police failed to help her last year when she asked them to remove Akbar from outside her home. \n“The scariest thing is that they ignored my emergency calls,” she said. \n“I was phoning, crying and begging but nobody came. I made an official complaint.” \nEast Renfrewshire MP Kirsten Oswald has taken up Paula’s case and written to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on her behalf. She said: “I’m advised that Ms Clifford is living in fear of her former partner. \n“I understand he has subjected her to repeated domestic abuse and threats, which have been documented. \n“With his history of criminality and violence, it is clear Mr Akbar presents a credible threat to Ms Clifford and her young daughters.” \nBut in a reply to Oswald, Foreign Office Minister Alan Duncan said they could not “interfere with another country’s legal processes” to help Paula. \nHe added: “I understand a hearing is due to take place on March 28 about removing the \nstop file on the passport of her daughter Alexa.I would like to reassure you that consular staff are in regular contact with Ms Clifford and continue to offer her assistance.” \nAyia Napa police chief Detective Inspector Paris Paraskeva insisted his force have done everything possible to help Paula. He said: “We spent hundreds of hours on this case, maybe a thousand, and investigated all the reports. \n“But I can’t say anything about the case. This is a matter before the court with suspects.” \nAkbar did not respond to our requests for comment.
