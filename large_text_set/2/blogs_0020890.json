NASCAR want’s its involvement in the movie to build a younger fan base, and the best way to do that is by using drivers who represent the future of stock car racing. \nEven heading into just his second season, Elliott is one of the most-popular drivers in Cup. Suarez is a highly anticipated young talent, as well as the first Mexican driver to race in Cup. Wallace might not yet be in the spotlight, but even at the Xfinity level he’s made a name for himself throughout the sport. \nMost importantly, though, all four drivers are extremely active on social media, which essentially is a requirement for any modern athlete who wants to be seen as marketable. \nThis article first appeared on NESN.com and was syndicated with permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:26:49.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
