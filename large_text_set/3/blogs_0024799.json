On Thursday Chuck appeared on The Dan Patrick Show and made one of the most bizarre pitches in sports broadcast history .\nBarkley: “You know what we should do for ratings? If I get a disease and I’m gonna die, how about you get Skip Bayless in here and I’ll kill him live on national television.”\nPatrick: “I like it. Like pay-per-view.”\nBarkley: “No, no, no. Just get him in here. Only when I know Imma die….Cause I just want to get Skip Bayless in a room one time and beat him like a dog.”\nPatrick: “So you’d kill him.”\nBarkley: “Yes. Only if I knew I was gonna die. Not if I’m gonna live, cause I don’t wanna go to prison. Cause like Mahorn say, ‘they would love you in prison.'”\nSo the general premise is that a terminally ill, dying Charles Barkley would have a fight to the death with Skip Bayless — broadcast on TV like the world’s weirdest Hunger Games. \nThe strangest part about Chuck’s pitch is that he doesn’t want this on PPV. He wants it to be democratic and free for the whole world to watch him eviscerate a fellow broadcaster on live TV. On the one hand I abhor violence in all forms, but on the other ...\nEither LeBron is the biggest finger-pointing diva in sports - Drama King - or he's coming apart under the pressure to repeat. Bizarre rants.\n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) March 23, 2017 If you want to watch Barkley’s proposal it begins around 40:50 in this video.\nh/t Uproxx \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:35:22.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
