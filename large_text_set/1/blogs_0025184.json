Sean Bratches, an American TV sports executive, becomes commercial operations managing director as part of a new-look F1 management structure. \nBrawn returns to Formula 1 \nLiberty Media's statement carried quotes from Ecclestone, who said: \"I'm proud of the business that I built over the last 40 years and all that I have achieved with Formula 1, and would like to thank all of the promoters, teams, sponsors and television companies that I have worked with. Sky Sports News HQ's Craig Slater on Ecclestone no longer running Formula 1 \n\"I'm very pleased that the business has been acquired by Liberty and that it intends to invest in the future of F1. I am sure that Chase will execute his role in a way that will benefit the sport.\" \nEcclestone earlier told German magazine Auto, Motor and Sport he had been \"deposed\". \nCarey said: \"I am excited to be taking on the additional role of CEO. F1 has huge potential with multiple untapped opportunities. I have enjoyed hearing from the fans, teams, FIA, promoters and sponsors on their ideas and hopes for the sport. \n\"We will work with all of these partners to enhance the racing experience and add new dimensions to the sport and we look forward to sharing these plans overtime. Martin Brundle says it is the right time for Ecclestone to step down \n\"I would like to recognise and thank Bernie for his leadership over the decades. The sport is what it is today because of him and the talented team of executives he has led, and he will always be part of the F1 family. \n\"Bernie's role as chairman emeritus befits his tremendous contribution to the sport and I am grateful for his continued insight and guidance as we build F1 for long-term success and the enjoyment of all those involved.\" \nRetired 2016 champion Nico Rosberg was the first of the sport's big names to react on social media, tweeting: \"Bernie, mega job! But a change has been overdue. Mr. Carey, all the best in making our sport awesome again.\" \nSky F1's Martin Brundle tweeted: \"Part of me is very sad that Bernie is heading for the exit, part of me is very excited that we can take a necessary and new direction in F1.\" \nNew McLaren chief Zak Brown, who had previously been linked with a job with F1's new owners before accepting his role at the Woking team, paid tribute to Ecclestone while also welcoming Liberty and its plans for the sport. \n\"Formula 1 wouldn't be the international sporting power-house that it is today without the truly enormous contribution made over the past half-century by Bernie Ecclestone,\" said Brown. \"Indeed, I can't think of a single other person who has had anything like as much influence on building a global sport as he has. \n\"Bernie will be a very hard act to follow, but he's created a fantastic springboard from which Chase Carey and his Liberty Media colleagues will be able to take Formula 1 forward and make it even bigger and even better. And we at McLaren will be eager to help them - indeed we already enjoy great relationships with the Liberty Media principals and we're looking forward to working very closely with them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:40:20.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
