And Washington, D.C. is just the start. \nHuge crowds also gathered in Los Angeles and New York, not to mention the marches in cities like Boston, Denver, and Chicago . All around the world, women have gathered for marches and demonstrations that span all seven continents. Even in Antarctica, women are joining in . \nAmongst those marchers, some of our favorite celebrities are taking a stand and speaking up. Stars like Zendaya, Emma Watson, Gina Rodriguez, Chrissy Teigen and more out on the streets, and the sight of them fighting with everyone else is making our hearts absolutely burst. \nBut we don’t want to speak for them, so here, in their own words and posts, are some of these amazing women using their platform to elevate the message. \nSi se puede. pic.twitter.com/DesrVrJ6bv \n— Gina Rodriguez (@HereIsGina) January 21, 2017 @happyhippiefdn @womensmarch @womensmarchla #womensmarchla #WMLA #whyimarch #hearourvoice #hh4pp \nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jan 21, 2017 at 2:35pm PST \nToday at the #womensmarch in LA introducing U2's The Edge!!
