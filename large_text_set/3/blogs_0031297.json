Over the course of each episode, the contestants will tackle a different theme, hand-making items in different disciplines — the difficulty of which increase as the competition unfolds.\nDescribed by NBC as a \"friendly competition\" that will be filmed in a \"serene outdoor setting\" (perhaps they'll borrow Ron's secret cabin in the woods), the show will crown a winner at the end of the six week journey, but the focus will be on \"the characters and camaraderie of those who enjoy creating their own crafts, all under the comedic guidance of Poehler and Offerman,\" per the press release.\nBoth Poehler and Offerman share a passion for craftsmanship — Poehler is a self-proclaimed crafting novice, while Offerman, much like his stoic Parks and Rec character, is well known for his love of woodworking, and even owns his own store, Offerman Woodshop, in Los Angeles.\n“I’m thrilled to be celebrating artists who make things by hand, and I’m looking forward to finally conquering my fear of paper mache,” Poehler said.\nSEE ALSO: Makeup artist's Ron Swanson makeover is superb as a plate of bacon\nAdded Offerman: “People who make things are my favorite kind of folk. Practical, clever and terrific in a pinch. That makes me tickled pink to have a front row seat at this prodigious display of talent, and admiring and cheering on an amazing crop of American makers. Plus, Amy and I have a strong tradition of tomfoolery so let’s see if we don’t have some good fun.”\nThe show is currently looking for participants — noting that artisans and makers of any type, or any creative person who loves making things by hand, are welcome.\nHere's hoping all of the contestants live by the immortal wisdom of Ron Swanson: \"Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.\"\nWATCH: Simply Genius Shower Thoughts With Nick Offerman", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IQnBKccw1g7TjcRdehVjYRT1z_M=/http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fthumbs%2FvKgJRrwb.jpg", "https://thehandmadeproject.castingcrane.com/age-gate", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/vKgJRrwb.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-29T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:48:18.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
