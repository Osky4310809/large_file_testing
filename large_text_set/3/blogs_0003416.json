This includes setting up the Naza Premira Technical Centre at the same location, which is responsible for after sales service. \n“With this initiative, we ensure that our customers will have an ease of mind when buying any of our products where we provide complete services via our Sales, Service and Spare Parts,” said Farouk Faisal, chief operating officer of Naza Premira. Farouk also said Naza Premira currently has RM2 million worth of parts and accessories in inventory, with a further RM300,000 worth of stock at authorised dealers. \nThe Piaggio Motoplex Concept Showroom will have its official launching in the second quarter of 2017. Owners of Piaggio, Vespa and Aprilia scooters and motorcycles may also have their machines serviced at 23 authorised service centres nationwide.
