Dumlao   2:35pm The NPA said the attacks was a response to complaints of police abuse from villagers. The STAR/File photo LA TRINIDAD, Philippines — Officers manning the town police station in remote Mablicong, Abra that New People's Army rebels raided Sunday night will undergo investigation. The Cordillera police leadership has formed a Special Investiation Task Group headed by Senior Superintendent Gregorio Lim, deputy regional director for administration, to check for operational lapses. Around 30 communist rebels reportedly raided the town’s police station, which is temporarily housed at the abandoned home of Malibcong Mayor Benido Bacuyag. The guerrillas occupied the station for an hour and took seven M16 rifles, three pistols and four mobile phones. Reinforcing police officers headed by Senior Superintendent Alberto Tagum, provincial director, were ambushed by rebels on the way to the town proper Monday morning. PO2 Jessie Trinidad and PO1s Marlon dela Paz, Gerome Baldos, Kennon Sanggoy and Von Harold Layao were hurt in the ensuing firefight. Cordillera police director Chief Superintdendent Elmo Sarona reminded all police persoonel to be alert at all times to prevent similar incidents. He ordered all chiefs of police under his command to intensify their crime prevention efforts and strengthen security. Abra Gov. Jocelyn Valera-Bernos said all policemen deployed in Malibcong were pulled out and relieved with those coming from the Cordillera regional headquarters. Abra is presently on heightened alert. NPA: 'Tokhang' abuses prompted Sunday raid Meanwhile, communist guerrillas said complaints by villagers against the police’s “Oplan Tokhang” prompted Sunday’s raid on the headquarters of the Mablicong town police. Martin Montana, spokesperson of the New People's Army-Ilocos in congratulating the Abra-based Agustin Begnalen Command said, Sunday’s raid was meant to punish the police for abuses on villagers during various “Oplan Tokhang” operations and for disrespecting indigenous socio-political structures in the villages. The attack was the latest attack by the NPA in the Cordillera after rebels torched two trucks of the Philex Mining Corporation in Itogon, Benguet last week.
