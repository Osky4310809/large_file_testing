We’re now on month six, so we have two more months.

(Photo: Charlie's Chance) \n“So for now as we plan more events to fundraise for further treatment it doesn’t mean we stop helping other families in our position. It just means that we will concentrate on getting Charlie to Seattle again for now. \n“Please say your prayers, light your candles and if you would like to help with fundraising it will be greatly appreciated. Thanks as always for your continued support. \n“We just plod on. It’s just another hiccup on this journey to getting Charlie better. \n“Stay positive always.” Read More Mum's fury after tot's chicken pox pictures used by Facebook scammers who claim he has cancer for 'likes' \nLiverpool FC legend Steven Gerrard was among the kindhearted Scousers who supported Charlie last year, making a donation of £25,000. \nCharlie’s family and friends have managed to raise £1,500 in just a few days for the new appeal and are setting up a new online fundraising page.

We’re also starting a new fundraising page, because at the moment people might see that it’s at £160,000 and it could stop them from donating. \n“The support from everyone has been incredible – that’s never been in doubt from day one – and we want to thank them for it.” \nUpdates on Charlie’s Chance and fundraising events can be found at https://www.facebook.com/CharliesChancefoundation or @Charlieschance on Twitter. \nA new fundraising page is in the process of being set up, but donations can be made through the first Charlie’s Chance appeal page at https://www.gofundme.com/charlie-schance Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:48:28.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
