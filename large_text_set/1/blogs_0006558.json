It’s still up. In this instance, however, the link features a still shot from the video that is nothing short of rank porn. Consequently, a duly-edited screenshot will have to suffice: Twitter screenshot/joshtpm, YouTube screenshot/tpmtv \nMarshall’s commentary —“They did say targeting close associates”— remains strangely, amusingly cryptic. \nMarshall’s link goes to Pornhub.com, the gi-normous pornography website. \nIn the video, Angela is an aggressive brunette with purple streaks in her hair. For a while, she wears a black teddy with purple racing stripes. \nStrawberry is a redhead who temporarily wears frilly black underwear and a sexy leopard-print top. \nThe video is decidedly and completely not safe for work . Pretty much everything that two lesbians have ever done to each other at any point in human history without using machinery happens over the course of just over 25 minutes. \nThe video has been viewed over 45,000 times. \nOver 80 percent of Pornhub’s discerning porn viewers approve of the video, according to a tally below the view counter. \nRecent comments below the video are amusing. \n“Did anyone else come here for the political commentary and leave disappointed?” asks one commenter. \n“I masturbate to Das Kapital,” quips another. \n“Josh Marshall has excellent taste in lesbian porn,” says still another. \nMarshall, twice a graduate of fancypants Ivy League universities and the 2007 recipient of the Polk Award for Legal Reporting, is not backing down from his apparent love of the porn video showing lesbians absolutely working each other over. \nOn Saturday afternoon, he tweeted: Got an email form Eve Peyser at Gizmodo asking about my tweet last night. Here’s what I sent her. pic.twitter.com/SOTbta2cP6 \n— Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) December 31, 2016 \nMarshall is not the first person to be embroiled in possible embarrassment because he sent a bunch of people to a video among Pornhub’s vast treasure trove. \nIn 2015, Drexel University law professor Lisa T. McElroy accidentally sent a pornography website link — to an entire class — containing a video of a woman stuffing herself with a generous bounty of anal beads. (RELATED: Law Professor Emails SHOCKING Porn Video To Entire Class) \n“I thought this article on brief writing would be interesting to all of you,” the text of the McElroy’s corresponding email explained. \nThe link went to a video which was very appropriately titled “She Loves Her Anal Beads.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T01:54:39.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
