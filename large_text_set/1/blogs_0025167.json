The Washington Post first reported the conversation.\nTrump has made the false claims before, tweeting in late November that he had \"won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\"\nHillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes but lost the Electoral College to Trump.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:28:05.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
