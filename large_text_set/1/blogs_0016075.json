The basic white T-shirts have been perfected to wear with just about anything, while other options like the Disco Pant and bodysuits are tried-and-true pieces that work for day or night. At the company's peak, almost every girl you knew was wearing a pair of leggings or a skater skirt from the brand. On the negative side of things, American Apparel also had its fair share of scandal when it came to sexual harassment allegations against founder Dov Charney. The shocking, objectifying ads also didn't do the brand many favors.

Late last year, the company closed the majority of its stores in the U.K., as well. The news comes after Canadian wholesale company Gildan Activewear won an auction to acquire the brand's intellectual property and some of its manufacturing equipment for $88 million. While Gildan had initially indicated that it would assume some of the companyâ€™s manufacturing operations, it has decided not to take over the American brands' stores or U.S. factories. The 110 U.S. stores are set to close by April 2017.
