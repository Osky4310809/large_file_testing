What’s the one thing that bothers you about him?” \nThe Fox host, who agreed with Hewitt’s assessment that Trump has kept his campaign promises so far, said that it might, in fact, be the president’s stick-to-itivness that has hurt him. Hannity said Trump is “not a perfect person.” \n“The difference between Trump and, say, other politicians, … they’ll say anything to get elected,” he told Hewitt. “[Trump] just stuck to what he believed in, and maybe that’s a fault.” \nHannity added that Trump perhaps “shouldn’t tweet out every thought he has,” ultimately concluding, “Maybe he’s a little too sensitive at times, I think.” \nDisapproval of the president’s Twitter behavior is not a new phenomenon. \nTrump has unnerved his fellow Republicans with his tweets, his campaign staffers tried — and failed — to reign in his use of the social media platform and earlier this month Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters he wishes the president would tweet less frequently. . @SenateMajLdr McConnell says what we’re all thinking: “I’m not a great fan of daily tweets.” https://t.co/Y3ls2PTFcA \n— Tré Goins-Phillips (@tregp) February 17, 2017 \n“I’ve been pretty candid with [Trump] and with all of you that I’m not a great fan of daily tweets,” he told reporters on Feb. 17. “What I am a fan of is what he’s actually been doing.” \nMcConnell went on to say he believes Trump’s actions so far have been similar to those of any other potential Republican president, again adding: “I’m not a fan of the extra discussion that he likes to engage in, but we’re gonna soldier on.” \n“We like his positions,” he continued, “and we’re gonna pursue them as vigorously as we can.” \nBut for all of Trump’s activity on Twitter, it hasn’t actually helped the social media company’s bottom line, which has been suffering in recent years, according to NBC News . \nWhile Trump certainly makes news on Twitter, most Americans find out about the 140-character messages via cable news, Facebook or their friends. According to Debra Williamson, an analyst with eMarketer, that’s always been Twitter’s problem. \n“Everybody knows what Twitter is. But not that many people use Twitter,” she told NPR . “And they’ve been fighting that perception, which has turned mostly into a reality over the past few years.” \nFor what it’s worth, though, it doesn’t appear Trump will be giving up Twitter any time soon. After all, in 2012, the president said he loves Twitter because, in his words, “It’s like owning your own newspaper — without the losses.” I love Twitter…. it's like owning your own newspaper— without the losses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T20:55:37.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
