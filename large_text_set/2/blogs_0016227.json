I assure you, V.A.T.S. in VR is awesome. We love it.\" \nHe continues: \"We're lucky that the action isn't super twitchy. Given the size of the world and the amount that you're moving in Fallout 4 that part is tricky because you're doing it a lot. Right now we're doing the teleport warp thing and that's fine, but we're experimenting with a few other [techniques].\" \nFallout 4 in its virtual reality state sounds exciting, however is without a concrete release date as yet. Many would argue VR is yet to realise its full potential at this stage, but Howard seems confident The Commonwealth is somewhere the technology can thrive. \"It's going great,\" he says. \"It's definitely the right game for us to do.\" \nGlixel's interview with Todd Howard can be read in full over here .
