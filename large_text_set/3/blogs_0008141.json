Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. \nPresident Trump tweeted positively about the bill on Tuesday, though making clear it is being offered “for review and negotiation.”   \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017 \nClub for Growth president and former Indiana Congressman David McIntosh dubbed the proposal “RyanCare” and announced it will be a “key vote” on its congressional scorecard. \nOne of McIntosh’s main critiques is that it does not include “the critical free-market solution of selling health insurance across state lines.”   \nHeritage Action president Michael Needham was equally as critical. \n“Rather than accept the flawed premises of Obamacare, congressional Republicans should fully repeal the failed law and begin a genuine effort to deliver on longstanding campaign promises that create a free-market health care system that empowers patients and doctors,” he said . \nMeanwhile, FreedomWorks panned the GOP bill as “ObamaCare-Lite,” and Americans for Prosperity labeled it “ObamaCare 2.0.” \nFormer House Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Jordan announced he will be introducing legislation on Wednesday, which Republicans in the House and Senate voted for in December 2015 fully repealing ObamaCare, and stated he supports Sen. Rand Paul’s, R-Ky., separate bill to replace to the Affordable Care Act.   \n— Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 1, 2017 \nJordan called the Republican leadership’s plan, “ObamaCare in a different form.” \n“Think about this,” he said. “We put on President Obama’s desk a plan that repealed ObamaCare, got rid of every single tax, got rid of the mandates. And now, the first thing the Republicans are bringing forward is a piece of legislation that we’re going to put on a Republican president’s desk that says we repeal it, but keeps Medicaid expansion and actually expands it. That keeps some of the tax increases.” \nThe congressman stated, “That is not what we promised the American people we were going to do.” Jordan: \"Tomorrow I will introduce the bill that every…Republican voted on just 15 months ago, the bill that actually repeals ObamaCare.\" pic.twitter.com/aTnfvR7Xac \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) March 7, 2017 \nIf the House Freedom Caucus and its three dozen members vote as a block against the Ryan-backed bill, it appears dead on arrival, unless Democrat members can be brought on board. \nAdditionally, the Republicans only hold a 52-48 advantage in the senate, and Sens. Paul and Mike Lee, R-Utah, have already come out in opposition to the plan. \nHadley Heath Manning, healthcare policy director with the Independent Women’s Forum, said the GOP leadership plan has some “good ideas,” but “the problem is what it leaves undone.” \"Standing in the middle of the road is very dangerous; you get knocked down by the traffic from both sides.\"– Thatcher on House GOP HC bill \n— Hadley Heath Manning (@HadleyHeath) March 7, 2017 \nShe told Western Journalism, “It’s clear Republicans are trying to build consensus, but sometimes efforts to please everyone result in pleasing no one.” What do you think?
