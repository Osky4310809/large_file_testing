She had talked to her students about the Women’s March that became a worldwide movement, telling them that marchers wanted peace and kindness. The young kindergarteners said that they wanted those things too.\nHolding signs with handwritten verses of love, friendship and peace, close to 750 students walked around the school chanting, “We want kindness, we want peace.”\nDespite their young age, the students have a solid grasp of the meaning of the word “kindness.”\n\nSome of the handmade students’ signs. (Angélica Casas and Pablo De La Hoya/ KQED) “Kindness means everybody gets along and loves each other, and be nice to everyone,” said Noelle Carter, a 6-year-old in Kimball’s class.\nSanai Brooks, also 6, first suggested the campus march. She provided an analogy as to what kindness means. “Never push anybody in the water,” Brooks said. “And then when someone pushes you in the water, somebody’s going to help you.”\n“They have a lot to say,” said kindergarten teacher Olivia Thomas, whose class also participated in the march. “They should be empowered to say it and take ownership of what they believe.”\nThe school-wide event took place on Friday, January 27.\n\nVideo produced by Angélica Casas and Pablo De La Hoya.
