Ned Dishman/NBAE via Getty Images Loading recommendations Team Quotes On the final play of the game We got a great look at it. I think James [Ennis III] was even surprised he was so open. I know Scottie [Brooks] probably wanted to kill a couple of his guys for leaving him open like that. Yeah, we got the look we wanted and it didn't go in. -- Coach Fizdale On tonight's game Well you can't play with the basketball gods. You can't spot a team 15 points and think that every time you're going to be able to come back and win the game. It's the same thing I've been stressing to our guys over the last month is consistent effort and focus and we didn't decide to do that until the second half. -- Coach Fizdale On making adjustments at the half Effort and focus. There was no adjustments to the coverage, the schemes, nothing. We played harder and we did it with more focus. That was it. -- Coach Fizdale On Otto Porter Jr. Otto Porter [Jr.] is a heck of a player. He is what the NBA has become. He is a Swiss army knife; he can play multiple positions. The more he makes his three the deadlier he becomes but he does so much other stuff for them. Defensively, on the glass, cutting. He's a very versatile good player. -- Coach Fizdale On what needs to happen to break this cycle We gotta have more of a sense of urgency each possession. Basically, cherish each possession defensively and offensively. When you talk about coming in and being elite, just certain players, we’re are not supposed to give up, plays that you could control, the 50-50 balls, you know, careless turnovers and just basically understanding the detail of your opponent. When we learn to do that for 48 minutes, I think we can get on a roll. We’ve showed signs of it, it’s just we gotta be a little bit more consistent. -- Tony Allen On the Wizards 66-point first half I don’t know. I thought we were a little sluggish coming out of the defensive end. I thought that they made it a point of emphasis to get up and down the court, when that didn’t work they put us in pick-and-roll and tried to force us to scramble, but for the most part, a lot of teams are going to do it, we just got to be ready and better prepared. -- Tony Allen On more attention to detail in the second half leading to better play That’s the start, obviously, but after that it gets a little more complicated. But yeah, we need a better start. -- Marc Gasol On Otto Porter You have to kind of pick your poison on the pick-and-roll. When the initial action is not played correctly, and they get to the paint either with a drive or a pass, somebody has to help and you have to pick whether to come off Bradley Beal, or to come off Porter. So you pick the one guy, and he got hot on threes and got going. -- Marc Gasol On what will take to turn the team around Defense. Sixty-six points in the first half, that’s too many points. If we don’t get it defensively, it’s going to be hard for us. We don’t have the firepower to match 66 point in two halves. We’re not going to be a 130-120 game – those aren’t the games that we’re going to win consistently. We have to do a better job on that. -- Marc Gasol Marc Gasol led the Grizzlies with a game-high 28 points and seven assists. Mike Conley contributed 20 points and six assists. Vince Carter added 12 points, shooting 3-of-6 (.500) from three-point range. John Wall (25 points, 13 assists) Markieff Morris (17 points, 12 rebounds) both recorded double-doubles. Otto Porter Jr. contributed 25 points shooting 6-of-8 (.750) from beyond the arc. Bradley Beal also scored in double figures with 12 points.
