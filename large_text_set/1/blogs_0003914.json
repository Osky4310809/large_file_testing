Esteban once “walked into an FBI office in Anchorage and claimed he was being forced to fight for ISIS,” sources told CBS. Because of this concerning claim, police were called and brought him to a psychiatric facility. They seemed to believe that this was part of his mental illness, not a legitimate claim. \n5.
