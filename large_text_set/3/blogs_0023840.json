The site also claimed Lahren may leave The Blaze before the expiration of her contract in September. \nFurther, the Daily Beast reported that Leon Wolf, The Blaze’s managing editor, told staff her show would “not be in production this week.” The Daily Beast said Wolf told it that “it was communicated to me that (Tomi’s) show was not going to be produced this week,” and that he wanted to let employees hear it from him first.   Glenn Beck Calls Trump SC Pick ‘Great Replacement For Scalia’ \nThe report could not be confirmed. Neither Lahren nor Glenn Beck, who owns The Blaze, had replied as of Monday evening. \nOn Friday, Lahren spoke about abortion in a way that flies in the face of traditional conservative thought. \n“I’m pro choice, and here’s why,” Lahren said. “I am a constitutional, y’know, someone that loves the Constitution. I’m someone that’s for limited government. So I can’t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I’m for limited government, but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies.”   \nThe comment was followed by some sparring on Twitter between Beck and Lahren. Rule another label out. I am NOT a \"constitutional\". I believe in LIFE, liberty and property. Just an old fashioned \"constitutionalist.\" \n— Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) March 17, 2017 I have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker. \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017 Wait, libertarian views? Help me out on Trumpcare, stimulus, and executive orders. Trump is anything but libertarian. #intellectualhonesty https://t.co/jlt5sFvQMP \n— Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) March 20, 2017   Obama’s Final Year Broke Records For Lack Of Transparency \nOn Monday, Beck spoke about her comments on his radio show. \n“I would disagree that you’re a hypocrite if you want limited government and yet you want the government to protect life of the unborn. It’s very, very clear. But it takes intellectual honesty, and it takes a willingness to actually think these things through and to do more than just read Twitter or Facebook to get your news and your political opinions. You actually have to study things — these things out in your mind. Especially at a time period like today,” Beck said. \n“Bomb throwing is — bomb throwing in today’s world is dangerous. Freedom of speech, it’s not free. Speech isn’t free. It comes with a very high price tag. First, being intellectually honest and intellectually curious. Speech is not free. It comes with another cost and usually to the other people at the other end of your argument. The pen is mightier than the sword, and it can destroy people if your aim is clicks, views, and ratings,” he continued. \nHowever, Beck also said that Lahren would not be automatically banned from The Blaze for her beliefs. \n“I don’t hire people who are sycophants or who have my opinion,” he said. “I try to hire people who have a different opinion because I believe in being intellectually rigorous. I don’t want straw men. I want people to make a real argument on the other side so we can learn from each other and we can grow.” \n“The Blaze cannot be about me, me, me, me,” he added during his show. “Media should not be about me, me, me, me.” What do you think?
