Dawn lost seven-and-a-half stone (Photo: Rex Features) \nBut speaking in 2014, she revealed her dramatic weight loss was because of she had a hysterectomy after a cancer scare . \n“I became quite ill about three years ago, with all kinds of hell ​kicking off in here, where I keep my lady plumbing,” she said on stage during her one-woman show. \n“Anyway, I eventually went to hospital, and my doc was so convinced I had uterine cancer, that he ordered a second biopsy to be sure, when the first one was clear. Even before the result of the second one, I decided to be done with my old enemy, my defunct reproductive stuff. It was curtailing my life.

When I was due to have my hysterectomy the doc told me that if I could lose some weight before the op, they would be able to do it via ‘key-hole’, and I would recover in three weeks or so. \n“Otherwise it would be big open surgery, and three months to recover. So, I set about dropping a few stone. No magic wand, just tiny, joyless low-cal eating and lots more walking for weeks and weeks. It was grim. I lost seven and a half stone. I could have the keyhole surgery. Great. That’s all it was, practical.” \nThe huge weight loss came around 14 months after her split from her marriage to Lenny Henry and at the time was thought to be due to her heartache and eating more healthily. She will host Little Big Shots (Photo: ITV Picture Desk) \nDawn will return to our screens tonight as the host of ITV's newest show, Little Big Shots. \nShe’s on the lookout for the very best in young fresh talent, and will get it all on film for ITV. \nLittle Big Shots intends to showcase the amazing skills of some of the most talented children from all over the country in a show that is basically Britain's Got Talent, but for children.
