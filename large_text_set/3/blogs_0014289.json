Michael K 77 Just when I was beginning to think that we needed some actual happy news around these dreary parts, RuPaul came through and caused cannons to burp out loads of confetti by announcing that he’s married now!\n\nRuPaul was a guest on Hollywood Today , and hosts Ross Matthews and Ali Landry (aka the Doritos Girl from 1998), brought up his partner of 23 years, George LeBar . Ru mostly lives in Hollywood and George The Rancher mostly lives in a gigantic ass ranch in Wyoming and isn’t into showbiz shit. But they make it work, and now they’re married! And they got married for a really good reason. I’ve always thought that you should only get a legal ball and chain attached to your ankle for one of two reasons: 1. If you’re a gold digger and your piece is a millionaire who doesn’t want you to sign a prenup. Or 2. TAX REASONS! This is how Ru spilled the news:\nRoss : Are you going to get married?\nRu : You know, I don’t think I’ve said… I’ve never said this on television before, we are married.\nRoss : When did you get married?\nRu : We got married, actually, on our 23rd… I met him on the dance floor at Limelight in 1994 on his birthday. So we got married on his birthday, the anniversary of when we met, this year. Just in January. We’ve been looking into it for, really, tax breaks and for financial things.\nRu and George The Rancher will probably never share pics or videos from the ceremony, so I’ll paint the picture myself. Ru loves Taylor Dayne, so Ru’s vows were her song I’ll Always Love You and he lip-synched them. And George The Rancher’s vows were a monologue from Brokeback Mountain (that and Rancho Notorious are the only cowboy movies I really know, okay?). Ornacia was the Best Woman, and the officiant, Michelle Visage, ended with, “I now pronounce you husband and husband, and don’t fuck it up .” That’s obviously how it went down.\n\nPic : Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T03:42:43.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
