Charlie Ridgely \nRecently, actor Derek Theler has seemed to be campaigning for the tile role in the upcoming DC film, Shazam! The Rock has already been nabbed to play villain Black Adam, and he is currently meeting with DC executives about where the film could go . \nAs for Theler, he seems to want to play opposite The Rock in the film. In several Instagram posts, he has stated how much he loves the character, and how much he looks up to the veteran actor. A photo posted by Derek Theler (@derektheler) on Sep 15, 2016 at 11:04pm PDT \nIt seems that graphic artist BossLogic agrees with Theler's cries to play Shazam, and he's released a new image of the actor portraying the character. \nThe artist has the eyes of fans around the nerd community, as his pieces always tend to be a great representation of what we could possibly see. \nTheler is seen in the photo posing in one of the classic Shazam poses, as he flexes with a smile. \nTheler certainly has the personality to play Shazam, as he always seems to be happy and uplifting. This also makes a great fit for The Rock, as he is of a very similar personality.
