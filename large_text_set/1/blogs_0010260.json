Odion Ighalo \nIghalo has been heavily linked with a move to China in the ongoing transfer window with Shanghai Shenhua reportedly set to offer him a juicy deal \n“I don’t know if Ighalo is going there or not, I don’t know. Whether he chooses to go there is his decision but we have good options for his position as a striker. \n“We have the young (Victor) Osimhen who is now eligible to play (in the Bundesliga) since the first of January for Wolfsburg, and I will have a look at him”, Rohr said. \n“And I will also have a look at a Nigerian-German we just discovered, I think we will have a look at him in March.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T08:13:21.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
