I look at models and I’m like, ‘They have small boobs and they can pull this off, so maybe I can too.’” \nLouisa explained that she’d previously wanted to have a boob job since the age of 12, and only gave up on her dream last June. \n“I thought, ‘I’m going to start saving now, and maybe if I get one by the summer I can look nice in all my holiday pictures,’” she explains. \n“I thought, ‘What am I doing?
