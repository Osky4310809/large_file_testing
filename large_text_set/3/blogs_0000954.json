As such, I have decided to initiate an outside, third party investigation into this matter to ensure transparency and accountability.” \nIndependent Monitor Nick Mitchell will work with the third-party investigator, who has not been selected, the statement said. \nMurray was criticized in May by then-District Attorney Mitch Morrissey over his handling of an internal affairs investigation that led to the arrest of an officer and a woman , who was named as his accomplice. \nMorrissey sent what he called an unprecedented letter to Police Chief Robert White explaining his concerns about Murray’s direction of the investigation and subsequent arrest of the woman, who was not a police officer. And Morrissey accused Murray of having “a cavalier attitude” when he tried to discuss what had happened. \nSix months later, the Denver Police Protective Association, the union that represents rank-and-file officers, twice filed an open records request asking for a copy of Morrissey’s letter. \nBoth times, the Department of Safety, through its records coordinator, denied the letter existed. At the time, Murray told the records coordinator, “I have no records responsive to this request,” according to e-mails obtained by The Denver Post. \nHowever, the letter surfaced at the police department in late January when two Denver television stations requested it. \nNick Rogers, the police union president, has accused Murray of lying to the records coordinator. \n“I would hope the No. 2 person in this department would have much more integrity than that,” Rogers said. “You’re telling me they’re not going to remember a letter from the district attorney that is so scathing about how poorly that investigation was handled. \n“If the DA sent me a letter saying I was a moron, I wouldn’t forget it for the rest of my career,” Rogers said. \nBut Murray, in an interview before the independent investigation was ordered, told The Post that it was an oversight, complicated by the fact that he was the officer in question and had been removed from any involvement in questions related to the original case. \n“This is not dishonest,” Murray said. “This was an oversight. That’s what this is. There was no conspiracy. There was no cover up.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:24:11.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
