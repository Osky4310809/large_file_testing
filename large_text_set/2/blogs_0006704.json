(Photo: Instagram/Jeremy McConnell) (Photo: Instagram/Jeremy McConnell) \nIn between foul-mouthed insults, one person wrote: \"God he will do anything for abit of publicity!! He's a first class t***er (sic)\" \nAnother commented: \"Said he would of been at the birth .... was in Thailand getting smashed ! Dad of the year (sic)\" (Photo: Instagram/Jeremy McConnell) (Photo: Instagram/Jeremy McConnell) \nAfter the strongly-worded backlash, Jeremy appeared to first delete all the negative responses - before then removing the post itself. Jeremy McConnell (Photo: Rex Features) Stephanie Davis (Photo: WENN.COM) \nShe then shared screengrabs of previous comments the Irish model has made on social media denying he could be the dad after he told Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield that he'd never said that. \n\"Stephanie has felt humiliated by Jeremy denying his own son and foolishly announcing publicly his request for a DNA test,\" the statement read. \n\"Jeremy has caused Stephanie massive amounts of stress, pressure and upset throughout her pregnancy, ruining what for most women is one of the most special time[s] of their lives.\" \nWe have contacted a rep for Jeremy for comment.
