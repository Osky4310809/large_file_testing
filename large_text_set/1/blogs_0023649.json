All the tracks are produced by Shawty Redd who has quite an extensive resume, including Gucci’s “Heavy” off The State vs. Radric Davis . \nGucci won HipHopDX’s We Working Artist of the Year last year for releasing six projects after his release from prison in May, not even giving him a full twelve months. And on only the 25th day of 2017, Wizop has shared project number one of the new year. \nStream Gucci Mane’s 3 for Free EP and see the cover art and tracklist below.
