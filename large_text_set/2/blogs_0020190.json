Limited to 500 units worldwide, with 50 allocated to the United States, the Graphite Gray Magno droptop comes with model-specific decor including a black-and-silver interior, special Edition 50 badging, and black chrome accents on the car’s side skirts, grille, front splitter, front fender vents, and rear diffuser. Of course, none of this comes as much of a surprise to us, as Mercedes revealed at the release of the GT C Edition 50 coupe that the GT C roadster would also gain an Edition 50 variant.\n- \n-But AMG isn’t finished celebrating its golden anniversary, and the sub-brand is also taking the wraps off the C63 S cabriolet Ocean Blue Edition at the Geneva auto show . It’s actually painted in Cashmere White Magno; the C63 S Ocean Blue Edition’s name stems from the Deep Ocean Blue hue used on the model’s convertible top and on finishes on the car’s front and rear fascias, exterior mirror housings, lip spoiler, and wheel center caps. Additionally, the hue makes its way to the interior, featured within the analog clock and dyed into the stitching that holds together the Ocean Blue Edition’s gray interior. Good luck getting your hands on a C63 Ocean Blue Edition, though; the model will be limited to a worldwide production run of 150 units.\n-Finally, Mercedes-AMG will show off a new AMG Performance Studio package for the C43 coupe and convertible. The package brings the dark exterior details featured in the C43 coupe’s Night package (black grille, lip spoiler, and front and rear fascia detailing) but turns things up to 11 thanks to the addition of black 19-inch wheels and a flat-bottom steering wheel wrapped in leather and suede.\n- - AMG Brings a Car to the Boat Show with GT S and Matching Cigarette - First Ride: Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster - Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster: Full Specs, Pricing, Reviews, Photos, and More - -Pricing for all three special-edition models remains under wraps; however, Mercedes-AMG plans to open its U.S. ordering books for the threesome this summer.\n- \n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:20:25.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
