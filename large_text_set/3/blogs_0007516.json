First it was that Lonzo would be better than Stephen Curry , then he said his son would only play for the Lakers . This time he’s speaking out against Charles Barkley. According to Sporting News , Barkley had the following to say about LaVar, and his recent comments to the media:\nJust because you say some s--t, doesn't make it right. He's gonna be better than Steph Curry? That's what he said. Steph Curry has won a couple MVPs, he's pretty good. Man, let me tell you something. That's that AAU s--t. You can't say a guy is going to be better than Steph Curry, a guy who has played 30 college games. I know you can be proud of your son, but at some point, it becomes stupidity.\nBall then later responded on Colin Cowherd’s show on Fox Sports.\nLaVar Ball responds to Charles Barkley's criticism: \"If Charles thought like me, maybe he'd win a Championship.\" pic.twitter.com/XWc9Y5n0Xg\n— Herd w/Colin Cowherd (@TheHerd) March 7, 2017 “Here’s the thing, I don’t pull anything back. Whatever I say, I say. It’s just like with Charles Barkley is saying with all these guys. If Charles thought like me, maybe he’d win a championship. Oh yeah, it hurt because he’s saying sometimes when stuff comes out of people’s mouth is just stupid. Guess what? You talking too. So, everybody has an opinion how things were. I don’t care about that I put the goals up high. I know what my boy is about. I know the work he’s put in. It’s not a one-on-one sport, but if it is one-on-one, I’m going to take the taller, faster, stronger guy.”\nIt will be interesting to see if LaVar’s continued comments will have anything to do with how NBA team’s view Lonzo’s future in the NBA.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/XWc9Y5n0Xg", "https://twitter.com/TheHerd/status/839183862756339712", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/lonzo-ball-dad-hurting-his-draft-stock-ucla-markelle-fultz-no-1-pick-nba-draft/wdpdc2wz2bl31fpw102mqidfj"], "published": "2017-03-08T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T02:46:49.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
