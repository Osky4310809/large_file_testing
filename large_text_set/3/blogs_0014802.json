The head of Hollywood’s biggest superhero franchise is at Mar-A-Lago this evening, chomping down on well-done steaks with the 45th president of the United States. \nPerlmutter donated $1 million to Trump during his presidential run last year, and was subsequently named to his Inauguration committee. He’s also reportedly serving as an advisor on veteran affairs. After 4½ hrs at his golf club, Pres Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago. Will be having dinner tonight with @Marvel CEO Isaac Perlmutter. \n— Mark Knoller (@markknoller) March 18, 2017 \nDespite their CEO’s association with Trump, it hasn’t stopped Marvel animators from poking fun at the president.
