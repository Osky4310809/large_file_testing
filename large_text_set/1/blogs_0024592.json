King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 9 hours ago 13 \nIn the very first making-of episode behind their upcoming 7th album \"Emperor of Sand\" - due out on March 31 via Reprise - the guys from Mastodon opened up on how cancer and deaths of their loved ones shaped the new record. \nDrummer Brann Dailor kicked things off: \"Ever since [2009's] ' Crack the Skye ,' we've taken the stance that whatever tragedies everyone goes through, we're lucky to have this thing to put it all in - Mastodon. \n\"That's where we put my sister's death, that's where we put Brent's brother's death, that's where we put Troy's wife's cancer, that's where we put Bill's mom's death, that's where we put all this stuff and turned it into something beautiful - or tried to, at least.\" \nGuitarist Bill Kelliher added: \"['Emperor of Sand'] is kind of like a metaphor for cancer. There's been a lot of cancer going on, in the world and in our personal lives.\" \nBrann chimed in: \"Cancer will touch your life at some point, unfortunately.\" \nBassist Troy Sanders said: \"Since the dawn of time, people have dealt with this, and what it is is a very stealth disease. It's something you can't see that's in you - you're born with it. It's silent all its life, and it's running without vision; something that can hollow you out inside and change all that's right.\" \nFocusing on the album's opening track and lead single \" Sultan's Curse ,\" Troy added: \n\"It's the beginning of the journey. What light do you have to reflect outward and give this fight everything you've got? That's where the album starts. 'Tired and lost, no one to trust, who is there to give you the push.'\" \nSingling out time as another major theme on the album, Brann added: \"'Emperor of Sand' is another way of saying Grim Reaper. Sand represents time, and when a person is diagnosed with cancer, ultimately our thinking is, 'How much time do I have?' When you're reminded of your own mortality, you think a little bit more about it, obviously.\" \nTroy added: \"It's facing your own mortality. And what that means is, 'What do I do with this time?' 'How much time?' is usually the first question. And it's what you do from that moment forward that means everything. It's that dark journey that one goes on from the diagnosis to the very end result. It's the fight, the struggle and what you can muster from the inside out that will determine the longevity that we might have. \n\"That is the basis of what the 'Emperor of Sand' is all about.\" \nUltimately, Brann concluded the album \"heavily reflects what the band members went through over the past year and a half on a personal level.\" \nMake sure to watch the full clip below.
