(Photo: Wavebreakmedia Ltd, Getty Images/Wavebreak Media) \nNot content with making it more difficult to exercise your constitutional rights , it seems Arizona's leaders also are planning to make it easier for insurance companies to rip you off. \nThis, in the name of \"protecting\" you. \nReally. \nYou know that cover sheet you get when you buy an insurance policy? The one that summarizes what’s covered in your plan? Rep. David Livingston, R-Peoria, is pushing a bill that says insurance companies would not be required to actually provide what it lists in that summary of benefits – only what’s listed in the policy itself. \nSo, if your summary of benefits says, for example, that prenatal care is covered but page eight of your insurance policy say it isn’t, you’d be out of luck. \nIf the summary of your house insurance policy says the contents are covered for replacement value but the actual policy says otherwise, you’d be stuck with the lesser coverage. \nThis, no matter what you thought you were buying, no matter what you were told you were buying. \nAccording to House Bill 2045: “Any summary of benefits, illustration or other similar explanatory document that is made available by the insurer does not amplify, extend or modify the terms of a policy.” \nThe bill also says that if there are differences in a policy when translated into languages other than English, the English version governs coverage. \nSo, not only do you have to read the fine print to know what you're getting, you have to read the fine print in English. \nLivingston's bill sailed through the House last week on a partyline vote, 35-23, as Livingston assured his fellow Republicans that the bill was all about consumer protection. \nCue Capitol Media Services’ Howard Fischer, who covered the debate: \nRep. Isela Blanc, D-Tempe, questioned Livingston during floor debate about the change, noting his comments that it is good for insurance customers. She wanted to know whether the changes were actually requested by those who buy policies. \n“Citizens of the state of Arizona asked me to run this bill,” he responded during floor debate. \nThat answer clearly did not satisfy Blanc. \n“These so-called citizens, are they connected to insurance agencies, companies, groups, special interests related to insurance?” she asked. \n“Yes,” he finally conceded.
