We’ve all been there. For those occasions, an external battery is what you need, and today you can buy a big 20,000mAh battery from Aukey for a mere $27.99 at Amazon.\nSee also: Best USB-C portable battery chargers November 16, 2016 At the moment, the listing for the battery shows a price of $34.99, which is still a big discount compared to its normal $43.99 price tag. However, if you type in the promotional code AUK2MAHQ during checkout, you can cut the price down by another $7 to just $27.99.\nObviously, having an extra 20000mAh external battery would be a big help on long trips, or even if you are just not able to charge up your phone from a normal wall outlet. This battery from Aukey will be able to charge a device like the Samsung Galaxy S7 over seven times before it runs out of juice, which is pretty impressive. If your smartphone also has support for Quick Charge 2.0, this battery will also be able to charge it up at those much faster speeds.\nThere’s support for microUSB and lighting ports, if you also own an iPhone. However, this model does not have any USB Type-C connections for the newest smartphones on the market, although there are adapters you can get that will help you get the most out of this battery.\nGet it at Amazon ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:35:59.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
