Connect with a local agent Grab a soft sweater and a good book, then take your pick of these snuggly spots for whiling the winter days away. \nIt’s funny how after the holidays, living in a Winter Wonderland becomes a whole lot less wonderful. Whether you’re enduring thunderstorms, snow, or gusts of wind, snuggling up at home near a crackling fire or in your personal reading nook is the ideal way to wait out the weather. \nNo matter your interior style, there’s always room to add a few cozy touches. Here are some favorite ways to warm up your home design to face the wintry days ahead. Fireplaces: Light up the night (or day) \nThere might be nothing in the world as comforting as a beautifully decorated fireplace. While it’s typical to have these fixtures in the living room or even the dining room, consider the charm of having one in your own bedroom. \nThe soothing crackling of a fire is the perfect way to wind down at the end of the day, and with so many styles to choose from, you’re sure to find one that fits your interior style.

A reading nook can inspire calm and creativity with a few simple furnishings and accessories. \nPair a fun patterned chair with an ottoman, and a unique side table to set your reading material on. Make sure you have sufficient lighting and a cozy throw blanket nearby for those days when you just want to curl up with a good book. Photo from Zillow listing . Window seats: Room with a view \nOn your day off, there’s nothing quite like sipping a cup of coffee while enjoying a beautiful view. What better way to soak up your surroundings than with comfy window seating? \nTraditionally found in older homes with Victorian style , window seating is versatile and complements most styles of design. If your home is modern , consider a bright white seating display with patterned pillows. If your look is more traditional, opt for textured seating in a timeless print. \nWhatever your choice, you won’t regret spending time in this cozy spot. Photo from Zillow listing . Area rugs: Keeping toes toasty \nHardwood floors are a luxury, but they can be painfully cold in the winter months. Help insulate your home with plush area rugs throughout the space for visual warmth and added coziness. \nRugs with texture like shag or a high pile offer extra comfort while walking around the house. Put one in each high-traffic area, as well as under your bed to ensure you wake up with warm feet. \nWhat are some of your favorite ways to add warmth to your home? \nRelated :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:32:37.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
