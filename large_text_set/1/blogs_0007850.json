West Ham in fight to keep Antonio as Chelsea consider move \nIt has not been severe enough to stop Alonso from playing — the 26-year-old has started the last 14 Premier League games, which coincided with Chelsea’s club record run of 13 straight wins. But with the rigours of the season and his injury starting to take more of a toll, Chelsea wanted to bring Ake back as cover and open up the possibility of rotating more, so giving Alonso the possibility to rest his injury. \nAke impressed on a season-long loan at Watford last term playing as a leftback and showed his growing confidence at the highest level at Bournemouth, albeit as a centre-half. \nHe was supposed to spend the campaign there but Chelsea decided to trigger the clause in the deal that would allow them to bring him back this month. \nCoach Antonio Conte said that Ake’s fine performances and ability to play in a number of positions was the reason the Holland Under-21 international is at Stamford Bridge again.
