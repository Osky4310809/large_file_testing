The bill would also remove all Obamacare taxes and limit Medicaid spending. \nCurrently Obamacare gives out subsidies based on income. In the Republican bill, those subsidies would be changed to being based on the person’s age. This aspect of the bill would take effect in 2020. \nStarting in 2020, the bill would also eliminate the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. The federal government would cap payments to states, instead of the open-ended system we have now, and those payments would be based on the number of people enrolled in Medicaid per state.   \nThe proposed legislation would also include $100 billion for “state innovation grants” to help states cover the costs of those with pre-existing conditions which make covering them more expensive. \nAnd last, but certainly not least, the proposed legislation would cut off all federal funding to organizations that provide abortions. \nYou can read the full legislation here . \nA potential problem with the bill is how it is funded. The draft legislation calls for “employer-sponsored insurance” above the 90th percentile to be taxed. This is similar to Obamacare’s “Cadillac tax” which was highly unpopular.
