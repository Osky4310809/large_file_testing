Yet vaccines continue to make the news. So in order to more effectively challenge misguided positions on vaccine safety, it’s important to understand why they persist despite the medical community’s attempts to assuage the concerns of skeptical parents.\nThe theory linking vaccines and autism was ignited by a long-discredited paper , but it persists because of people’s fear of the unknown: Scientists don’t fully understand what causes autism. Consider why no one believes vaccines cause heart attacks, strokes, or obesity; the biological mechanisms behind these diseases are relatively well understood. But with autism, mystery breeds conspiracy.\nTo understand the true causes of autism, the U.S. will have to continue to invest heavily in research and treatment. But until we can reduce fear of the unknown, the scientific community may have to try something different: increasing fear of what we do know. We need to more prominently highlight the devastating effects of leaving children unvaccinated, which include serious illness or death from diseases including measles, whooping cough, hepatitis, and tetanus.\nMany of these diseases that vaccines protect against are rare enough today to escape public consciousness. Polio, measles, and whooping cough are no longer rampant, as they were decades ago. Rates of polio, for instance, have decreased 99%  since 1988, from an estimated 350,000 cases worldwide to fewer than 100. This is largely due to vaccination. Historically, people knew someone, or knew someone who knew someone, who had the disease. In the 1960s, before a vaccine was available, there were an estimated 4 million cases of measles in the United States each year; in 2016 there were 70. (It’s important to note that in 2014 there were 23 measles outbreaks and 667 cases — primarily among unvaccinated individuals.)\nResearch suggests that getting disease outbreaks into the public discourse could increase vaccination rates. Emily Oster, a professor of economics at Brown University, studied how vaccination rates across the U.S. change after pertussis outbreaks. She found that children were more likely to get vaccinated after an outbreak. Specifically, an outbreak in a county decreased the share of unvaccinated children by an average of 28% (1.2 percentage points). Online searches for “pertussis” and “pertussis vaccination” also increased, and these effects were larger for regions with lower baseline vaccination rates. Taken together, these findings suggest that salient information about recent disease outbreaks can change people’s decisions about vaccines.\nHow state and local health departments respond to outbreaks is also important. Analyzing data from 12 states, Oster found that some states coordinate responses from the top down, while other states leave it to individual counties to respond to disease outbreaks. Because every state has some outbreaks each year, but not every county does, states that centralize their reporting have residents who hear about outbreaks more frequently, are more likely to search for information about vaccines online, and are more likely to vaccinate their children after outbreaks.\nOster’s research also shows that areas that systematically notify the media about outbreaks seem to have larger vaccination bumps — as do those that declare a smaller number of cases to be an “outbreak,” because, once again, residents hear about the disease more frequently. Each case, then, can bring attention to the ill effects of failing to vaccinate children — and encourage parents to avoid them.\nThese findings are important for at least two reasons. The first is that even small changes in vaccination rates, of just a few percentage points, can substantially reduce the chances of an outbreak. For example, Louisiana has a pertussis vaccination rate of 98.5%, which seems only slightly higher than Montana’s 95%. But there are four times as many cases of whooping cough per capita in Montana than in Louisiana.\nThe second is that immediate, large-scale “promotion” of specific disease outbreaks seems to be effective where many other strategies have failed. Previous research suggests educational campaigns that debunk myths about vaccines generally don’t increase  vaccination rates. And sharing dramatic images or stories of children with preventable diseases without connecting them to actual outbreaks may even strengthen skeptical parents’ belief in the negative side effects of vaccines.\nThe scientific community generally uses reason to make its points. But appeals to emotion can be more effective for changing behavior. A better vaccination campaign, it seems, might not be one that focuses solely on education and evidence, but rather one that emphasizes the frequency and severity of the diseases vaccines are meant to eradicate.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:28:13.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
