While many women around the world use full-coverage foundation to look #Flawless like Beyoncé , others are taking serious steps to add freckles to their skin. A post shared by Gabrielle ❣ Twin Peonies (@gabriellerainbow) on Jan 20, 2016 at 11:50am PST \nUnlike other extreme beauty fads that shine quickly and fade just as fast, this trend will literally stay with you forever. “Freckling,” as it’s professionally called, is a process in which a cosmetic tattoo artist inks natural looking dots onto the face that will eventually blend in with the person’s skin tone. Celebrities' Crazy Tattoos \nMontreal-based cosmetic tattoo artist Gabrielle Rainbow has spearheaded the trend based out of Canadian shop Imperial Tatoo Connexion. In a February 16 interview, Rainbow told Newbeauty she was inspired by her friend who was tired of drawing her fake freckles on with makeup. \nAfter experimenting on herself, Rainbow now has a range of clients who typically tend to “get some in the summertime with sun exposure, but want them yearlong.” \nFreckling requires a one-hour-long session, and they will generally last up to three years, Rainbow said, and added that “over the course of a few months, the color will soften dramatically and look more natural.” A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Aug 12, 2016 at 9:47am PDT \nIt’s hard to pinpoint who exactly started the freckle trend, but Kylie Jenner , whose everyday makeup routine consists of a whopping 15 steps, started to embrace her natural freckles on social media last year, despite initial self-consciousness. Kylie Jenner: How Her Face Has Changed \nFirst posting a freckles appreciation picture on Instagram March 8, the makeup mogul posted another fresh-faced photo on May 13, writing , “when everyone is drawing on freckles, but you’re always covering yours.” While vacationing in Turks and Caicos on August 16, Jenner proudly displayed her natural complexion again in another no-makeup shot. \nGet celeb fashion, beauty tips, and more delivered directly to your inbox.
