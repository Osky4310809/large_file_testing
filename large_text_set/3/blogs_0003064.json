This is partly thanks to the 3.5 litre Ecoboost V6 under the hood, which has been enhanced by Hennessey. \nAmong the modifications done to the mill include a high-flow air induction system, upgraded turbochargers, air-to-air front mounted intercooler, stainless steel catback exhaust, and an ECU update. These add up to an output of 613 hp at 6,000 rpm and 830 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm, which is a lot more than the stock motor’s 450 hp and 691 Nm. \nTo go along with the extra grunt, Hennessey will apply plenty of emblems onto the truck’s body, as well as inject some exclusivity by limiting production of the VelociRaptor 600 to just 100 vehicles for 2017. Two dedicated 1 of 100 plaques will highlight this, placed in the interior and under the bonnet. \nFor a little bit extra, customers can also tack on an off-road package to the VelociRaptor 600, where unique bumpers, 20-inch 10-spoke wheels, 35-inch Toyo off-road tyres, a lift kit (by 76 mm), and LED lighting are added on. Not enough? Then maybe you should consider looking at the VelociRaptor 6×6 instead. \nIf both are a little too excessive for you, Hennessey also offers the “mild peri-peri” VelociRaptor 500 upgrade, which bring the horsepower count to 500. A Hennessey programmer with tune, stainless steel catback exhaust and high-flow intake help contribute to that gain. Other parts that are standard on the VelociRaptor 600 can also be ordered for the lower-output model.
