I honestly believe that he’s probably the most courageous president to ever hit the office. But at the same time I also believe that if you’re gonna be a strong leader, you also have to be compassionate and you have to think about the people’s wellbeing in the process as you’re doing things. It’s one thing to be tough but everybody knows a bully one day will be taken down and it’s just a matter of time. We don’t want our president to be looked at as a bully, or someone who’s gonna say ‘My way or no way.’ We want him to be able to negotiate on behalf of the people but at the same time keep our integrity in a great place. ” \nMost courageous ever? \nAkon also expressed worry that the ban would make Americans targets when travelling abroad, saying: “I don’t wanna have to deal with foreign affairs because of a decision my leader made for me. All the biggest American icons become targets once they leave America. And that even goes to Canadian artists.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!
