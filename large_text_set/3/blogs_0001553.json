If anything, it was Johnson’s putting that held him back on Day 1, but there was a moment that caught him off guard. \nFrom the first tee (his 10th hole of the day), Johnson hit 3-wood down the hill and over the green some 332 yards and out of bounds. He followed that with a 2-iron that ended up pin high in a bunker left of the green. WGC-Mexico Championship: Articles, photos and videos \n“It was supposed to be a little into the wind but I kind of pulled it. But I never thought I needed to tell it to get down but that's just how it goes,” said Johnson, who made a double bogey-6 on the hole. \nOverall Johnson was pleased with how he calculated the distance differences at 7,500 feet, which for most players is about a 15 percent increase. \n“I feel like I got a pretty good bead on it, calculating the yardage. I hit a lot of really good iron shots,” he said. “I'm happy with the way I hit it and the way I judged the distance. I thought I controlled the ball very well, just need to make a few putts tomorrow.” Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:51:49.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
