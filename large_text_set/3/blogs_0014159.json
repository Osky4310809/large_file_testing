A federal appeals court said Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017, it will reconsider an earlier ruling that would have made it easier for President Trump to fire Cordray. (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) The Justice Department will not support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a monumental court battle over whether the structure of the federal consumer watchdog is unconstitutional, according to court documents filed Friday.\nThe department also argued that the president should be able to remove the director of the independent agency at will, a shift that consumer advocates say could threaten the independent nature of the agency.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act that created the agency, the director can only be removed for cause — setting a high bar for a president who wants to put new leadership in place. That approach was called into question last fall when a federal appeals court ruled in support of PHH Corporation, a mortgage lender suing the CFPB to challenge an enforcement action.\nIn October, a three-judge panel ruled that the agency should be restructured so that the president can have the ability to fire the director at will.\nThat ruling was vacated in February when the court granted the CFPB’s request to rehear the case , this time with the full panel of judges. Oral arguments for the case are scheduled for May 24.\n[ There is a fierce tug of war over the future of the CFPB ]\nIn Friday’s amicus brief, the Justice Department compared the regulator to other independent agencies that are run by a commission with multiple members and concluded that the design of the CFPB may violate the constitution because it is run by a single director that the president cannot remove at will. “There is a greater risk that an ‘independent’ agency headed by a single person will engage in extreme departures from the President’s executive policy,” the brief reads.\nThe CFPB declined to comment. The agency has until March 31 to file another brief in the case.\nThe Justice Department’s move sets the stage for a rare showdown between two federal agencies in court. While the amicus brief does not make the Justice Department an official party in the case, it shows that the department is actively opposing the CFPB and signals that it may not defend the current structure of the agency if the battle reaches the Supreme Court, legal experts say.\n“It’s certainly not good for the CFPB,” said Michael Landis, litigation director for U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy group. “The D.C. Circuit will put weight on the views of the Justice Department.”\nThe brief marks a reversal for the Justice Department, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the CFPB during the final days of the Obama administration, asking the court to rehear the case. At the time, the department stopped short of taking a stance on whether it is constitutional to have a single director who can only be removed by the president for cause.\nThe filing deals another blow to the nearly six-year-old agency which has come under increased attack since the presidential election from Republicans and financial industry trade groups who hope President Trump will support their efforts to weaken the regulator.\nThe case may become more complicated as it progresses through the court system. While the CFPB can defend itself before the D.C. Circuit court, the agency would need to be represented by the Justice Department if it wants to take the challenge up to the Supreme Court, Landis said.\nUnder that scenario, the CFPB would need another group to join the case on its behalf to be able to argue against PHH before the Supreme Court. Some Democrats and consumer advocates tried to fill that role when they requested to intervene in the case earlier this year, but their efforts were rejected by the court.\nSome supporters of the CFPB said the director should be shielded from shifts in presidential administrations to provide a more consistent approach to regulation. “It is independent from the political process, just like the other bank and financial regulators,” said Brian Simmonds Marshall, policy counsel for Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of groups that fight for civil rights and labor issues.\nStill, some supporters of the CFPB downplayed the potential impact of the brief, saying that the court may view it as a political move and put more emphasis on the law.\nRead more:\nLabor Dept. cuts target job training programs for seniors, disadvantaged youths\nWhy the Fed rate hike probably won’t boost your savings account any time soon\nCongress could pump the brakes on these new retirement plans\nIn unprecedented move, pension plan cuts benefits promised to retirees", "external_links": ["http://wapo.st/2jeq2lC", "http://wapo.st/2n3c8DL", "https://twitter.com/@jonnelle", "http://wapo.st/2lMifuV", "http://wapo.st/2nAZ8SD"], "published": "2017-03-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:50:56.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
