Over the past three years, he has had three releases but none of them were mega-hits at the box office. And while the gen next stars and his colleagues are taking their films past the Rs 100 crore mark, Shahid has not been able to do that. In fact, his overall profitability over the years has been negligible at the box office and we have proof. \nShahid has won a lot of hearts with his performance in Udta Punjab and Haider , but both the movies failed to set the box office on fire. And then, Shaandaar was a washout at the box office. On top of this, if you analyse the overall profits his last three releases made, you will be shocked. When you add the profits and subtract the losses of all his last three films, you’ll be surprised to know that Shahid’s films have made an overall profit of just Rs 14.55 crore, which is negligible compared to the profits of films starring Varun , Alia , Siddharth and many others. Check out the chart of profits and losses of his last three releases right here: \nIn today’s day and age, every director and producer have a look at the profitability of an actor over a period of time rather than just their talent. Surprisingly the fact that Shahid hasn’t delivered a single Rs 100 crore film over the past few years is a worrying factor. This is why, Rangoon is very important for the actor at this stage of his career. He needs to reinvent himself, get a couple of hits under his belt and choose better movies going forward. This would help him regain his position as a top box office star once again. Salman , Shah Rukh , Aamir and Akshay have been ruling box office clearly coz they deliver huge profit making films and Shahid should now change his focus to these mega budget and mega money making films.

The film sees Shahid reunite with Vishal Bhardwaj, who has given him two hits already. This along with the fact that Rangoon looks interesting and has a good buzz around it makes the situation very good for Shahid. And post- Rangoon , he is working on a huge film like Padmavati too. So things do look bright for Shahid, but firstly Rangoon should work at the box office as this would give the much required boost to his career.
