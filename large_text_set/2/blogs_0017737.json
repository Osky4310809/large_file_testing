So when I turned around to look I got so angry. I put my car in park in the middle of the street and got off and yelled, 'What are you doing?' and he said, 'Mind your own business, b****.'\"\nIn a video of the incident, Torrez tells Cardona she is going to call the cops, to which he responds, \"Call them. It's my dog.\"\nPolice responded to the scene and eventually arrested Cardona.\nAccording to authorities, Cardona had dragged the dog for two blocks.\n\"This poor baby was helpless and this man just didn't even care,\" Torrez said.\nG2, who Torrez said was underweight, was given to animal control and is reportedly doing well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:51:26.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
