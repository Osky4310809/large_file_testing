Andrew Stuart \nFor more than three decades, Slayer have painted bloody, violent, menacing tableaus in their music and videos. Later this month, they'll do it in print. Related See Slayer's Bloody First Comic-Book Covers: 'It Has to Be Violent' \"It looks awesome,\" guitarist Kerry King says of artwork that will grace comic racks later this year \nThe debut issue of the thrash-metal stalwarts' first official comic book, Slayer: Repentless , will hit stands this month, with its story building off the mysterious, eyepatch-wearing convict in their recent music videos. The group drafted Twilight Zone comic artist Guiu Vilanova to give the story its gory look and Metalocalypse writer Jon Schnepp to pen a tale gruesome enough to be worthy of the band's lyrics. Six pages from the issue are below. \nThe story opens as two brothers, Adrian and Wyatt – the latter of whom was the subject of Slayer's \"Repentless,\"\"You Against You\" and \"Pride in Prejudice\" videos – converse about why Wyatt left the family's neo-Nazi group and moved to a town called Repentless (several signs throughout the comic reference Slayer songs). Wyatt became, to quote Adrian, a \"race traitor\" and fell in love with a black woman, only for Adrian's cohorts, referred to here as \"the cause,\" to carry out violent acts against Wyatt's friends and create an act bloody enough to get him locked up. The preview ends with guards testing Wyatt's level of hatred and it only gets bloodier from there, leading to a cameo by the band members. \nSchnepp told Rolling Stone last year that he'd worked hard to find the right tone for the series. \"I'm busting my ass on these because I want to honor the legacy,\" Schnepp says. \"It can't be corny or jokey. It has to be harsh, violent and very gritty.\" \nThe issue will be available with two covers. One, featuring Wyatt's bloody face, is by Eisner Award winner Glenn Fabry while the other, a skeleton with stakes impaling its bones, is by Eric Powell ( The Goon ). They come out on January 25th.
