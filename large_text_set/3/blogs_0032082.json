After lifting off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida and carrying an SES-10 communications satellite into space, the rocket booster separated and barreled toward Earth, slowing down and sticking a landing on a drone ship parked at sea. \n\"It's an amazing day I think for space as a whole,\" Musk said after the landing. \"Something can be done that many people said was impossible.\" \nThe launch was particularly special since achieving rocket reusability is a development that is expected to usher in a new era of launches at a reduced price.

The company is getting pretty good at returning rockets to Earth: After 13 attempts in recent years, the company has stuck eight of them. \nThe first one, which returned to land in December 2015, won't ever be going back to space, though. It has special status and is on display at the company's Hawthorne, California headquarters. \nSpaceX has otherwise conducted the bulk of its rocket landings at sea, something Musk has said is necessary for high-velocity missions. As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 17, 2016 \nMusk, of course, isn't the only one interested in recycling rockets. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has also been keeping a lower profile, launching and landing his New Shepard rocket at least five times as the company prepares for a future goal of taking tourists to space.
