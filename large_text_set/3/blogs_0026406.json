Understandably, this practice makes many people uncomfortable. \nIn response, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, and Montgomery County attorneys Jane Doe and John Roe filed suit against Mack in Federal Court. \nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston, argues that Mack’s courtroom prayer practice is a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment: \nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. \nFreedom From Religion Foundation reports: \nPlaintiff Jane Doe is a licensed attorney who has appeared before Mack on at least four separate occasions. While Doe is Christian, she “objects to a government official telling her when or how to pray.” \nPlaintiff John Roe, a self-employed attorney who regularly represents clients in front of Mack, “is religiously unaffiliated and objects to being subjected to religious prayers” in a courtroom. \nThe legal complaint asserts that due to his “considerable influence and power as a justice of the peace, Judge Mack exerts coercive influence over those in his courtroom, effectively compelling their participation in his religious practice.” \nAccording to reports , Justice of the Peace Wayne Mack has been opening court sessions with Christian prayers and Bible readings for several years. As a result, individuals fear that if they appear uncomfortable with the Christian ritual, the judge will be biased towards them when deciding their case. \nIndeed, in 2014 the Freedom From Religion Foundation filed a complaint about the inappropriate prayers. The following is an excerpt from a letter of complaint sent to Judge Mack by the FFRF: \nWe understand that in August you opened one of your court sessions with the Christian prayer. We believe that this is regular practice in your courtroom. A concerned Montgomery County resident who had business before you contacted us to report that after you entered the courtroom you stated, “We are going to say a prayer. If any of you are offended by that you can leave into the hallway and your case will not be affected.” \nAfter that announcement, we understand that you introduced a pastor who read from the bible for more than five minutes. While the pastor was reading, our complainant says, “I felt that the Judge was watching for reactions from the courtroom; bowed heads, indifference, etc. I definitely felt that our cases would be affected by our reactions [to the bible reading].” \nOur complainant further says, “Once the Bible reading was over we were then asked to bow our heads to pray. I was very uncomfortable and certainly felt that I was being coerced into following this ritual and that the outcome of my case depended upon my body language.” \nHowever, rather than putting an end to the offensive, illegal, and blatantly unconstitutional practice, Judge Mack continued the practice of offering Christian prayers in his courtroom. \nClearly Judge Mack is wrong to entangle his personal religious beliefs with his judicial office. Promoting his Christian faith in the courtroom has a coercive effect on others, and gives the appearance that his judgements and decisions are predicated on his religious bias, rather than the law. \nBottom line: Judge Mack needs to stop promoting Christian prayers in his courtroom, or resign from the bench.
