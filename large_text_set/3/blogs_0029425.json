The graphics were top of the line at the time, and it made the game and the character moves look absolutely fantastic. The game contained a plethora of characters (over 35), including many Tekken 3 characters such as Eddy Gordo, Panda, and True Ogre , and also many from Tekken 2, like Alex, Baek Doo San, and Ganryu . Two new characters were introduced, but they were just twists on other players that already existed (sort of like Evil Ryu from SF). Not only will it remain a favorite among fighting game fans, but it was also one of the top PS2 titles in general. 3. Super Street Fighter II Turbo \nPlatforms: Dreamcast, SNES, Game Boy Advance Developer: Capcom \nThe game that first brought out the competitor in me was Street Fighter II Turbo for the SNES. It was face-paced fighting that took skill and practice to master, but when you did master it, nothing was as gratifying. Defeating my cousins over and over again in my living room every time they would visit is one of the most cherished childhood memories of mine, and I just wanted to keep playing while they all wanted to go outside and play football. It added powered-up Super Combos into the Street Fighter mix, forever changing the franchise’s landscape and influencing future titles. It also had an adjustable speed setting for the first time in the series, and added the ability to perform Air Combos on opponents in mid-air. 2. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 \nPlatforms: Dreamcast, Arcade, PS2, Xbox Developer: Capcom \nIt’s tough to throw Marvel vs. Capcom 2 at number 2 on this list instead of number one, but it IS nearing 15 years old (so don’t complain about it not being number one in the comments..mmmkay). The character list was absolutely epic if you happened to be a fan of both Marvel and Capcom, having over 50 playable characters. Captain America, Spider-Man, Hulk, Gambit and many more Marvel characters were included, as well as Capcom’s Mega Man, Ryu, Chun-Li and Jill Valentine. It has the most inclusive roster of any fighting game to date, and it played like Turbo II Remix but more fluid. Not only is it the best crossover fighting game, it’s the best Marvel video game to date. 1. Super Street Fighter IV \nPlatforms: PS3, Xbox 360, PC, 3DS, Arcade Developer: Capcom \nForget the rest, Super Street Fighter IV is the best fighting game to date. Capcom created the ultimate in fighting game styles, especially when it came to visual presentation. SSFIV’s 3D backgrounds and character models play on a 2D plane for a unique visual effect, and the special moves were well animated, as well as colorful. There are 35 characters available, two of which are brand new to the franchise (Juri and Hakan). The online mode is better than the original, and it came with balancing tweaks that made the game way more enjoyable. The Ultra version of SFIV is still working out the balancing kinks, and is too derivative of Super Street Fighter IV to include it in this list. So, Super Street Fighter IV currently stands as the best Street Fighter game, and therefore, is the best fighting game ever made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T13:24:43.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
