A photo posted by Paul Labile Pogba (@paulpogba) on Jan 16, 2017 at 7:23am PST \nBut he opted for a different emoji on Instagram to give his thoughts on the match, insisting that he and his team-mates must start preparing for the next match - away to Stoke on Saturday. \n\"[Sh*t] happens,\" he posted with a picture. \"That's when we need be strong.
