Set in France and produced by Said Ben Said and Michel Merkt, “Elle” has been described as a powerful rape-revenge thriller laced with dark humor. The movie was acquired by Sony Pictures Classics at Cannes. \nThe biggest surprise of the night was Xavier Dolan winning best director and editing with “It’s Only The End of the World” which also earned Gaspard Ulliel the best actor prize. Dolan is currently shooting “The Death and Life of John F. Donovan” in Prague. \nDolan won over Paul Verhoeven (“Elle”), Houda Benyamina (“Divines”), François Ozon (“Frantz”), Anne Fontaine (“Les Innocentes”), Bruno Dumont, “Slack Bay” and Nicole Garcia’s “From the Land of Moon.” \nGeorge Clooney, who received the honorary Cesar, rocked the boat with a political speech calling out President Donald Trump. \nWelcomed on stage with a standing ovation, Clooney said Trump has exploited rather than created the current climate of fear and uncertainty in the U.S. \nClooney received the honorary Cesar award from the hands of Dujardin. The pair drew some laugher when Clooney asked Dujardin, whose English is notoriously limited, to translate his speech in France. \nClooney attended the ceremony with his pregnant wife, Amal Clooney, and sat in the front row between Alain Terzian, the president of the Academy of Cinema Arts and Techniques, and Clooney’s pal, French actor Jean Dujardin (“The Artist”). \nHouda Benyamina’s directorial debut “Divines,” which won the Camera d’Or in Cannes and earned a Golden Globe nomination, won best first film, female newcomer for Oulaya Amamra, among other prizes. \nA politically-minded and contempo friendship tale, “Divines” stars Amamra and Deborah Lukumuena as two friends determined to make money fast and escape to a better life. \nConceived by Benyamina following the 2005 riots that erupted near Paris, “Divines” was acquired by Netflix following its premiere at Cannes’ Directors Fortnight. \nKen Loach’s Cannes’ Palme d’Or-winning “I, Daniel Blake” won best foreign film prize at France’s Cesar Awards on Friday. \n“I, Daniel Blake,” a contemporary social drama about an ailing carpenter fighting to stay on welfare in the U.K., beat out Maren Ade’s “ Toni Erdmann ,” which is vying for best foreign-language film at the Oscars and was a favorite the win the Cesar nod. Other foreign-language nominees were Kenneth Lonergan’s “Manchester by the Sea,” which is up for best picture at the Oscars; Xavier Dolan’s “It’s Only the End of the World,” from Canada; Cristian Mungiu’s “Graduation,” from Romania; Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “Aquarius,” from Portugal; and Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne’s “The Unknown Girl,” from Belgium. \nAs expected, the ceremony did not have a president, following the controversy and protests which led Franco-Polish director Roman Polanski to give up the honorary role. Polanski had been appointed to preside by the Academy of Cinema Arts and Techniques. \nClaude Barras’s “My Life as a Courgette,” which is also competing for an Oscar, won best animated feature over Sébastien Laudenbach’s “La Jeune Fille Sans Mains” and Michael Dudok De Wit’s “La Tortue Rouge,” another animated feature Oscar nominee.
