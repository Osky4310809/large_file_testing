Beneath all the glamour, controversy and drama that shrouds her, here's a side of Sofia that everyone can relate to. Read on to find out more... A post shared by Sofia Hayat. (Gaia Mother) (@sofiahayat) on Mar 16, 2017 at 1:40pm PDT Your fans are eagerly waiting to know about your fiance... \nEveryone has been waiting for his name and I have kept it quiet because he is not a celebrity. I wanted to protect him. He is a beautiful soul with a heart of gold, a gentle kind man. His name is Vlad Stanescu. He is an Interior Designer from Romania. He is extremely creative and so talented. He has worked on palaces for His Majesty King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, HRH Queen Silvia of Sweden, HRH Prince William Duke of Cambridge, HRH The Sultan of Brunei, HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Nasser bin Jassim Al Thani of Qatar etc. He notices the smallest things. He is a true gentleman. He is a very old soul, and behaves so beautifully. He always pulls out my chair at dinner, opens car doors, never asks me to meet him somewhere, instead he insists on coming to me in a car, opening the door, dropping me off. He remembers the smallest of things that I say, the things I like, what makes me smile, and then he does more of those things, because he says that if he makes me happy and smile, and makes my life easier, it makes him happy. Who proposed first and where? \nWell, we were having dinner and it was a mutual thing, he said to me, I love you so much that I would marry you now, I said yes, he then formally proposed, and I said yes, two days later we got a ring. Are we going to see Sofia getting married soon? \nWe are getting married on the April 24 this year. Our ceremony is the blessing of all as one, Hindu, Muslim, Gnostic, Christian, Buddhist and Tibetan. The all, true divinity by an ancient Egyptian High Priestess who served me when I was Goddess Isis. We have already had our Islamic wedding. What is the most beautiful quality about Vlad that makes you fall in love with him every day? \nI have never met anyone who has such love and respect for female divinity. He surprises me with flowers every other day, brings me little gifts that mean something, writes little love notes on rose petals for me to find. I look into his eyes, and I see me. He makes me feel that I am the most beautiful and perfect woman. His energy and heart are so pure and loving. He does not have any other emotion except love. He reflects my heart as I do his. A post shared by Sofia Hayat. (Gaia Mother) (@sofiahayat) on Mar 16, 2017 at 1:49pm PDT What does your family think of him? \nThey adore him!!Did you get any congratulatory phone calls from Bollywood celebrities post engagement?Yes I did. My friends are extremely happy for me. They can sense my happiness and have never seen me so in love. I guess that is what unconditional love does. How do you deal with all the haters and naysayers online who cook up stories about you without knowing the real you? \nI understand that we are all energy. We emit energy and the universe responds to the energies that you emit. It is like tuning into a radio station, when you tune into a classical music station, you hear classical music, when you tune into pop music radio station, and you hear pop music. Humans are the same. Whatever you emit, you are. So the haters and people who make negative comments, are the negative comments. It is their energy and not mine, they created the hateful comments, they are the creators of that, therefore they are that which they create. I send them love, because love is the only thing that can change hate. That is our mission, the Cosmic Father and Mother in Union with the Son, to bring humanity back to Unconditional Love. Last year, you said that you will never get married, have sex and have children. After a year, you announced that you are engaged. What inspired this change of heart? \nI did not have a change of heart. At the time, that was my truth, now this is my truth. I was not lying when I said that. That is what I was then. An easy way of explaining this is, some people get married because they love that person, then some people get divorced because they no longer have that love for that person. That does not mean they were lying when they first fell in love. My beautiful baby face..I look at you with such love. I adore you x A post shared by Sofia Hayat. (Gaia Mother) (@sofiahayat) on Mar 16, 2017 at 3:07pm PDT You were quite open about you past struggles, even in the ' Bigg Boss ' house. Do you think your spiritual awakening has made you a forgiving person? \nAbsolutely. We must always forgive, and the energy that comes with non-forgiving can cause stagnant energy to build up in the body and cause illnesses. This does not mean that you must tolerate any harmful behaviour toward yourself. You must step away from it. To remove judgment, fear and to have an open heart leads to enlightenment and living from the soul. When one lives from the soul you are a true Quantum being. A post shared by Sofia Hayat. (Gaia Mother) (@sofiahayat) on Mar 16, 2017 at 4:01pm PDT Any film and television offer which has been offered to you? \nYes, but I do not have time for that now, as I am working hard on the supernatural level to bring humanity to awakening.
