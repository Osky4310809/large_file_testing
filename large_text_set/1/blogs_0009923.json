We'll see when it's possible for him to start training with us.\" \nThe former Sporting and Olympiakos boss is also keen to retain influential midfielder Robert Snodgrass despite speculation regarding an improved offer from West Ham. \n\"I hope [he won't leave],\" Silva said. \"Really, I hope no. We need to improve our squad.\" \nThe numbers in his playing group took another hit after Markus Henriksen and youngster Josh Tymon left the action at United through injury. \nSilva confirmed midfielder Henriksen's problem was \"probably more serious\" after he landed awkwardly following a challenge with Paul Pogba and damaged his shoulder, while Tymon's late withdrawal was \"just a kick, nothing serious\". \nHull host Bournemouth in search of a first win since November on Saturday and the recently installed Silva, who had his name sung by the travelling supporters at Old Trafford for long spells, added: \"We had many problems to solve during the last days, and I'm very happy with the performance. \n\"Obviously I'm not happy with the result but I am with the performances. \nFA rejects John Terry red card appeal \n\"We only had players on the bench from the academy. But we need to be positive because we need to keep this club in the Premier League. \n\"The next game for us is the most important game for us. We need to rest our players to give them a recovery. We need to win points for our fans.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T03:13:55.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
