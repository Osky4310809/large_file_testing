It also makes our water smell. \nWe do like: \nHalf cut seedless grapes, Cooked Rice, Birdseed (any type of mix), Peas, Corn, Oats, Chopped lettuce \nI'VE BEEN FEEDING DUCKS BREAD THIS WHOLE TIME IM SO ASHAMED IM SUCH A MONSTER pic.twitter.com/dzyicjJc7Q \n— d (@proudsIytherin) March 22, 2017 \nThe photo traveled wide through the Twitter-sphere — “I am a duck murderer,” said one user — and we’re assuming people across the world promptly kicked themselves for tossing ducks bread as a snack (we’ve all done it).\nListen, what’s done is done, and now you know.\nWe scoured Instagram for ducks who are pumped that someone put the word out to do the right thing. Put that unwanted crust in the trash, and next time, try tossing some of the tasty treats mentioned above.\nJust don’t do it. \nSomebody got a bit #muddy in the #garden #duck #ducks #muscovyduck #instahappy #instagood #picoftheday \nA post shared by Chloe Wood (@wanderer_chloe) on Mar 24, 2017 at 11:17am PDT\nThis is a bread-free zone. \nThis picture always cracks me up, that angry duck at the back lol #naturephotography #nature #ducks #funny #photography #animals #winter \nA post shared by Eviechi (@eviechi_) on Mar 24, 2017 at 11:04am PDT\nFREEZE!

Preening, fluffing, following her around…much to the annoyance of the other male. Quite a lot of chasing off this morning, but he remains undeterred. -#ducks #ente #erpel #urbanwildlife #nature #animals #feathers #duckstagram \nA post shared by Silvia (@irrblossar) on Mar 24, 2017 at 10:05am PDT\nTo read more about why you shouldn’t feed waterfowl bread, visit the Audubon Society’s website.
