Some start out strong and end up losing viewers over time, while others just can’t make it work in their freshman season. Plus, as audiences know all too well, cancellations aren’t always predictable . While some seem doomed right from the start, others remain on the bubble for some time.\nIn the coming months, all five major TV networks will have to decide which entries from their lineup — from sitcoms to fantasy dramas — will get officially pulled. Here’s a look at 14 shows that may be counting this TV season as their last.\n1. Maya & Marty Maya & Marty | NBC\nNBC’s second attempt at a variety show (following Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris ) failed to impress in its freshman season. The show, hosted by Maya Rudolph and Martin Short, features various comedy sketches, musical performances, and celebrity guests. Though its premiere garnered a solid 6.26 million viewers, ratings declined quickly, with the sixth and final episode dipping down to only 3.94 million viewers.\nWith lackluster ratings and equally mixed reviews, NBC may not want to take another chance on Maya & Marty .\n\n2. Training Day Training Day | CBS\nCBS’s latest attempt to adapt a hit film isn’t going well. Training Day is performing even worse than Rush Hour did in its first few weeks on air. The February premiere of Training Day earned just a 0.9 in the key 18–49 demographic, making it the second lowest series debut for the network this season (after Pure Genius ). As if that wasn’t bad enough, the show has only continued to dip in ratings in subsequent weeks.\nGiven its very slow start, it seems like the drama has little shot of returning for a sophomore season.\n\n3. Scream Queens Scream Queens | Fox\nFox’s horror comedy earned a second season renewal, largely because it made up for soft ratings with significant DVR and on-demanding viewing. But this season hasn’t been quite as successful. So far, the sophomore season of the series is falling well below last year’s average in live viewership and demographic score — and unlike last season, its DVR viewership isn’t adding much.\nRight now, its future remains a toss-up, but if the show can’t stabilize in the upcoming weeks, it might find itself in jeopardy of cancellation.\n\n4. The Real O’Neals The Real O’Neals | ABC\nThanks to its slate of family sitcoms, ABC has solid comedy blocks on both Tuesdays and Wednesday. But there’s one notable exception: The Real O’Neals . The second-year comedy has lagged pretty far behind its counterparts, averaging just a 0.93 rating this season. To put that into perspective, that’s a full 35% lower than the next lowest-rated comedy, Fresh Off the Boat .\nThose lackluster numbers will likely put the show in jeopardy, when it comes time for ABC to determine their lineup later this year.\n\n5. The Exorcist The Exorcist | Fox\nGiven the classic predecessor it has to live up to, The Exorcist earned surprisingly decent reviews in the lead up to its premiere. Unfortunately, it hasn’t fared anywhere near as well in viewership. The Fox show didn’t exactly come out swinging in its premiere and it fell another 40% in the following week. Of course, it’s early on, so it still has a chance to rebound, but if it doesn’t improve, it could find itself on the chopping block at the end of the season.\n\n6. Code Black Code Black | CBS\nAfter a lackluster first season, CBS made some changes to Code Back and brought it back for Season 2. Unfortunately for the network, the revamp hasn’t helped much. The medical drama is still struggling in ratings, earning only an average 0.97 demographic score throughout its second season. With few signs of improvement, CBS will likely have little motivation to bring the series back for more episodes.\n\n7. Rosewood Rosewood | Fox\nFox’s drama managed to earn a second season renewal last year, despite terrible reviews and average ratings. But things have changed this time around. The second season of Rosewood is averaging a 0.73 rating in the 18–49 demographic and drawing an average audience of 3.30 million viewers. Compared to its first season, that means Season 2 is down by 31% in its average total audience. The decrease could signal the show’s potential end, although a decision has yet to be announced.\n\n8. The Odd Couple The Odd Couple | CBS\nThe CBS reboot proved to be a bit of a surprise last season. Despite being have its premiere pushed back to April and running in a unconventional twice-a-week format during the month of May, the show brought in surprisingly strong ratings, ultimately earning a Season 3 renewal.\nUnfortunately, this season — which premiered in the fall instead of midseason — just isn’t delivering in the same manner. With recent episodes scoring barely over a 1.0 in adults 18–49, The Odd Couple is currently CBS’s lowest-rated comedy — by a fair margin. With the network now introducing new comedies to its lineup, this sitcom could soon find itself replaced.\n\n9. Elementary Elementary | CBS\nElementary is in its fifth season on CBS, but it may not be around much longer. Though never a huge ratings earner for the network, the show saw a significant drop in viewership last season — and things aren’t going much better this time around.\nIn recent episodes, the show only drew a 0.6 rating in the 18–49 demographic, which is low by any standards, but especially by CBS’s. Given those numbers, and the fact that the series now has enough episodes for syndication, the network may decide to do away with it altogether.\n\n10. Secrets and Lies Secrets and Lies Season 2 | ABC\nIt was kind of surprising that ABC decided to bring Secrets and Lies back for a sophomore season, considering that it was billed as a one-off miniseries and didn’t earn great ratings. Unfortunately, Season 2 is proving to be even more disappointing, earning only an average 0.7 demographic score and 3.2 million viewers so far.\nGiven its lackluster performance and equally poor reviews, it’s very unlikely that the drama will get a third shot from the network.\n\n11. Frequency Frequency | The CW\nThough The CW’s new adaptation earned decent reviews ahead of its debut in the fall of 2016, it hasn’t fared quite as well in ratings. The show has garnered an average 0.3 demographic score and 1.02 million viewers so far this season. That’s pretty low, even for The CW.\nThe show’s shot at survival was made even bleaker with the network’s decision not to order additional Season 1 episodes . While Frequency is not officially canceled, the chance of it coming back to The CW is slim.\n\n12. Quantico Quantico | ABC\nTwo seasons in and Quantico is not the strong performer it once was. The ABC drama has struggled in ratings in recent weeks, scoring middling viewership and a low average of 0.75 in the key demographic throughout its sophomore season. To be fair, the show likely owes some of its decline to a change in time slot, having been moved from Sunday nights to Monday nights for Season 2.\nWhether ABC will decide to give it one more chance in a different slot remains to be seen, but the show certainly isn’t a sure bet for renewal this time around.\n\n13 . The Blacklist The Blacklist | NBC\nNBC’s The Blacklist was a solid performer for the network in its first three seasons, but Season 4 earned significantly lower ratings, with a poor 1.1 score in the 18-49 demographic.\nGiven its successful history on the network, NBC probably won’t be too quick to pull the plug, but if things don’t turn around, the drama could be in danger of cancellation after this season.\n\n14. Son of Zorn Son of Zorn | Fox\nSince its debut, the part-animated, part live-action series has been pulling in only so-so ratings for Fox. Its freshman season has raked in an average of 3.4 million viewers and a 1.3 score in the key demographic. While those numbers are pretty on par with Fox’s other quirky comedy, The Last Man on Earth , the latter has earned critical acclaim and become an award season contender over the last couple of years. Plus, it’s closer to syndication than Son of Zorn .\nWith Son of Zorn underperforming and earning mixed reviews, it could find itself on the chopping block at the end of this season.\nCheck out Entertainment Cheat Sheet on Facebook!\n\nRead the original article from The Cheat Sheet ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T14:27:47.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
