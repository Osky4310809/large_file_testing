He wanted to find out what was happening and how he could help. \n\"But it's not a financial issue. We own our ground and generate funds from hiring our facilities. \n\"We just feel there's a lack of support for the club and Non-League football in general.\" Bolasie is battling back from a serious knee injury (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nHillingdon helped Bolasie on the road to stardom when he joined the club as a teenager. \nHe has climbed the ladder via Plymouth, Barnet, Bristol City and Crystal Palace before his £24million move to Goodison Park in the summer. \nHowever, the DR Congo international played for Borough for free, although he received a goal bonus of a free burger from the club's kitchen. \nDhand recalled: \"I wanted to sign him for £20-a-week, but others didn't agree. \n\"I ended up giving him a burger for every goal. He once scored eight, so he shared them with his teammates.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T14:01:24.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
