The intention of Restricted Mode is to filter out mature content for the tiny subset of our users who want a more limited experience. \n\"LGBTQ+ videos are available in Restricted Mode, but videos that discuss more sensitive issues may not be,\" the statement read. \nThe YouTube spokesman said that a \"very small subset of users\" had switched on the feature. \nVlogger Rowen Ellis, who has more than 22,000 followers and describes the content she creates as \"pop culture from a feminist and queer perspective,\" posted a video Friday in which she stated that around 40 of her videos cannot be seen on restricted mode. \n\"We don't really know how long … it's been there but it's something I think people are just starting to realize the extent of it, particularly in regards to LGBT-related content,\" Ellis said. \nOthers posted examples on Twitter in which it appeared that videos with titles that included the words \"gay\" and \"lesbian\" were hidden in restricted mode. Just looked at my videos with the \"restricted mode\" on.
