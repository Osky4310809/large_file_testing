Data roaming, or using mobile data in places other than where the phone is registered, also demands extra fees. \nLi's announcement is one of the points that the report promised for innovation in the internet industry. Acknowledging that \"in the age of internet, faster and more cost-effective information networks are crucial to the development of every sector\", the report pledged to increase broadband and lower rates for other internet services. \nSmall and medium enterprises can also expect fall in broadband services this year, according to the report. \nRelated Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T06:44:04.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
