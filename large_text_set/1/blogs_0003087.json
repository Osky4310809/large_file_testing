Rather than pies, chefs and owners Matthew and Emily Hyland are bringing along Emily’s lauded burger (which Eater New York dubbed as a \"top notch\" burger) and the spicy chicken sandwich from sibling spot Emmy Squared. The burger and sandwich pop-up takes place on Tuesday, January 10th beginning at 5 p.m. Be warned: everything is available in very, very limited quantities, so this means lines are to expected and everything will sell out quickly. Proceeds from pop-up will go towards dog-focused Cane Rosso Rescue. The burger will go for $20 (in Brooklyn, it’s $26), and the chicken sandwich for $15. Why no pizza from the known wood-fired and Detroit-style pizzerias? Cane owner Jay Jerrier was taken with those dishes during meals at Emily and Emmy Squared and wanted to share the love with Texas. This kicks off Cane Rosso’s guest chef nights, where chefs will create a special pizza for the evening. The lineup includes Peached Tortilla’s Eric Silverstein (Monday, January 16); Evan LeRoy of soon-to-be barbecue joint LeRoy & Lewis (Monday, January 23), Valentina’s Tex Mex BBQ’s Miguel Vidal, Via 313’s Brandon and Zane Hunt, and Philip Speer. A portion of the speciality pizza sales will go towards a charity that each chef will choose. The pop-up will travel to Cane Rosso locations in Dallas (Monday, January 9) and Houston one (Thursday, January 12), too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T06:16:15.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
