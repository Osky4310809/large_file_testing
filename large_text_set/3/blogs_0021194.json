Courtois has been discussing Conte's future (Photo: AFP/Getty) \n“The talks are maybe just rumours, I don’t know,” said the Belgium goalkeeper. “But he’s important for the club. \n“I think the club knows that so they will do whatever to have a happy ending.” \nConte is already planning for next season and wants to be reunited with his former Juventus striker Alvaro Morata at Chelsea. \nRomelu Lukaku is a back-up target for Morata and Courtois says Conte is building something which will endure at Chelsea.
