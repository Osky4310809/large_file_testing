Additionally, there are blacked-out headlamp bezels and black window trim, which replaces the Edge SEL’s standard chrome.\n- \n-Inside, the Edge SEL Sport Appearance package includes a copper-colored dashboard trim piece and gray cloth seats with contrasting brown suede inserts and stitching. Ford notes that the Sport Appearance package offers Edge customers the chance to pair cloth seats with higher-end technology, notably Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system.
