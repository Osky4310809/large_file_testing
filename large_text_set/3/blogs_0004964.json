South Dakota became a state in 1889, and today, just over 814,180 people (approximately 10 people per square mile) live in the Mount Rushmore State. Because of its size, it’s best to decide which part of the state to explore first, before setting out. Here, we take a look at a dozen ways to see South Dakota from Rapid City . \n1. A terrific introduction to South Dakota’s Black Hills and Badlands area is The Journey Museum in Rapid City . The museum takes guests through the area’s 2.5 billion years of history through interactive displays showcasing geology, pioneer history, the Native American culture of Lakota Sioux, and even dinosaurs. Afterwards, stroll through the charming downtown and browse the cute shops, grab a bite to eat in the enticing restaurants and enjoy the peaceful vibe. For some presidential fun, grab a map and find out why Rapid City is called the “City of Presidents.” (Tip: Life-size bronze statues of all of America’s past presidents can be found along the city’s streets and sidewalks.) \n2. Speaking of presidents, when in South Dakota a visit to Mount Rushmore National Memorial , just about 20 miles from Rapid City and celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, is a definite must. Nearly three million people visit Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt each year. In addition to marveling at the craftsmanship of artist Gutzon Borglum, who carved the rocks, be sure and take a walk along the Presidential Trail for different perspectives of the monument, as well as some wildlife viewing (Tip: Wake up early and visit the monument at sunrise, when the sun’s light perfect reflects on the rock for fabulous photos, and crowds are smaller). \n3. Not far from Mount Rushmore is Crazy Horse Memorial , a passion project begun by sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski in 1948; his children are continuing his legacy today. The monument is easily seen from ground level, but for a closer look, take the tour up the hillside and come face-to-face with the monument to realize its sheer enormity first-hand. \n4. Fans of the show Deadwood will want to visit the historic western town of Deadwood , the entirety of which is a registered National Historic Landmark. A walk past the saloons and along the main street will transport you back to the days when Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane roamed those same streets. Then visit the Mount Moriah Cemetery, where Wild Bill and Calamity Jane rest in peace side-by-side with murderers, madams and pillars of society. Warm up a cold night in Colorado's Hot Springs Loop \n5. The Gold Rush found its way into “them there hills” of South Dakota, and a visit to the Broken Boot Gold Mine submerges you right into the mining life. A guide winds you through the tunnels, telling stories from the mine’s glory days. And when the light turns off, well, you’ve never seen pitch black darkness as complete as this. \n6. South Dakota is a big state to traverse, so whenever you can get out and stretch your legs, take advantage. Spearfish Canyon State & National Forest Scenic Byway in the Black Hills is a terrific place to do just that – choose from walking, hiking, or biking. One rewarding hike is through tall canyon walls to Roughlock Falls with stunning views of the natural beauty all around. For a more strenuous hike, check out Harney Peak , the highest point east of the Rocky Mountains and west of the Pyrenees Mountains in Europe at 7,242 feet. \n7. In the 1930s, travelers through South Dakota fought terrible dust storms during their long drives. To help quench those travelers’ dry mouths – and to draw them into their store – the proprietors of Wall Drug in Wall, S.D., advertised free ice water. The campaign worked, and Wall Drug still stands today, and still offers free ice water to travelers. Stop in for a sip, or spend some time shopping in the eclectic shops and grab a bite to eat (Tip: The ice cream’s a good way to cool off, too). \n8. The 1880 Train , an historic steam train, runs between Keystone and Hill City, offering passengers a taste of the way travelers made their way across the USA back in the late-1800s. Along the way, an onboard narration shares the history of the area, and the slow-moving train is a terrific way to travel through the Black Hills’ landscape. \n9. Tatanka: Story of the Bison is a tribute to the 30 to 60 million bison that once roamed the U.S. plains; at the end of the 19th century, less than 1,000 survived. A highlight is the larger-than-life bronze sculpture of 14 bison being chased by three Native Americans on horseback; you can almost hear the hooves pounding on the ground below. \n10. Driving through South Dakota, Badlands National Park spans 244,000 acres and takes travelers by surprising, suddenly appearing in the prairie. Millions of years of erosion have carved out beautiful buttes, canyons and gullies, making for dramatic landscapes (Tip: Plan to see the sunrise and/or sunset for more drama). \n11. A drive along the Needles Highway in Custer State Park provides even more spectacular views, winding through pine and spruce forests, and through meadows surrounded by birch and aspen trees and granite mountains. The highlight of the drive is passing by The Needle, a stunning needle-like granite formation, and then through the mountain itself – don’t be surprised if you find yourself holding your breath to squeeze your car through. \n12. Each September, Custer State Park holds the annual Buffalo Roundup to check in on the park’s resident buffalo herd of 1,300 or so, and everyone is invited to watch the fun. Horse handlers, cowboys and cowgirls from throughout South Dakota enter a lottery system to help out with the roundup, and use their skills to corral the massive animals for a head count, medical checks and branding, if needed. The roundup is really a sight to be seen, and it’s up to the buffalo as to how quickly, or slowly, the roundup happens – a game of cat and mouse at its best. In 2014, 14,434 people watched the roundup; that number skyrocketed to 21,929 in 2015 for the roundup’s 50th anniversary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:20:19.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
