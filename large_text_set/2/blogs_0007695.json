TMZ reports that police in San Francisco responded to a call on Saturday morning regarding an alleged domestic incident involving Smith and a woman. \nPolice allegedly took a report after speaking with Smith and the woman, but there were no arrests. Per the TMZ report, there is an “active investigation” ongoing as a result of that visit. \nIf that investigation does result in an arrest, Smith’s chances of returning to Oakland’s lineup would likely move to the slimmer end of the spectrum.
