(Photo: Getty) Share Get daily   \nThere’s an exhaustion epidemic that’s sweeping the country, with four out of five women complaining of extreme tiredness. \nToo knackered to exercise, or too tired for chores? You might be low on iron. It’s one of the most common causes of unexplained tiredness, but iron supplements have got a bad rep because of their dodgy side effects. \nWe spoke to TV’s Dr Hilary Jones and nutrition scientist Dr Emma Derbyshire to find out more about this deficiency and what you can do to help feel more lively. 1. What iron does... Red blood cells (Photo: Getty) \n\"Iron is essential for the oxygen-carrying part of red blood cells, which is why tiredness is usually the first signs of a shortfall,\" says Dr Hilary. Without enough iron, your red blood cells simply can’t carry enough oxygen to your organs and tissue, which means they don’t work as efficiently. 2. Feeling exhausted? Symptoms can include feeling dizzy or faint, shortness of breath and headaches (Photo: Getty) Read More Why am I always tired? The top reasons why you’re tired all the time and how to get your energy back \nFeeling knackered is such a common complaint that doctors have even given it a nickname — TATT, or Tired All The Time syndrome. \n\"One of the most common things I see in my surgery is people feeling worn out,\" says Dr Hilary. If we can’t figure out what’s making them tired from their lifestyle, we’ll do a blood test and check their iron levels.\" \nAfter Vitamin D, iron is the second most common deficiency in the UK. Other symptoms include palpitations, feeling dizzy or fainting, restless legs at night, shortness of breath, cold hands and feet, and headaches. 3. Who’s at risk of being deficient? Athletic women are more at risk (Photo: Getty) \n■ Menstruating women during a heavy period, women lose a cup of blood – which can contain 125mg of iron. \n■ Sporty types \"Even among young women who are quite physically fit, the levels of deficiency are high – 60% of female athletes are not getting enough iron and it impacts on their performance,\" says Dr Hilary. \n■ Vegetarians \"Iron found in meat is the most easily absorbed type,\" explains Dr Emma. \"Plus healthy foods like beans, lentils and nuts might be good for you, but they can block the absorption of iron.\" \n■ Irritable Bowel Syndrome sufferers IBS means nutrients are often not well digested in the gut, so sufferers can be low on iron and vitamin B12. 4. Can we just eat more spinach? You'd have to eat a LOT of spinach to get your recommended amount (Photo: Getty) Read More Feeling dizzy? Here are seven reasons for a spinning head and how you can stop it \n\"There’s been a drop in the amount of iron people are consuming and it’s down to changes in eating trends,\" explains Dr Hilary. \n\"People are eating 13% less red meat than they used to, which contains the most easy-to-absorb form of iron.\" \nMore than a quarter of women aged 19 to 64 don’t eat enough iron. \n\"Many try the “just eat more dark leafy greens” approach, but you’d have to eat 17 tablespoons of spinach a day to get your recommended daily amount,\" says Dr Emma. \nBut there are a few ways you can boost your iron levels. Vitamin C has been shown to improve the absorption of iron by up to 181%, so try having a small glass of orange juice with your meal. Some foods – such as milk, tea, beans and chilli – hinder the absorption of iron, so limit these. 5. The problem with pills Many women have bad experiences with iron supplements \nIf your GP diagnoses you with low iron or anaemia, treatment is simple: tablets such as ferrous sulphate to boost your levels. But 80% of women taking iron supplements complain of unpleasant side effects. Strong supplements can be hard on your digestive system, and can cause black stools, constipation, diarrhoea, stomach cramps and nausea. \nMenstruating women need about 18mg of iron a day, but many supplements contain 200mg. Because the body only absorbs the iron it needs, the excess left in the gut causes those nasty side effects. \n\"In an ideal world, every patient would be tested and prescribed an appropriate level for their deficiency,\" says Dr Emma. \"Many people have had such bad experiences with traditional supplements they have been put off.\" \nLast year, there were over six million prescriptions for iron supplements in the UK, but 40% admit skipping their tablets altogether as a result of side effects. \nTry one of these gentler supplements:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T09:28:13.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
