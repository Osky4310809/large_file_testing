Or maybe a collaborative album. The sky is apparently the limit here. \nThis all thanks to Smash Mouth’s active Twitter presence, as the band previously tried to get the attention of Parquet Courts by tweeting at someone that wasn’t the band but had the handle @ParquetCourts1, saying “ They’re awesome .” Smash Mouth’s love of modern indie bands was taken to the next level when it declared Car Seat Headrest’s “Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales” as one of the best songs of 2016. @carseatheadrest One of the best songs of 2016 point blank! — Smash Mouth (@smashmouth) August 1, 2016 \nThings escalated when someone tweeted that Smash Mouth and Car Seat Headrest should release a split EP where they cover each other’s songs. Understanding its place in the world, Smash Mouth tweeted , “I don’t think they would think that’s cool but we’re game,” following that up with, “ They don’t need our old asses! ” But to the surprise of the old-ass-havers in Smash Mouth, the band it had been courting responded with, “ Let’s make it happen! ” After all, when the water’s warm you might as well swim. \nWhile this all feels like the kind of thing that’s a fun joke on Twitter but will never materialize in the real world, in an interview with Australian radio station Triple J, Car Seat Headrest’s Will Toledo spoke about the budding collaboration with Smash Mouth. While he said that this arrangement “kind of remains a mysterious front,” he seems optimistic that something will materialize very soon. \nWe’re hoping that something will happen with that in the future. Really, we don’t know what right now, but if nothing else, we’ll probably cover a few of their songs. I grew up obviously knowing their hits, and I have been listening a lot to Astro Lounge , and I still think it’s a great record. The songs really hold up as pop songs. \nWhen asked if the plan is to collaborate or just cover a few songs, Toledo seemed unsure of what the final product would be: “Right now, my plan is just to cover a couple things, but we really haven’t gotten into discussion as to what exactly it’s going to be.” While no one can say for sure there will be a Car Seat Headrest/Smash Mouth collaborative album coming in 2017, for our part we can say that the top spot on our best albums of 2017 list is ready and waiting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T18:21:23.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
