That’s nearly double the amount of men who said the same. (In fact, 30 percent of men regretted not getting frisky when they were given the chance.) \nWomen did worry more about pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections , and loss of reputation associated with casual sex, but those factors don’t account for the sex differences when it came to post-sex regret. Even the difference in sexual satisfaction didn’t seem to explain the disparity. \nInstead, researchers suggested that it comes down to fundamental differences that tie into evolutionary psychology. Basically, women may be more wired to see sex as a way to have children with a supportive partner. A short-term rendezvous wouldn’t provide that for them. But for men, the results of short-term sex wouldn’t be so problematic—so they look for casual opportunities more than women do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T06:28:54.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
