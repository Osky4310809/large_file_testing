Cedric Richmond (D-La.) made a joke about White House adviser Kellyanne Conway being photographed sitting on her knees on the Oval Office couch. \nRichmond, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, is seen on video gesturing to Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who apparently referenced the photograph moments earlier. \nSpicer: 'Sessions Was 100% Straight, There's Nothing to Recuse Himself From' \n\"I really just want to know what was going on there,\" Richmond said, smiling, \"You can just explain to me that circumstance, because she really looked kind of familiar there in that position there.\" \nScott appeared to grimace at the comment, and Richmond told him \"don't answer-- and I don't want you to refer back to the 90's.\" \nAs the Washington Post pointed out , Richmond could have been referencing the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998, which led to then-President Bill Clinton being impeached. \nAfter conservatives objected to the video, Richmond said Tuesday that he did not mean to imply anything of a sexual nature, contending that acting \"familiar\" was once popular jargon for \"behaving too comfortably.\" Subscribe \nStay connected with the most-trusted name in cable news through exclusive videos, show highlights and behind-the-scenes details.
