Terms are not known at this time. \nArizona had already signed veteran receiver Jeff Mathis, presumably to pair with Chris Herrmann behind the dish. Instead, perhaps, Herrmann will continue in a broader utility role, as he did last year. \n[RELATED: Updated Diamondbacks Depth Chart ] \nThe 33-year-old Iannetta hasn’t hit much recently, but was a high-quality OBP threat over the 2012-14 campaigns. If he can bounce back in the BABIP department, perhaps he’ll return to being a solid offensive force. There are also questions behind the dish, where Iannetta has wavered in pitch-framing ratings. He emerged as a top-quality framer in 2015, but fell back to receiving poor ratings last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T06:14:10.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
