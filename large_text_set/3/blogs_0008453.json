Most of these packs range in the $1 to $2 range, and you’ll never hear me complain about free icon packs. \nTo use these icon packs, you’ll need a launcher such as Nova Launcher, or any other launcher that supports 3rd-party icon packs. There are plenty of launchers to choose from on Google Play, so take your pick. \nAs for the packs, they all range in look, offering anywhere from 600+ to 3500+ custom icons, all looking quite different and capable of aligning with whatever look you’re going for. Check them all out and just download them. They’re free! \nFree Icon Pack Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T06:19:51.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
