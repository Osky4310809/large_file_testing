Five people have been shot in downtown in the past 24 hours, police said, and at least nine have been wounded by gunfire citywide since the start of the year. Police have yet to address possible motives in the downtown shootings, released any of the victims' identities or say whether the two incidents are connected. \"Our investigators are still gathering information from this morningâ€™s shooting as well as the shooting that occurred on Saturday morning,\" Sgt. Catherine Michal, a police spokeswoman, said. We are waiting to see what our investigators find out.\" The latest gunfire occurred about 2:20 a.m. Sunday in the 300 block of 3rd Avenue N., an area of downtown with many nightspots nearby, police said. No arrests have been made. Upon arrival, officers located a man and a woman with gunshot wounds, police continued. Paramedics from Hennepin County Medical Center and officers provided medical care to the victims. The man was declared dead at the scene, while the woman was hospitalized with noncritical injuries, police said. The man is the city's first homicide of 2017. Barely 24 hours earlier in a few blocks away downtown, three people were shot, with one hospitalized in critical condition. No arrests have been announced in that burst of gunfire. Officers working off-duty near 3rd Street and 1st Avenue N. found two adults suffering from gunshot wounds around 2 a.m. Saturday. A man who was shot multiple times was taken to HCMC for citical injuries. A woman who was also shot was treated at HCMC for noncritical wounds. Just after 3:30 a.m., officers were informed that a third victim had been treated at North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale for a graze wound and released. He told police that he had been shot downtown. Investigators interviewed witnesses in the area of both shootings and were checking with business owners in the area to see whether images on surveillance cameras offered any clues. Police said officers will be in the area in the coming days speaking with business owners about the violence. Anyone with information is encouraged to text 847411 (TIP411).
