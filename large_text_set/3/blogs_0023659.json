As the designer brand's celebrity ambassador, Gomez arrived at the school looking to spread the after-school program's message of empowerment and fulfilling one's potential. \nHowever, as Gomez told the room of teens, she wanted the atmosphere to be comfortable, casual and for everyone to feel free to get to know her, although \"most of you know most of my life anyway,\" she joked. \nThe star mingled with the students, pulling up a seat to chat and impart some advice, like \"love yourself first\"—a message Gomez has been personally following as of late.
