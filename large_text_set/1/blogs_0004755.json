Doherty posted on her Twitter account Wednesday that she was doubling up on her radiation in an effort to finish that course of her breast cancer treatment. \nMeanwhile….. gonna do a double up day of radiation so I get completely finished this week!!\n— Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 4, 2017 \nCompletion of radiation would mean Doherty could turn her focus from fighting breast cancer to healing from it by reconstructing the breast Shannen had removed last spring. Doherty explained the process to a fan who asked Shannen what the next step was.\n@Carlychristina8 wait for radiation to leave body, get tested and hope we got it all. After that, I start the road to reconstruction.\n— Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 4, 2017 \nAnother day of radiation. Meet Anna and Vince, 2 members of my radiation team. They make a concerted effort to talk to me and show me what's going on in this process so I don't feel so out of control in it. Never be too timid to speak up and ask for what you need to get thru the process. None of this is easy but a great team can make it more pleasant. #cancerslayer #fightlikeagirl #warrior #communicationiskey \nA photo posted by ShannenDoherty (@theshando) on Dec 7, 2016 at 1:26pm PST \nShannen has been undergoing radiation for nearly two months. Doherty will more than likely have to wait several weeks to several months for her breast construction to take place, however, as her oncology team determines whether or not they have gotten all of the cancer. Depending on the type of radiation Shannen has been having, according to the American Cancer Society, Doherty’s oncologist will more than likely perform a PET scan to check for any signs of cancer left. Because radiation causes what are called “hot spots” on this particular test, Shannen will have to sit back and wait for the radioactive cells to clear out in order to get an accurate reading. \nShannen Doherty revealed her breast cancer diagnosis in August of 2015 after news sources obtained a copy of a lawsuit Shannen had filed against her former business manager. Doherty’s lawsuit accused her business manager of failing to pay her health insurance premiums which resulted in a delay in Shannen having preventative care, including a mammogram. Shannen and her former business manager eventually reached a settlement for an undisclosed amount last summer. \nSoon after Shannen came forward with the news of her breast cancer battle, Doherty began to realize the impact her vulnerability of admitting her fear and distress was having on others who were going through the same thing. Normally a very private person in regard to her personal life, Shannen began to document her breast cancer journey on social media as a means of helping not only her cope but encouraging others. \nShannen regularly included pictures of the transformation of her body, including the loss of her trademark jet black hair, as well as the emotional roller coaster of going through chemotherapy and radiation and all other facets of her cancer fight. \nStep 1 \nA photo posted by ShannenDoherty (@theshando) on Jul 19, 2016 at 9:07pm PDT \nStep 6 \nA photo posted by ShannenDoherty (@theshando) on Jul 19, 2016 at 9:05pm PDT \nThank you to these three who helped me thru an impossibly tough day and continue to be there every minute supporting and loving me. @kurtiswarienko was in Mexico working but knew he left me in good hands. @annemkortright @chriscortazzo #mamarosa I love you. #mycrew #thisisasquad \nA photo posted by ShannenDoherty (@theshando) on Jul 25, 2016 at 10:26am PDT \nThe many faces of cancer. Chemo Day. What we call the Red Devil being injected into me via the port thats in my chest.

In one post Shannen discussed an encounter with someone on an elevator who appeared terrified when they found out Doherty had just had a radiation treatment. Shannen took the time to let everyone know that didn’t mean she was radioactive and didn’t pose a health risk to others. \nDriving home from radiation with my love @kurtiswarienko Today, we were in an elevator and I was asked how I was feeling. I responded by saying that I had just gotten a radiation treatment so therefore very tired. The random girl on the elevator with us physically lunged away as far as she could. She then proceeded to look horrified for the next 3 floors. Just a heads up…. 1. You can't catch it 2. The radiation won't leak out of me and go into you. Hope that helps. #cancertruths from the #cancerslayer \nA photo posted by ShannenDoherty (@theshando) on Dec 15, 2016 at 3:19pm PST \nShannen revealed that after discovering her cancer had spread beyond the breast to the lymph nodes that she underwent a single mastectomy mid-2016 according to Entertainment Tonight . Because of the surgery to remove her breast, Doherty knew that she eventually wanted to have it reconstructed and in November shared a short video on Instagram as to what that process entails.\nGetting my expander expanded by my reconstructive surgeon @jayorringermd and the lovely Ana Marie. I consider myself very lucky and very blessed to have this man as my doctor. The last couple of days have been busy gearing up for radiation. #warrior #fightlikeagirl #cancerslayer \nA video posted by ShannenDoherty (@theshando) on Nov 17, 2016 at 11:09am PST \nShannen Doherty’s candor and bravery throughout the process of fighting breast cancer has brought her accolades from fellow actors and actresses including Ashton Kutcher , former Charmed co-star Alyssa Milano , and former Beverly Hills 90210 co-stars Jennie Garth, Jason Priestley, and Luke Perry. \nIf 2016 will be remembered as the year of celebrity deaths, perhaps Shannen Doherty’s completion of cancer treatment will help us remember 2017 as the year of celebrity survivors. \n[Featured image by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images.]\nShannen Doherty Finishing Radiation, Hoping To Be Cancer Free For New Year is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T03:34:44.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
