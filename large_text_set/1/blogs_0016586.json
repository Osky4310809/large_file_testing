You just surprised your hot wife with a trip to Mexico for her birthday. You pose with her for a photo on Instagram, because you love her that much. You even wore a tropical tank top, because you felt beyond confident enough to do so. On top of all that, you’re a quarterback for the Chicago Bears. You’ve been out with an injury for months, and all you want to do is hang out with your boo on a boat in peace—but that doesn’t matter, because all of a sudden, everyone thinking that you look “fat” is suddenly more important than all of that. \nThat’s what Jay Cutler had to deal with when his wife posted a photo of them enjoying some birthday vacay time in Mexico, reports the Chicago Tribune . After his wife, Kristin Cavallari, posted the photo to her Instagram (pictured above), Cutler was fat-shamed by a slew of commentors , even though the photo calls out how amazing of a husband he is.

Flabby,” one user commented. \n“Why is he so big?” another person wrote. \nCutler has yet to confront the trolls, but we’re just assuming he’s having an amazing time on the beach. While this may sound like an isolated incident, it’s actually not uncommon for men to deal with body shaming—here are four more times big-name celebs had to endure the gross trend. Leonardo DiCaprio #LeonardoDiCaprio has put on a few pounds. He's worth $200 Million and bangs supermodels. I don't think he cares. pic.twitter.com/eiklW9musX \n— Joe 'Monk' Pardavila (@joepardavila) July 21, 2014 \nWhen DiCaprio hit up Bora Bora with his ex-girlfriend and German model Toni Garn, people could only focus on how “bloated” he looked—and Page Six even called him the “The Great Fatsby.” The photos that emerged weren’t really out of the ordinary. Sure, he wasn’t rocking a six pack, but we’re definitely not going to get down on him for letting loose on his vacation. Vin Diesel A photo posted by Vin Diesel (@vindiesel) on Oct 11, 2015 at 11:49am PDT \nOut of all people, even the ever-muscular Vin Diesel faced body shaming after an unflattering photo of his “dad bod” was photographed in Miami —but it didn’t take long for Diesel to fire back on Instagram. \nHe used the opportunity to speak out against body-shaming and wrote: “It is amazing the response from the journalists who I have been talking to for the last two days in New York. Today one wanted to see the dad bod. Haha. I am wondering if I should show the picture… Body-shaming is always wrong! What do you think?” Rob Kardashian A photo posted by ROBERT KARDASHIAN (@robkardashian) on Dec 22, 2016 at 12:45pm PST \nThe lone Kardashian brother has been facing some serious backlash for his fluctuating weight gain for the past two years. After being diagnosed with diabetes and coming clean about his battle with depression , Kardashian has made an effort to eat healthier and hit the gym, but has had issues maintaining successful weight loss, TMZ reports. Either way, being a part of the most famous family in the world could take a toll on anyone—we give him props for making an effort to change. Jonah Hill \n— Page Six (@PageSix) April 30, 2015 \nJonah Hill always seemed to play the “funny fat guy.” When a photo of him emerged on the set of “Arms and the Dudes,” people went crazy over his heavier physique. The NY Daily News reported that Hill had allegedly gained 70 pounds , calling him “noticeably husky.” Despite the constant comments, Hill bounced back, and has been looking slimmer than ever.
