Whether this color is a shade of grey or violet (or a mix of both) remains to be seen, but if a new leak showing all three color options is to be believed , Samsung could be making all color variants fully black at the front. \nPersonally, I find this to be a good move on Samsung’s part. First, black is just a universally acceptable good-looking color that everyone can get behind. Second, and perhaps more important as one of our readers pointed out, it will help hide the array of sensors the Galaxy S8 has up front. With so little bezel at the front of the phone, those huge modules for the iris scanner and the front-facing camera could look rather ugly, and making all color variants black around the display is a very easy fix for it. \nThen there’s the fact that the black at the front will further hide the minimal amount of bezel, enabling an experience that’s all about the display, something Samsung has been hinting at with its official Galaxy S8 teasers. Given how Samsung’s AMOLED displays beat anything out there in terms of color reproduction and vividness, that can only be a good thing. Oh, and let’s not forget that an AMOLED display looks awesome on a dark-colored device when displaying dark images. If you have the black Galaxy S7 edge (or any other Samsung phone in the same color), just put an all-black wallpaper on the home screen to see what I mean. If anyone remembers the Galaxy Nexus, they’ll know what I’m talking about. \nSpeaking of the Galaxy Nexus, I’m just hoping Samsung doesn’t put its logo below the display as some images have shown, as that could ruin what would otherwise be a very attractive visual experience. Samsung had removed its logo from the Galaxy S7 and Note 7 in Japan last year , and it would be great to see the company making a similar move in every market with the S8. \nOf course, a lot of people will disagree with me, and that’s okay. Color choices are extremely personal, but my preference for black on my smartphones has me excited for the Galaxy S8, a device I”ll go buy on the first day of availability. What do you think about the possibility of every Galaxy S8 variant being all black from the front?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T17:11:24.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
