Her feed is full of before-and-after photos with minimal clothing showing off her progress (she lost 100 pounds!), hoping to inspire her followers in the process. Unfortunately, a few days go, one Instagram user decided to leave an awful comment on one of her posts pointing out her cellulite. And as a result of King's (epic) response to the hater, Instagram deleted her post. \nA post shared by SundayMorningView (@sundaymorningview) on Feb 20, 2017 at 1:21pm PST \n\nThankfully, another user managed to repost the photo with King' original caption, which is as follows: \"For that guy who made a negative comment about my cellulite yesterday. There are so many worse things in life than cellulite, like your sh*tty attitude. Let people do whatever the f*ck they want and look however they please and post whatever makes them happy. Find a hobby and worry about ya damn self.\" (Related: This Woman Was Body Shamed For Showing Cellulite in Her Honeymoon Photos ) \nKing's middle finger and partial nudity could have violated Instagram's Community Guidelines , but she seems to think that they deleted the photo for other reasons. (Instagram prohibits 'close-ups of fully-nude buttocks' which does seem like a bit of a stretch here.) That is why the body-positive activist took to Instagram again to post another photo calling out the social media platform for their double-standard. \nA post shared by Youtube Malzisfit (@mallorykingfitness) on Feb 22, 2017 at 3:23pm PST \n\nWhile referring to her removed photo, King says: \"This upsets me for two reasons 1) Why do thousands of posts go unremoved that show butts and boobs in WAY more vulgar ways than mine? Is it because my cellulite is offensive? Is it because I'm not trying to be sexy? Is it because I don't have the body type that is continuously shared on here? 2) Why are people so threatened by a woman unafraid of showing her body and speaking her mind? People used the excuse that their kid could see the photo. Don't let your kid on social media! No, that's not it.\" \nShe continued by calling out the media for brainwashing people into being offended by bodies that are 'outside the norm' and isn't the least bit deterred by Instagram deleting her photo. \"Y'all can report my photos as much as you want, I'm gonna keep sharing them because the world needs more women unashamed of their bodies and unafraid to share their voice,\" she wrote.
