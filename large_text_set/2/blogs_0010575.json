Sherrie tested five other councils in London and Greater Manchester but all of them turned her away. One told her: “We don’t have a legal duty to assist you.” \nHowever, Matt Downie, director of policy at the homelessness charity Crisis, said asserting that a condition had to be “life-threatening” in order to secure free shelter was disingenuous. \nHe said: “Simply saying that having a mental health problem rules you out is not correct. What you need to find out is the impact of that mental health condition on that person.” Chris Martin pays tribute to George Michael in surprise visit to homeless shelter \nHaringey Council accepted that its response fell below standards. A spokesperson said: “While the reporter was offered information on shelters and hostels, she should also have been offered a follow-up appointment with a specialist adviser and we are sorry that didn’t happen.” \nCharities say many women eligible for emergency accommodation are being turned away as housing budgets are hit by council cuts. \nRebecca Pritchard, director of services at Crisis, said: “Local authorities do have a legal duty to provide accommodation for people who are what is known as priority need. But because they don’t have the resources, many end up gatekeeping, finding reasons not to help people.” \nThere are an estimated 68,000 women living in temporary accommodation and emergency shelters in Britain, and a recent survey found that nearly a quarter of women sleeping rough had been sexually assaulted in the past year, and three in 10 had experienced sexual violence at some point while homeless.

She tested three other councils and two did offer her a place to stay for the night while the third turned her away. \nBarnet Homes, which provides emergency accommodation on behalf of Barnet Council, told The Independent it takes domestic violence extremely seriously, adding: “We are sorry our service fell short of expectations in this case. In view of the information we have received on this particular case, we will be providing further training across the team to ensure future cases are handled more sensitively.” The causes of homelessness The causes of homelessness 1/7 Family Breakdown \nRelationship breakdown, usually between young people and their parents or step-parents, is a major cause of youth homelessness. Around six in ten young people who come to Centrepoint say they had to leave home because of arguments, relationship breakdown or being told to leave. Many have experienced long-term problems at home, often involving violence, leaving them without the family support networks that most of us take for granted 2/7 Complex needs \nYoung people who come to Centrepoint face a range of different and complex problems. More than a third have a mental health issue, such as depression and anxiety, another third need to tackle issues with substance misuse. A similar proportion also need to improve their physical health. These problems often overlap, making it more difficult for young people to access help and increasing the chances of them becoming homeless Getty Images/iStockphoto 3/7 Deprivation \nYoung people's chances of having to leave home are higher in areas of high deprivation and poor prospects for employment and education. Many of those who experience long spells of poverty can get into problem debt, which makes it harder for them to access housing Getty Images/iStockphoto 4/7 Gang Crime \nHomeless young people are often affected by gang-related problems. In some cases, it becomes too dangerous to stay in their local area meaning they can end up homeless. One in six young people at Centrepoint have been involved in or affected by gang crime Getty Images/iStockphoto 5/7 Exclusion From School \nNot being in education can make it much more difficult for young people to access help with problems at home or health problems. Missing out on formal education can also make it more difficult for them to move into work Getty Images/iStockphoto 6/7 Leaving Care \nAlmost a quarter of young people at Centrepoint have been in care. They often have little choice but to deal with the challenges and responsibilities of living independently at a young age. Traumas faced in their early lives make care leavers some of the most vulnerable young people in our communities, with higher chances of poor outcomes in education, employment and housing. Their additional needs mean they require a higher level of support to maintain their accommodation Getty Images/iStockphoto 7/7 Refugees \nAround 13 per cent of young people at Centrepoint are refugees or have leave to remain, meaning it isn't safe to return home. This includes young people who come to the UK as unaccompanied minors, fleeing violence or persecution in their own country. After being granted asylum, young people sometimes find themselves with nowhere to go and can end up homeless Getty Images/iStockphoto \nLondon Charity Solace Women’s Aid said the “system isn’t working” for women fleeing domestic violence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:05:11.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
