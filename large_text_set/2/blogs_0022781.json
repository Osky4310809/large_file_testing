Hence this reduces to $E = pc$. Einstein also introduced the concept of relativistic mass (and the related mass-energy equivalence) in the same paper; we can then write \n$$m c^2 = pc$$ \nwhere $m$ is the relativistic mass here, hence \n$$m = p/c$$ \nIn other words, a photon does have relativistic mass proportional to its momentum . \nDe Broglie's relation , an early result of quantum theory (specifically wave-particle duality), states that \n$$\\lambda = h / p$$ \nwhere $h$ is simply Planck's constant. This gives \n$$p = h / \\lambda$$ \nHence combining the two results, we get \n$$m = E / c^2 = h / \\lambda c$$ \nagain, paying attention to the fact that $m$ is relativistic mass . \nAnd here we have it: photons have 'mass' inversely proportional to their wavelength! Then simply by Newton's theory of gravity, they have gravitational influence. (To dispel a potential source of confusion, Einstein specifically proved that relativistic mass is an extension/generalisation of Newtonian mass, so we should conceptually be able to treat the two the same.) \nThere are a few different ways of thinking about this phenomenon in any case, but I hope I've provided a fairly straightforward and apparent one. (One could go into general relativity for a full explanation, but I find this the best overview.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:08:01.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
