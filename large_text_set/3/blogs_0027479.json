Long, an 11-year veteran of the force, was arrested Thursday. \nAuthorities say veteran officer Michael Long put a young pitbull into a sheet and trash bag then dumped the pup in a waste bin at Wissahickon Valley Park around Thanksgiving. \n“The dog had been micro-chipped, which led us to Mr. Long,” said Nicole Wilson, Pennsylvania SPCA Director of Humane Law Enforcement. “We found what we believe is the matching sheet in Mr. Long’s possession.” \nEmaciated Dog Dumped In Trash Bag At Philly Park Recovering At Shelter \nThe dog named Cranberry was found by a good Samaritan on a hike with her family dog the Tuesday prior to Thanksgiving. The person found the dog inside a garbage bag at the park and called the PSPCA’s Humane Law Enforcement team. \nThe officers went to the scene to rescue Cranberry and bring it back to the shelter to receive medical care. \nCranberry, who was found in an emaciated condition, made a full recovery and found a forever home in December. \nShe has returned to a healthy weight and is now safe in the arms of a family who treats her like the trusting treasure she is. \n“She is currently living in a home in Malvern soaking up life as a couch potato very happy and most of her updated pictures come back exhausted by how happy she is” said Wilson.
