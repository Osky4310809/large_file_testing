With the weather department predicting rain and a dip in temperature, the crowd had come prepared to witness many firsts at Rajpath during 68th Republic Day celebrations. \nThe nearly 90-minute long parade showcased India's military prowess and cultural diversity. The crowd waited patiently, cheering various military contingents and tableaux of states and government departments for the big show which was scheduled at the end of the mega-event. \nAs soon as the announcement was made, thousands present along the Rajpath set their sight on the cloudy sky to witness the star of the show. Soon, the supersonic roar of India's own Light Combat Aircraft - Tejas - filled the sky. Three Tejas jets flew at a height of 300 metres from ground at a speed of 780 km per hour in 'VIC' formation. Awestruck spectators were seen gazing at the sky even as the aircraft vanished under clouds.

However, technical specifications suggest that the JF-17 Thunder is no match for the Tejas. Photo: Tejas Brochure/Aeronautical Development Agency \nTEJAS vs JF-17 THUNDER Experts describe the supersonic Tejas to be as capable as the Mirage 2000, the French-made fighter jet. In fact, developers at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) used Mirage 2000 as a benchmark for Tejas. Tejas is designed to carry air-to-air, air-to-surface and laser-guided missiles and other weaponry systems. The fly-by-wire technology makes it easier for the pilot to manoeuvre the jet. Tejas is fitted with a new, state-of-the-art Israeli radar, considered to be one of the best in its class. Its radar warning system, which alerts the pilot to enemy aircraft or missiles, is made in India. Heavy use of carbon fibre in its fuselage reduces weight of the Tejas, thereby proving better agility. It also helps the aircraft evade enemy radar by absorbing radar waves. The fighter jet's wingspan stands at 8.2metres while its length is 13.20 metres. Tejas stands at 4.40 metres height. The maximum speed of the supersonic jet is 1350 kmph. While the J-17 Thunder needs a minimum 600-metre long runway, Tejas can take off from a 460-metre tarmac.Tejas can operate up to a height of 50,000 feet. Mid-air refuelling is another facility where the Tejas scores over the JF-17 Thunder. The internal fuel capacity of Tejas is 2,458kg, while the JF-17 Thunder is at 2268kg. Tejas has a 'glass cockpit' which displays real-time information to the pilot. \n(With inputs from PTI)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T10:22:40.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
