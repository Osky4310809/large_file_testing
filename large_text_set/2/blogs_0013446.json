Nick Viall and Olivia Caridi Taylor Hill/Getty Images; John Lamparski/WireImage.com \nOn Viall’s first one-on-one date of the evening, special-education teacher Vanessa Grimaldi professed her love for him — making her the third woman to do so this season. Viall, 36, burst her bubble with his response: “I really, really like you, but it is incredibly important for me, if I’m lucky enough to feel love or say ‘I love you’ in this role, that I only say it to one person.” Oh.

She’s putting herself out there,” Caridi said. “It just felt like he was almost lecturing her and scolding her and it confused her, and rightfully so. He screwed up there, and I just was not a fan of that. I just thought it was rude.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:08:38.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
