He had a very clear opportunity in the first half and it's good that he had it. In the second half, he made a decisive pass for [Thiago] Motta and, if he scores, it would have been a decisive pass for him. \n\"Other than that, he worked a lot, and he did the job we want, to press. We also want him to score, but we took him out for Hatem to help the team, to continue his work. It's good for the team.\" \n'PSG won't buy for the sake of buying' \nPSG are still on the lookout for further recruits, but Emery says that any new signings must be of the right calibre to help the squad progress. \n\"We need players ready to continue our progression,\" he said. \"Draxler will also help the team on many occasions. \n\"We need all the players to be ready to help the team. They work hard and I'm happy because the team came back after the holidays to work very well.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:47:42.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
