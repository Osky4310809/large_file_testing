Today, the developer released the first screenshots of that game, showing the look of the diverse cast of characters.\nSee also: Best Android games of 2017 1 week ago \nThe screenshots show that the game will definitely be based on the team’s current comic book incarnation, rather than the 2015 Marvel Studios movie, or its upcoming sequel. Telltale is not revealing much in terms of its storyline, saying only that the Guardians find “an artifact of unspeakable power” after an epic battle.\n\nNone of the movie cast will be voicing their characters in the Guardians Telltale game, but there are a few well-known actors that will be joining in the fun. They include Friday Night Lights’ Scott Porter as Star-Lord and Nolan North, who voiced Nathan Drake in the Uncharted series of games, as Rocket.\n\nIf you are going to the South By Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, you will have a chance to be one of the first to play Telltale’s Guardians of the Galaxy game. On March 17, the developer will hold an event at the Paramount Theater, with the doors opening at 6:30 p.m. The audience will crowd play a part of the game with their smartphones and see their actions on the theater’s big screen. The game itself will be released later in 2017 for consoles, PC and mobile devices, and we would bet it will launch close to when the movie sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, hits theaters on May 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:06:18.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
